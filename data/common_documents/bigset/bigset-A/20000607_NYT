And may the best `Superman' win

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Superman times two.
</P>
<P>
   One with the logo tattooed on his biceps. One with the insignia
ironed on the front of a baggy T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal is the Man of Steel on steroids. Reggie Miller
is Clark Kent with rickets.
</P>
<P>
   It's Lakers vs. Pacers in the NBA Finals and time to see which
one can make his team fly.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what happened in their respective conference finals,
the answer would seem to be Shaq and the Lakers, who were faster
than a speeding bullet in coming from 15 points down in the last
10{ minutes Sunday to knock off Portland in Game 7 of the Western
finals.
</P>
<P>
   But after all those years of coming up short, Miller and the
Pacers finally did leap the tall buildings of New York in a single
bound to win the Eastern title in Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks vs. Fix.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Middle America represented by Larry Bird's team from
the heartland, the conspiracy theorists never rest. The Oliver
Stone set points to that fourth-quarter run by LA at Staples Center
as evidence the NBA and its kissin' cousins at the network simply
could not and would not tolerate a small-market Finals matchup of
Indiana-Portland.
</P>
<P>
   They point to a touch foul that sent the Lakers' Kobe Bryant to
the foul line for a three-point play during the decisive 15-0 run.
They point to the Blazers' Steve Smith being virtually hammered
into the floor on his drive to the basket in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Good points. Just bad calls. They happen all the time in the
sport that is the most difficult to officiate.
</P>
<P>
   The conspiracy-seekers overlook the fact that, with the
exception of Rasheed Wallace, the Blazers played the fourth quarter
like frightened turtles, pulling their heads inside their shells,
afraid to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   They also overlook the fact that a St. Louis-Tennessee matchup
produced the best Super Bowl of all time and TV ratings that also
ranked high.
</P>
<P>
   While it is a pleasant notion to think of NBC Sports chairman
Dick Ebersol perched on a high window sill at Rockefeller Center,
ready to air a steady diet of Suddenly Susan reruns rather than
Pacers-Blazers live to the nation, the truth is the two best teams
with the two best stories are here.
</P>
<P>
   It is a duel of contrasts. Young vs. old. Small town vs.
Tinseltown. Earthbound vs. high-flying.
</P>
<P>
   It is Bird vs. Magic one more time, though with both in vastly
different roles. Maybe it isn't Lakers vs. Celtics. But put the
hawk-nosed Bird anywhere within sniffing distance of Hollywood's
phoniness and you get a real sense of disdain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like 'em,'' Larry Legend says.
</P>
<P>
   This time around Magic is no more than the world's biggest
cheerleader, his seat on the baseline just across from the Lakers'
bench. But he rarely occupies it during the fourth quarter of
games, standing and pacing in the aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I'd love to be out there,'' Magic says.
</P>
<P>
   What it might be is the Team of the Past vs. the Team of the
Future.
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, previous Pacers teams were better than this one
but never could get over the considerable hump of Michael Jordan or
around the scrappy roadblock of the Knicks. The Indiana team that
lost to O'Neal when he was with Orlando in the 1995 Eastern
Conference finals had more speed to get up and down the floor in
the transition game, not to mention a more mobile Rik Smits in the
middle. The Pacers who were beaten by the Knicks a year ago had
more strength and bulk up front with Antonio Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Lakers, in spite of their 67-15 regular-season
mark, have shown during the playoffs that they are still green and
growing into the team that can live up to all of the hype. These
Lakers allowed Sacramento to get up off the floor to force their
first-round series to the limit and then could not close out a 3-1
lead on Portland until the Blazers took a late-game trip to Choke
City.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, perhaps the Lakers will be worthy of having
their own weekly TV series on NBC. But for now, they are a project
that is under construction as a real dynasty, living too much on
the edge of the raw talent of their only two great players, Kobe
and Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   But somebody has to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Superman or Superman. Shaq or Reggie.
</P>
<P>
   It's like the vote for the young Elvis or the old Elvis on the
postage stamp. As pumped up as Roseanne or skinnier than Calista
Flockhart? Bending iron rims with slam dunks or shooting 3-pointers
with X-ray vision?
</P>
<P>
   Bet on a guy with a cape.

Venus ill-prepared for French assault
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ On a cold day in Paris, one cold enough to pass for
winter in Houston of late, Venus Williams couldn't keep her inner
fires lit Tuesday. She tried to shake off the chill, and the veneer
of rust from her game, but she obviously found herself in the wrong
place at the wrong time, being underprepared and underdressed.
</P>
<P>
   And, hence, grossly over-seeded, considering how scarce she has
made herself in 2000. Venus was way out of her element _ and
elements _ confronting Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario on Roland Garros'
red clay, the gritty surface the gritty Spaniard most loves and has
most frequently conquered. That Arantxa, a three-time French Open
champion who is second only to Chris Evert in career match
victories on clay, could be slotted eighth, four notches below the
enigmatic U.S. teen, seemed preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   And it was, once they started exchanging baseline blows.
Sanchez-Vicario blitzed Venus 6-0 in the first set and 6-2 in the
third, although Williams had enough wherewithal to briefly reverse
her sagging fortunes with a 6-1 blitz of her own in the middle set
when Arantxa briefly let up on the throttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did all I could today,'' Williams said, conceding it wasn't
nearly enough to send her forth into the semifinals of the
tournament that places a premium on strategic planning, mental
toughness and physical preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Venus remains grossly deficient on each count, coming up short
in the latter because she has played just four matches in the last
six months amid speculation, fueled primarily by her own wacky
father, that she was contemplating retirement at the nubile age of
19.
</P>
<P>
   The official reason given for Williams' hiatus was painful
tendinitis in her wrists. Many wondered, nonetheless, if it wasn't
really sister-itis, brought on by Serena Williams' becoming the
first of the heralded siblings to win a major championship at the
U.S. Open last fall. As close as the girls might be, Venus failed
to handle the dramatic usurping by her ``kid'' sister well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't help at all,'' she said of the doubles title the
Williamses claimed the next day in New York. ``It never helps. I'll
never forget it. I'm very bitter.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, after subsequently losing to Serena in the Grand Slam
Cup, Venus pretty much disappeared. Richard Williams, who once told
us he intended to buy Rockefeller Center, suggested there was a
better than 50-50 chance Venus would quit tennis to focus on other
interests, not the least of which would be spending the $15 million
she had earned playing the sport as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   But since $15 million doesn't go as far as it used to, Williams
finally resurfaced at the Betty Barclay Cup tournament in Hamburg
the first week of May, where Amanda Coetzer whipped her in the
quarters. Three weeks later, Jana Dokic whacked Venus in the
Italian Open's round of 16. No one had pushed her through the first
three rounds in Paris, but she hadn't played anybody, either.
</P>
<P>
   But, even at 28 and losing some of her once-indefatigable
fetching skills, Sanchez-Vicario is nobody to be trifled with at
Roland Garros, which she first conquered before her 18th birthday
and again just two years ago. Williams might have beaten Arantxa
four times in a row _ twice on clay, too _ but that was before
Venus wandered off to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``My game,'' Williams said, ``is not anywhere near normal, in my
opinion. I've made a lot of improvement since Hamburg, though. It
wasn't until Rome that I could start practicing my serve.''
</P>
<P>
   She had no 120-mph rockets in reserve for Sanchez-Vicario but
insisted: ``No worries because I'll eventually be there.''
</P>
<P>
   In time for Wimbledon? Perhaps, as long as she can prepare
herself for the lawns by practicing at home in Florida, out of the
rain and cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can find some grass courts that aren't soaked,'' she
said, getting a dig in at the unseasonably ugly weather Europe has
been experiencing. `` For me it's OK if I go home and just
practice. That's what I need to do anyway. In general, I don't play
so many warm-up tournaments for the Grand Slams. If I'm on my game
and I'm hitting the ball, where's the problem?''
</P>
<P>
   But getting on her game and staying there has been a problem.
The widely anticipated dominance of the WTA Tour by the Williams
girls will remain the stuff of conjecture only until they can stay
healthy and maintain a higher level of consistency. Professional
coaching would seem a desirable option, but that never has been
seriously considered with father calling the shots.
</P>
<P>
   As you know, Venus took on Paris by her lonesome after Serena
pulled out, citing chronic knee pain. The injury has plagued her
since early April and presumably threatens her participation at
Wimbledon, although Venus predicted Serena will play.
</P>
<P>
   But at a title-contending level? We never can be sure with
either of them.

AFTER SPENDING $35 MILLION, CORZINE WINS DEMOCRATIC SENATE PRIMARY
IN N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Will be updated with results of GOP primary.) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Jon Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire
whose $35 million spending spree shattered all records for a U.S.
Senate primary, trounced former Gov. Jim Florio on Tuesday to win
the New Jersey Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. who ran on
a platform of big-spending government programs and unabashedly
liberal positions on social issues, rolled to victory after a
12-week onslaught of television commercials turned him from a
wealthy campaign contributor who was otherwise unknown in his home
state into as much a household name as Florio.
</P>
<P>
   In unofficial returns reported by The Associated Press, with 85
percent of districts reporting, Corzine had 59 percent of the vote
to 41 percent for Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, 53, used his victory speech to lay out his entire
agenda: investing in health care, Medicare, Social Security,
education, the inner cities, the environment and in benefits for
service members and veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' he shouted to a jammed hotel ballroom in
East Brunswick. ``I want to invest in America _ that's what this
campaign will be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceding defeat, Florio said he would support his rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree with Jon Corzine on a number of issues,'' Florio
said, ``but I agree with him a lot more than I would agree with any
of the Republicans who are running for that office.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio continued: ``I am a Democrat, and I will be working very
hard to elect Democrats for all positions that are open this
November.''
</P>
<P>
   In the four-way Republican primary, Rep. Bob Franks, a four-term
congressman from Union County, was in a tight race with state Sen.
William L. Gormley, a veteran lawmaker from the Atlantic City area
with strong financing from casino interests there.
</P>
<P>
   With 94 percent of districts reporting, Franks had 35 percent of
the vote and Gormley had 34 percent, according to the AP. James
Treffinger, the Essex County executive, had 18 percent, while
Murray Sabrin, a college professor who ran for governor as a
Libertarian in 1997, had 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, Corzine's stated willingness to spend
whatever it took to win now has put a burden on Republicans, who a
year ago, before Gov. Christie Whitman dropped out of the race, had
viewed New Jersey as an easy victory. Republican leaders now will
have to decide whether to commit large resources to try to defeat
Corzine, or focus on other, less costly races.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's entry into the race as a self-financed candidate saved
state Democratic leaders from having to raise as much as $10
million for a less wealthy Senate candidate. Now, his victory in
the primary means they will be able to focus on the real prize of
New Jersey politics: the governor's race in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic outcome had rested on two uncertainties: whether
voters would be persuaded or repulsed by the money Corzine spent on
his campaign, and whether Jim Florio could overcome the lingering
animosity of Democrats still nursing grudges over the $2.8 billion
tax increase he signed as governor in 1990, fueling years of
Republican electoral victories.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine was expected to spend $2 million on Tuesday alone in
get-out-the-vote efforts, from rain gear and rented vans to
payments of $75 or more for his street workers. The previous record
for a U.S. Senate primary was $8.1 million, and Corzine has already
exceeded the nearly $30 million Michael Huffington spent in vain in
his race for the U.S. Senate in California in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Democrats was embodied by one couple at the
public library in Westfield. ``I wasn't going to vote, but I'm
opposed to someone who spends $36 million to buy an election,''
said Mark Rubin, an accountant voting there. ``Florio was an awful
governor, but I voted for him because no one has a right to buy the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bu Rubin's wife, Andi, said she could not bring herself to vote
for Florio. She waited in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The winner in November succeeds Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who
surprised the state's political community in February 1999 when he
announced that he would not seek a fourth term. Lautenberg, himself
a millionaire businessman, said he did not want to spend two years
raising money for re-election. He endorsed Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time as Lautenberg announced his retirement,
Corzine was forced out of his job as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs.
When Goldman Sachs held an initial public stock offering in May
1999, Corzine received 4.4 million shares, and instantly became
worth $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Corzine's candidacy emerged several months later, it was
viewed as the answer to a prayer by many Democrats, among them Sen.
Robert Torricelli, who believed the only way to defeat Florio was
with a great deal of money.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, as combative as he was in three races for governor,
relentlessly assailed Corzine as a political neophyte whose naivete
could not compete with his own experience in state government and
as an eight-term congressman. With a meager $2.5 million budget,
Florio ran only attack commercials in the last two weeks of the
race, and had to be pressed at times to articulate his own agenda
were he to win a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Florio did little to deflect Corzine's attacks, which began
on television in mid-April and remained unanswered for a month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly as closely watched as the Senate races were the primaries
in both parties to fill Franks' seat in Congress, as well as the
contested Republican primaries for two other House seats. With
three seats potentially in play, New Jersey has become one of a
handful of states that could decide which party controls the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fifth District, Rep. Marge S. Roukema, a 20-year
Republican incumbent, again defeated E. Scott Garrett, a
conservative state assemblyman who nearly unseated her in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th District, former Republican representative Dick
Zimmer beat another former Republican representative, Mike Pappas,
for the right to challenge the freshman Democrat, Rep. Rush Holt.
While Pappas appealed to hard-line conservatives, Zimmer ran
television commercials reminding voters of Pappas' paean to Kenneth
Starr on the House floor during the impeachment proceedings against
President Clinton, sung to the tune of ``Twinkle, Twinkle, Little
Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Holt used similar commercials to unseat Pappas two years ago.

Games' golden girl girds for 15th Olympic trip
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The most amazing of Olympic streaks is alive and well.
And as Gertrude Birkman is quick to point out, so is she.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm still kicking,'' Birkman, 87, said. ``You probably
were wondering, `Whatever happened to that old lady?' I'm still in
pretty good shape except for I forget some things sometimes. But
you know, I'll never forget the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   How could she? By any gauge, Birkman, who lives in the Champions
area, is America's greatest Olympic fan. And, yes, she's headed for
Sydney to watch her 15th Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting tickets has been smoother this time,'' Birkman said.
``You know, they charge like the mischief. But I think it's worth
it. I'm thinking this one will be the last one, though.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's what she said in 1996 and here she is again.
</P>
<P>
   You might recall the inspiring story of the quippy, fun-loving
Birkman and the travails she had trying to purchase, ``one measly
ticket in my home country,'' four years ago when the Summer Games
were in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Birkman, who had been to 13 previous Olympics (counting the 1988
Winter Games) since watching Jesse Owens in Berlin in 1936, was
constantly denied when she tried to purchase Olympic tickets
through the confusing Atlanta ticketing system. She put up with
interminable waits on the telephone and filled out three ticket
requests on the day tickets became available, but was shut out.
</P>
<P>
   She even wrote a letter to Atlanta Olympic chief Billy Payne and
sent it via certified mail, looking for answers to her ticketing
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured he was the head fella,'' she said, ``so I thought
maybe he could help. Why would I want to deal with anyone else?''
</P>
<P>
   But Payne didn't. Birkman received a form letter consoling her
for coming up empty. But after Birkman's story came to light,
hundreds of Houstonians stepped up and offered tickets. Her
telephone rang off the wall and TV crews from all over began
knocking on her door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be talking on the phone and someone would be at the front
door and someone else at the back door,'' she said. ``If that
happens again, I'll try to be nice, but you know old women can get
kind of snippy.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations gave her tickets. Strangers called her home and the
Chronicle, offering seats. Even Olympic expert Jack Kelly, who has
since become an adviser for Houston's 2012 campaign, stepped up and
said, ``Tell her she can have tickets for any day that she's
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Birkman indeed made it to Atlanta and enjoyed the Games, but
like many others was less than enthusiastic about Atlanta's effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was too hot,'' she said. ``I hope if Houston gets it, it
will be air-conditioned. The arrangements were terrible in
Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   But now it's on to Sydney for this superfan, who has seen
firsthand the most memorable of Olympic moments.
</P>
<P>
   She laughed out loud like the young lady she was, when Owens
sprinted to gold in Adolf Hitler's Berlin. She marveled at Babe
Didrikson Zaharias redefining women in sports. She was high in the
seats at Mexico's Estadio Azteca when Bob Beamon shattered the long
jump record in 1968. She was courtside in Munich, Germany, when the
1972 Soviet Union basketball team shattered America's basketball
dominance.
</P>
<P>
   She watched Nadia Comaneci in 1976, Mary Lou Retton in 1984 and
Shannon Miller in 1996. She has been to London, Rome, Munich,
Montreal, Seoul and every other Olympic host city since Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Owens and Babe Zaharias were the ones that really got me
hooked,'' she said. ``It's just a wonderful thing. And I'll never
forget what people did for me four years ago. Dear Lord, the people
of Houston made me humble. My dream came true.''
</P>
<P>
   And the dream is alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   Birkman had triple-bypass surgery in 1995, but has since stayed
relatively healthy. She now walks with a cane and gave up golf
three years ago because of bad knees.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have encouraged her to move to a retirement home, to
which she replies, ``The only way I'm leaving my house is feet
first.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, she fell off the curb in her front yard while
doing yardwork and opened a gash in her head.
</P>
<P>
   But she said of the accident: ``I was just bleeding a lot. The
way people were hysterical when they found me, they were the ones
that should have gone off in an ambulance. I didn't knock my square
head off, just the crown.''
</P>
<P>
   She will be 88 in Sydney. She swears that this time her 15th
Olympic Games really will be her last.
</P>
<P>
   But to that, only four words come to mind: See you in Athens.

ONLY NOW MATTERS TO LAKERS

By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ If championship-round experience counts for anything,
theLakers should have an edge in the NBA Finals that begin tonight.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The franchise hasn't been this far since 1991 and hasn't won a
championship since 1988, but the locker room is replete with rings.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper won three championships with the Chicago Bulls, along
with coach Phil Jackson and his staff, who won six. John Salley won
two rings with the Detroit Pistons and a third with the Bulls.
Robert Horry won two titles with the Houston Rockets. And of
course, A.C. Green, the lone link to those Showtime years, won a
pair of championships with the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal and Brian Shaw haven't won but did play in the
1995 Finals, losing to Horry's Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But Horry said don't make too much out of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really doesn't mean anything. It's all about how the team
is playing and how you have come together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Horry also doesn't see any value in discussing Finals
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has been close to this situation before. They know
what's at stake. There is no need for for anybody to say
anything,'' he said. ``If you don't know what's at stake now, you
need to be checked into a mental hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper did warn his younger teammates about the media crush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing is I told the guys with having all of you
(reporters) here, is take it easy. It's all hype,'' Harper said.
``You're going to see them for the next 8, 10 days. Just come out
and play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shaw and O'Neal admit they've discussed their '95
experience, mostly because they'd like to redeem themselves. And
Shaw said the Lakers' wealth of Finals appearances is indeed an
asset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that it's overrated,'' he said. ``As far as all
the extraneous things, off the court, that's seven or eight guys
who have all been through that and know what it's like and have a
better chance of dealing with it. That helps.''
</P>
<P>
   FINAL-LY: No matter how many games the Lakers won or road trips
they swept, Jackson avoided all season any attempts to place
expectations on his team. So when was he finally convinced they
were championship material?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two minutes to go in the last game,'' he said, referring to
Game 7 against Portland. ``It was an ultimate moment for this team
on Sunday, whether they could rally from such a game.''
</P>
<P>
   GUARDED: Jackson hasn't unveiled his defensive strategy, but it
seems likely that while Harper will open against Reggie Miller and
Kobe Bryant on Mark Jackson, the matchups are likely to change
throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a plan on how we want to send Reggie and what we
want to do, but this team counters well,'' Jackson said. ``They've
made an art out of what they have been doing. ... We'll definitely
have Kobe on him. We'll have Brian Shaw on him. We'll have plenty
of people that will have to guard Reggie.''
</P>
<P>
   CAN'T TOUCH THIS: Bryant was concise when it came to the Pacers'
defensive challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Can they stop Shaq? ``Who, Indiana? I don't think so, no.''
</P>
<P>
   Can they stop you? ``No, I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   ROYAL REMINDER: Of the Lakers' many struggles in the postseason,
Jackson listed the two-game letdown in Sacramento as the most
surprising, and said it provided a warning for this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taken out of that road game in Sacramento by crowd
noise and by defensive pressure and by a team that played a
freewheeling offensive system,'' he said. ``Indiana presents that
same kind of problem in their offensive system. A lot of space, a
lot of distance for 3-point shooters. Nobody really hangs around in
the paint where Shaq can hang out and anchor himself around the
lane. So this will be a challenge for our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   OUCH REPORT: The Lakers enter the Finals relatively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Little-used rookie forward Devean George remains out
indefinitely with a sprained left ankle, but Kobe Bryant's sprained
right foot doesn't appear to be a concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foot feels good,'' he said Tuesday. ``I didn't need any
treatment this morning.'' &QL;

SUFFOLK SHERIFF PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO CORRUPTION CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIVERHEAD, N.Y. _ The sheriff of Suffolk County surrendered
himself Tuesday and pleaded not guilty in criminal court to all
charges of corruption and abuse of power.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Patrick Mahoney was indicted by a grand jury that
investigated his office for 15 months, and finally charged with one
felony count of defrauding the government and 54 misdemeanors for
incidents during his 11 years in office here on eastern Long
Island, including charges that he raffled off special deputy
sheriff positions to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also accuse Mahoney of using a full-time county
employee to coordinate his re-election efforts; using county
offices and vehicles for personal business; and of embezzling
$16,000 from the heriff's Benevolent Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney's former undersheriff, Edward J. Morris, was charged
with 28 felony counts and seven misdemeanors, the most serious
charge being bribery. Morris is accused of coercing correction
officers under his command into making campaign donations to the
sheriff in exchange for paid overtime .
</P>
<P>
   According to the grand jury indictment unsealed Tuesday in
Suffolk County Court, Morris solicited and accepted more than
$10,000 from county jail officers during the last 10 years on
Mahoney's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Morris also pleaded not guilty to all charges.
</P>
<P>
   The arraignments came as no surprise: Mahoney said last week
that he expected to be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing has the odor of (the) garbage that it is,''
Mahoney said. ``Catterson's gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said the indictments are the culmination of a
long-running feud between him and Catterson, Suffolk County's two
top elected law enforcement officials. It is a battle between a
Republican district attorney who is not shy about using his
prosecutorial powers, and an independent, hard-charging Republican
sheriff who bucked the party last year and crossed over to the
Democrats to run against the Republican county executive.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 months ago the district attorney impaneled a grand jury
to investigate allegations of corruption in the sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   The feud between Mahoney and Catterson goes back at least to
1993, when Catterson reportedly felt that the sheriff had upstaged
him after Katie Beers, a 10-year-old who was kidnapped and held in
a dungeon for 16 days, was found alive. Previously, Mahoney had
endorsed Catterson for district attorney. Now their relationship
has so degenerated that Republicans routinely argue over who has
the unsavory task of standing between the two men during photo
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system works when honest people work the system,'' Mahoney
said in his office at the Suffolk County Jail after his
arraignment. ``When dishonest people like the D.A. use the system
to indict his political enemies, the system fails. Catterson is the
biggest bully in Suffolk County.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Catterson brushed off those remarks as the ramblings of a
desperate man. ``I understand he's under a lot of pressure,''
Catterson said at his Hauppauge office. ``He's been saying these
things for years. This so-called feud is in his mind. This had
nothing to do with personality but everything to do with
misconduct,'' Catterson said.  &QL;

ANALYSIS: DESPITE HIGH SPENDING, CORZINE AVOIDED ERROR OF MANY RICH
CANDIDATES 
</HEADLINE>
 (With NJ-ELECT) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ It wasn't just the money. It was also the
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Corzine's record-breaking spending spree on his way to the
Democratic Senate nomination in Tuesday's New Jersey primary made
most of the news during his long and venomous campaign against
former Gov. Jim Florio, just as the advertising it paid for helped
turn him from a nobody into a household name across the state in
only a few months.
</P>
<P>
   But on election day, it was the backing Corzine's millions
cultivated among leaders of New Jersey's Democratic Party
establishment that produced the turnout in key election districts
that finally sank Florio's dogged struggle for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   In the populous northern urban counties of Bergen, Essex and
Union, Democratic county leaders spent lavishly on Corzine's
get-out-the-vote effort to bus voters to the polls, handing him
top-heavy margins of victories that swamped Florio's strong leads
in his southern base of Camden, Atlantic and Cumberland counties.
</P>
<P>
   Florio can complain that Corzine's $35 million in spending
bought the friends he needed on Election Day, and Corzine's friends
in the party can reply that he was only practicing the kind of
deep-pocket ``party building'' that prosperous Republicans have
been doing for years.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that in tending to the party and not just to the
politics of the campaign, Corzine avoided the mistake of other rich
men who thought, as rich men often seem to do, that their money was
all they needed to get what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many examples can you call up?'' said Stephen A. Salmore,
a Republican campaign consultant. ``Ron Lauder, Al Checchi,
Huffington, Mark Dayton in Minnesota _ the number of wealthy
candidates who have spent their money and gone down in flames is as
great if not greater than the ones who have spent their money and
won.''
</P>
<P>
   Checchi and Michael Huffington lost in Republican races in
California, after spending huge fortunes for elusive votes. Lauder,
the cosmetics heir, scorned the New York City Republican Party when
he ran for mayor in 1989 and was gleefully crushed by them. Dayton,
a department store heir, ran third in his race for governor in
Minnesota two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine had the support of virtually every important Democrat in
the state and outside it, including the chairman of the Senate
Democratic Campaign Committee; both of the state's Democratic
senators, Robert Torricelli and Frank Lautenberg, who is retiring
and whose seat Corzine is seeking; and a roster of county
Democratic chairmen and committee members.
</P>
<P>
   These Democratic leaders were not, as Florio charged, interested
only in Corzine's money, which allowed them to save a bundle for
next year's governor's race, the grand prize in New Jersey
politics. They were also deeply averse to hitching their party's
wagon to Florio's dubious star, which has sputtered more than it
has sparkled in three races for governor, only one victorious. Most
recently, Florio was evicted from the State House by Christie
Whitman in 1993 after forcing a $2.8 billion tax increase through
the Legislature, a tax increase that still resonates in the state,
including in Corzine's attack ads.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County
executive, put it on Sunday, the Democrats were not interested in
spending the fall campaign ``defending Jim Florio's tax
increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he lost, Florio still made a strong showing in his
South Jersey stronghold, and among thousands of Democrats around
the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the emotional favorite of the rank-and-file Democrats,''
said Roger A. Bodman, a prominent Trenton lobbyist who was a member
of Gov. Thomas H. Kean's Republican administration. ``It goes
beyond his tax increase to 25 years as an assemblyman and a
congressman and as governor, and as a guy who stood up for the
party year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Florio could not get the traction he needed by making
Corzine's money and his Wall Street career the issue. He accused
Corzine of buying the nomination, he accused the party leaders who
abandoned him for selling out, and he linked Corzine's career as
the head of Goldman Sachs, the investment house, to a range of
evils, including profiting from slavery in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Now the state is poised for an unusual match.
</P>
<P>
   As Bodman put it: ``You can have this curious situation where
the Republican candidate is the middle-class everyday Joe with a
mortgage and a 6-year-old car against the Democrat who is a
millionaire and who out of noblesse oblige decides to go out and
give something back to society.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine may wake up on Wednesday hoping that his victory has at
last put to rest Florio's charge that the $35 million he spent on
the primary represented a poisonous level of spending. After all,
he could maintain, the voters have absolved him.
</P>
<P>
   But Salmore maintained that the Republicans could easily build
on the record of ill will toward Corzine's millions built up by
Florio's relentless attacks, and add to it a favorite Republican
theme, that Democrats cannot be trusted with money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is how you say it,'' Salmore said. ```Look how much money
he spent on his campaign, and now guess how much of your money he
is going to spend if he goes to Washington. This man doesn't know
the value of a dollar _ how can you trust him with your taxes?'''
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Sommer, a Democratic lobbyist and once a member of
Florio's congressional staff, said that Corzine would not
necessarily allow the Republicans to spring their syllogism that
big campaign spending necessarily equals big tax dollar spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end of this campaign, the money issues certainly came
to the fore,'' Sommer said Tuesday. ``But now it's five months to
Election Day, and Jon Corzine can make it a question about him and
his character. He is a man of character, he's worked harder than
his opponent in this race, and now he's the home team.''

FISHER, 19, HAS GROWN UP FAST IN THE FAST LANES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Teen-ager Sarah Fisher isn't sure what sort of
reception to expect when she returns to Texas Motor Speedway this
week.
</P>
<P>
   But four races and two ``confrontations'' into her Indy Racing
League career, Fisher knows she hardly is the same wide-eyed,
19-year-old who made series history when she qualified for the
Mall.com 500 at TMS in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I tougher? For sure. This is serious,'' said Fisher, who
was 13 days past her 19th birthday when she started 17th and
finished 25th on the 1.5-mile quadoval in Fort Worth last fall. ``I
was a kid before and I always had my dad (Dave) there. Now, I've
got to fight my own battles. I've still got (team owner) Derrick
Walker there to help me, but I've got to be just as tough as
nails.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the profile she has created for Walker Racing and the
star-starved Indy Racing Northern Light Series, the fact remains
that Fisher has crashed out of her past two races. Included was the
well-dissected wheel-banger involving Lyn St. James during the 84th
Indianapolis 500 last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I've got to finish this race. That's it,'' said
Fisher, referring to the 500-kilometer event at TMS on Saturday
night. ``I've got to finish it. I'm not expecting a top-10, because
we've had two races that we haven't finished. We need to finish a
race first.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you just can't jump into this sport and be dominant,
unless you're God's gift to racing. I don't think I have that much
talent, or I'd have won the Indy 500.''
</P>
<P>
   The wreck at Indy involving Fisher, St. James and Jaques Lazier
generated huge interest, as it eliminated the first two women to
ever start an Indy 500. Fisher was driving a solid race when she
attempted to pass St. James in Turn 1. Lazier, however, had slipped
inside of Fisher in the bottom groove to make it three-wide. St.
James, racing on the outside line, clipped Fisher's car in the
side. St. James slid into the concrete wall, while Fisher lost
control of her car and skimmed the wall in the short chute between
Turns 1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not haunted by it. But I'm a bit disappointed because we
thought we could have for sure finished,'' Fisher said during an
appearance at SpeedZone on Tuesday. ``We had some fuel pick-up
point problems, and were stalling out of the pits. That would have
caused us problems as well, but at least we would have finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate and wasn't our fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker directed some pointed criticism at St. James, the race's
oldest driver at age 53, immediately after the incident. But Fisher
said she spoke to St. James at the victory dinner a few hours after
the race to square matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her it wasn't me on the inside, that it was Jaques
Lazier and I had to give him some room as well,'' said Fisher, the
third woman to qualify for the Indy 500. ``She admitted that she
hadn't heard that until after she had done her interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure she didn't have any hard feelings
about me, because I believe that was her last race. And it's better
to talk about it than to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, however, has not totally made peace with veteran Eliseo
Salazar. Fisher was running second to Mark Dismore at Las Vegas
Motor Speedway on April 22 when she spun and collected the car
driven by Salazar, knocking both out of the Vegas Indy 300.
Salazar, in his first season of driving for Texan A.J. Foyt, ripped
Fisher on national television for being in over her head.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar, a native of Chile, apologized in a TV interview for
those remarks before the start of qualifying at the Indianapolis
Motor Speedway. But Fisher said Salazar has not spoken to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't realize _ and nobody knows this _ that
after the race, I went and apologized to his crew,'' said Fisher,
who was tutored at Indy by four-time race-winner Al Unser. ``Eliseo
had already left for the day, and apparently they never said
anything to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be polite if he did \Rapologize\S, instead of through
the media. But that's the way it is. You got to look at him as
another competitor on the racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   Same as Texan Greg Ray, the reigning IRL champion who is coming
off an Indy 500 performance in which he crashed in Turn 2 _ twice.
After starting on the pole, Ray finished 33rd and last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Ray has torn up as many race cars as I have; actually, I
think he's torn up more than me this year,'' said Fisher, driver of
the No. 15 Walker Racing Cummins Special Dallara/Aurora. ``He needs
to do the same _ finish races.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray is aware of that, and said he will have no problem racing
against Fisher through TMS' high-banked, 24-degree turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't lose any sleep over that issue \Rracing Fisher\S, one
way or the other,'' Ray said. ``Sarah Fisher's resume says she's
one helluva race car driver. In the times I've seen her race, I've
seen her make some mistakes. So have I. So have other guys and
girls. She has a lot to learn, and a lot of natural ability.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Walker's determination, too, when he signed Fisher, who
has been racing some type of vehicle since age 5, without so much
as a test in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sarah has a lot of potential,'' said Walker, who compared
Fisher's style to that of a young Rick Mears at the start of his
storied career at Team Penske. ``She's at the right age and she's
got a good opportunity in being in the IRL to learn her craft. The
challenge, in part, is hers and ours because no race driver is a
race driver by themselves. They have to have the right mechanism
around them to be able to do what they need to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in this business to have fun. We like to have it
when it comes, but in reality, it's a business and winning is what
it's all about. We're both going to survive on the results that we
create together as a team and a driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite her recent sour runs, Fisher believes there is still ``a
ton'' of people cheering for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's because we're the underdog,'' Fisher said. ``If you
look at it, I'm just a kid going into this race. But I'm trying to
do something that's pretty neat.'' nn

FACTORING COULD HELP HEALTH CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) The comprehensive exploration of the health care
insurance industry's ``claim game'' by The Star on Sunday implies
what would seem a promising business opportunity for a savvy
financial management enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The problem alleged by many physicians, hospitals and their
patients is one of slow-paying insurers. In some instances,
otherwise reputable businesses face charges of failing their
fiduciary duty in an effort to take advantage of the humongous
``float'' created by health care industry money flows.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most common examples of a ``float'' occurs when a
financial intermediary uses money to make money until it settles
with the ultimate payee. When you buy a traveler's check, for
instance, the issuing company can earn interest on your payment
until you cash the check.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurers today stand accused by increasing numbers of
their critics of being inordinately slow to transfer the money they
receive from the insured to the providers of medical services. The
growing suspicion is that because profits are under pressure,
insurers resort to this strategy to fortify the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Motives for slow paying aside, anyone who has dealt with medical
insurers up close and personal can accept at face value any claim
that insurers are too often too slow to honor their obligations.
Not only does this create financial problems for providers, but
also it often puts hapless patients at odds with those they depend
on for their health care.
</P>
<P>
   The solution to the problem thus far has been for providers to
employ a growing army of clerks assigned to do nothing but monitor
the disposition of claims and badger insurers and patients for what
they're owed when reimbursement is deemed too slow.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't a particularly effective approach, though, especially
given the apparently growing nature of the problem. A better
approach might be for a provider of factoring services to step into
this void. A factor is used in many business arrangements to buy a
company's receivables at a discount and collect the money owed at
100 cents on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   In the health care industry, it seems, it would make a lot of
sense for providers simply to sell their billings to an enterprise
for something less than face value and let a professional bill
collector handle the often onerous chore of dealing with insurers.
</P>
<P>
   The economic appeal of traditional factoring services is that it
makes money immediately available to plow back into the business,
which is critical for those operating on thin margins. For health
care providers, the added benefit would be not only to reduce
clerical overhead, but also to free up everyone involved to focus
entirely on practice of the healing arts.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when providers could rob Peter to pay Paul when certain
groups became no-pays for whatever reason, be it indigence or
uncooperative insurers.
</P>
<P>
   With everyone responsible for paying the bills playing it so
close to the vest these days, however, cost shifting no longer is
an option. Therefore, with insurers becoming increasingly difficult
to deal with, medical professionals themselves are in need of
professional help with their business operations.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring, anyone?

LAKERS REGROUPED, READY FOR GAME 1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Precious little time has passed since Kobe zipped
the lob and Shaq rattled the rim and the Lakers forcefully blasted
their way to a Western Conference title. The celebration ended in
an NBA-record 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers open the NBA Finals tonight for the first time since
1991, and will be battling both the Indiana Pacers and a bit of
vertigo, brought on by their rapid rise from the ashes Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There's no telling until the 6 p.m. tipoff at Staples Center how
the most grinding, emotionally draining and thrilling victory in
years _ the Game 7 comeback against Portland _ will affect the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   High on momentum? Or drunk on the effects?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of riding it out. We're still up,'' Kobe
Bryant said Tuesday after the Lakers' sole pre-Finals practice,
which followed an off day Monday. ``Our confidence is pretty high.
It should be. And we're excited. We should be. By the same token,
we have a lot of work to do. And we have to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of steadiness has been a hallmark of this team since
coach Phil Jackson's arrival this season. And it will have to carry
them for one more best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only natural to be worried about the fact that
you expended so much energy and emotion in a series that there
would be a letdown,'' Jackson said. ``But we feel like it might be
a momentum boost for us too. You can't tell. This Laker team is a
very interesting team that way. We're a little skittish, but I
think that we have some momentum going into this thing. ... (The
Pacers) may be more rested and physically in better condition, but
we have the home court, and I think we'll have the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers finished off the New York Knicks two days before the
Lakers closed out Portland, giving them more time to rest, but also
more time to hear the incessant conventional-wisdom chatter: that
the West is supreme, and that either winner would trounce the
East's representative.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that Reggie Miller and Co. came to town a
little edgy, and looking forward to the idea that the Pacers might
have been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' Miller said. ``We hope they overlook us. We're
not coming in here to lay down. We're coming in here to shock the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   By its very nature, the Finals will be like nothing the Lakers
have faced this postseason. But hype and distractions aside, it
also could be easier.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in these playoffs, the opponent isn't built
around an elite power forward _ the Lakers' Achilles' heel on
defense. And for the first time in weeks _ or ever since the Lakers
and Trail Blazers' series began _ Shaquille O'Neal should be free
to dominate once more.
</P>
<P>
   That the Lakers needed seven games to advance was a testament to
the Blazers' unique personnel, and the ability of Rasheed Wallace
and Scottie Pippen to roam and crowd O'Neal. Indiana coach Larry
Bird won't use more than a double-team to help spindly center Rik
Smits and certainly won't be able to get away with throwing three
or four bodies at O'Neal, as the Blazers did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'd be as successful at it,'' said Pacers
forward Austin Croshere, ``because I don't think our guards are as
athletic as Scottie Pippen, who's so long that he can guard a point
guard, get down into the paint and get back out to contest shots.
But at the same time, we will definitely have to mix that in. I
don't think that you can allow a team like the Lakers a set
defensive scheme and allow them to kind of pick it apart and take
advantage of it. We'll have to mix things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Pacers were encouraged by what they saw Portland do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Croshere said. ``It just showed that they're not
invincible. That they've lost games at home, that they were taken
to seven games.''
</P>
<P>
   And although O'Neal should easily score more than the 17.5
points a game he settled for in Games 6 and 7, he's bracing for
more abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it won't be easy,'' O'Neal said. ``They're probably
going to pack it in and force our shooters to hit some shots. ...
But I'm just going to play my game and do what I've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for the quick turnaround between the last round and this
one, O'Neal welcomes it. His Orlando Magic team in 1995 had more
than a week off before the Finals and ended up getting swept by the
Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's better (this) way. You really don't have time to
celebrate,'' O'Neal said. ``You get prepared for the other team and
you can keep it going. Last time I went to the Finals, which was in
'95, we had like 10, 11 days off, and we just kind of lost focus,
messing around, joking around. But we had a half a day to
celebrate, now it's back to business and it all starts up
tomorrow.'' &QL;

FORMER COLORADO GOVERNOR TO LEAD LAUSD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID R. BAKER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Warning that a turnaround ``is not going to
happen overnight,'' former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer won the Los
Angeles Unified School District board's unanimous approval Tuesday
to lead the nation's second-largest district.
</P>
<P>
   In a hastily arranged press conference outside the district's
headquarters, Romer, 71, said he took the spot because he likes
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is the toughest a guy could find, and could have the
greatest rewards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Romer immediately won praise from the teachers union and Mayor
Richard Riordan, who has championed school reform. Romer will
oversee a district facing a broad array of challenges, from the San
Fernando Valley breakup movement to Latino political leaders who
still are simmering over the ouster of former Superintendent Ruben
Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAUSD school board has made an outstanding choice in
selecting Roy Romer as superintendent,'' Riordan said. ``The
district faces many formidable challenges. But there is only one
priority: giving our children an outstanding education.''
</P>
<P>
   United Teachers Los Angeles President Day Higuchi lauded Romer,
claiming the Democrat is ``exactly the kind of person we need to
tackle the biggest problem facing the district, and that is
space.''
</P>
<P>
   After more than a week of closed-door interviews and debate, the
board voted to begin contract negotiations with Romer to replace
interim Superintendent Ramon Cortines, who will leave office June
30. Romer has asked Cortines to stay indefinitely to help oversee a
massive reorganization of the district.
</P>
<P>
   Romer also said he will resign from his current post as chairman
of the Democratic National Convention once contract talks conclude.
</P>
<P>
   During the press conference, Romer told the crowd of reporters
and district brass that the future of Los Angeles hinges on saving
its school district, which has been plagued by low test scores,
overcrowded campuses and efforts to break it apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one caveat: This is not going to happen overnight,''
Romer warned. ``You've got to know that when you have the embedded
delay of even providing space or training teachers, you're not
going to see this happen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be patient, but we need to keep that vision out
front. In summary, this can be the very best educational setting in
the United States, and the destiny of this community deserves it,
and we need to organize everybody to say that's our first
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there is one thing that could stand in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do not make this school system work, you're never going
to get there. So educating these 712,000 youngsters and others in
this area is the most important business of everybody that lives in
this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I say that on my first day ... because this job cannot be
done by the schools alone. It's going to take a very strong
commitment by parents, by the business community, by all the ethnic
relationships and organizations. We need a total, communitywide
commitment to make this happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer called for creating a new system for tracking the academic
progress of each child every three months to catch struggling
students before they fall hopelessly behind. And he promised to
carry out Cortines' plan to split the district into 11
semi-independent parts.
</P>
<P>
   Although his political career makes him an unusual choice for
superintendent, board members cited Romer's long record of pushing
for education reform as a key reason he got the job. Romer has
chaired or participated in a host of education-oriented panels and
commissions, including the National Education Goals Panel and the
Education Commission of the States. As governor, he helped pass
legislation creating charter schools in Colorado and established a
preschool program for at-risk children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Romer is someone who for the last 16 years has been
at the forefront of education reform,'' board member David Tokofsky
said. ``He knows the players in public education and school reform.
And he knows the failures of school reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer's selection, and the process by which he was picked, did
not please everyone. After Zacarias' messy ouster last fall, many
Latino organizations and activists had hoped for another Latino
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   While several said Tuesday that they were eager to meet Romer
and did not want to criticize him in advance, they were still upset
that the board made its decision behind closed doors, without
taking public input on the finalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school board's relationship with the Latino community has
been extraordinarily strained, and he's going to have to deal with
that,'' said Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, although Romer was the board's unanimous choice in the
end, he was not so at first.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Victoria Castro favored one of the other three
finalists, former Chicago school board President George Munoz.
Other members, she said, preferred the third candidate, a veteran
school administrator whose name the board never disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Romer has already told her that building a relationship with the
Latino community is among his highest priorities, Castro said. ``He
has to do it,'' she said. ``If not, he'll go down as the last
superintendent of Los Angeles Unified.''
</P>
<P>
   That could yet happen, even if Romer builds the alliances he
needs. Efforts to break up the district into smaller parts are
pushing forward in the San Fernando Valley and Sacramento. A Los
Angeles County panel today will discuss and perhaps vote on plans
to create two new districts in the Valley, although that plan would
need the approval of the state's Board of Education and local
voters before it could become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview between meetings Tuesday afternoon, Romer
declined comment on that specific proposal, but said parents should
give Cortines' decentralization plan a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decentralization is a smart move,'' he said. ``People
ought to say, `Let's see how it works.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although negotiations over the details of his contract,
including salary, are still ongoing, Romer said Tuesday that his
transition into the job would start immediately.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he seemed on a mission to meet everyone whose path he
crossed. Running into Higuchi outside an elevator, he dove into a
discussion peppered with the names of union officials with whom he
had worked in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Said Higuchi: ``We could do something really radical here.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer brushed aside notions that at 71, he might be too old for
the hard job ahead. And he said he understood that elevating the
district would not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to get there without a lot of knocks on the
head,'' he said.

two soldiers _ one black, one white, both part of an institution
portrayed as a model of race relations _ stood only yards apart in
the middle of this sprawling base, each believing himself the
victim of racism; one because of an award, the other because of a
transfer. The Army is not supposed to harbor racial resentment
anymore. Its work force is integrated. The Army is one of the few
institutions in America in which blacks routinely boss around
whites, and supposedly no one gives it a second thought. But that
is an idealized image. The Pentagon has found that two-thirds of
its men and women had experienced a racially offensive encounter in
the previous 12 months. And those findings are more or less
mirrored here at Fort Knox. By Steven A. Holmes.

splash of peach liqueur. I took a sip; it was like an interior
sunset. Two ingredients. It couldn't have been simpler. But it had
the big kaboom of science. The next thing I remember I was hungry.

PACERS ARE `OTHER' TEAM IN FINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not that they have a complex, or they're tired of
hearing about L.A.'s glamour boys or think the spotlight is having
a little trouble with this equal billing business, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Hey, America, we're over here! The other team. The Indiana
Pacers, or as they're apparently known in many parts, the team that
is not the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers said the proper things about their NBA Finals
opponent leading into tonight's series opener, but when a New York
Times reporter described Kobe Bryant as ``awesome'' to Pacer Jalen
Rose, it was more thanhe could let slip past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unique thing about all this is _ and I'd be lying to say I
don't have to get used to it _ I have to get used to when when we
talk about their players, we're going to put them on a pedestal,''
Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about our players, we're going to talk about like
bottom journeymen. I have to get used to this, I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers tried not to play the respect card, but they're know
the Lakers are heavily favored. And well aware at the NBA's
pleasure that a team from a major media market with high-profile
stars made it into The Finals against small-market Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's good,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird. ``It's good
to have New York, good to have the big cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't really worry about that. We've worked very hard
to gethere. We've done as much as any other team. We fought for the
three years I've been here to make it to this point. We really
don't care who our opponent is. We want to play, we want to win. We
know we're going to be the underdogs. We know no one is giving us
an opportunity to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Said forward Dale Davis: ``It doesn't matter. I think we've been
underdogs throughout all the series we've been in, and we were the
No.1 seed. Whether we're the underdogs or not, we have an
opportunity here to do something for this franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MILLER FACTOR: Guard Reggie Miller did not lead the Pacers
in scoring during the regular season _ Rose topped him by one-tenth
of a point _ but he has stepped it up in the postseason, leading
Indiana with a 23.8 scoring average.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Bird said they expect the Lakers to use different
starters _ Ron Harper will probably open on him, with Bryant also
getting some time _ to alternate against Miller, as Phil Jackson
did when he coachedthe Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both great defenders,'' Miller said. ``Kobe being a
first-team all-defensive team, and me having great battles with Ron
when he was Chicago. They present different challenges. They're
both long, they're both quick, they both play good position
defense. And overall their team defense is great, too. It's nice to
have Shaq in the middle in case you get beat.''
</P>
<P>
   HOMECOMING: Miller isn't the only Southern Californian on the
Pacers. Forward Austin Croshere starred at Crossroads High in Santa
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic was my favorite player by far,'' Croshere said. ``It was
pretty hard as a kid growing up in L.A. not to be a Lakers fan, and
in turn, not to be a Magic Johnson fan.''
</P>
<P>
   Croshere said he did play against Magic in some pickup games at
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of a surreal experience, to be honest,'' he said. ``Just
catch yourself out there, trying to play a pickup game and then
saying, `OK, all right. I'm guarding Magic Johnson.'''
</P>
<P>
   FINALLY: Bird on Magic saying the series is almost an extension
of their old playing rivalry: ``Pretty nice to have a rivalry when
he's sitting over in the stands and I'm sitting in the hot seat.'' &QL;

GAGNE GETS FIRST `W' AS DODGERS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ARLINGTON, Texas _ Scarborough Green has a big-time name and
big-league swing, but this was Eric Gagne's night. Finally.
</P>
<P>
   The proof during Tuesday's 7-1 Dodgers victory over the Texas
Rangers was Green's fifth-inning blast into the right-field stands
that touched off fireworks at The Ballpark in Arlington and was
announced as his first major-league home run.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson ran out to argue. It was worth
spoiling the party because replays showed the ball landed three
feet foul. But it also was critical because Gagne was making his
eighth start in search of his first victory this season.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires changed their call. Then they had to coax a reluctant
Green out of the Rangers dugout and back to the plate where he
popped to short. And though Gagne pitched one more inning, his long
wait for victory ended right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so great to get that first one out of the way so we can
start working on the second,'' said Gagne, who scattered five hits
in six-plus innings. ``All of this has been an adventure and I've
learned a lot. But there is nothing like coming out on the winning
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Gagne went out for the seventh but left after David Segui opened
with a double and Chad Curtis walked. Terry Adams came on to pitch
out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give Eric a lot of credit because we have had to skip him in
the rotation and that can be tough on a young pitcher,'' Johnson
said. ``It's not something I like to do, but we've wanted to keep
(Kevin Brown) and Carlos (Perez) on a regular schedule. Eric has
done very well with it, which is great because we are going to need
him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who were shut down the night before by Ryan Glynn
and John Wetteland, didn't have much success against Texas starter
Mark Clark (3-4) until the fifth, when they scored four times.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen capped the inning when he greeted Clark's
replacement Francisco Cordova with a two-run single. Gary Sheffield
had two hits and two sacrifice flies. Rookie shortstop Alex Cora
added two hits, two runs and raised his average to .280.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the Dodgers, who had dropped eight of 12, had 14 hits.
Shawn Green, who reached base twice for the 41st time in the team's
55 games, also robbed Rusty Greer of a home run with a leaping
catch at the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers finally scored in the eighth inning when last year's
AL MVP Ivan Rodriguez homered off Adams. Mike Fetters pitched the
ninth for the Dodgers, who end their six-game trip here this
afternoon before returning home Thursday to play Houston in the
makeup of an April 17 rainout.
</P>
<P>
   ``A game like this makes you feel like good things are going to
start happening,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne went 1-1 with a 2.10 in five starts last September when he
made the jump from Double-A San Antonio. But this year had not been
so kind.
</P>
<P>
   He was so bad in four spring-training starts that he opened the
season in Triple-A. He made one start there and pitched six
scoreless innings. Gagne returned to the big leagues and pitched
well in spots, but he did not break through until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Against Cincinnati in mid-April, Gagne left with a lead after
allowing three hits and two runs in five innings, but the Dodgers
bullpen could not hold it.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, against East-leading Atlanta, Gagne allowed four hits
and one run in seven innings but lost 2-1 to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned something from every game I've pitched, the good
ones and the bad ones,'' Gagne said. ``Sometimes you get breaks,
but mostly you have to make your own. You have to make good
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had a four-run lead, Gagne's pitch to Green in the
fifth could have shaken his confidence. The Dodgers applauded
first-base umpire Gary Cederstrom for asking the other umpires what
they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see that very often, but I know I appreciated it,''
Gagne said. ``The ball was clearly foul, but you have the crowd
cheering and the fireworks going off. What are you going to do? The
umpire made a great call.'' &QL;

AFTER SPENDING $35 MILLION, CORZINE WINS DEMOCRATIC SENATE PRIMARY
IN N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs top of story for updating, rewriting; also subs last 4 grafs
for updating and rewriting)  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Jon Corzine, the Wall Street multimillionaire
whose $35 million spending spree shattered all records for a Senate
race, easily defeated former Gov. Jim Florio on Tuesday in the
Democratic primary for the seat being vacated by Sen. Frank
Lautenberg.
</P>
<P>
   In the four-way Republican primary, Rep. Robert Franks, a
four-term congressman from Union County, declared victory at 12:20
a.m. on Wednesday over State Sen. William Gormley, a veteran
lawmaker from the Atlantic City area who nonetheless refused to
concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake,'' Corzine shouted to the crowd at a hotel
ballroom in East Brunswick. ``I want to invest in America. That's
what this campaign will be about.''
</P>
<P>
   Conceding defeat Tuesday night at 10:35, Florio said he would
support his rival. ``This has been a tough campaign, this has been
a very spirited campaign,'' Florio told dispirited supporters at a
hotel in Cherry Hill. ``I disagree with Jon Corzine on a number of
issues, but I agree with him a lot more than I would agree with any
of the Republicans who are running for that office.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio's aides had hoped that a low turnout caused by heavy
rains Tuesday morning would favor him, but in unofficial returns
reported by The Associated Press, with 98 percent of districts
reporting, Corzine had 245,901 votes, 58 percent, to 178,562, 42
percent, for Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, in his victory speech, likened himself to Gov. Christie
Whitman, former President Ronald Reagan, Gen. Colin Powell and Sen.
John McCain. But he also acknowledged his relatively poor name
recognition and quickly borrowed a line of Florio's to begin his
campaign against Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good evening, New Jersey, I'm Bob Franks, the candidate with
experience that money can't buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gormley, speaking simultaneously in Egg Harbor, refused to
admit defeat, saying about 100 precincts had yet to report results.
``We're going to look at the numbers and wait until everything
comes in,'' he said. ``It's not my intention to needlessly prolong
this process.''
</P>
<P>
   With 98 percent of districts reporting, Franks had 95,546 votes,
or 35 percent; Gormley had 91,738 votes, or 34 percent; James W.
Treffinger, the Essex County executive, had 47,792, 18 percent; and
Murray Sabrin, who ran for governor as a Libertarian in 1997, had
34,089, 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, Corzine's stated willingness to spend
whatever it took to win now has put a burden on Republicans, who a
year ago, before Governor Whitman dropped out of the race, had
viewed New Jersey as an easy victory. Republican leaders now will
have to decide whether to commit large resources to try to defeat
Corzine, or focus on other, less costly races.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's entry into the race as a self-financed candidate saved
state Democratic leaders from having to raise as much as $10
million for a less wealthy Senate candidate. Now, his victory in
the primary means they will be able to focus on the real prize of
New Jersey politics: the governor's race in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic outcome had rested on two uncertainties: whether
voters would be persuaded or repulsed by the money Corzine spent on
his campaign, and whether Jim Florio could overcome the lingering
animosity of Democrats still nursing grudges over the $2.8 billion
tax increase he signed as governor in 1990, fueling years of
Republican electoral victories.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine was expected to spend $2 million on Tuesday alone in
get-out-the-vote efforts, from rain gear and rented vans to
payments of $75 or more for his street workers. The previous record
for a U.S. Senate primary was $8.1 million, and Corzine has already
exceeded the nearly $30 millon Michael Huffington spent in vain in
his race for the U.S. Senate in California in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Democrats was embodied by one couple at the
public library in Westfield. ``I wasn't going to vote, but I'm
opposed to someone who spends $36 million to buy an election,''
said Mark Rubin, an accountant voting there. ``Florio was an awful
governor, but I voted for him because no one has a right to buy the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Bu Rubin's wife, Andi, said she could not bring herself to vote
for Florio. She waited in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The winner in November succeeds Lautenberg, who surprised the
state's political community in February 1999 when he announced that
he would not seek a fourth term. Lautenberg, himself a millionaire
businessman, said he did not want to spend two years raising money
for re-election. He endorsed Corzine.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time as Lautenberg announced his retirement,
Corzine was forced out of his job as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs.
When Goldman Sachs held an initial public stock offering in May
1999, Corzine received 4.4 million shares, and instantly became
worth $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Corzine's candidacy emerged several months later, it was
viewed as the answer to a prayer by many Democrats, among them Sen.
Robert Torricelli, who believed the only way to defeat Florio was
with a great deal of money.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, as combative as he was in three races for governor,
relentlessly assailed Corzine as a political neophyte whose naivete
could not compete with his own experience in state government and
as an eight-term congressman. With a meager $2.5 million budget,
Florio ran only attack commercials in the last two weeks of the
race, and had to be pressed at times to articulate his own agenda
were he to win a Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   But Florio did little to deflect Corzine's attacks, which began
on television in mid-April and remained unanswered for a month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The New Jersey primary also featured three of the nation's most
competitive congressional races. In the Fifth District, Marge
Roukema, a 20-year incumbent, clung to a narrow lead over E. Scott
Garrett, a state assemblyman. With 99 percent of the vote counted,
Roukema, who beat Garrett by 1,710 votes two years ago, was
maintaining nearly the same margin, 1,571 votes, or 52 percent to
Garrett's 48.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12th District, where two former congressmen fought a
testy campaign for the Republican nomination, Richard Zimmer scored
a convincing victory over Mike Pappas. With 100 percent of
districts reporting, Zimmer had 62 percent of the vote to Pappas'
38 percent. The winner will face a freshman Democrat, Rush Holt,
who two years ago defeated Pappas, who succeeded Zimmer in 1996
when Zimmer vacated his seat to run for Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In the Seventh District, with a crowded field of four
Republicans and four Democrats, Michael Ferguson, a college
instructor, defeated Thomas Kean Jr., the former governor's son,
and two other candidates. In the Democratic field, Maryanne
Connelly and Michael Lapolla were almost tied at 45 percent each
with 99 percent of the precincts reporting.

THE RETURN OF A REFORMED REGGIE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A decade and more, we've waited to get Reggie
Miller back in Los Angeles for basketball games that matter. And
this is who shows up?
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen-points-a-game Reggie?
</P>
<P>
   Second-option Reggie?
</P>
<P>
   A (ital) reformed (endital) gunner?
</P>
<P>
   A leader by example?
</P>
<P>
   Say it ain't so, Reg.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the rumor swirling around the Staples Center on the
eve of tonight's NBA Finals opener between Miller's Indiana Pacers
and the Lakers that Reggie Miller, 34 years old and 13 seasons out
of UCLA, has toned down his act, for what is quaintly referred to
as the good of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, he would talk about getting it done. Now, he just gets
it done,'' said John Salley, the Lakers' veteran backup center who
is a long-time Reggie-watcher. ``He's leading more by example. You
see him in his interviews more professional clothes, more
professional manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Clothes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah. Some guys get up there and look bummy. He gets up there
and looks professional. That shows how he's matured and realizes
how you present yourself carries over.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Salley said that, Miller climbed onto a
press-conference podium wearing a fishing hat pulled low over dark
shades, and a long-sleeved Pacers T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   There went the fear he's grown up completely.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there were the words of Pacers guard Travis
Best, on Miller's new willingness to (is he kidding?) pass the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought last year, when we played New York (in the Eastern
Conference finals, losing in six games), there were times guys may
have been open but he took the shot because he felt like he had
to,'' Best said. ``He just didn't have the confidence in the other
guys late in the game. Now, he doesn't mind giving the ball up for
the last shot. That's what you have to do to win.''
</P>
<P>
   To which we say: Good for Indiana, but meanwhile, Los Angeles
would like to sell some tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Mellow Reggie isn't going to put fans in the seats. We might as
well pay to see Mark McGwire choke up and hit ground balls to
right, to see Deion Sanders field snaps for the field-goal kicker,
or to see Oscar De La Hoya and Shane Mosley settle it with a game
of backgammon.
</P>
<P>
   When you go to the WWF, you want to see a guy bashed over the
head with a chair. And when you go to see the Pacers, you expect to
see a guy bombing 3-pointers from 30 feet, giving ``choke'' signs
to the opponents' bench, and keeping up the taunts all the way to
the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to that Reggie?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, thank goodness, is that he's still around here
somewhere, and he's reemerging.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different Miller who led the Pacers during their 56-26
regular-season run to the Central Division title. The difference
being that the 6-foot-7 guard didn't actually lead them.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in 11 years, Miller (18.1 points a game)
wasn't the Pacers' top scorer. The improvement of guard Jalen Rose
(18.2) relieved him of that burden.
</P>
<P>
   In place of his old 21-points-a-game air show, Miller displayed
new facets to his game. Inverting the concept of improving your
range, he became more than a pure jump shooter, showing off
mid-range and post-up shots and drives to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can kind of pace himself and let Jalen Rose do his thing
for a little while, Travis Best, other guys,'' said Lakers guard
Brian Shaw, who came into the league a year after Miller. ``But I
think he has more of an all-around game now. He's always been able
to shoot the ball from the perimeter. But he's taking the ball to
the basket and finishing well, (while) getting to the free-throw
line, which he's always done.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all of this is entirely new for Miller. Pacers president
Donnie Walsh points out that he drove more early in his career,
before the NBA's cycle of rule changes led to rougher play, making
the paint unsafe for slender young men.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wouldn't have made it through a season if he'd kept that
up,'' Walsh said during the Pacers' practice Tuesday at the Staples
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, knowing he'll have to adapt to survive as he ages,
Miller added muscle to his frame, his listed weight rising from 185
before the 1998-99 season to 202 on the Indiana playoff roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing better defensively, too,'' Shaw said. ``A lot of
people look at his slender frame and think that he's weak. He's a
wiry-strong kind of guy. His competitive spirit and his will
enables him to compete and get the best of a lot of guys who are
bigger and stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   He broadened his repertoire as well as his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Miller played with the Lakers' Kobe Bryant in the offseason and
each picked up something from the other. Miller learned some
one-on-one moves. Bryant learned about using screens and about
Miller's step-back jumper. Oh, and Bryant learned about Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loves contact, he draws fouls and gets to the free-throw
line,'' Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant and Ron Harper _ who was an NBA rookie as Miller was
completing his 2,000-point UCLA career in 1987 _ will be the Lakers
most responsible for guarding Miller in this best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades after another Reggie (Reggie! Reggie!) in pinstripes
tormented Los Angeles, another is poised for the attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for the Lakers is that after Miller let his scoring
average slip to its lowest in 11 years during the regular season,
he has raised it to its highest (23.8) in four years during the
Pacers' playoff victories over Milwaukee, Philadelphia and New
York.
</P>
<P>
   He's looking like the NBA's all-time leader in playoff
3-pointers (185) again.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for all but the most unromantic Lakers fan is that
this means vintage Reggie, one of the great basketball entertainers
of the 1990s, is here in 2000 after all.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire will swing from the heels, Deion will high-step into the
end zone, and Oscar and Sugar Shane will throw leather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a team game, of course, but there are guys who lift a
team up, and Reggie is one of those guys,'' Walsh said. ``He has
the ability to make the shots when the game is on the line. And he
visibly wants the ball for the last shot. There aren't many guys
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The guy who scored 25 points in the first quarter of a 1994
playoff game against New York, and who scored eight in the last 8.9
seconds of a 1995 playoff game against New York, is the one who put
the Pacers in their first NBA Finals by scoring 17 of his 34 points
in the fourth quarter of Friday's Game 6 victory over the same poor
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside product is pumped to be playing his first
championship series in front of family and friends in Los Angeles.
He's also pumped as ever to be considered an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope they overlook us,'' Miller said from beneath that hat
and those shades. ``We're not coming in here to lay down. We're
coming in here to shock the world. ... Great players should step up
when the money is on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Did somebody say Reggie has cut out the big talk?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I think he's still talking as much as he ever has,'' Shaw
said, laughing at Salley's assertion. ``That's something that gets
him going. I played with Larry Bird, and I can't remember anyone
who talked more than him, but that's what got him going.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to the guys on our team (is), if he's having a quiet
night, let sleeping dogs lie. Don't start talking and get him hyped
up. We've seen what he can do when that happens.'' &QL;

PAYTON TOWERS OVER SEATTLE SPORTS SCENE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A 30-foot poster of Gary Payton draped over a building
in the heart of downtown goes a little beyond symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the building is NikeTown. And granted, Payton is in
Phil Knight's stable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the message is clear: Seattle is his city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's saying I'm going here or there or whatever. I say
just let me relax a little. Everybody knows I want to stay with
Seattle,'' Payton said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is not every day you get to replace Ken Griffey Jr., but
Tuesday was that kind of day for Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Where Griffey's face was emblazoned for three years on the front
of Nike's flagship storefront on glittery Sixth Avenue, there is
now a shot of Payton _ which Payton unveiled during a special
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   He is captured from his tough-guy, photo-shoot stare all the way
down to his two-tone, No. 20 `Glove' shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look here,'' Payton said, pointing to the feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This photo is from 1996. See those shoes? Those are the first
`Glove' shoes. We're up to the fourth edition by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton also said the bulging biceps and popped veins running
down his forearm were not technically enhanced by some darkroom
geek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on, now. That stuff's all natural,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton likes the poster. And the people of Seattle, or whoever
voted in a poll to choose Griffey's replacement, seem happily
married to this guy named Gary _ sometimes wild, sometimes crazy,
sometimes generous, always a character.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Alex Rodriguez who was voted as the new poster boy.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that is because Rodriguez is widely viewed as on his way
out of town, the caboose in a trainload of exiting talent starting
with Shawn Kemp and continuing with Randy Johnson, Griffey and Joey
Galloway.
</P>
<P>
   But a larger part of how Payton earned his place literally on
the Seattle skyline is because of all the sweating and sneering
he's done over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite rumblings to the contrary, fans are starting to see that
Payton could be a lifelong Sonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sees the value to dedicating himself to being a one-team
athlete,'' said Payton's agent, Eric Goodwin.
</P>
<P>
   It is this kind of mindset that could lead Payton and the Sonics
to a contract extension. With three years left on his 1996 deal for
$87 million, it is the right time for such a move.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics, short of ripping the team apart and rebuilding,
 &UR; gfgrave &LR; a la the Bulls or Magic, would be insane not to lock up
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   For every snarl, for every media blowoff, for every TV remote
control thrown at Vernon Maxwell that seems to underscore Payton's
volatility, Payton has countered with conciliatory gestures, many
of them deeply meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the school kids Payton helps sponsor were brought over
to Planet Hollywood for a nice lunch. The Gary Payton Foundation
got a $5,000 check from Nike, added to the millions Payton has
raised and donated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I got a lot of people looking at me, asking me for
my time, and I try to do everything I can, and I'm going to keep on
trying,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude apparently applies to the Sonics as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever roller coaster the Sonics were on for the second half
of the season, Payton said he has no issues with head coach Paul
Westphal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time I complain is when it's real bad. Right now I
think things can be fixed,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton has a few suggestions for general manager Wally Walker. A
center would be good, for instance the Wizards' Jahidi White or
Magic's John Amaechi.
</P>
<P>
   As for 2-guard? Maybe Walker should take a seat for this: Isaiah
Rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says he's a problem, but you have to deal with the
problem, because he can score on the floor. He can't ask for too
much, so I say give him a year, take a risk. If I'm with him, I
think I can work with him. Off the court, that's where he has his
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton might also take a trip to visit Rashard Lewis, the
talented 20-year-old who is a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Rashard wants to come back here. Just before the
draft, I'm going to talk with him. He can come play and score 20-30
points a night here, and I think this team is better suited for
him,'' Payton said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own summer plans, Payton is taking the kids to Disney
World, taking his wife to the Bahamas, then heading off to his Las
Vegas home in July to start training with Tim Grgurich for the
Sydney Olympics and next season.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a close-up view during playoff work for TNT, Payton said
the Western Conference champion Lakers don't scare him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw us last year. We were in games all the time against
those guys. I think we just need a couple more pieces and we'll be
all right.''
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Payton's part of the Seattle ``We.'' He's into it.
He's towering over everything now. It suits him.

BAKER, SCIOSCIA NOT FANS OF INTERLEAGUE PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Clearly, Dusty Baker, the San Francisco
Giants' manager, is no fan of interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a buzz when we play the (Oakland) A's,'' he said in
the Giants' first-base dugout before Tuesday night's game. ``But
there ain't no buzz here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fine the first couple of years,'' Baker said. ``We
needed something. We had lost so many (fans) because of the work
stoppage. But now ... why should the Angels or Texas or Seattle
determine what happens in our division?''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scioscia, the Angels' manager _ and Baker's teammate when
both were with the Dodgers _ isn't especially wild about it,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd much rather be playing teams in your own division,''
said Scioscia. ``You want to either pad your lead or pick up
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   BELCHER CLOSE: Right-hander Tim Belcher will make one more rehab
start for Edmonton on Saturday night at Sacramento, then hopes to
be ready for his first start of the season the following week at
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like a four-month spring training,'' said Belcher,
who had surgery Dec. 2 to repair a muscle in his right elbow.
</P>
<P>
   BONDED: The Angels' 11-inning, 5-4 loss to the Giants Monday was
a ``doubled-edged sword,'' according to Scioscia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was encouraging the way we came back,'' he said of the
Angels' two-run rally in the bottom of the ninth that tied the
score. ``But it was discouraging that we didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' Barry Bonds won it with his major league-leading
24th home run in the top of the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Bonds, who turns 36 next month, is even
better than his three NL MVP years in the early '90s, Scioscia
said, ``I don't know if he's better, but he's been able to
maintain. Bonds is like Mantle, Mays and Snider ... one of those
guys you always mention when you're comparing the best.''
</P>
<P>
   PLAYER MOVES: The Angels outrighted infielder Keith Luuloa to
Edmonton. He appeared in just six games and was 6 for 18. ... The
Giants' starter Tuesday night, Joe Nathan, was activated from the
disabled list (tendinitis in right shoulder) prior to the game. To
make room, outfielder Terrell Lowery was designated for assignment.
He was 15 for 27 (.556) in 12 games. &QL;

ARMED AND DANGEROUS: BUHNER, JAVIER THROWS HALT ROCKIES RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Pinball Wizards broke loose in the sixth inning at
Safeco Field Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   With Colorado trying desperately to rally from a 3-1 deficit,
Mariners outfielders Jay Buhner and Stan Javier took turns playing
the Safeco wall to precision.
</P>
<P>
   On consecutive plays in support of reliever Rob Ramsay, Buhner
threw out Todd Helton at second base and Javier threw out Jeffrey
Hammonds trying to reach the same destination, helping preserve the
Mariners' 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very inflating for us, and very deflating for them,''
shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. Rodriguez took Buhner's throw on a
tough in-between hop to put the tag on Helton. ``They're thinking,
`We hit a couple of rocket doubles, and we've got two out and
nobody on.'''
</P>
<P>
   In each case, Helton and Hammonds short-hopped the outfield wall
with balls that probably should have been doubles. But right
fielder Buhner, then left fielder Javier, read the angles of the
wall to perfection. Each was waiting in place for the ball when it
bounded back toward the infield. Each plucked the ball out of the
air, then whipped it toward second base and an eventual out.
</P>
<P>
   A proper pinball machine would have had bells and whistles
shrieking and lights flashing. Buhner and Javier had to settle for
prolonged ovations from the 26,812 in attendance, who saw those
plays help the Mariners turn the corner in a win that gave them
sole possession of first place in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised I threw the ball that well,'' Javier
said. In his youth, Javier had a nice arm, but age and a series of
injuries has sapped some of its suppleness. ``I used to throw the
ball a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be tough for Javier to throw the ball better than he
did, bringing the crowd to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no pinball machine would be complete without a trap
door. The Rockies found one when Jeff Cirillo hit what he thought
was a three-run homer, only to see it turn into a single,
short-circuiting an inning that had the potential to make the
Mariners go ``tilt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, that's where I had my trouble _ damage control,''
Mariners starter Brett Tomko said. ``When you can get out of an
inning like that giving up just one run, you're in pretty good
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, batting with two on and none out in the third, crushed
a Tomko serve for what he thought was a three-run homer. But
first-base umpire Eric Cooper, as close to the ball as anyone who
hadn't bought a ticket, ruled _ correctly, replays would show _
that the ball didn't go out. Instead, it hit the top of the fence
and stayed in play.
</P>
<P>
   Although base runners Tom Goodwin and Mike Lansing each advanced
a base and stayed put, Cirillo, who didn't have Cooper's view of
the ball, was caught in a rundown and was tagged out by first
baseman John Olerud. Hammonds would get the Rockies a run with a
sacrifice fly, but Tomko escaped without a major mishap and would
go on to record the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Paniagua pitched 21/3 innings of strong scoreless relief to
reach the ninth inning, where Kazuhiro Sasaki took over and
finished up for his ninth save, his second this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a huge 21/3 innings Jose gave us,'' manager Lou
Piniella said. ``He gave it to us when we really needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paniagua took over for Ramsay in the sixth. Ramsay was in
trouble even after the two pinball throws, walking the next two
batters he faced. Paniagua warmed up in a hurry, came in, got a
grounder to Rodriguez to get the third out, then pitched two more
shutout innings, aided by Mark McLemore. The second baseman plucked
a tough but soft short-hop off the bat of Cirillo out of the air
with runners on the corners and turned it into an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of defense going on tonight,'' Javier said.
``The play McLemore made was something else, too. Ever since I've
been here, I've been impressed by the defense we've played.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you don't win (division titles) without defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Punctuating the point, the Mariners took over first place in the
West, with Texas losing to fall a game off the pace.
</P>
<P>
   The game wasn't without some downside for the Mariners. Rickey
Henderson left with what was called a stiff neck, and Tomko took a
line drive off his left foot in the third inning. Henderson was
scheduled to get Wednesday off anyway, and Tomko isn't expected to
miss a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third inning was kind of a daze to me after that,'' Tomko
said.
</P>
<P>
   Funny, because hitters have been in kind of a daze facing him in
interleague games. After picking up his fourth win in six decisions
overall this year, Tomko improved his career record to 7-0 in
interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' Tomko said, ``but if they want to
play all interleague games, it's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said his injury was in his shoulder blade more than in
his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me when I run it gets aggravated,'' Henderson said.
``It should be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning has a way of making things all right.

SPARKS GET DEFENSIVE FOR THIRD WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Sparks anticipated a tough game against the
expansion Portland Fire, a team that took the three-time defending
champion Houston Comets to double-overtime before losing.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, however, were the defensive agitators and never had
any trouble as they defeated the Fire 70-57 Tuesday night at the
Forum. The win improved their record to 3-0, the only remaining
undefeated team in the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   The only negative Tuesday was the announced attendance of 4,639,
the lowest figure since a 1998 game with Sacramento drew 4,851.
</P>
<P>
   But everything else went well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great defensive effort,'' Sparks coach Michael Cooper said.
``I think this was one of our better defensive games. I think we
make it difficult for them to score.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophia Witherspoon had 12 points for Portland (1-2), its only
player in double figures. The Fire reserves outscored its starters
33-24.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks bench, paced by Allison Feaster's 13 points, had 20
points as a group.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Leslie led the Sparks with 19 points and six rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thing is just win,'' Leslie said. ``I don't care if I have
three points or 30. I just want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Comparing the Sparks to Houston, Portland coach Linda Hardgrove
said the Sparks are ``extremely athletic, very, very quick.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a great offensive game for the Sparks, who shot 34
percent, but they were able to contain the Fire at 37 percent. The
Sparks made their point at the free-throw line, where they made 17
of 24 attempts. Feaster was 11 of 14 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was punctuated by runs, mostly by the Sparks, who
took a 26-24 advantage into the break.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 5-2, the Sparks took command as DeLisha
Milton scored on a layup to initiate a 12-2 run. Portland pulled
within 16-13, but it was a short-lived. Feaster ignited the defense
by picking up a couple of steals to help build the Sparks lead to
24-13 with six minutes to play. Nikki McCrimmon scored five
consecutive points to give the Sparks their biggest lead of 15
points with 1:23 remaining in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Portland struggled offensively in the first half, shooting 25
percent from the field. But the Fire stayed in the game with 80
percent shooting (12 of 15) from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Milton had 10 points and three blocks for the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   NOTES: Guard Tamecka Dixon went down with a knee injury with 44
seconds to play in the first half, but she returned to start the
second half. ... Forward LaKeisha Frett (tendinitis) is the only
Spark who didn't see action. &QL;

LESSONS FROM MIRACLE GAME 7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Indiana Pacers and Reggie Miller will hopefully forgive the
Lakers and their bandwagon if they begin the NBA Finals tonight
still hung over from Sunday's Miracle on 11th St.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the Western Conference Game 7 win over Portland the
biggest win in this generation of Lakers, but it came about 10
minutes away from being the Flop on Figueroa, too. Friends and
colleagues who have replayed tapes of the fourth quarter still have
a hard time accepting the result.
</P>
<P>
   Three themes left over from Game 7 are sure to be continued
during the series:
</P>
<P>
   1. The maturing of Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   When all of the Laker world was about to crumble in the fourth
quarter, it was Kobe who kept his wits about him and made big play
after big play. They weren't all big plays along the lines of a
28-foot jumper or a highlight-worthy drive through the lane,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe made defensive stops, rebounds, blocks and assists in
between his field goals. Jerry West should take immense pride that
Kobe has developed into the kind of dominating, complete player he
envisioned when he dealt for the high school graduate during the
1996 draft.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant took the Portland challenge personally. The Trail Blazers
kept saying they could break Bryant down, but in the end the
opposite was true. In the fourth quarter, Bryant broke down Scottie
Pippen. ``They were saying they wanted to expose me, post me up,
break me down,'' said Kobe. ``It got under my skin. I said I wasn't
going to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he has a chance to win an NBA title in his third pro
season. He's still precocious, but with poise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something I've dreamed about,'' Kobe said Sunday,
pausing for effect, ``for all my 21 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we have to remember is that it's still just
basketball. Have fun and play.''
</P>
<P>
   2. The continuing education of Shaquille O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   There were times in Game 7 when the NBA camera peered in on the
face of the Lakers' center and showed the nation a young man with
streams of honest sweat rolling past anxious eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when Shaq seems to get caught up in the tension
of the moment, and he becomes so intent on making correct decisions
that he becomes a bit tentative. He all but acknowledged as much
when noting, ``sometimes when we try too hard, we make a lot of
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But considering the onslaught he faced against Portland, this
was understandable. I don't care how big a person is, when a team
decides to aggressively triple-team a player, and when the
officials will allow them any contact short of rape, it is going to
wear him down.
</P>
<P>
   And not enough has been said about the difficulty of playing
Portland's Arvydas Sabonis. The Lithuanian is a 7-foot-3, 300-pound
tree trunk, the only real physical match for O'Neal at least in
terms of size, who also forced O'Neal to move out defensively to
guard his outside shot.
</P>
<P>
   In the two biggest losses in the series for Portland, Sabonis
was absent for key stretches the third quarter of Game 3, when Mike
Dunleavy left him on the bench too long, and the fourth quarter of
Game 7, when Sabonis picked up three fouls in five minutes of play
and fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   He exited with 8:35 left after picking up his fifth, and the
Trail Blazers were outscored, 6-0, before he returned with 4:19
left. He fouled out 95 seconds later, Shaq making two free throws
to tie the game, and the Trail Blazers never led again.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, like most NBA teams, has no answer for Shaq. The NBA
record for highest scoring average in the Finals is Michael
Jordan's 41.0 in 1993 against Phoenix. I'd have to think it's in
jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   3. The psychology of Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, there have been times when it's been abnormal
psychology. I can't say I was very impressed by the way he tried to
get in the head of Scottie Pippen, even if it ultimately worked.
Pippen took himself out of Game 7 by backing away from the
challenge in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jackson knew he would. But the daily thumping of Pippen's
psyche, including employing Rick Fox like his jailhouse character
in the HBO series ``Oz,'' seemed cheap, like clubbing baby seals.
Reggie Miller isn't likely to go down from these kind of tricks in
the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson seems more interested in playing with the minds of
his own players. He has dangled this team's ``arrival'' all season,
and it still hangs there despite the Portland win.
</P>
<P>
   He'll still push it, too. He'll undoubtedly remind them that
seven of the eight teams in the modern era that finished the
regular season with a winning percentage over .800 the Lakers'
67-15 comes home at .817 went on to win the title, the only
exception being the 1983 Celtics (68-14, .829, East Conference
finals losers to New York). That list includes three of his six
title-winning Bulls teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see if we've learned anything,'' he said after Game 7.
Well, here's a tip to Shaq and the fellas: Phil will always have
you chasing this carrot. After all, he has eight rings.
</P>
<P>
   He seems to have their attention. The Portland series turned out
to be a lot closer than it had to be, just like Sacramento. That
doesn't mean the Lakers won't throw a shoe at least once in the
Finals, just as they have in each series. But there's less chance
it will become a continuing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Especially since Bryant has a chance to do something not even
Jordan did win a title by his fourth season. Especially since Shaq
now has a chance to bury that sweep at the hands of Houston in the
'95 Finals, not to mention the other similar endings since.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Orlando (in 1995), we had a full week off before the
Finals,'' said O'Neal. ``There was a lot of partying. Our focus was
on making the Finals. After we beat the Bulls and Michael (in the
1995 Eastern Conference finals), we felt we had it won.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude this time is that we have four more games to win.
There is still a job to be done.'' &QL;

LITTLE HOPE FOUND FOR PACERS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Around the truly important places water coolers, bar stools and
latte lines the NBA Finals 2000 already is considered the biggest
mismatch since Rik Smits' first blind date with black socks.
</P>
<P>
   Smits, who's never been on ``NYPD Blue,'' is employed by the
Indiana Pacers as their starting center. About as nimble as the Tin
Man with ACL issues, this guy.
</P>
<P>
   Having an obligation to explore the bright side, it should be
stated that the 7-foot-4 Smits _ known as the ``Dunkin' Dutchman''
before gravity reduced his feet to aper weights _ can shoot it. And
make it. But his presumed inability to check Shaquille O'Neal _
backed by solid evidence threatens to make Pacers vs. Lakers as
competitive as a surfboard in a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any hope for the Indiana Pacers?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, but in the interest of analytical freewheeling,
let's explore one of the few variables in their favor:
</P>
<P>
   It's known as 2-3-2, which reads as if it could be defined as
the illegal defense Buddy Ryan designed for Portland's Trail
Blazers in their relatively successful skirmish with O'Neal. But
what 2-3-2 really represents is the venue breakdown for the NBA
Finals, a tricky proposition allegedly born of geography.
</P>
<P>
   The first two games are to be contested in the arena of the team
with the home-court advantage (Lakers), followed by three at home
for the underdogs (Pacers), wrapped up _ if necessary _ by two more
at the original site. This is a not exactly slight deviation from
the 2-2-1-1-1 format of the conference quarters and semis. It's
also a warning for the favorite to take care of business in Game 1
and 2.
</P>
<P>
   According to league spotters, this change (which has been used
for a few years now) is to reduce the number of back-and-forth
trips required for teams with vast time-zone differences.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Lakers' erratic behavior in the Portland series,
location may not be anything. But we're struggling to identify a
competitive edge for the Pacers, and this may be the best we can
do.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they seem to have the stronger bench, but the previous
series demonstrated that it's unwise to go cuckoo over that one.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from an extremely ambivalent coach in the departing Larry
Bird, Indiana has a pack of accomplished snipers, the ringleader
being former UCLA star Reggie Miller. The Lakers' marvelous Kobe
Bryant figures to have Miller duty during the important stretches
of this series. Miller duty means chasing one of the NBA's ranking
trash talkers through a phalanx of illegitimate screens designed by
savvy assistant coach Rick Carlisle.
</P>
<P>
   Pacer point guard Mark Jackson should be no problem for Laker
Ron Harper, but Jackson's caddy, speedy Travis Best, could be a
nightmare. Best, a headline writer's secret weapon, was
particularly menacing in the Pacers' Jan.14 victory over the Lakers
at Indianapolis. Even with smallish Derek Fisher assigned to
violate his airspace, Best _ with the help of high screens by Smits
_ smoked L.A. in a memorable fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   However, the biggest defensive dilemma the Lakers must address
is posed by small forward Jalen Rose. Rose, voted the NBA's Most
Improved Player, figures to be a tough cover for Glen Rice. This is
where Indiana could do some business.
</P>
<P>
   Or the Lakers may even try to hide Rice on Jackson, leaving
Miller and Rose to Bryan and Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Power forward Dale Davis is the key rebounder for a
poor-rebounding squad, but on a team of offensive rifles, he's
something of a musket.
</P>
<P>
   As a defensive unit, the Pacers are less formidable than the
swarming army from Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is the shotblocker, Smits the lumbering liability and
Jackson, a former Clipper, is slower than Friday afternoon traffic.
Miller and Rose have their moments defensively, but when Bird needs
a few stops, he relies on Best _ one of the few humans who has a
reasonable chance of staying in front of Philly's Allen Iverson _
and reserve forward Derrick McKey. Despite going almost 6-10, McKey
is extremely agile and could be summoned to take on Bryant when
Kobe starts to get out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana's unofficial defensive coordinator is Dick Harter, the
former University of Oregon coach whose philosophy of stinginess
earned a seat next to Chuck Daly in Detroit and one beside Pat
Riley in New York. Harter's theories include shunning the low-post
double-team, while ganging up when the opponent attempts an
on-the-ball screen.
</P>
<P>
   But the triangle offense directed by Lakers assistant Tex Winter
and promoted by Phil Jackson has little use for on-the-ball
screens. And there will be two reasons for Harter to rethink his
notion about double-teaming the post:
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   He can attempt to handle Bryant on the post with McKey; but the
only answer he has for O'Neal in a one-on-one setting is Smits.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why, despite the 2-3-2 proposition, it looks like
Lakers in five. &QL;

   EDITORIAL-UN-WOMEN _ The year 2000 graduates have received their
diplomas and most schools are out for the summer. But 110 million
children never entered school this year_ two thirds of them girls.
That's one reason wny the United Nations meeting on women this
week, a follow- up to the 1995 Beijing conference, is so important.

<P>
   EDITORIAL-GAMBLING _ Bet you didn't know there are more than 250
online casinos, 64 lotteries, 20 bingo games and 139 sports books
attracting suckers on the Internet. Legislation to ban this
activity passed the Senate in relatively good shape, but the
measure has collected harmful House amendments like a ship acquires
barnacles. House should start all over. (The Atlanta Constitution).

 &HT;    Capitalizing on capital punishment
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got to hand it to death row inmate Michael ``Cowboy''
Toney for displaying that good old Texas entrepreneurial spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Toney tried to sell five seats to his own
execution on the Internet auction site eBay.com. This is false
advertising, because there are no seats in the viewing room at the
execution chamber in Huntsville, Texas. The auction was on display
only about four hours; eBay shut it down before anybody bid on the
alleged seats. Prison officials say that even if someone had bought
seats, they couldn't get in.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, poo-- . This is Texas, where lethal injections are as common
as honky-tonkin', rodeo and the cow-chip toss. Why is the state
picking on this guy just because he's trying to make a buck off one
of Texas' leading institutions?
</P>
<P>
   Texas may not lead the nation in everything _ it's been a while
since we won a college football championship. But by George, as in
George W. Bush, we are No. 1 in state-sponsored killing: 216 since
1982, and 131 since Bush took office in 1995. Why shouldn't Toney
be allowed to make a fast buck off the phenomenon? Obviously at
these rates, there's a market out there.
</P>
<P>
   If a guy wants to drum up a little extra cash on his way out,
why stop him? Heck, if he wants, he ought to be able to leave a
couple of extra tickets at the -- ill -- all window for Elvis. It
wouldn't take a visionary such as myself to point out that the
state could set up a Death Row Gift Shoppe outside the viewing
room. There could be Big House refrigerator magnets, ``He's Outta
Here'' T-shirts, death row potholders, coffee cups, paperweights,
even ``We're No. 1'' foam hands.
</P>
<P>
   I personally wouldn't want one. But what capital punishment
booster wouldn't want to dangle his car keys off a key chain
decorated with Death Row and the state seal?
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't do my Christmas shopping in a place like that. But
I'll bet plenty of Texans would. And I say guys like Toney ought to
be able to get a piece of the action _ before the state gets a
piece of him. It's only fair.
</P>
<P>
   Executions are supposed to be a deterrent, right? Isn't that the
logic behind the justification? I personally wouldn't want to go to
a show like this. But wouldn't executions be even more of a
deterrent if Texans could buy a ticket to look? Why not increase
capacity for viewing executions at Huntsville from the current 20
or so to something much larger, with theater seating?
</P>
<P>
   May I suggest an Offing in the Round, a dinner theater
arrangement where ticket buyers get to enjoy the same last meal
selected by the victim. I hear cheeseburgers are a big favorite. If
you want something light, you probably should eat before you come.
</P>
<P>
   The state could sell sky boxes. Let's think big here. How about
a football stadium with a retractable roof and making the guy the
halftime show?
</P>
<P>
   It would be just the thing for that depressing lull that sets in
for bored Texas sports fans after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, as execution-happy as we are in this state,
why doesn't somebody come up with a cable channel called the
Execution Channel? ``All gurneys, all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Me? I think I'll stick with Animal Planet.

 &HT;    Dancer's disdain, delight
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Edgar Degas had seen her, he would immediately have taken up
his paint brush or sculpting clay.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica swung her pink recital dress back and forth like a
wedding bell. With her pageboy cut swept up into an elegant French
twist, she looked the very portrait of the dainty young dancer.
</P>
<P>
   This effect had taken considerable effort _ a trip to the
hairdresser's complete with a public tantrum: ``I want to keep my
pinktails!'' But I knew in my heart it would all be for naught. No
amount of adorableness, I feared, would prevent her from ruining
the dance recital.
</P>
<P>
   I had tried to bail two weeks earlier, when Veronica was showing
no signs of getting with the program, quite literally, in her
creative movement classes at Jeraldyne's School of the Dance. While
all the other 4- and 5-year-olds struggled valiantly to learn their
routines, Veronica stared into space or twirled around,
ragdoll-limbed, in her idiosyncratic interpretive dance.
</P>
<P>
   I felt sorry for her teacher, Monnette Bariel. Here she was, a
world-class dancer with a world-renowned dance company, coping with
a recalcitrant 4-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think she ought to go through with the recital?'' I
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, she'll be fine,'' Monnette answered stoically. ``She's
coming along.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as I could tell, she was only ``coming along'' when one
of the other little dancers yanked her by the hand.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Veronica was one of the youngest and the
smallest, and that she had entered the class mid-year. Last
November, I had visited Jeraldyne's _ the teaching school of the
Dayton Contemporary Dance Company _ only days after the death of
founder Jeraldyne Blunden. Inspired by the grace and enthusiasm of
the young dancers, I decided to enroll Veronica, who always seemed
to be dancing to some inner beat.
</P>
<P>
   That, alas, proved to be the problem. When the other little
girls gamely pretended to be butterflies or trees, she pretended to
be a bunny rabbit. Or stared into space.
</P>
<P>
   The creative movement class, the youngest group of dancers, was
scheduled to perform first at Saturday's concert. They must have
been terrified, these pint-sized performers, as they skipped
onstage one at a time. Yet their faces blossomed into smiles, as
naturally as sunflowers to sunlight, when they hit the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   All of them, of course, except Veronica. She waited in the
wings. And waited.
</P>
<P>
   With a performer's true instinct _ or the instinct of a kind
heart _ the next little girl in line grabbed Veronica's hand, and
they skipped onstage hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P>
   The girl continued to mother-hen Veronica, patiently showing her
where to plant her feet. Their pas de deux _ the one dancer all
helpfulness, the other all stubborn cluelessness _ drew delighted
laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never told her to do that,'' Monnette said afterward of the
mission of mercy.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Monnette put Veronica onstage? Maybe it had something to
do with Jeraldyne Blunden _ with her determination and grit and the
freedom she gave her dancers to make choices. Monnette eulogized
Blunden as ``a mother figure to me.'' Other instructors paid
tribute to Blunden with a series of poems and reminiscences during
an annual student concert.
</P>
<P>
   When I picked my daughter up at intermission, Veronica was
oblivious that she had been anything less than the star of the
show. Which, in a sense, she had been. She stared up at me with her
deep brown eyes and pulled a carnation from her pocket. Her face
blossomed into a smile:
</P>
<P>
   ``My teacher gave me a flower.''

 &HT;    Growing privacy concerns sure to make issue a hot one this
election
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only time I fail to find my mailbox stuffed with junk mail
is on postal holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Most of my junk mail is flipped into the trash unopened. Most of
the rest also is junk mail that I open because it looks close
enough to personal mail that it tricks me.
</P>
<P>
   I admit that I must have caused this flood of junk mail by
occasionally buying merchandise out of catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of some kitchen knives several years ago brought
forth catalogs and offers featuring every item remotely associated
with knives or the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   More puzzling is how my private e-mail account also is filling
up with junk mail. I'm not sure how all these people find their way
to my personal e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   I have several e-mail addresses. I welcome messages from any and
all sent to my public e-mail addresses. But I also have a couple of
private e-mail addresses that I give out only to people I want to
contact me.
</P>
<P>
   How do people get their hands on my private e-mail addresses? I
don't know, but it gives me an eerie feeling that I'm being
watched.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Americans feel the same way. According to a New York
Times article by Richard L. Berke, both presidential political
parties and their candidates believe that privacy will emerge as
one of the big hot-button issues during the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Neil Newhouse said privacy ``tests off the
charts.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's pollster, Mark Penn, said privacy is ``a
pretty powerful groundswell.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush told Business Week, ``I'm a
privacy-rights person. The marketplace can function without
sacrificing the privacy of individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's recent speech at New York University
put privacy front and center. He said there is greater protection
for video rental receipts than for most intimate medical
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen cases where people's prescription drug histories are
sold freely to direct mail companies without their permission;
where hundreds of employees at an HMO have access to patients'
records,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, both presidential candidates and their parties are
going to try to claim the high ground when it comes to privacy.
</P>
<P>
   By 47 percent to 41 percent, Americans responding to a March
Gallup Poll believe Bush would do a better job protecting ordinary
citizens from privacy invasions.
</P>
<P>
   More than being upset with junk mail, both real and virtual,
polls show a growing number of Americans don't trust the keepers of
their financial and health records.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation moves more to wireless communications for personal
and business uses, Americans worry that their privacy will be
further eroded.
</P>
<P>
   I once wrote that I bought a frequency scanner for my car before
a long road trip that also picked up cell phone conversations,
which was a complete surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Reader response was swift and outraged, both at me for buying
and reporting on the device, and at the government for allowing the
public to purchase such an evil piece of equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, I had no idea that people felt so deeply about
their cell phone privacy, particularly when analog cell phone calls
are transmitted unscrambled and can be received on an inexpensive
frequency scanner easily purchased at electronic stores around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   These privacy anxieties have not escaped the political parties
that intend to promise all manner of government controls over
privacy invasions.
</P>
<P>
   When the candidates make their promises to pass laws to protect
privacy, voters need to make sure that the cure is not worse than
the disease.

   EDITORIAL-UN-WOMEN _ The year 2000 graduates have received their
diplomas and most schools are out for the summer. But 110 million
children never entered school this year_ two thirds of them girls.
That's one reason wny the United Nations meeting on women this
week, a follow- up to the 1995 Beijing conference, is so important.
(The Atlanta Constitution). 9.
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-GAMBLING _ Bet you didn't know there are more than 250
online casinos, 64 lotteries, 20 bingo games and 139 sports books
attracting suckers on the Internet. Legislation to ban this
activity passed the Senate in relatively good shape, but the
measure has collected harmful House amendments like a ship acquires
barnacles. House should start all over. (The Atlanta Constitution).

   MCCARTY-COLUMN _ It's true that Veronica was one of the youngest
and the smallest, and that she had entered the class mid-year. Last
November, I had visited Jeraldyne's _ the teaching school of the
Dayton Contemporary Dance Company _ only days after the death of
founder Jeraldyne Blunden. Inspired by the grace and enthusiasm of
the young dancers, I decided to enroll Veronica, who always seemed
to be dancing to some inner beat.(McCarty, Dayton Daily News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   NETHAWAY-COLUMN _ Puzzling is how my private e-mail account also
is filling up with junk mail. I'm not sure how all these people
find their way to my personal e-mail address. I have several e-mail
addresses. I welcome messages from any and all sent to my public
e-mail addresses. But I also have a couple of private e-mail
addresses that I give out only to people I want to contact me.
(NETHAWAY, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   KELSO-COLUMN _ Two weeks ago Michael ``Cowboy'' Toney tried to
sell five seats to his own execution on the Internet auction site
eBay.com. This is false advertising, because there are no seats in
the viewing room at the execution chamber in Huntsville. The
auction was on display only about four hours; eBay shut it down
before anybody bid on the alleged seats. Prison officials say that
even if someone had bought seats, they couldn't get in. (Kelso,
Austin American-Statesman) MOVED

   GECKOS _ WASHINGTON _ High-speed photography has revealed the
secret that allows gecko lizards to scurry up sheer walls or along
the underside of ceilings. Hundreds of millions of microscopic
hairs on the lizards' feet enable them to invoke a form of atomic
energy known as the ``van der Waals force.'' The force causes atoms
to cling to each other and enables geckos to cling to just about
anything. Berkeley University researchers describe their research
in the journal Nature on Thursday. (Nesmith, Cox News Service). 30.

   GRAPEVINE: News, notes from the wrestling industry
</P>
<P>
   By John Allen
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Last week Multichannel-Online reported that World Championship
Wrestling lost over $60 million last year and is on pace to lose
close to that amount this calendar year. Guess we know why
cost-cutter Bill Busch isn't around anymore. According to the
report, ``there was talk of SFX (Entertainment) wanting to buy a
stake in WCW, but a Time Warner official already went on record by
saying that WCW is not for sale. WCW President Brad Siegel couldn't
be reached for comment. It appears as if the negotiations with SFX
are merely for them to promote live WCW events. This would be WCW's
worst financial year as of yet if the projections hold up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers will probably hold because top stars such as Ric
Flair, Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan are finishing up guaranteed
contracts and television ratings are still lagging. The World
Wrestling Federation is only seven weeks away from topping WCW's
record of consecutive Monday night ratings' winners. Nitro held a
streak of 83 straight wins over RAW dating from 1996-1998.
</P>
<P>
   _ While WCW maybe losing its shirt, ECW star Sandman is losing
his pants. At last weekend's TNN tapings in Pensacola, Fla.,
Sandman was the last man to enter the ring in an eight-man tag
match (Steve Corino, Jack Victory, Scott Anton and Rhino vs. Raven,
Tommy Dreamer, Tajiri and Sandman). Sandman, whose gimmick involves
chugging and spilling a few beers on the way to the ring, appeared
drunk before he entered the ring, falling down and needing
assistance to get into the ring. The wrestlers in the ring came out
of character and laughed at Sandman. Sandman grabbed the microphone
and promised the crowd he'd flash them and did so a few times.
Raven and Dreamer got Sandman to put his pants back on and got him
out of the ring. As a result, Sandman is expected to be fined and
the Bayfront Auditorium, where the event was held, will not welcome
the return of ECW anytime soon. Of course it will make for
interesting editing for ECW executive producer Paul Heyman.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another wrestling tragedy happened last week. An independent
wrestling group, UWF, had a wrestler die from injuries suffered in
the ring Wednesday. According to The Union Leader of Concord, N.H.,
Mark Mendlan, 20, died as a result of severe neck and head
injuries. Mendlan, who wrestled as Kid Gorgeous, was dropped on his
head by his opponent, Ben Alcorn, who wrestles as the Dudeman.
Mendlan laid motionless in the ring for several minutes after
landing awkwardly from the gorilla press slam. He was rushed to an
area hospital where he was pronounced dead. The match was the first
professional match for Alcorn, who told UWF officials that he had
been involved in backyard matches for years and had trained with
UWF for three weeks. Mendlan started with UWF at 18 and came from
backyard wrestling matches.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you missed it the first time, NBC will re-run the Saturday
Night Live episode that was hosted by The Rock on Aug. 10. The show
was the highest rated SNL: episode of the year.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are in Arizona Saturday, you'll get a chance to see
former WWF star Shawn Michaels at the Diamondbacks' baseball game.
Michaels will be throwing out the first pitch before the game
against the Anaheim Angels.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of the Heartbreak Kid, HBK-TWA.com, the official Web
home of Shawn Michaels' Texas Wrestling Alliance, says it will hold
another TWA vs. ECW match featuring their champion against ECW
champ Justin Credible.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maybe he's changing his gimmick, but 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin
is scheduled to be on the Oprah Winfrey show on July 16th. The
title of the show is ``Live with the Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   _ She has seen her fame wane, but former WWF valet Rena Mero,
better known as Sable, will have an online chat with the Microsoft
Network on June 13 at 7 p.m. She is scheduled to talk about her
dedication to fitness, her new book and professional wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   _ On DustyRhodes.net, Rhodes says former WCW wrestler and
current Turnbuckle Championship Wrestler Ray Lloyd, a.k.a. Glacier,
will get a tryout with ECW.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spike Dudley says on his Website, SpikeDudley.net, that
reports of a five-year deal between Dudley and ECW's Heyman are
untrue. In fact Dudley, has been out of action for the last two
months with a knee injury and probably won't return until the fall.
He claims to have not talked to Heyman in weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ The rebuilt American Wrestling Association has signed a bit of
their past _ the Road Warriors. The first team to hold the AWA, NWA
and WWF tag team championships, the Road Warriors have been looking
for work since being let go by the WWF last winter.

   TRADE SHOWS SUFFER
</P>
<P>
   The shakeout and consolidation that is sweeping Internet
retailing has reached a related industry: Internet retailing trade
shows.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of layoffs, closings and executive layoffs at
Internet retailers, the publisher and show organizer, Faulkner &AMP;
Gray, has canceled its Internet Retailer World 2000 conference,
which was scheduled later this month in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt T. Peters, a group publisher at Faulkner &AMP; Gray, said that
Web trade shows were under the same pressures as Web retailers.
More narrowly focused shows, like automobile e-commerce
conferences, are now in favor, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the normal shakeout and consolidation you see in
any industry,'' Peters said. ``It's just happening faster on the
Internet because everything happens faster on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters said registration was still strong for another show,
Electronic Commerce World 2000, which his firm was planning for
October in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In another bad omen, the Internet Retailer World 2000 show had
also planned to feature some companies that are now in deep trouble
_ or out of business. ToySmart, the defunct Disney-backed toy Web
retailer, had agreed to send its chief e-commerce officer, Mark
Reese, to the show as a speaker. Executives from the struggling
companies CDNow and Skymall.com, were among other officials who had
originally agreed to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as another confirmation that there's a problem in the
e-commerce segment,'' said Richard Smith, an Internet consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Smith knows this first-hand. In February, he agreed to speak at
Internet Retailer World 2000 about balancing marketing needs with
customer privacy. But in mid-May, he received a letter from the
organizers saying the show had been canceled because not enough
people had signed up.

   SALON RELENTS AND REDESIGNS
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to soothe ruffled readers, the online magazine Salon.com
completed its product recall last week.
</P>
<P>
   Salon pulled back the site redesign, which had elicited an
immediate and hearty chorus of e-mail boos and hisses from readers
after it was introduced on May 22. The disgruntled audience said
the new site included bugs, was hard to navigate and used type that
was too small to read.
</P>
<P>
   Within two days, Salon's editor, David Talbot, posted a note to
readers saying he had heard their wails and was taking the concerns
into consideration. Then, last Thursday, came another note from
Talbot, entitled ``Salon to readers: you win!'' and introducing a
new new design that addressed many of the readers' criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   The new five-column look remains in place, but the third and
fourth columns effectively serve as a single column to showcase a
feature article. Type sizes can be controlled by readers, and
headlines for the main articles once again link directly to the
reports, rather than taking readers through department home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said the magazine in its latest guise had accomplished
the goals of promoting breaking news from news services while also
featuring more of Salon's own content. But he said the latest
overhaul had also removed the bugs and eliminated some of the
``horizontal sprawl'' that one reader complained about in the May
22 redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Talbot said the ``ear splitting'' response had indicated how
deeply the readership was attached to the magazine. ``We
unwittingly turned our readers into a focus group,'' he said,
noting a lesson for any future redesigns. ``Maybe we'll test it out
a little internally first.''

WARNED BY THE MUSIC INDUSTRY, WEB SITE FILES SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a lawsuit that legal experts say may have
broad implications for all Internet search engines, a music Web
site has sued the recording industry to retain the ability to link
to music files even though some of the works may be pirated
material.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed late Friday in Federal District Court in San
Jose, brings to a boil a simmering dispute between MP3Board.com
Inc., a 12-employee music search engine in Santa Cruz, Calif., and
the Recording Industry Association of America, which represents the
major record labels.
</P>
<P>
   MP3Board.com runs a search engine focused on finding MP3 files.
The company's lawsuit asked Judge Ronald M. Whyte to declare that
MP3Board.com should not be held liable for copyright infringement
if it provided results of an automated search that might include
pirated copyrighted works.
</P>
<P>
   The Recording Industry Association of America, which has
complained to MP3Board.com, says that results of its searches turn
up hundreds of links to pirated songs.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Rosen, the president of the association, said in an
interview on Monday that the Web site is abetting music pirates by
aggressively pointing people to copyrighted music. On May 25, the
association sent a cease-and-desist letter to MP3board.com, saying
that if the site was not disabled by June 2, or all of the
offending links removed, then the association would consider taking
additional legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts say the case has profound implications because the
association is seeking to hold MP3board.com liable for linking to
copyrighted material produced during an automated Web search. If
the court embraces that reasoning, search engines in general could
find themselves liable for providing such links whether to music,
literature, movies or other works _ said Mark F. Radcliffe, a
copyright lawyer with the Palo Alto, Calif., law firm of Gray Cary
Ware &AMP; Freidenrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is right in the back yard of the major search engines,
and if the decision goes the wrong way it's going to affect Yahoo
and Excite(at)home very directly,'' Radcliffe said, adding the case
touches on issues copyright lawyers have been struggling with. ``It
goes right to the heart of the way the Web works.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen declined to discuss whether her group considered
MP3board.com similar to other search engines, or whether the
efforts to pursue the actions of MP3board.com had implications for
other search engines. ``I'm not going to put our legal theories''
in the newspaper, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lars Mapstead, chief executive of MP3board.com, said his company
kept an index of roughly 500,000 songs its automated search engine
has culled from the Web. He said it would be prohibitive to go
through every link provided by an automated search engine and
determine whether or not it was a pirated work. ``I would literally
have to listen to every song,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said activity is no different than other search engines,
except with a different focus, and he said that he suspects that
the industry association was going after his company because it was
small and did not have deep pockets like bigger search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright experts and the entertainment industry are already
struggling with the issue of linking and providing access to
pirated copyrighted works. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act of
1998 provides some ``safe harbor'' provisions that prevent search
engines and Internet service providers from being held liable for
some content posted on their services, but not all the provisions
have been tested or refined in court. In a case that touches on
some of the same issues, the movie industry has sought to prevent a
Web site, ``2600: The Hacker Quarterly,'' from posting links to
other sites that offer software that allows users to copy DVD
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Ira P. Rothken, a lawyer representing MP3Board.com, said that if
the association succeeded in taking his client off the Internet for
linking to copyrighted material, it could ``lead to paralysis on
the Internet because automation would become meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the effect could reach much further on the Web. At the
major search engines, he said, ``a human being would have to go
through every single file.''

CELEBRITIES RUSHING TO CASH IN THEIR FAME ON THE DOT-COM BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott, former stars of
the San Francisco 49ers, were there. So was Keyshawn Johnson, the
outspoken New York Jets wide receiver who was recently traded to
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
</P>
<P>
   So it was no surprise that dozens of venture capitalists and
various other boys of Silicon Valley were giddily gathering around
their Sunday afternoon heroes seeking autographs and exchanging
backslaps.
</P>
<P>
   But the fawning was mutual at the Fairmont Hotel here, where an
all-star roster of football and baseball players gathered one rainy
afternoon in February for the annual meeting of Champion Ventures,
an investment fund set up for pro athletes. The jocks may not have
seemed as starstruck, but they were eager to be there, too, seeking
a piece of the dot-com action and hoping a little Silicon Valley
magic would rub off on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I want equity,'' said Johnson, eyeing his agent warily
across the ballroom. ``I don't want to be just the guy with the
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about convergence. For all the buzzwords about the future
melding of high-technology, multimedia and telecommunications, the
real buzz these days has more to do with the coming together of
Silicon Valley money and the culture of celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that little extra cachet,'' said Kevin Fong, a venture
capitalist with the Mayfield Fund who hopes big-name athletes will
give the companies he has helped foster an advantage. ``Everyone is
jaded. They want a hot company right on the fine edge. Celebrities
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Silicon Valley is beginning to resemble Hollywood, chalk it
up to more than the Spago's in downtown Palo Alto. A parade of
agents and celebrities have been making the pilgrimage to the
Valley in recent months in the hope of using their fame to cash in
on the dot-com boom. The days, it seems, of demanding simply a
paycheck for a product endorsement are passe. Now celebrities
expect to be  &UR; owners &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the peculiarities of the Internet phenomenon has made
all that possible. Web companies that need instant branding but
have little cash on hand can offer the lure of stock options and
potential market riches. And who better than a movie star or
athlete to help them? Especially considering the success of William
Shatner, the former Star Trek icon, who received 125,000 stock
options _ worth millions today _ to pitch for Priceline.com. Or
Cindy Crawford who became the name and face of fashion retailer
Estyle for a stake in the company and a seat on the board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood agents are getting into the act, carving out a
niche in the lucrative new media trade. The Creative Artists Agency
has teamed up with Idealab, the Pasadena, Calif.-based creator of
online ventures like Etoys, to build entertainment sites for the
agency's clients. And that doesn't even begin to factor in what
will happen when large media and entertainment companies catch up.
Then the lines between e-commerce, sports and entertainment will
blur further.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies are realizing that entertainment might help
them get above the clutter,'' said John Mass, vice president of
corporate advisory new media, at the William Morris Agency in Los
Angeles. ``There is finally a role for media and entertainment
having an effect on technology.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, venture capitalists are beginning to act a little
more like Hollywood agents. ``To the extent Hollywood is about
access, we have it,'' said Fong. And agents, who control the
talent, are beginning to think more like dot-com venture
capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone would know, Mass of William Morris would. For eight
years, Mass, a former investment banker, has headed the new media
group there, a talent agency known more for its roster of movie
stars than its corporate accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Several clients _ including Lucent Technologies and Anheuser
Busch _ have knocked on his door recently to help execute their new
media strategies. In particular, he said, William Morris arranged a
meeting between executives at SportsLine.com and Intel Corp. before
SportsLine went public. As a result, Intel made a 4.9 percent
investment in the company. ``This gave SportsLline the halo of a
technology company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But William Morris has been equally active is matching up stars
with Internet companies. Last September, an agent introduced Robert
Levitan, the chief executive and co-founder of Flooz.com, which
offers on-line gift certificates for retail Internet sites, to
Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Everyone realizes there is no longer a distinction
between marketing, branding and the experience,'' Levitan said.
``Because we had no brand equity we needed to put brand attributes
around the product and service. Hollywood definitely wants a piece
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Levitan was looking for a spokesperson for Flooz. Goldberg, the
star of ``Sister Act'' and a past host for the Oscars ceremony, was
perfect for the role. She ``speaks to all groups, men, women,
blacks, whites,'' Levitan said. A 15-minute conversation turned
into an hour. And within a week, she had signed a contract and was
shooting print ads _ becoming in the process the third-largest
shareholder in the company. (Neither Levitan nor Goldberg would
disclose how many options in the still-private company she holds.)
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew what he was talking about and I was ready to start,''
Goldberg said in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But she has influence with more than consumers. Levitan said
Flooz.com, which is based in New York, recently signed a contract
with BarnesandNoble.com to offer Flooz gift certificates. But
BarnesandNoble.com was slow to follow through on the details. So he
asked Goldberg to give the executive in charge a nudge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had her call and the secretary was more than a little
surprised,'' Levitan said. ``It sounds like her,'' he said the
secretary whispered to her boss. It was just enough to get the
company moving on the project. Besides, Goldberg said, ``I think it
helped him understand that this was not just a gig for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, what could be better than having a hard-to-reach
celebrity on call? In January, Levitan made the 45-minute ride to
Goldberg's home outside New York to show her the coming year's
marketing plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Valentine's Day?'' Levitan said she asked him. He
had no commercials in the works. ``I have time next Tuesday,'' she
told him.
</P>
<P>
   For Goldberg the experience, so far, has been worthwhile.
``People say, `Why did you do it?''' she said. ``I pay homage to
William Shatner because he made it viable to go to folks like me.
It was an opportunity to make a little dough.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she added, it relieves some of the pressure of relying
solely on movies as a source of income. ``It doesn't make you feel
bad you didn't have a huge opening weekend,'' Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   But access to celebrities can only enhance success; it doesn't
guarantee it. Silicon Valley and Hollywood have a lot to offer each
other, said Dan Case, chairman of Chase H&AMP;Q. The convergence of
technology and media is real. But, he warned, ``there is a growing
numbness, a disconnectedness from reality.''
</P>
<P>
   James Breyer, a partner at venture firm Accel Partners in Palo
Alto, agreed. He has talked to a number of celebrities looking to
either dot-com themselves or find a company looking for a
spokesperson. ``Today I can't tell you whether it will pay off,''
said Breyer. ``Anyone who has spent time putting these kinds of
deals together realizes it is really hard.''
</P>
<P>
   One concern is that in the crush to cash in on the star of the
moment, business plans will be poorly thought out. Just because a
person knows how to pose for a camera, for example, doesn't mean
they know anything about building a Web business. Actors, too, are
on location for months on end and may underestimate how much work
it takes to help create a brand. And while it may be great fun to
hang out with Joe Montana, Breyer said, ``it is just as important
to talk about an idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Still that doesn't deter the likes of Calvin C. Lui, the
28-year-old chief executive of Theman.com, a shopping and lifestyle
Web site for men. He recently hired Karen Sortito, a Hollywood
marketing executive from Sony Pictures Entertainment as his chief
marketing officer, and was at the Champion Ventures meeting,
picking up business cards, hoping that one of the athletes would be
interested in his site and willing to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he has had no takers. But Montana is a wine drinker, he
mused, and maybe would be interested in writing a column about
different vintages. But why not just hire a professional wine
columnist? Lui grinned and sighed, as if pointing out the obvious.
``If Joe has a site there,'' he said, ``it will be read because it
is Joe.''

CISCO, FOX TRANSMIT DIGITAL FILM ACROSS INTERNET TO THEATER IN 
ATLANTA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On Tuesday, for the first time, a Hollywood movie
will be digitally transmitted across the country over the Internet
and then digitally projected to a cinema audience, going from the
studio in Hollywood to a theater in Atlanta without ever touching
film, officials at 20th Century Fox Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc.
said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to demonstrate the potential of digital
distribution, which many believe will one day supplant traditional
canisters of celluloid, and to allow Fox to have the world premiere
of its new animated feature, ``Titan A.E.,'' at Atlanta's Supercomm
trade show on Tuesday. The film, a space adventure that combines
three-dimensional, computer-generated images with traditional
animation, is scheduled to open in theaters on June 16. Cisco makes
networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Digital projectors have been used sporadically in the last year
to exhibit a few films in a handful of theaters around the country
_ Disney's ``Dinosaur'' is one _ and video images have been
streaming across the Internet, with varying success, for a long
time. But, Fox and Cisco officials said, this will be the first
time the two processes have been combined in a demonstration of the
kind of digital distribution network that may replace film in
coming years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such cutting-edge applications using the Internet not only
revolutionize movie creation and distribution, but will drive
innovation in myriad other industries as well,'' said Larry Lang,
vice president for service provider marketing at Cisco. ``Just as
the Internet has enabled industries of all kinds to increase
flexibility, decrease costs, and explore new opportunities, digital
cinema has the potential to bring great benefits to the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Cisco's latest technology, ``Titan A.E.'' will be
electronically hurled from Qwest Communication Inc.'s CyberCenter
in Burbank to the Woodruff Arts Center in Atlanta, where it will be
projected on a Barco/Texas Instruments DLP Cinema digital
projector.
</P>
<P>
   How long it might be before such digital distribution is common
is an open question. Two major issues have been slowing the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the price. Cinema owners are reluctant to pay an
estimated $100,000 per projector when the bulk of the savings will
go to the movie studios, which will be freed from the costs of
making thousands of prints and shipping them around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue is the fear among many in Hollywood that once
their films are loosed upon the Internet, they will be subject to
the same kinds of piracy that have plagued the music industry in
recent months. As a result, both Fox and Cisco stressed the
security precautions they would be using with the Cisco 7140
Virtual Private Network, a method for isolating and protecting data
traveling across the internet, including fire walls, security
routers and encryption devices.

SOME RETAILERS GO AGAINST THE GRAIN IN INTEGRATING ONLINE
OPERATIONS 
 BY BOB TEDESCHI  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the term ``clicks and mortar'' first made the rounds
last year, traditional retailers have repeated the phrase with
mind-numbing regularity, vowing to anyone within earshot that by
integrating their Web operations into their physical stores they
would eventually bury the Internet-only merchants.
</P>
<P>
   So one might forgive the tax lawyers of some of these
traditional retailers for being slightly confused. Even as these
companies preach the gospel of Internet integration to the public,
some of the best-known merchants are telling government regulators
that their Internet and physical-world operations are distinct and
separate businesses _ and therefore should enjoy the tax advantages
of maintaining separate operations.
</P>
<P>
   Those advantages are sizeable. Like catalog companies,
Internet-only businesses can sell to customers in any state but are
required to collect sales tax only in the states where they have a
physical presence _ a company headquarters, for instance, or
warehouse. For Web merchants, the rules regarding physical presence
_ or nexus, in tax parlance _ can also be set in motion in states
where the merchants operate Internet server computers, or even
backup servers.
</P>
<P>
   But traditional retailers have a problem. If they integrate
their physical stores and their Internet operations, they run the
risk of causing a nexus in every state where they have a store and
must then collect a sales tax in that state _ even for sales on the
Internet. And the more their stores act as agents for the Web sites
_ by accepting merchandise returns in their stores for purchases
made on the Web, for example, or promoting their Internet sites
within the bricks-and-mortar stores _ the greater the chances that
states will require them to collect sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   When these merchants do charge sales tax, not only do they often
lose price battles against pure e-tailers; they must also invest in
high-price tax software, so they can calculate, collect and then
disburse sales taxes for nearly every purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Bricks-and-mortar retailers, of course, are fighting the tax
codes with every nickel of lobbying money they can scrape together,
saying that tax laws unfairly favor Internet retailers. And despite
the fact that the House recently voted to extend a moratorium on
new Internet taxes, the earthbound retailers are hopeful that the
Senate will modify the legislation so that all Web merchants could
be required to collect state sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers are approaching Internet sales taxes in
widely varying ways. Some, like Wal-Mart and the bookseller
Borders, are being particularly aggressive. In both cases, the Web
sites charge sales tax only in the few states where the companies
have actual Internet operations _ even though they allow goods
bought on the Web to be returned to all of their stores and even
though they promote their sites within the stores.
</P>
<P>
   Some tax analysts say such an approach is pushing the boundaries
of tax law in some states, even if a separate corporate division is
handling the dot-com side of the business. But according to Rich
Fahle, a Borders spokesman, ``Every lawyer we've spoken to said
we're legally in the clear. And our competitors aren't charging tax
online either, so that would put us at a serious competitive
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Borders' big competitor, Barnes &AMP; Noble, has spun off
its dot-com operations into a separate company,
Barnesandnoble.com's sales tax practices are similar to
Amazon.com's and other pure Internet retailers.
</P>
<P>
   One industry executive said Wal-Mart might be inviting a court
case _ something he said he would welcome, ``so we could all get
some clarity on this issue and maybe level the playing field'' for
non-Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Les Copeland, a Wal-Mart spokesman, declined to ``speak to
someone else's theory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we approached this,'' Copeland said, ``we just looked at
how other dot-com companies were structured, and we set up
Wal-Mart.com similar to the other dot-com companies.'' He said that
to keep things at arm's length, Wal-Mart stores serve as a
contractor to Wal-Mart.com, when it comes to accepting product
returns from the Web site's customers.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers that have set up separate companies for their
online stores are taking a more conservative approach. Kmart,
which, in league with Softbank Venture Partners, founded
Bluelight.com as a separate business, is one example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we charging taxes? Absolutely,'' said Mark H. Goldstein,
Bluelight's chief executive. ``Did we buy an expensive software
package to do that? Absolutely. Do we think it's right? Absolutely
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein said the company might become more aggressive about
taxes later this year, ``when we can focus on this issue more
clearly and directly.'' But for now, ``there are municipalities
that are counting on this money,'' he said. ``We don't want to be
the lightening rod for holding back revenues. We don't want to do
anything that's illegal. And we don't want to alienate communities
where Kmart has stores.''
</P>
<P>
   And although charging sales tax can put his company at a pricing
disadvantage, Goldstein said that gap was narrowing because
Internet-only retailers have been slowly raising their prices in an
effort to make a profit. ``It was a larger issue when the dot-coms
were being subsidized'' by venture capitalists, he said. ``That's
disappearing quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   For other traditional retailers, the advantages of integrating
business units far outweigh the sales tax hit. ``Spinning off a
piece of the company just detracts from the overall business,''
said Ken Weil, vice president of new media for Victoria's Secret, a
unit of the Limited Inc. ``I recently talked to one company that
separated the businesses,'' Weil said. ``They put their URL on the
shopping bag in stores, and the stores division wanted to charge
the Internet division. They got bogged down in a channel
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Secret charges sales tax on its Web site in any state
that has a sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, Weil said, there is no evidence that Victoria's
Secret is rankling consumers who might have expected tax-free
Internet shopping. ``We get hundreds of customer service contacts a
week,'' he said, ``and taxation never comes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil acknowledged that because his site sells only goods bearing
the Victoria's Secret brand, customers are essentially unable to
engage in price-comparison shopping, as happens with many other
kinds of retailing sites. But according to a recent report by
Jupiter Communications, an Internet research firm, even among goods
that consumers can buy from multiple retailers, sales tax is less
an issue than many retailers may believe.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of 1,600 online shoppers, Jupiter found that when
shopping for goods priced $50 or less, only 29 percent of
respondents said they would consider rejecting the purchase if the
retailer charged sales tax. That number climbed to 41 percent for
goods over $100.
</P>
<P>
   So from a tax standpoint, companies should avoid integrating
their Internet and existing retail operations ``only if they're
selling high-priced, commodity products, like computers,'' said Ken
Cassar, a Jupiter analyst. ``Otherwise, the opportunities for
serving customers and promoting the site are big enough that even
if you do have to charge tax, they're well worth it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cassar noted that 42 percent of those surveyed said that, if
given the option, they would want to return products purchased
online to the Web site's affiliated store _ an option that, for
most retailers, includes charging a sales tax to Internet
customers.
</P>
<P>
   That logic is not lost on Kent Anderson, president of
Macy's.com, which tightly integrates the Web site and physical
stores, in areas like inventory management and marketing. And it
charges sales tax in any state with Web operations or Macy stores,
which are owned by Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just completed some research which told us that the ability
to take merchandise back to the store is a key element for our
customers,'' he said. ``It came out as No. 1 or 2 in almost every
customer feedback session.''
</P>
<P>
   And sales tax? ``It was not an issue,'' Anderson said.
</P>

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Huey is a magazine editor known for his Southern
charm and pit-bull mentality: when he has an idea between his
teeth, he might be pleasant about it, but he will never let go.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Huey, managing editor of Fortune magazine,
decided that Time Inc. ought to start or purchase a magazine about
Internet business. He flew to San Francisco and met with editors
and publishers at The Industry Standard, Red Herring and Business
2.0, deciding who or what or whether to buy. No luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to see if there was a way that we each could satisfy
the other's goals, and we basically decided we could not,'' Huey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since he could not buy 'em, he joined 'em. The result is
E-Company Now, a new monthly magazine from Time Inc. that Huey said
cost less to start ``than it would have ever cost to pay the
Internet multiples everyone was asking for.''
</P>
<P>
   With the first issue, released three weeks ago, Huey and his
editors jumped, some would say belatedly, into a fray of magazines
that besides The Standard and Red Herring includes titles like
Upside, Fast Company and _ take a deep breath _ the newly
rechristened Ziff-Davis Smart Business for the New Economy.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the dot-com advertising boom to last forever.
What's more, Huey must keep E-Company Now from leeching content
from Fortune, its inspirational parent.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this daunts Huey. ``I'm relatively confident this is
going to work,'' he said in an interview last week from his home in
Atlanta. (Huey prefers to commute to work from Georgia most weeks
than to live in New York City.) ``We figured out about two years
ago that the whole Internet story was moving out of the realm of
being a tech story alone. But we never wanted Fortune to drill down
so deep into the subject that it became a magazine just about the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Company Now may soon have something else going for it that the
other magazines do not, words that would make any Internet-magazine
mogul's heart go pitter-pat: America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other magazines in the field do not have the benefit
of Time Inc.'s expertise in consumer magazines or the marketing
clout of AOL, which has given the magazine special placement on
choice CompuServe, AOL and Netscape sites. So far, those sites have
generated more than 30,000 subscriptions, said Ned Desmond, editor
in chief of E-Company Now.
</P>
<P>
   Huey said the advantages of Time Inc.'s backing were obvious.
``We are not running around trying to raise a new round of
financing or preparing an IPO,'' he said. ``We're running around
trying to get the best editors and writers we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, most of the magazines about Internet business _ even
those that are still raising financing and preparing initial public
offerings _ are thriving and expanding. Business 2.0, which is
published by Imagine Media in San Francisco, shifted from a monthly
to a twice-a-month publication three issues ago.
</P>
<P>
   Red Herring, published by Red Herring Communications, will do
the same in November; its June issue is 628 pages. Ad pages for The
Industry Standard, the weekly from IDG, are up almost 500 percent
against last year and have almost surpassed those of People
magazine. Its issues often reach 360 pages, including both
advertising and editorial material.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the magazines have been buoyed by the fact that the
market for advertising pages promoting dot-com companies has grown
exponentially the last three years. In 1997, online, Internet and
e-commerce companies spent $113.2 million in advertising in
American magazines, according to Competitive Media Reporting.
Spending climbed to $153.6 million in 1998 and then surged to
$687.3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the tide has shifted in recent months, as some of the
speculative excess in technology and Internet stocks has subsided;
many of those advertisers can no longer afford to spend so freely
and no longer need to reach the venture capitalists who thumb
through the Internet magazines. Rich LeFurgy, chairman of the
Internet Advertising Bureau, said the flow of dot-com advertising
would soon abate and probably fall steeply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shift is toward more moderated spending and more effective
spending,'' LeFurgy said. ``You were getting to absurd lengths with
some of these magazines as it was. They were getting out of control
in terms of the number of ad pages relative to editorial. That will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey said he had already thought of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not naive about advertising,'' he said. ``We have along
with the dot-com advertising, consumer advertising and business
advertising, liquor, cars, fashion. Yes, we will take every dot-com
ad that can pay for it, but our business plan is not built on
soaking up an ever-growing pool of dot-com advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The real battle among the Internet magazines may play out not in
terms of advertising pages, but in the more mundane sphere of
old-fashioned circulation. While some of the Internet business
magazines have significant circulations, most remain fairly small.
Ziff-Davis Smart Business for the New Economy has a circulation of
1,048,941, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations, but that
was all gained when the magazine was still known as PC Computing.
(Ziff-Davis repositioned the magazine to a business-strategy
magazine with the May issue.) Fast Company's circulation is
402,603, according to the circulation bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But the rest of the magazines have circulations closer to that
of Model Railroader, and many give away the bulk of their
subscriptions free.
</P>
<P>
   Upside, which is not audited by the Audit Bureau of
Circulations, reports circulation of 257,000, of which 15,000 are
paid. Gini Talmadge, president of Upside Media, said that the
subscriptions were given away to qualified readers, meaning readers
who have filled out a survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``So our subscriber list reads like a Who's Who of the
Internet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Industry Standard, which also is not audited by the Audit
Bureau of Circulations, gives away half of its weekly 150,000
circulation to qualified subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Huey said that competition like The Industry Standard, Business
2.0 or Red Herring was not a threat to his new magazine, which has
guaranteed advertisers a circulation of 200,000 readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Industry Standard says they are a must-read for anybody
doing business on the Internet,'' Huey said. ``If that's true, why
does it have a circulation of 150,000 and half of it they give
away? They are the hot trade book. And that's a very good position
to have. But look at us. We want to be a national business magazine
that is informed by the Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Weber, editor in chief of The Industry Standard, does
not dispute the circulation figures. But he said paid circulation
was growing ``at a healthy pace'' and that ``substantial
increases'' would be announced soon. He dismissed Huey's other
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   There are potential pitfalls for Huey's and Desmond's magazine.
Editors of competing magazines are quick to criticize Time Inc. for
coming late to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two years late to the party,'' said James Daly,
editor in chief of Business 2.0. ``They have to do something that
other magazines are not doing, and there's not a lot of space
left.''
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem is that E-Company Now is a monthly
title in a field that is now almost exclusively on weekly or
twice-a-month schedules.. But Huey said the magazine's Web site,
with its daily columnists and a business-to-business component,
would help keep readers plugged in. He suggested that the shift to
twice-a-month publication by Business 2.0 and Red Herring was part
of a strategy to get more advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems pretty obvious to me what that's about,'' he said.
``Our argument is that they are not doing the frequency thing for
the reader.''
</P>
<P>
   About Huey's theory, Ted Gramkow, publisher of Red Herring,
said, ``I don't think so.'' He countered, ``This is John Huey's
way, and Fortune and Time Warner's way, of attracting dollars that
have been beyond their high price in Fortune. This is a pure
advertising play.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it would be hard for any publisher to argue that
readers want even more Internet magazines. But the titles continue
to proliferate. Business 2.0 is introducing an as-yet-unnamed
offshoot in October, a business lifestyle magazine whose editor in
chief is a former editor of Harper's Bazaar and In Style.
</P>
<P>
   The former publisher of Office Products International is
introducing line56, an Internet-business magazine whose title was
inspired by the famous soliloquy in Act III of Shakespeare's
``Hamlet,'' that begins with the words ``To be or not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   IDG, The Industry Standard's parent company, has just introduced
Darwin: Business Evolving in the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting to be way too much for me,'' LeFurgy of the
Internet Advertising Bureau said. ``I have total information
anxiety. The magazines just stack up and stack up in my office
now.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Several years ago, with tongue only
partially planted in cheek, Intel's chairman, Andrew Grove, made an
observation: Unlike the chip industry, where processing speeds
double every 18 months or so, the moribund telecommunications world
seemed to double its speed only about once a century.
</P>
<P>
   But here on a test bench at Agilent Technologies is clear
evidence that may give lie to Grove's Law _ evidence that the
nation's communications networks could be poised for sweeping
improvements in speed and efficiency that could rival the breakneck
pace of breakthroughs in the chip industry.
</P>
<P>
   Using inexpensive high-speed semiconductor components, lasers
and mirrors, a small group of Agilent researchers have fashioned a
palm-size device capable of shuttling data at 10 billion bits _ or
10 gigabits _ a second.
</P>
<P>
   And the Agilent device, known as a transceiver, does not rely on
the costly, complex optical-network formats that telephone
companies and Internet backbone carriers typically require to
achieve such transmission speeds. Instead, the device uses a new
souped-up version of the homely Ethernet format that has been the
simple, reliable mainstay of office computer networks for nearly
three decades.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not your father's Ethernet; it is Ethernet 3,000
thousand times as fast as the original versions. At the rate the
technology is evolving, some analysts expect office desktop
computers to soon have access to data networks with speed and power
formerly available only in the nation's best research laboratories
_ but at prices no higher than today's standard business-office
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has caught the world by surprise,'' said Waguih Ishak,
director of Agilent's communications and optical research
laboratory. ``Three years ago, very few people were talking about
one-gigabit Ethernet. And people were laughing at us when we talked
about 10-gigabit optical networking.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is laughing at Agilent now, or at the other companies
developing new Ethernet technologies. A mad dash is under way as
dozens of start-ups and established giants race to put the
27-year-old Ethernet networking standard on an ever faster
price-performance improvement curve.
</P>
<P>
   While 10-gigabit Ethernet transceivers remain mainly at the
testing stage, one-gigabit transceivers are already becoming the
preferred way to link the new optical switches that are becoming
the standard way to route information over the Internet. (Optical
components use flashes of laser light, rather than electronic
pulses, to convey the on-off semaphore of digital information.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of our one-gigabit transceivers will fall below $5 by
2004,'' said Brian E. Lemoff, an Agilent designer. That number is
significant because $5 is roughly the current price of a
100-megabit Ethernet transceiver _ one capable of moving data at
only 100 million bits a second.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts and executives say the rapid improvements in
Ethernet _ and the resulting increase in bandwidth, or transmission
speeds, of fiber optic networks _ could bring a frenzied pace of
change to the telecommunications world similar to the
microprocessor chip's revolutionary impact on the computer industry
in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of all of this is the cost of optical components is
now following the same declining cost curve that drove the
semiconductor industry,'' said Geoff Baehr, chief network officer
of Sun Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   As prices plunge for the new high-speed Ethernet, it could
become what economists call a disruptive technology _ one that
forces established data communications companies to alter their
business models, while creating lucrative new opportunities for
fast-moving start-up companies. And the victims of the disruptive
technology, according to the data-networking upstarts, will be the
nation's giant telephone companies, which have large investments to
protect in more costly and complex telecommunications and voice
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet engineers now routinely cite Clayton M. Christensen's
thesis about the power of so-called disruptive technologies in his
book ``The Innovator's Dilemma'' (Harvard Business School Press,
1997).
</P>
<P>
   ``Gigabit Ethernet is a totally disruptive technology that until
recently looked like a toy'' to the telephone companies, said David
Isenberg, an industry consultant and a former AT&AMP;T engineer. ``Now
it's going to eat their lunch before they have time to turn
around.''
</P>
<P>
   That role reversal has not escaped Robert Metcalfe, a
co-inventor of the original three-megabit Ethernet standard at
Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at the telephone companies have all read
Christensen's book by now,'' Metcalfe said, ``but they're like deer
caught in the headlights.''
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications executives, of course, take a dim view of
such hyperbole. They note that established network companies have
ready access to Ethernet technology, and will not hesitate to use
it. They also contend that many of the keys to better networks have
less to do with pushing technical boundaries in the laboratory than
with mundane issues like obtaining rights of way for fiber optic
cables and cellular towers.
</P>
<P>
   And the big companies may not be as beholden to their installed
network equipment as the upstarts may assume, according to David C.
Nagle, AT&AMP;T's chief technology officer and president of AT&AMP;T Labs.
</P>
<P>
   ``New players do have an advantage,'' Nagle said. ``But
increasingly, we and everyone else are learning how to respond
quickly to these disruptive technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The new players include aggressive start-ups like Yipes
Communications of San Francisco, which is building a nationwide
data-networking service based on a gigabit Ethernet optical
network. Users, primarily business customers, could use it for any
number of current and future high-speed applications, possibly
including combined voice and data communications and TV-quality
video.
</P>
<P>
   Yipes has raised almost $91 million from venture capitalists and
partners and plans to sell Internet connection services in more
than 20 metropolitan regions in the United States by the end of the
year. The company has moved quickly by leasing unused fibers from
other companies and assembling networks in the nation's largest
metropolitan areas. Early customers include the Silicon Valley law
firm of Fenwick &AMP; West, the Palo Alto Medical Foundation and Front
Range Internet, a Colorado Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The company says it can give customers connections over optical
fiber networks at data speeds from one megabit to one gigabit using
Ethernet _ and can do so while significantly underpricing its
traditional telecommunications industry competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To compete, they are going to have to cannibalize their
existing customer base,'' said Jerry Parrick, chief executive of
Yipes and a former telecommunications industry executive who has
run data networking businesses at the regional telephone companies
Pacific Bell and U S West.
</P>
<P>
   According to an estimate by the Del'Orro Group, a
telecommunications market research firm in Portola Valley, Calif.,
the hardware cost for conventional networking equipment at the
OC-192 standard _ the optical network format used by phone
companies _ was $6,783 for each gigabit. That compares with $350
for a 10-gigabit optical Ethernet connection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes so much sense because we are able to avoid the
multiple layers of what is in effect scar tissue'' in telephone
companies' networks, said Eric Benamou, chairman and chief
executive of the 3Com Corp. 3Com was the company Metcalfe founded
to commercialize the Ethernet standard in in the 1970s; he left in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Ethernet was a simple data standard for
letting groups of computers communicate within a single office
building, or at most an office-park campus, at a top speed of 10
million bits a second. But improvements in the technology now allow
for Ethernet networks of speeds of 10 billion bits a second,
reaching some 30 miles. As a result, Ethernet has become
competitive with the main network techniques now used by the big
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   Those techniques include asynchronous transfer mode, which
supports speeds from 1.5 megabits to the gigabit range. Another is
a format known as synchronous optical network, or Sonet (pronounced
like the short-verse form), which supports data rates ranging from
51 megabits up to nearly 2.5 gigabits.
</P>
<P>
   The main advantage that asynchronous transfer and Sonet hold
over Ethernet is that they offer rich network management _ software
that enables engineers to carefully control and monitor
communications traffic, be it voice or data. Ethernet provides for
only skimpy network management, although many companies are working
on more robust management software packages for use with Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, Ethernet is much more flexible than
asynchronous transfer or Sonet. Executives at Yipes, for example,
say they will have a significant advantage over the data services
offered by traditional telecommunications companies because the
Yipes network administrators will be able to dial the amount of
bandwidth a customer receives, up or down, quickly on demand.
</P>
<P>
   This flexibility might permit a small Web site, for example, to
add capacity quickly and temporarily for a special event, or make
it possible for an individual in an office to set up a high-quality
teleconferencing connection for a short period.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of flexibility, the biggest advantage of the new
gigabit Ethernet services like Yipes could be the ability to add
each new customer to the network with an industry-standard Ethernet
connector _ similar to the small circuit boards or plug-in devices
that already enable a new PC to be quickly added to an office
network or allow a consumer's home computer to be attached to the
local cable television system. Telephone companies typically have a
much more complicated task in determining how best to connect each
new data customer to the local network.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes it a seamless interconnection,'' said Michael
Kleeman, chief technology officer of Aerie Networks, a broadband
network start-up in Denver, which plans to use Ethernet technology.
``There are no additional boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   The most bitter struggle between the new Ethernet data
networking upstarts and the traditional data networks may involve
voice traffic, currently the revenue backbone of the telephone
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone industry technologies have been designed to ensure
that data packets carrying voice telephone calls have priority
passage through the network, even during peak traffic periods. That
capability adds to the complexity and cost of conventional
telecommunications data networks, but it also gives voice
conversations a reliable sound quality that Ethernet or standard
Internet formats cannot yet match.
</P>
<P>
   But service providers like Yipes intend to plunge in to the
lucrative voice market by guaranteeing customers a minimum quality
of service _ whether for voice or data _ that the companies say
they will be able to meet by designing their networks to handle
bursts of high-data traffic.
</P>
<P>
   For Metcalfe, the Ethernet inventor, the venerable technology's
new ascent offers a lesson that transcends cost savings. In the
current era, where approaches to technical standards in computing
range from Microsoft's proprietary control to the free-software
approach represented by the Linux operating system, Metcalfe says
that Ethernet illustrates a third way.
</P>
<P>
   Ethernet became a universal standard, he said, because of the
licensing practices Xerox adopted in the 1970s. Xerox licensed its
Ethernet patents at modest terms, ensuring that it won the
standards battle with competing technologies at the time, promoted
by companies like IBM.
</P>
<P>
   With licenses easily obtained, companies were free to devise the
best ways to develop commercial Ethernet-based products.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ethernet is today is a business model based on open
standards and individually owned implementations,'' he said. ``It
has created a world where there is rapid innovation and fierce
competition.''

in fairy tales, old fashion love and making dreams a reality. ...
Please don't be afraid, for I am truly a lost and lonely kitten,''
writes Lora Zaiontz, 34.
</P>
<P>
   But these messages are not found during a typical Internet
search of personal ads. To get to these Web pages, the search word
has to be inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Bauder is serving 75 years for aggravated sexual assault of a
child. Picone is serving seven years for conspiracy to distribute
methamphetamines. And Zaiontz is serving a life sentence for
capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   They are among thousands of inmates who are now using the
Internet to find pen pals, sympathizers and money through sites
such as meet-an-inmate.com, pennpals.org, cyberspace-inmates.com
and outlawsonline.com.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Toney, a Death Row inmate who killed three people in the
Fort Worth suburb of Lake Worth with a briefcase bomb in 1985,
recently used an Internet auction site in a failed attempt to sell
seats to his execution. Officials from eBay removed the posting
within hours.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates have no access to computers unless their prison job is
to repair them, said Larry Todd, a spokesman for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice. Instead, the Web pages are created
by people in the ``free world'' _ friends, members of advocacy
groups and the companies that have made inmate Web sites their
business.
</P>
<P>
   But the words on the screen come from the inmates, who, not
surprisingly, say ``I am innocent'' more than ``I am sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Inmates can benefit from communication with supportive friends
or relatives because it gives them an incentive to improve their
lives, prison officials say. But they warn that some inmates are
not looking for companionship, and are instead trolling for
pushovers who are willing to send cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want people to get ripped off,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   If inmates use their Web pages to proclaim their innocence and
solicit donations, they should be monitored, and in some cases,
removed from the Internet, victims advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona legislators agree, and have passed a law prohibiting
inmates from communicating with ``communication service
providers,'' which includes inmate pen pal services.
</P>
<P>
   The law, which takes effect next month, also prohibits inmates
from accessing the Internet through a computer or third party.
Inmates who violate the law could lose good time credits earned
toward an early release or could be prosecuted on a misdemeanor
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Justice For All, a Houston-based criminal justice reform group,
is monitoring the Arizona legislation to determine whether it might
work for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For victims, it is ``very, very hurtful for them to go to a Web
page and find a very sugar-coated version of what happened,'' said
Sharlene Hall, vice president of the advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   But families should have no say in the matter, said Charles
Sparks, operator of Ohio-based pennpals.org. They participated in
the criminal justice process by attending the trial. Once the
defendant is in prison, victims' families are ``out of the loop at
that point, justifiably,'' Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is their lack of freedom just the starting point? How much do
the victims get to prod these people?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Potter does not have a problem with inmate Web pages, as
long as they are not used to scam money from people.
</P>
<P>
   Potter, 33, was a friend of Darren Cain's, one of two people
fatally shot in Houston in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Victor Thompson is on Death Row for the murders of his
ex-girlfriend, Dennise Hayslip, and her friend, Cain.
</P>
<P>
   On his Web page, Thompson says he is looking for a pen pal who
will ``enter our friendship with an open mind and not judge me. ...
I am a very firm believer that everyone needs someone in their life
and I need you. I am a very interesting person with a lot of
character and I just need someone to share that with.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also proclaims his innocence, then asks for money for
his legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be prepared for any and everything that the state
is coming at me with, the minimum cost of adequate legal
representation starts at $25,000. But we're wanting to raise
$75,000 to cover all bases,'' Thompson says on his Web page.
</P>
<P>
   But if anyone sends money, it will not go to Thompson's legal
defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   The money goes to his commissary account, according to a
disclaimer that the Web site operator put on Thompson's page.
</P>
<P>
   Potter said the disclaimer was added only after he and several
others repeatedly contacted the Web site operator, the Canadian
Coalition Against the Death Penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition, which consists of Toronto residents Tracy
Lamourie and Dave Parkinson, now also lists a link to the victims'
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Lamourie said she does not edit the inmates' Web pages, but that
she simply sets them up.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way that she and her husband could investigate each
of the 250 inmates on their site to verify the facts about their
cases, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Lamourie said she and her husband, both 30, established their
site about two years ago, in hopes of educating others about
capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If more people were exposed to the realities and the stories,
then perhaps people wouldn't be so quick to support the death
penalty,'' said Lamourie, who works in publishing sales.
</P>
<P>
   Joanna Kelly had the same goal when she set up a Web page for
her pen pal-turned-friend, Death Row inmate Michael McBride.
</P>
<P>
   McBride, a former resident of the Fort Worth suburb of Saginaw,
gunned down Boswell High School graduates Christian Fisher and Jim
Holzler, both 18. Fisher had broken up with McBride and was
attending college in Lubbock when he lured her to his Lubbock home
and ambushed her and three of her friends in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   McBride was executed May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who lives in Dublin, Ireland, said she began writing to
McBride after finding an inmate pen pal Web site during a boring
New Year's Eve 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But the Web page did not accomplish what she had hoped, Kelly
said, mainly because of what McBride chose to put on it.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said she had wanted him to provide information about his
childhood, interests and aspirations. If people knew more about
him, Kelly thought, they might find his life worth sparing.
</P>
<P>
   But McBride insisted on writing about how he had suffered as a
result of the trial and subsequent death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said she tried to convince McBride to write something
else, but in a letter ``basically putting me in my place,'' McBride
insisted that Kelly transcribe what he had sent her.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before his execution, McBride wrote a letter to Kelly,
which she has since posted on his Web page. In the letter, McBride
says he confessed his sins to a priest:
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I killed did not have that opportunity and my soul
weeps for them. I'm trying to do my part, I know God does his, now
you do yours.''

<P>
   Independent booksellers are a famously fractious group, as the
name suggests. In their two-decades war against chain stores and,
more recently, online booksellers, they have shared little beyond
common enemies _ Barnes &AMP; Noble, Borders, Amazon, the price clubs _
and a will to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from one another in neighborhoods across America, they
have fought a guerrilla war with discouraging results. Nearly half
the independent booksellers have disappeared since 1994, according
to the American Booksellers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internet, the site of so much recent loss for the
independents, will take on greater importance as a battleground in
the next two months. Set to debut are two large-scale Web sites
that seek to promote the independents. But many wonder whether the
sites are jumping in too late and can compete with the customer
service of the online giants Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   On June 6, the booksellers association will begin to unveil
Booksense.com, a site turning the independents into ``local store
dot-com, closed but open 24 hours a day,'' says Michael Hoynes, the
program's marketing officer. Next to come, in early July, is
Contentville, a site produced by Steven T. Brill, which will,
according to its senior vice president and e-publisher, Annik
LaFarge, make some 40 of the most respected booksellers in the
country the ``heart and soul'' of its book retailing area. The
sites hope to showcase the independents as stores run by
booksellers with personalities as unique and marketable as their
books.
</P>
<P>
   But they are built on very different business models.
Booksense.com is a ``hub site'' for hundreds of individual Web
sites created and maintained by local stores. Each will have its
own Web address and set its own prices.
</P>
<P>
   What is unusual about Contentville's relationship with the
independent booksellers it has recruited _ Glenn Goldman of Book
Soup in Los Angeles, Neal Sofman of A Clean Well Lighted Place in
San Francisco and a former ABA president, Ed Morrow of Northshire
Bookstore in Manchester Center, Vt., among others _ is that the
independents will not actually be selling books on Contentville.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will provide editorial content for a fee and will
get an equity stake in the company should Contentville go public.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Farley, an e-commerce analyst at PaineWebber, believes the
biggest issue for the new sites lies in customer service, exactly
the territory the independents in Booksense.com, in particular,
will have the least control over. ``The trick,'' she says, ``is
providing a great customer experience. Amazon has spent five years
developing a complicated and hopefully very robust distribution and
fulfillment network. They didn't snap their fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the challenge, the sites have established alliances with
Baker &AMP; Taylor and Ingram, wholesalers that have traditionally
dealt in bulk orders to booksellers and now face the challenge of
shipping smaller orders directly to consumers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram, for example, has worked over the last two years to
improve its ability to ship smaller orders to more customers, and
over the last year has developed this operation in earnest
delivering books for Barnesandnoble.com and Buy.com, the two
largest of 20 such clients it works with.
</P>
<P>
   Ingram has a cash investment in Contentville, which ``gives us
reassurance they'll do it right,'' said Brill. Booksense.com has
reached similar distribution agreements with Baker &AMP; Taylor and
other wholesalers. The wholesalers' ability to deliver on their
promises is crucial, says Lorraine Shanley, a publishing consultant
at Market Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The online component of bookselling is difficult for people
without the resources and organizational savvy of Amazon,'' she
said. ``ABA is a trade organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The obstacle, she says, is the same as it was for Barnes &AMP; Noble
when it went online. ``They are trying to jerry-rig entrenched
systems, as opposed to building a Web-based transactional business,
which is what Amazon did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Len Vlahos, director of Booksense.com, says customer service
will be the strength of the program. ``The local store itself will
be point of customer contact,'' he said. ``There's an actual person
in the store, which has many more years of customer service
experience than Amazon.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question still remains whether the Internet plays to the
independents' strengths as retailers. Online booksellers can't
replicate the experience of browsing and buying books in a store,
says Jeffrey Fieler, consumer Internet analyst at Bear Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Though he acknowledges that ``the independents have to do
something or they will be marginalized'' even further, he is
skeptical that a niche retailer can develop a significant market
share in a category already well-served on the Web. Last year,
according to Fieler, people visited an average of 15 sites a month.
This year, he says, the number has shrunk to 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are finding the places that meet their needs,'' he
says. ``The larger sites in each area are adding functionality so
that people don't need to go to other sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Booksense.com, which has been delayed since the fall by
technical problems, grows out of Booksense, a ``national marketing
umbrella'' launched by the booksellers association for its
beleaguered members in February 1999. In the last 16 months,
Booksense has attracted 1,154 stores across the country to its
offline program. It offers, among other features, a bestseller list
drawn from members' stores, gift certificates redeemable at any
affiliated store (allowing direct competition with the ubiquity of
the chains) and national advertising promoting independents'
reading recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Booksense.com charges participants a set-up fee, a monthly
maintenance fee and takes 4.5 percent in commissions on orders
shipped from wholesale partners.
</P>
<P>
   The association has earmarked more than $2 million for
promotion. Farley said Amazon had spent $40.6 million in
advertising, promotion and public relations in the last quarter
alone, though Amazon sells more than books.
</P>
<P>
   Local marketing by the independents themselves, together with
significant in-store promotion of the individual Web sites, is seen
as key to Booksense's viability.
</P>
<P>
   Fieler also sees risks in this limited approach. ``Partnerships
with other sites that command large shares'' of Internet traffic,
such as Barnes and Noble's relationship with AOL, or Amazon's
relationship with Yahoo, will be crucial for the venture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Research from the American Booksellers Association shows, Hoynes
says, that the typical customer of an independent bookstore buys an
average of 20 books a year, but only eight of those at an
independent store. Booksense's goal is to build the independents'
share to 10 or 11.
</P>
<P>
   Contentville has significantly more marketing clout and will
sell more than books: content from newspapers and magazines, as
well as e-books, dissertations and other material. It will spend
$75 million in advertising over the next two years, according to
Brill, who estimates that books will account for 25 to 30 percent
of the site's total revenue. Both NBC and CBS have invested in
Contentville, and the site will be advertised on the networks
beginning in July in some markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Contentville independents will create a variety of editorial
features, including recommended ``libraries'' of essential books in
various categories, ``If You Ask Me'' endorsements of books they
love and new books they are enthusiastic about. There will also be
store bestseller lists and ``Buzz on the Floor'' notes on local
happenings that have helped sales of certain titles. But Shanley
questions whether the local flavor will help on the Web, where
``virtual communities are more important than land-based ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The new sites are complementary _ Contentville will have pages
that point back to Web sites that may be part of Booksense.
</P>
<P>
   This may be an advantage for the booksellers involved in the
programs. Roxanne Coady of R.J. Julia Books in Madison, Conn., who
is participating in both sites, said: ``Booksense as a branding
campaign, Booksense.com and Contentville can all act to remind
consumers that independent booksellers have a valuable voice. That
alone is a big deal.''

BILL TO PROTECT DATABASES CREATES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On one side are the Chamber of Commerce, Consumers
Union, research librarians and Charles Schwab. On the other side
are the New York Stock Exchange, real estate agents and the
American Medical Association. Yahoo is on one side, eBay on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   These odd alliances of lobbyists have formed over the question
of whether databases _ collections of facts like telephone
directories, weather reports, stock tables and real estate listings
_ can be copied, repackaged and distributed by anyone with an
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the House Judiciary Committee approved a bill
sponsored by Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., that would establish
criminal penalties for the unauthorized use of material in
databases. Opponents say the bill would allow companies with
databases to control access to facts.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, held up by competing commercial interests and a
jurisdictional dispute in the House, seems unlikely to be enacted
this year, but few other issues before Congress this year have
generated so much lobbying. Advocates on both sides say their
livelihoods are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Realtors, with members in every
congressional district, is one of the capital's most formidable
lobbies. Last month, at the association's Washington meeting,
hundreds of real estate agents visited their senators and
representatives to argue that without the Coble bill, their
multiple-listing services were in danger of being pirated.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's senators, Bill Frist and Fred Thompson, both
Republicans, were so besieged that they had to reserve a committee
hearing room so they would have space for all the agents from their
state.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, lobbyists for Bloomberg LP, the financial
information service, have been telling lawmakers that if the Coble
bill becomes law, the stock exchanges could make it impossible for
the company to publish complex calculations about stock prices and
trends. ``The bill would mean they would have absolute ownership
right over something as basic as stock quotes,'' said Kevin
Sheekey, a Bloomberg spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Michael R. Bloomberg, the company's founder, is northeastern
vice chairman of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and largely because
of his influence the chamber has thrown its considerable lobbying
weight into the fray. ``Factual data is the nuts and bolts of the
information age,'' said Rick Lane, the chamber's chief lobbyist on
technology issues. ``If you try to control its use, you're going to
stifle commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides may be exaggerating. But the question of database
piracy is one instance in which technology has developed so rapidly
that it has outstripped the laws governing commercial
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Before there was an Internet, the issue was pretty well settled
by copyright law. Creative works could be copyrighted; facts could
not. If a database was nothing but a collection of raw facts _ say,
a list of countries in Europe _ then it was public property. But if
the compilation involved selection and coordination _ for instance,
European countries ranked in order of their wine production _ then
it could be copyrighted, and no one could use the list without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have ruled, for example, that the telephone white
pages cannot be copyrighted because the only arrangement involved
is alphabetical. But the Yellow Pages are protected because someone
had to select the various categories.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the sheer volume of information on the Internet, the ease
with which it can be retrieved and the size of the potential
profits have blurred the line between what is acceptable and what
is not. For example, is the five-digit coding system for medical
services and procedures developed by the American Medical
Association more like the white pages or the Yellow Pages?
</P>
<P>
   Companies and interest groups have chosen sides on the issue
depending on whether they primarily collect data that is put on the
Internet (the stock exchanges, real estate brokers, Lexis-Nexis,
eBay, AMA) or use the data compiled by someone else (the Chamber of
Commerce, Consumers Union, Yahoo, Schwab, research librarians).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   EBay, the online auction company, is a collector. It worries
that an ambitious Web-meister will take its listing for, say, a set
of Wedgwood china and the listings on all the other auction sites
for a set of the same china and provide a new list for comparative
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which makes most of its money from transaction
fees, could suffer from the competition. Even worse, a lobbyist for
eBay said, is that the prices and availability of its items change
minute by minute. The competing Web site could have misinformation.
And customers would blame eBay, damaging its reputation and
business.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, eBay recently sued a company called Bidder's Edge that
has just the kind of Web site it fears. Last month a U.S. District
Court in California issued a preliminary injunction preventing
Bidder's Edge from using eBay's data.
</P>
<P>
   Associations of real estate brokers who run multiple-listing
services have won similar suits.
</P>
<P>
   A few cases have gone against the owners of databases. But even
the legislation's proponents say that in almost every instance,
companies that have been damaged because their databases were
copied have been able to get relief in court.
</P>
<P>
   The opponents of the Coble bill say this shows that no sweeping
new legislation is needed. ``Existing law takes care of any
legitimate issue of database piracy,'' said Jonathan Band, a lawyer
representing a group of Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Verstandig, senior vice president of the National
Association of Realtors, disagreed. ``We've been pretty lucky with
these cases so far,'' he said. ``But we're afraid this isn't going
to hold up much longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill's opponents have endorsed a measure sponsored by Thomas
Bliley, R-Va., chairman of the House Commerce Committee. The bill
would allow the Federal Trade Commission to issue orders preventing
inappropriate reproduction of databases.

EVEN A WORM NEEDS LOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (The Week in Review) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month a hyperactive computer program bearing the message
``I Love You'' ricocheted around the world's e-mail systems in less
than 24 hours and infected tens of millions of computers.
</P>
<P>
   The ``I Love You'' bug, allegedly launched by a computer student
in the Philippines with too much time on his hands, touched off a
cyber-flu season. More than 29 variants have emerged so far,
including diabolical derivatives with names like ``NewLove'' and
``Resume _ Janet Simons.'' Most of the mutants arrived without
tidings of love, but instead carried a software payload designed to
erase victims' disks once the message's attachment was opened.
</P>
<P>
   While ``I Love You'' was startlingly swift and effective, most
of its imitators went almost nowhere. According to some computer
security experts, the copycat cyberplagues should have spread just
as rapidly as the worm (in computer entomology, worms propel
themselves while viruses hitchhike on other documents) they were
mimicking.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, what's love got to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   Quite a lot, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Computer experts looking at the different contagion rates are
divided about whether Internet users learned a hard lesson in
computer hygiene or whether the world is actually a lonelier place
than anyone realized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been told that men were much more likely to open the `I
Love You' worm than women,'' said George Cybenko, a computer
scientist at Dartmouth University and a founder of the Institute of
Security Technology Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the ``I Love You'' message was so simple and beguiling
that in some cases it hoodwinked even the most sophisticated
computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Capps, a senior Microsoft software designer, padded
downstairs at 5 a.m. on the morning of the ``I Love You''
infection, poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down at his
computer to read his e-mail. It happened to be his birthday, so as
he scanned his mailbox he thought he saw a love note from his wife.
</P>
<P>
   After opening the program Capps quickly realized his error and
managed to delete the bug before it spread widely. ``What I
remember thinking was, ``How did Marie manage to sneak downstairs
late at night to send me a birthday note?'' he said sheepishly.
</P>
<P>
   Capps was not alone. Hewlett-Packard &AMP; Co. acknowledged last
week that its computers suffered more than 700,000 infections from
the ``I Love You'' worm _ more than 500,000 in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The total damage _ primarily time spent restoring files and
cleaning out clogged e-mail systems _ may reach $950 million,
according to ICSA.net, a computer security company that tracks the
cost of computer infections.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the far more lethal ``NewLove'' bug began
infecting the address books of users of the popular Microsoft
Outlook e-mail program, sending itself to every person on the list.
But instead of delivering the endearingly named document
LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU.TXT.VBS, NewLove cloaked itself by snatching a
recent document name from its victim's hard disk and using that
name in the subject line of all subsequent messages sent from the
address list, destroying data on the hard drives of affected
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the ``Resume'' bug urged e-mail recipients to look at
a job seeker's fabulous curriculum vitae, helpfully included as an
attachment _ which, of course served as an electronic Trojan Horse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their cleverness, however, both ``NewLove'' and
``Resume'' were stopped in their tracks. ``If `NewLove' had come
before `I Love You' it would have spread more slowly but we would
have had a bigger disaster,'' said Peter Tippett, chief technology
officer of ICSA.
</P>
<P>
   Tippett, who was trained as an epidemiologist before starting an
antivirus software company in the 1980s, has long argued that
computer viruses and infections closely mimic the biological world.
</P>
<P>
   That might be another reason why the lethal ``NewLove'' was less
effective than ``I Love You.'' In the real world as well as in
cyberspace, diseases that kill their hosts quickly tend to have
limited success in spreading through large populations. ``Viruses
that kill their hosts never make it,'' Tippett said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the Darwinian imperative or the irresistible power
of love at work, experts believe the current cyber-flu season will
not be the last, especially as the millions of PCs of the 1990s are
transformed into billions of cell phones, personal digital
assistants and even toaster-connected Internet appliances by the
end of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   For each new device connected to the Internet there are dozens
of new ways to spread infection. Even now, computer security
experts are warning that the growing popularity of music and
file-sharing programs like Napster, Gnutella, iMesh and Scour
Exchange will virtually insure new vectors for diseases.
</P>
<P>
   That will mean that disease in the cyberworld will become as
routine as cold season is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what concerns me,'' said Kevin Kelly, author of ``Out
of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems and the
Economic World'' (Addison Wesley, 1994). ``These new systems leave
us completely open to these infections and we may just have to
learn to live with them.''

 &HT;    INTERNET YIELDS MAJOR JOB GAINS FOR U.S. FIRMS
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The sizzling Internet economy, on track to top $850
billion in revenue this year, is beginning to yield major
productivity gains for the nation's employers, University of Texas
researchers found in a study released Tuesday (cq).
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to productivity, digital companies are leading
the nation's economic performance,'' Andrew Whinston, director of
the Center for Research on Electronic Commerce at the university's
Graduate School of Business, said in an interview here.
</P>
<P>
   The 82-page report, the latest semi-annual survey on the overall
state of Internet commerce was co-authored by Anitesh Barua, the
center's associate director.
</P>
<P>
   It found that revenue per employee, a key measure of
productivity, rose by 19 percent from 1998

 &HT;    Wireless age to bring new freedoms ... and burdens
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Deb Spicer Tompkins lives in the blur.
</P>
<P>
   There is a blur, she will tell you, where there used to be a
line separating professional and family, private life and public.
But with her cellular phone, pager and wireless digital assistant,
Tompkins often finds herself where there is no line at all.
</P>
<P>
   As managing director of the technology practice at Hill and
Knowlton, a public relations firm, she gets e-mail from clients,
pages from her children, phone calls from co-workers, all the time,
everywhere. ``If you're not careful, it puts you in a perpetual
reactive mode,'' she said. ``Sometimes instead of reducing
information overload, it contributes to information overload.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, the human relationship with technology has always been
two-way. And now, in the wireless revolution, we have combined the
mobility of cars, the reach of phones and the power of computers.
``This is huge,'' said Steve Jones, professor and head of
communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``Wireless
Internet access represents as much of a revolution as the
introduction of the Internet itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who grew up in the pre-Net era, the prospects can sound
like an episode of ``The Jetsons.'' Say you're driving to the
theater. The car knows where you are going, sees the time, does a
quick calculation and realizes you are not going to make it on
time. The car calls the theater, then sells the tickets to someone
else.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Prial, marketing director for IBM's pervasive computing
unit, says it is hardly a stretch from what can be done now to that
scenario. ``You get to the theater and sure enough, you say, `Darn,
we're late.' And the car says, `No problem. I sold the tickets.'''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of the technology seems clear enough: Employees can
hit the beach without ducking a critical conference call, children
can reach parents from a party gone sour, stranded motorists can
summon a tow truck. The near future is even more alluring: paying
for items before you get to the store, turning on the oven when you
are miles from home, checking in to a flight while still on the way
to the airport _ something Swissair already does in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   ``And tomorrow, you'll have your electronic boarding pass on
your phone,'' Prial said.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many burdens of wireless technology are also hard
to miss. The relentless flood of e-mail and voice mail. The ease
with which a colleague or boss can intrude on your free time. The
annoyance of hearing strangers blithely discussing private business
in public places on their cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Yet work and bad manners are not new, even if we have witnessed
a spate of new technologies. How much of a difference does it make
that we can communicate without wires?
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Net power in the palm of your hand _ for
transactions, for information, for communication _ will be the
difference, said Steve Jones, professor and head of communication
at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ``People will become more
spur of the moment. It makes the Internet more a part of everyday
life.''
</P>
<P>
   As voice recognition software improves, users will ask their
hand-held devices for movie information, the nearest four-star
Italian restaurant and maybe even to translate what a stranger
says. ``We can get terribly Star Trek about it, but it's
possible,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is not happy about what technology has done so far. Flip
answers to critics _ ``well, just turn it off!'' _ ring hollow, he
said. ``People are realizing that even as they turn cell phones off
and don't check e-mail, it doesn't stop coming.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTENDS WORK WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Wireless extends the work week and may also add a layer of
stress, said Deborah Borisoff, professor in the department of
culture and communication at New York University. ``E-mail ups the
ante for responding. People call you and say, `I sent you three
e-mails. Why haven't you answered?'''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, despite the advantage of mobility, erosion of
personal life is becoming ``the norm,'' she said. ``We know the
comparison with the way it was, but what about the new
generation?''
</P>
<P>
   Borisoff ran into resistance when she demanded that graduate
students switch off phones and pagers in class. ``People tell me,
`I would lose my job if I turned off my beeper.'''
</P>
<P>
   James W. Carey, author of ``Communication as Culture'' and
professor at Columbia University, recounted standing behind a woman
in a Baskin-Robbins ice cream shop who was taking orders via
wireless phone from the people at home, apparently oblivious to the
people behind her in line.
</P>
<P>
   When the key division between home and public disappears, people
act rudely and don't even know it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Martin, who writes the syndicated Miss Manners column,
said new technology takes getting used to. ``Some people think they
are in an etiquette-free zone. Still, I think that everyone will
calm down when we get used to cell phones.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not technology that makes people rude, she said. ``It is
amazing how technology improves but people don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carey said he believes technology does shape expectations.
Television, he believes, has convinced some people that those being
watched can't watch back. One student who sat in the front row
constantly talked during class and was astonished that he
complained, Carey said. ``She said, `You mean you noticed? I didn't
think it would bother you.'''
</P>
<P>
   POWERFUL MEDIUM
</P>
<P>
   Many people still think the technology is just for talking.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, as the Europeans know and as Americans are finding out,
wireless is reaching new realms. When the phone's souped-up
software connects to sophisticated networks, the phone becomes a
map, a wallet and a window on the Web. With a tiny screen, phones
won't replace computer surfing, but Net sites are being configured
to be usable _ if not exciting _ via the phone.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Atlanta-based Hotpalm.com has software that will
let users trade stocks by phone. Moreover, Hotpalm technology can
let a shopper in a store connect to a search engine that will sweep
the Web to find the best price for the item you are looking at,
said Chandan Seernmani, chairman, chief executive officer and
co-founder of Hotpalm.com. ``Then you can take that to the service
desk and say, `Would you care to match this price or should I push
the button and buy this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Phones fitted with global positioning software can tell you
where the nearest Home Depot is _ and how to get there. Connected
to the Net, an emergency medical technician might read a patient's
medical history as she is lifted into the ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will change the way that people live and the way they do
things,'' Seernmani said. ``This is the wave we are getting ready
to ride.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW GATED COMMUNITY
</P>
<P>
   It started with the Walkman _ the first technology to create a
kind of ``gated community in the street,'' Carey said.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the man on the sidewalk talking on the phone, the woman
in the coffee line speaking loudly into her hand and ignoring those
around her, he said. ``Whatever the advantages, efficiencies,
conveniences and portability, these are devices for imposing
private life on public life. These devices surround people with a
kind of shell in which they become inaccessible and unaware of the
world around them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not just discourteous, Carey said. ``Democracy is a form
of public life that depends ultimately on people being aware of
strangers and being able to converse with them. There have been
many incursions and erosions of that. This is a kind of wholesale
assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet to IBM's Prial, that blending of public and private is only
for the better.
</P>
<P>
   If someone on an airplane recommends a book, now you may write
the name on a napkin, shove it in your pocket and forget it. But
soon, you will tap out the book title on your wireless, press a
button that says, ``buy this book'' and it will be waiting for you
at your hotel or when you get home.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless evangelicals expect the home to be networked as well.
Put a ``Web cam'' in the refrigerator that you can view from work,
so you know if you are low on milk. Better yet, install an
automatic ``replenishment'' sensor that calls you, he said. ``You
are driving home from work and you get a message that says, `Pick
up milk.' That improves your life.''
</P>
<P>
   PRIVACY AN ISSUE
</P>
<P>
   Some scoff at the IBM version of the wireless world-to-come.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just silly,'' said Alan L. Marcus, professor of history
at Iowa State University. ``That's Pollyanna stuff, although I can
understand in a world where one is selling things that this would
be attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Take one example _ the availability of a patient's medical
information, he said. ``Think about an insurance company having
your test results and, all of a sudden, you are not insurable. The
one thing that everybody wants is privacy, and this means that
privacy is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But wireless is really part of a much larger picture, said
Marcus, author of ``Technology in America: A Brief History.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans love technology, especially the kind that gives them
personal control _ or at least seems to. Look at cars,
videocassette players, cable television _ the culture is deep-fried
in individualism, Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, it does change relationships, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless encourages bosses to reach out and touch employees at
odd moments _ undermining the ``I wasn't home to get the phone
call'' alibi. And increasingly personalized work schedules raise
another barrier to unions, which often rely on a shared work
experience. But Marcus doesn't blame the wireless wave on muscular
marketing efforts to sell wireless service to one and all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic forces only work if people buy stuff,'' Marcus said.
``There has to be a reason why you spend your money that way.
Talking about economic forces reverses how we think. We think about
`them' doing it to us, but we do it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Marcus went to a wedding and wondered: Should he turn
off his cell phone and risk missing an emergency call from his
children or risk disrupting the wedding? Obviously, he should have
found out the number at the wedding's location and left that with
the kids. Instead, he switched off his phone, later marveling at
his own narrow-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I had a cell phone, it never occurred to me how to
operate without a cell phone.''
</P>
<P>
   GOOD FOR GROWTH
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget money.
</P>
<P>
   While wireless may appeal to our need for autonomy and
productivity, it is also a potentially dramatic economic
fertilizer. Leaps forward in communications and transportation have
spurred business expansion by lowering costs, raising efficiency
and making possible transactions that were simply not feasible
before.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless does the same.
</P>
<P>
   The service has grown much cheaper even as it becomes a more
powerful tool. Business-to-business electronic commerce _ something
increasingly possible via wireless _ will make companies more
efficient. Wireless also lets employees work away from the office _
in cars, airports, hotels and at home. Meanwhile, consumers find
themselves using wireless more as its costs fall. And new versions
of wireless will let them do more business _ whether it's buying
stocks, books or clothes.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, technology is an economic driver and wireless is a
key technology, said Charles Mahla, senior economist for Econ One,
a California-based consulting group. ``Ultimately that's going to
result in greater profits, greater incomes, greater demand for
consumer products. All this propels the economy forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Wireless also holds the promise of evening out economic
inequities. Development, technology and wealth are concentrated in
a relatively few places. But when new technology changes costs, the
possibilities shift, too, said Linda Garcia, associate director of
the Georgetown University Program in Communication, Culture and
Technology. ``From my point of view, the special thing about
wireless is that it has a very different cost structure. Wireless
doesn't have a high fixed cost. You can recover your capital
faster. This is exciting for, say, rural India.''
</P>
<P>
   Or the rural United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think cooperatives, rural telephone companies, have been
more likely to deploy technology more rapidly than the regional
Bell companies (like BellSouth). They have to make a capital
investment, but they don't have to make a profit. I'm just afraid
that it won't continue to happen. Other people can come and eat
their lunch _ these are great takeover companies.''
</P>
<P>
   For its advantages, many wonder if technology liberates us or
ties us further down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to think about whether this is freedom or an
illusion,'' said NYU's Borisoff. ``What do we mean by freedom? And
freedom from what?''
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Seagraves, executive director of the American Civil
Liberties Union in Georgia, uses her phone frequently _ but often
leaves it switched off. ``I don't find it to be an intrusion
because, if I don't want to talk, I turn it off. We sometimes give
technology a control that it doesn't have to have. And maybe we are
blaming technology for our own inability to set boundaries and make
our own choices.''
</P>
<P>
   But those choices are not easy for us, said Ralph Keyes, social
critic and author of ``We, the Lonely People.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans constantly tussle with technology, hoping it is a tool
to improve lives, even as it sometimes forces a trade-off. ``Every
day I ask myself, is my life better because I have all this
technology? I don't have a clear answer to that.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   A must-have peripheral for Nintendo's Game Boy Color, The Game
Buddy ($20; www.bti.ca) from Battery Technologies, Inc., is an
add-on rechargeable battery pack for the puny little hand-held game
device. It supplies nearly 24 hours of constant play with each
charge. It purports a whopping 2,000 hours of total storage
capacity and fits snugly to the base of the Game Boy Color where it
interfaces with the AC adapter port. It remains attached even while
charging. The Game Buddy also acts as a night light when it's
recharging, a beacon of hope in a dark sleepless night. The unit
also gives the Game Boy significantly more heft than some portable
game users are accustomed to, but don't be a wimp _ you've got 24
hours of recuperation and gaming time for your efforts. It's cool.

<P>
   DAZZLING, DIRT-FREE DIMPLES

   And from the ``what will they think of next and shouldn't we
shoot them before they do?'' files comes the BallButler ($90;
www.golfballbutler.com), a washing accessory for avid golfers who
happen to own their own electric golf carts. Mounted just about
anywhere on one's cart (fender, basket, drink holder _ No! No! Not
the drink holder!) and drawing power from the cart battery, the
patented BallButler embraces one's filthy whackable orb while a
diminutive 12-volt motor spins it about amongst ``polypropylene
monofilament brushes in a solution of water and detergent leaving
it sparkling clean.'' What more could you want? Someone to hit for
you, maybe?

 &HT;    Refilling ink cartridges saves money but can be risky

<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Sue and Jacki:
</P>
<P>
   I read that a kit has been developed and is being sold that
allows you to refill black or color printer ink cartridges. I want
to try it but can't remember the company offering the kits. Can you
help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Richard Dobrin, Beachwood, Ohio
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are two schools of thought on refilling ink
cartridges in printers. One is that you shouldn't do it because the
risk outweighs the cost sa and pieces from the hard disk. It's also
at cnet.com. Also, a good source for these two utilities and
freeware in general is freewarefilez.com.

 &HT;    Medium-priced computers could be the best vintage
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I am not exactly an international sophisticate. So _
when I took a corporate job during a break from newspapering _ my
boss, a veteran of really wicked expense account wars, tried to
help and explained his theory of ordering wine in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get the most expensive wines,'' he said. ``Restaurants
just put them there as window dressing; they don't expect to sell
many bottles. And don't get the cheapest ones, they're overpriced
for what they are and not very good. Look in the middle prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when I came to work after a long holiday weekend, I
started thinking about that 15-year-old advice. There were four or
five e-mails from readers asking what to look for in a new
computer. I realized computers and wine have a lot in common. The
ones in the middle price ranges are usually the best choice. That's
not universal advice, but those who need a really powerful computer
usually are advanced users who don't need my advice.
</P>
<P>
   Near as I can figure, the middle ground for computers right now
is a 500 megahertz PC. It seems so strange, typing that. Just a few
years ago, computer magazines were writing with awe about 350
megahertz machines.
</P>
<P>
   Newer faster PCs keep coming along and _ if you really want to
stay at the top of the heap _ you can buy PCs in the 1 gigahertz
range now.
</P>
<P>
   And there still is the high tech equivalent of an arms race. As
processors get faster, software gets more demanding, so you almost
have to upgrade just to run the latest programs. That trend is
still around, but it seems to have slowed some. You can do nicely
now and probably for the next couple of years, as far as running
your favorite programs, on a 500 megahertz machine.
</P>
<P>
   The next decision is memory. Even ordinary home PC users should
consider getting 128 megabytes or even more of RAM. Memory does
make a difference. A good video card and a fat hard disk are nice
too.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the neat thing. As I glance through the ads for PCs in
the 500 megahertz range, it's easy to see that every one of them
comes loaded with almost everything you need. So, for ordinary
folks, there aren't too many difficult choices to make anymore. My
guess is that the machine you find at the store will be more than
adequate without changing a thing.
</P>
<P>
   But there are decisions to make.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays there are two choices when it comes to who makes the
processor chip (and that's the real brains of your computer).
There's Intel, the safe choice, and AMD, a relative newcomer but a
respected one. I prefer Intel chips, but you're really fine with
either one. And the AMD advocates make a good case: AMD chips
usually test out just as fast or faster than the Intel chip. I go
with Intel simply because it's an old habit _ mostly a brand
preference.
</P>
<P>
   The next big choice is between a brand name PC _ one made by a
company like Dell or Gateway _ or a no-name machine, usually
assembled by what is called a ``screwdriver shop'' in the trade.
The no-name machines, logically enough, cost much less because the
manufacturer isn't saddled with a lot of advertising and marketing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that there would be a large and consistent
quality difference between, say, a Dell and some PC with a name
such as Sunshine Computing Co. on the case. Life would be easier if
that was the case. Then the decision would be to pop the extra
bucks for the brand name machine. But the truth is that some of the
screwdriver shop PCs are great, others are jokes.
</P>
<P>
   So what you get (and what you ought to buy if you're a novice)
is consistent dependability from the big brand name manufacturers.
You also get more reliable and professional customer support if
things go wrong. What you can get (if you know computers or have a
trusted friend who does) from the screwdriver shops is a real
bargain. So if you have a spirit of adventure and enough know-how
to evaluate the machine, you can save some money.

 &HT;    Maken X looks great but lacks substance
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   Superconsole horsepower pushing superconsole graphics does well
to hide less than super gameplay in Maken X ($40; www.sega.com; for
the Dreamcast). There is probably a reason the first-person
``slasher'' genre is under exploited: A sci-fi sword game offers
close-quarter combat but does not, by nature, offer an appropriate
perspective. Maken is the weapon, with an innate ability to ``brain
jack'' or possess various characters throughout the game. But this
clever approach is befuddled by poor control of the mostly-unseen
Maken wielder. Auto-locking on a given target does afford the gamer
some ability to dodge/thrust/parry without becoming completely
disoriented, but it makes for a shallow combat system just the
same. Add to that a story that is so completely hokey _ (We're
fighting evil. How evil? The Devil!) _ and plodding, poorly
scripted dialogue, and all you end up with is a great-looking,
fast-moving, wannabe anime role-playing sword game that only
exploits fresh gaming style, while the extraordinarily cool gaming
concept is unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   X-COM Collector's Edition ($30; www.hasbro-interactive.com; for
Windows) is a retro buff's dream, harkening back to the days (a
mere half decade ago) when games were perhaps more graphically
simplistic yet characteristically more deep, more absorbing and
simply better _ in this case at least. A collection of the three
X-COM strategy games, UFO Defense, Terror from the Deep and
Apocalypse, Collector's Edition, promises to satiate both the game
addict's hunger for a solid game experience as well as introduce
new or casual gamers to purity of gameplay often lost in late-model
splatter and gore festivals. A set of strategy, micromanagement and
resource hoarding games in essence, the X-COM titles have always
garnered praise for their attention to intangible details and sheer
addictiveness. One more kick at the can seems their due, especially
at a mere $10 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   Need For Speed: Porsche Unleashed from Electronic Arts ($35,
www.needforspeed.com, for Windows PCs) takes a big risk by focusing
its game on a single line of automobiles, and it succeeds wildly.
Driving the venerable ''Need For Speed'' franchise to a new,
faster, more hair-raising place with a long list of innovations,
the focus here is on creating a true simulation, not just a game.
And the genius is in the details, from the glint of sunlight on
chrome to the completely realistic driving physics, fully
functional dashboard, mesmerizing replay mode and long list of
once-and-future Porsches you can customize and drive. Multiple
camera angles capture every twist of dozens of beautifully detailed
tracks, all so easy to customize that you'll never run out of ways
to race. Perhaps the most fun is in the ''evolution'' style of
campaign gameplay in which you work toward faster,
smoother-handling cars. The only drawback is the large amount of
computer muscle needed to run the sim, but you can easily tweak
down the detail level. Electronic Arts promises to have an online
racing site running within a few weeks to make the multiplayer
options easier. This is the best of the series and goes to the top
of the list of ''must-haves'' for road-racing gamers. Vroom.

 &HT;    'Best encyclopedia' is no idle boast for Microsoft's Encarta
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a ``Letter from the Editor'' on the opening page of
the Microsoft Encarta Encyclopedia Deluxe 2000, Gary Alt calls his
product ``the very best general encyclopedia available in any
medium _ electronic or print.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be right.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of pure information, Britannica has to be considered
king of the encyclopedia hill. However, while I have not seen the
2000 edition, last year's electronic Britannica was just beginning
to test the multimedia waters. Britannica doesn't hurry into
anything.
</P>
<P>
   One can argue that an electronic encyclopedia is more valuable
than a print encyclopedia, because its user can find the
information more readily, and because it can present information
that the print media cannot, most importantly in terms of video and
audio.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Encarta is by far the best of the 2000 electronic
encyclopedias I have seen. The Deluxe version is available in the
Reference Suite _ five CDs or one DVD. I'm looking at the latter.
In addition to the encyclopedia, which can be had separately, the
reference suite includes the World English Dictionary, which
provides synonyms and basic facts and figures in addition to
standard dictionary services, and Microsoft's Interactive World
Atlas as well as a research organizing tool.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta's interface has been revamped again. Gone are the rather
startling (at least initially) snap-down menus, replaced by the
more familiar click-to-scroll kind. Every article is accompanied by
boxes containing links to available multimedia, topic-specific
online sites and an assortment of online search engines.
</P>
<P>
   The most imposing feature of Encarta continues to be its refusal
to shortchange its users through cost-cutting. You won't hear the
segment of Haydn's London Symphony played on some electronic
version of the hurdy-gurdy. You'll hear it played properly by an
orchestra. All the music, and there's a lot of it, is played on the
instruments for which it was written. You don't get this on any
other electronic encyclopedia with which I'm familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Some information _ as with any of the encyclopedias _ is shaky.
The unsigned article on flamenco is still the most accurate and
informative of all, but it persists in referring to Spanish gypsies
as Roma or Romani instead of gitanos, and uses the word ``canto''
instead of the proper ``cante'' for the vocal heart of the art.
</P>
<P>
   A video clip from a film on gypsy life has been added, which is
most welcome. But once again, the information is somewhat wrinkled.
It shows a woman dancing what is purported to be a zambra, ``a type
of flamenco dancing which owes much to Roma culture.'' The zambra
owes much to Moorish culture, not gypsy culture. What little we
hear sounds more like a tango, which indeed owes much to the
gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is the Archive, a large collection of articles from
Collier's Yearbook taken from the years before Encarta was created.
There doesn't seem to be much point to most of the older stuff
other than curiosity; it's extremely general, stiff and, the
intervening years have shown, wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Encarta continues to do a good job of appealing to all ages. It
is not as erudite as Britannica, which I suppose is a commercial
advantage in this anti-erudite age, nor does it cater obviously to
the elementary school student.
</P>
<P>
   The time line is a wonderful tool. It can be broken into
numerous topics _ art, science and the like _ and into numerous
areas _ Africa, Europe, etc. _ and two of these can be brought
on-screen for direct comparison.
</P>
<P>
   If you can only have one encyclopedia, Encarta is the one you
want.

 &HT;    It's Martha, minus the attitude
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Believe it or not, there may be one thing you can
probably do better than Martha Stewart, the undisputed goddess of
gracious living.
</P>
<P>
   Martha, as you may know, has become legend for baking 240
chocolate chip cookies to decorate her Christmas tree, making her
own garden compost and creating picture frames from twigs found on
her Connecticut estate.
</P>
<P>
   But you know, when it comes to the Internet, Martha still seems
a little lost, which is odd, considering her Web site is one of the
best of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   In between pruning peonies and making Polish delicacies with her
mother on her syndicated TV show, Martha will occasionally sit down
at the computer and attempt to show us how to surf the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The only time I've seen Martha get really excited about the Web
was during a demonstration she did about how to order seed catalogs
online. Here she was clearly in her element. Look! A catalog of
rare hybrids from Holland. Look! A British seed catalog brimming
with things you could never find in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That time, Martha herself was at the terminal, and she was
having a ball. Finding things online that genuinely interest you
that you didn't even know about before you logged on is one of the
main reasons people get so excited about the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But moments like that are rare. Last week, Martha had on her
show Jay Walker, co-chairman and founder of Priceline.com, the
name-your-own-price Web site best known for arranging discount
airfares to almost anywhere. He sat down at the computer, neatly
located in the computer storage hutch Martha built on an earlier
episode, and proceeded to show Martha how to buy airline tickets
online.
</P>
<P>
   During the demonstration, Martha sat quietly beside Walker while
he walked her through the nuances of the pull-down menu and other
computer basics while explaining how the service works. For people
who know how to surf the Web, and especially for people who've
always wondered how you can get plane tickets to Paris for a song,
it was a great segment.
</P>
<P>
   NOT IN HER ELEMENT
</P>
<P>
   But watching the show, I got the distinct feeling that Martha
Stewart has never logged on to Priceline.com and probably never
will. When she gets out the flour and butter and makes a
three-tiered wedding cake to die for, her enthusiasm and her
dedication to perfection is clear _ and is part of what makes her
the woman you love to hate. But when she takes a nod at the Net,
with the exception of the seed catalog extravaganza or passing
references to the wonders of eBay, you can just tell her heart
isn't in it.
</P>
<P>
   Martha should know people don't watch Martha Stewart Living to
find out how to get a cheap flight to Paris (or Buffalo, which was
the destination Martha selected for the demonstration). The people
who watch her show and read her magazine are as interested in the
Internet as they are in making the perfect flower arrangement, and
she knows she has to talk about the Internet whether she likes it
or not.
</P>
<P>
   What Martha can't seem to do is bring her trademark perfection
to the fine art of Web surfing. The legions of Martha devotees want
to know what sites she surfs, not just for seeds but for cooking
supplies, gardening tools and directions for making that yummy
dessert she whipped up last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Martha _ the person _ is still learning to love the
Web, Martha Stewart the company has already claimed its own corner
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Martha is a shrewd enough businesswoman to know she needs a Web
site, and www.marthastewart.com is a great site with a slightly
different attitude from the person, TV show and magazine of the
same name.
</P>
<P>
   Martha never pretends to be a Web geek, and I love her for that.
So whether she knows it or not, MarthaStewart.com is an excellent
example of multichannel media delivery.
</P>
<P>
   The people behind the Martha Stewart Living juggernaut know that
they are not in the magazine business, the TV business or even the
Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living is all about attaining a certain lifestyle
and makes use of any and every media outlet, including the
Internet, to give people the information that has made Martha
Stewart a billion-dollar media company.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart.com is beautifully organized, easy to use and
jam-packed with practical information you can actually use, such as
how to get all the wrinkles out of a linen tablecloth or select the
right type of homeowner's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   MarthaStewart.com also has an extensive e-commerce section,
where the truly devoted can purchase some of the items used to
create various projects demonstrated in the magazine and on TV. It
may be a little heavy on the e-commerce links, but this is the only
place to get the actual items Martha uses and recommends, and her
company is smart enough to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Web version of Martha Stewart is useful and interesting.
Although Martha has final say, the tone is a little easier to take
than the stern taskmaster of print and video. The information on
the Web site is written a crisp, clear, no-nonsense manner, but
Martha's schoolmarmish tone is nowhere to be found.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who wishes they could cook, garden or craft like
Martha without actually having to put up with Martha, the Web site
is a refreshing, highly recommended alternative.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a while before Martha Stewart the person understands
what her viewers want her to do with the Web, but Martha Stewart
the businesswoman understands how to use the Web to her very best
advantage.

 &HT;    Some free stuff offered on the Internet is actually free
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The world is full of free offers. There's the classic
advertising ploy called _ in the trade _ BOGOF (buy one, get one
free). If you leaf through almost any newspaper or magazine you'll
find offers for free subscriptions, free catalogs, free
installation of car stereos _the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   The magic word ``free'' is also a big deal on the Internet. As
you'd expect, there are dozens of Web sites devoted to bringing you
the opportunity to sign up for almost any kind of free offer you
can imagine. So today, at absolutely no cost to you, we'll look at
some of the sites that guide you to free offers.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep in mind that there is no true free lunch and that many
of these offers may end up charging shipping costs, or be
contingent on you buying something. So let the non-buyer beware.
</P>
<P>
   The first site is called The Original Totally Free Stuff and can
be found at www.totallyfreestuff.com/. The free offers here are
conveniently lumped into categories such as books, clothing,
coupons, audio, educational, e-mail accounts and hardware. One nice
feature of the site is a listing _ always found on the opening page
_ of free offers that have recently been added.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, on a recent visit, there were new offers for a
free mouse pad, a six-month magazine subscription and the seemingly
incredible offer of $75 free. But if you follow the link to sign up
for the free money, you'll earn that, to get it, you have to agree
to sign up for a telephone service and an Internet service. Which
just goes to show that not everything is free, even on a site
called Totally Free.
</P>
<P>
   Volition.com calls itself ``the oldest free stuff site'' on the
Net. It can be found, logically enough, at
www.volition.com/free.html. Just as was true with our first site,
you'll find free offers listed by category. Some of the categories
include home furnishings, credit cards, toys, pet supplies and
family fun.
</P>
<P>
   Just as was true with the first site, not all the free offers
offer free stuff. For instance, here's an offer you'll find at the
site:
</P>
<P>
   ``Receive a free $25 SuperCertificate from GiftCertificates .com
when you are approved for a Discover Platinum Card.''
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, you can also sign up for a free online
chat with a psychic.
</P>
<P>
   Next let's stop in at a site called Get-it-for-Free at
www.get-it-for-free.com/. You'll find the now-familiar free
mousepad offer there, too. Among other offers, you can get a free
rubber stamp (you'll pay $2.39 in shipping and handling costs to
get your free stamp); coupons that are said to be worth $100; and
an offer for a free Neopet (you'll have to travel to the site to
find out what a Neopet is).
</P>
<P>
   TheFreeSite.com at www.thefreesite.com/ calls itself ``the best
place to find freebies, freeware, free stuff, samples, games'' and
it does seem _ on casual observation _ to be one of the best of the
bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the offers here include services that offer free e-mail
and free Internet service, free postcards, free games and free MP3
computer audio files.
</P>
<P>
   You may find more legitimately free offers here than on the
other sites. Even so, don't expect to get a free BMW or trip to
Hawaii. But the allure of the free offer _ to those caught in its
trance _ may be more important than the product.

   BLACK-HOLES (San Francisco) _ They're the vacuum cleaners of the

&HT;     EARLY LOVE OF CATSKILLS INSPIRES RANGER'S BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;     By DOUG BLACKBURN

<P>
   HAINES FALLS, N.Y. _ Edward Henry is a hybrid. Part tour guide,
part student, Henry is also a blend of scientist, historian and
artist.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that explains why hiking with Henry along the eastern
escarpment of the Catskill Mountains is such a unique experience.
The former Eagle Scout studies and explains the cycles of emerging
mountain laurel and wild blueberries, all the while showing his
guest the breathtaking vistas to the south and west that inspired
Thomas Cole and other painters.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is beginning a new project in the mountains that he
considers his second home. He wants to pinpoint the various
locations where Cole and other members of the Hudson River School
painted their famous romantic landscapes. Then he plans to
photograph those views, roughly a century and a half later, to
compare how the ever-evolving Catskills have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone's ever done a real accurate examination
of the landscapes these painters depicted then versus how they look
now,'' Henry said, removing a faded black Baltimore Orioles cap to
wipe his brow. ``I'm thinking this might make a nice
coffee-table-type book.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another element that is at Henry's core:
author. The 30-year-old public affairs specialist with the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service has in the past few weeks published his
first book, ``Catskill Trails: A Ranger's Guide to the High Peaks''
(Black Dome Press, $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   The informative guide is far more than a basic catalog of the
various hikes available in the region, which receives considerably
less recreational traffic than the Adirondack Mountains. That's
because it reflects Henry's multifaceted fascination with the
Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   He started writing the book a decade ago when he was an
undergraduate at Binghamton University. A native of West Hurley, in
Ulster County, Henry became familiar with the rugged terrain west
of the Hudson River as a youth. But a camping trip during his
sophomore year in college to Woodland Valley, during which he hiked
to Wittenberg and Giant Ledge, changed him forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The views during that camping trip were just incredible,''
Henry recalled. ``We looked down into the Ashokan Reservoir and it
simply sparkled. In the distant horizon we could see Vermont,
Massachusetts and Connecticut. It was awesome, and I was hooked.''
</P>
<P>
   During the next six years, as he completed a master's degree in
forest ecology at Syracuse University, Henry continued to explore
the Catskills' rocky trails, cataloging his observations and
researching the specific history of the various areas.
</P>
<P>
   He was also writing about each adventure and taking photographs,
putting together what he envisioned as a coffee-table book.
</P>
<P>
   However, Debbie Allen and Steve Hoare, the editors at Black Dome
Press in Hensonville, had other ideas. When they read Henry's
manuscript they saw an opportunity to publish a hiker's companion
guide with a fresh perspective, a soft-cover book that belongs in a
backpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catskill Trails'' is the first of two books by Henry that
Black Dome is putting out. Book One, which started appearing in
bookstores in late May, focuses on the northern Catskills, from
Mount Utsayantha to the west to Kaaterskill High Peak just seven
miles from the Hudson River. Book Two, scheduled to be released
next year, is devoted to the southern Catskills, the region that in
the mid-1800s was often referred to as the Shandaken Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Henry no longer lives in New York. For almost three years he and
his wife, Kerry, have lived in Pennsylvania near the Delaware Water
Gap. Henry commutes to Pleasantville, N.J., across the bay from
Atlantic City, where he is stationed with the Fish and Wildlife
Service.
</P>
<P>
   But he regularly returns to his home turf, usually with his
American Eskimo dog, Arctic, in tow. Hiking and bushwhacking _
going off the trail to a particular destination _ are among his
favorite activities, and the Catskills are his favorite
destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most people realize how accessible the Catskills
are,'' Henry said. ``There are a lot of easy hikes that take only a
morning or part of an afternoon. These mountains are as easy or as
hard as you want them to be.''

&HT;     RONNIE MILSAP RELISHES MUSIC AND HIS MANY HIT SONGS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JOHN GOODSPEED  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Ronnie Milsap faced a difficult decision in the
mid 1960s _ follow through on a scholarship in Atlanta and become a
lawyer, or play music.
</P>
<P>
   If he hadn't quit college, Milsap said in a telephone interview
from Nashville, Tenn., ``I'd probably be in Atlanta _ and they sure
don't need any more lawyers over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Milsap's choice led him to become one of the most successful
artists in country music history. For the first time, Milsap's
colossal collection of chart toppers is now available in one
package, Virgin Records Nashville's ``40 1 Hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Only the late Conway Twitty had more country hits, but those
included duets with Loretta Lynn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the secret is, just do your work, man, and things
happen,'' Milsap said. ``You just do what you love to do. Music is
my baseball, my tennis or my golf _ it's an avocation and a
vocation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work, but most of the time it's fun. And I wound up
here at the year 2000 with 40 No. 1 records. I'm just proud to have
been part of something like this for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Milsap's string of No. 1 hits began with a triple in 1974:
``Pure Love,'' ``Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends'' and
``(I'd Be) A Legend in My Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some top 10 songs followed in 1975, but he nailed six No. 1s in
a row beginning in late 1976 and stayed in the top 10 for the next
15 years. Through the mid-1980s, such pop crossovers as ``It Was
Almost Like a Song'' and ``Smoky Mountain Rain'' secured his
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Milsap blurred lines between hard-core country, R&AMP;B, soul, '50s
rock and other forms of pop, causing occasional controversy but
winning six Grammy and eight Country Music Association awards.
</P>
<P>
   Milsap declines to pick a song he likes the most, much like a
good parent won't choose a favorite child.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've all been kind of like children in some ways,'' he
said, explaining the long nurturing process _ finding a song,
getting the right people in the studio, fitting it all together
just so and then sending it out to mature on its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole thing of making records, it's a bunch of voodoo
anyway,'' Milsap said. ``It's not nearly as planned as you'd
think.''
</P>
<P>
   Milsap's magic resulted in not just one career song, one that
not only defines an artist but raises the bar for his next effort,
but 10.
</P>
<P>
   He considers ``Pure Love,'' his first No. 1, as a career song,
along with several remakes _ Kris Kristofferson's ``Please Don't
Tell Me How the Story Ends,'' Don Gibson's ``(I'd Be) A Legend in
My Time'' and Al Dexter's 1944 ``Too Late to Worry, To Blue to
Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Daydreams About Night Things' is the next big thing that
happened because it was a song that was totally identifiable with
me that nobody else had done before,'' Milsap said.
</P>
<P>
   He was with songwriter John Schweers at Charlie Pride's
publishing company when ``John read that Olivia Newton John had
made a comment in a magazine that she'd been having daydreams about
night things. He jumped up and said, `I'm going to write a song
about that.' It made a lot of noise at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are ``It Was Almost Like a Song,'' pop crossovers ``Smoky
Mountain Rain'' and ``Getting Over Me,'' ``Stranger in My House''
and ``Lost in the Fifties Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Milsap surmounted a number of obstacles to get where he is. Born
blind and in poverty in the Appalachian town of Robbinsville, N.C.,
he was sent to a state school for the blind in Raleigh. His
instructors noticed his musical talents and he mastered the violin,
guitar, woodwinds and his trademark piano.
</P>
<P>
   As a young adult, Milsap didn't rush into country music. He sang
R&AMP;B in Atlanta first and had a hit with ``Never Had It So Good.''
He met his wife of 34 years, Joyce, moved to Memphis and did
session work _ keyboards on Elvis Presley's ``Kentucky Rain'' and
singing harmony on ``Don't Cry Daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   When his R&AMP;B career sagged, he moved to Nashville, hooked up
with Charley Pride's manager, Jack Johnson, and signed with RCA, an
association that continued until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Milsap is busy preparing to tour in support of ``40 1 Hits,''
which features two new, uptempo songs with a new sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producer Scott Hendricks said he was going to drag me into the
new century,'' Milsap said, ``and he did with `Livin' On Love'' and
`Time, Love and Money,''' which will hit the radio on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   Milsap also is selecting songs for his next Virgin Nashville
album, which he says will feature more contemporary tunes along
with others reminiscent of his older work.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes his new efforts will add to his list of hits, although
he's happy where he is, working with his son, Todd, as production
manager and lighting director, and being a grandfather of two young
girls with a grandson on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music is the business I'm in,'' Milsap said, ``but I'd be
doing this whether I got paid or not.''

 &HT;    AMID PEACE TALKS, BARAK FACES CALLS FOR NEW ELECTIONS
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ While negotiators try clear the way for a peace
summit, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's political opponents Wednesday
tied to take his Israeli government to the brink.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's parliament voted 61-48 for preliminary passage of a
bill calling for new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The move does not mean the immediate downfall of Barak's
year-old government. The bill would have to pass several more
procedural steps that could take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Also, some of those voting for the measure may have just been
making a symbolic show of dissatisfaction in an attempt to win
leverage over nuts-and-bolts domestic Israeli issues.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle will likely prove a distraction to Barak as he
moves ahead with peace talks with the Palestinians and attempts to
rekindle stalled talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright returned to Washington on
Wednesday after talking to all sides. U.S. officials are pushing
for progress in the closing seven months of President Clinton's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Syrian talks focus on the Golan Heights, a plateau that
Israel captured in 1967. The talks broke down in January.
</P>
<P>
   Albright met in Cairo Wednesday with Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk Al-Sharaa, but no concrete progress was made toward getting
the two sides back to negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of slight progress the night before, U.S. officials in
Jerusalem said that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators would meet
next week in Washington. They are trying to reach an outline for a
permanent peace. American officials want to seal the deal in a
still-unscheduled summit meeting between Barak and Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   But officials from all sides say large gaps remain on most
issues. Especially contentious are the emotional issues of whether
Jerusalem, now controlled by Israel, can be shared, and whether
Palestinian refugees who lost homes in Israel can ever return.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's domestic troubles are largely not about these issues,
but rather grow out of the fractious nature of Israeli politics.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's parliamentary move was lead by the ultra-religious
Shas Party. The party is the second largest member of Barak's
government, but has been complaining that it does not receive
enough government money for its system of religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's minister of education, Yossi Sarid, is from the
stridently secular Meretz Party and has accused Shas's schools of
widespread mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   Shas has threatened to bring the government down before, but has
been satisfied at the last minute by concessions from Barak. This
time, Barak has refused to deal. It prompted one Israeli columnist
to liken the former general to movie tough guy Chuck Norris.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has reportedly threatened to fire members of his cabinet,
mainly from Shas, who voted for the new elections bill. But his
allies said Wednesday that they expected no moves immediately.
</P>
<P>
   More deals could still bring Shas into the fold. Also, the prime
minister reportedly is considering rebuilding his ruling coalition
without Shas.
</P>
<P>
   One prevalent theory is that Barak could limp along until he
reaches a deal with the Palestinians, then, with the momentum of
that achievement, call for new elections himself.

PLANE TICKET FOR ROCKER? NO, A PINK SLIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves made the right decision when they shipped
motormouth relief pitcher John Rocker to the minor leagues. But why
won't the team take credit for doing the right thing?
</P>
<P>
   Braves' management insisted that Rocker got the boot because he
wasn't pitching well _ not because he's an insufferable creep who
embarrasses the team, infuriates his teammates and insults the
paying customers. Team honchos said that Rocker's demotion was in
the works long before he berated and threatened a sportswriter
Sunday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The object of Rocker's latest outburst, by the way, was the very
same Sports Illustrated writer whose December story quoted
statements by Rocker that clearly branded the Atlanta pitcher as a
race-baiting, gay-hating, xenophobic nitwit. The fallout for Rocker
included a two-week suspension and a $500 fine, not to mention the
lingering resentment of teammates such as Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press quoted Jordan:
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got one guy being a cancer time and time again.
Eventually, it's going to have an effect on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves obviously decided that the cancer needed to be
excised _ or at least exiled. So they told Rocker to pack his bags
and report to their Triple-A farm club at Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Braves chose to blame Rocker's lousy pitching _ 25
walks in 18 innings _ rather than his lousy personality because
they were afraid of antagonizing Rocker partisans in Atlanta who
routinely jump to their feet and cheer when this moron enters a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe they figured that demoting Rocker for failing to
control his fastball would hold up better against a challenge by
the players' union than demoting him for failure to control his
temper. Commissioner Bud Selig, don't forget, wanted to fine Rocker
$20,000 and suspend him for a month after the Sports Illustrated
article was published, but the punishment was reduced by an
arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. The game of baseball is so hopelessly dysfunctional
that even when it does the right thing, it does it for the wrong
reason.
</P>
<P>
   At least one baseball pundit speculated Tuesday that Rocker
would never return to the Braves, and he must know more about it
than those of us who only read about this stuff in the papers. But
as an on-again, off-again _ mostly on-again _ boycotter of
major-league baseball, I'll believe it when I see it.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that Rocker was merely banished in anticipation of a
Braves' trip to New York to play the Mets later this month? New
Yorkers, after all, were the primary targets of Rocker's insulting
comments last December.
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker starts looking like his old self on the pitcher's
mound, on the other hand, couldn't the Braves decide that his
potential ability to mow down Met batters outweighs the furor he
will cause in the Big Apple?
</P>
<P>
   We'll know soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, the Braves ought to give Rocker his walking papers
_ no matter what the cost, no matter what the reaction of some
misguided fans who seem to revere him as an icon of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't about free speech, folks. Rocker is certainly
entitled to his opinions, however disgusting they may be, but he is
not entitled to embarrass his employer or malign its customers or
spit in the face of the public that pays his salary. He most
definitely is not entitled to threaten sportswriters simply because
they have the audacity to report his malignant rantings.
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured that if Rocker can get away with assaulting and/or
threatening reporters, it will be no time at all before he is
assaulting and/or threatening fans. And if one day he leaps into
the stands to beat up a patron who annoys him, what will Braves'
management do about it? Send him back to Richmond?
</P>
<P>
   If the onetime national pastime hopes to regain its
once-cherished place in the hearts of American sports fans, it must
purge the rampant perception that the game is populated by
arrogant, self-indulgent jerks. It could start by purging John
Rocker.

Democratic Party will be named by the White House to an important
trade post involving Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nominee, George Chao-Chi Chu, was the focus of
federal investigations into business practices, he has never been
charged with any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced Tuesday that he intended to name
Chu, 43, to the government's Advisory Committee on Trade Policy
Negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Chu's Da Tung Trading Company does business in Europe, China,
Taiwan and Japan. Chu said the company buys expensive cognacs and
liqueurs in France and sells them in China, Taiwan and Japan;
invests in commercial real estate in China, Taiwan and Japan; and
exports American computer and solar equipment to Japan and Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working in trade matters for a long time, and I'm
happy to provide my expertise and be able to help our president to
make policy,'' Chu said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he favors free trade with ``any country in the world,''
but thought he could be especially useful as the United States and
China move toward normalized trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-1997, at a time when the party and the Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign were under fire for their fund-raising
practices, Chu had contributed more than $500,000 to the Democrats
and to events specifically benefiting Clinton, according to federal
campaign contribution records.
</P>
<P>
   More than a third of the money was donated in 1996, the same
year the state of California hit Chu with a $15,700 lien for
personal income taxes dating from 1989. The matter was quickly
settled.
</P>
<P>
   White House and Democratic National Committee (DNC) records also
showed that Chu had donated up to $55,000 through John Huang, the
former Commerce Department official and onetime executive of
Indonesia's Lippo Group. Huang, vice chairman of the DNC's national
finance committee, later was accused of raising more than $1
million in illegal contributions. There was no evidence that Chu's
donations through Huang were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Federal records showed that Chu and five of his brothers and
sisters had been investigated repeatedly between 1985 and 1996 by
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   They were suspected of mislabeling imported alcoholic beverages,
failing to keep proper records and failing to pay back taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Chu was never charged and the only member of his family who
faced enforcement action was his older brother, Michael, also a San
Francisco businessman and a Democratic Party donor.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Chu was suspended from importing activities for a
minimum of 45 days and ordered to pay $80,000 in back taxes, court
records showed.
</P>
<P>
   George Chu said Tuesday that the problem with the federal
government ``was a kind of misunderstanding that has been
resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he no longer contributes so-called soft money to the
DNC. He said he has made no decision yet about supporting Vice
President Al Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Current campaign finance records show that, subsequent to
mid-1997, Chu made at least eight donations totaling more than
$30,000 to the California Democratic Party; to Sen. Charles
Schumer, D-N.Y.; Sen. Tim Johnson, D-S.D.; and the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokeswoman said she could not comment immediately
on the Clinton administration's investigative and decision-making
procedures in selecting members of the advisory panel to which Chu
will be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Media interest in the Chu family has sparked criticism by some
members of San Francisco's Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   Rodel Rodis, a lawyer and friend of Chu's, said Tuesday that he
believes Chu would not be getting ``the same scrutiny if he were
not Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the White House, the advisory committee's task is
to provide ``overall policy advice on matters concerning objectives
and bargaining positions before entering into a trade agreement.''
It works closely with the office of the U.S. Trade Representative.
</P>
<P>
   Chu and his brothers and sisters were the children of a former
Taiwanese government official who came to the United States in the
1970s and did business in California through 1982. George Chu took
over the family business after his father's death in 1984.

 &HT;    GATES SKIPS WASHINGTON SOFTWARE SUMMIT
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's top software moguls, including
Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, urged the presumptive Democratic and
Republican presidential candidates Wednesday to regulate the
booming high-tech economy with a light hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next president must commit to a minimalist regulatory
regime based on private sector leadership and responsibility,''
members of the Business Software Alliance said in identical letters
to Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, one of the 13 signers, canceled his scheduled appearance
at a news conference on Capitol Hill. He flew back to Redmond,
Wash., the corporate headquarters, late Tuesday ``in order to be
with his employees'' when the judicial ruling on the Microsoft
antitrust suit came down, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours in advance of the court decision, other members of the
chief executives' panel were reluctant to comment on Microsoft's
fate. ``It's very early to speculate on what is going to be a long
and drawn-out process,'' said Eric Schmidt, chairman and chief
executive of Novell Inc. Microsoft competes with Novell in the
network server market.
</P>
<P>
   But with government antitrust policy on the front burner,
high-tech executives have become more aggressive in pursuing that
issue as well as other controversial matters of concern, such as
Internet privacy and the industry's strongly felt need to hire more
skilled workers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The heightened interest in Washington policy issues has come in
tandem with a sharp increase in campaign funds to incumbents of
both parties by top executives at Microsoft and in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to the forthcoming presidential candidates, the
software chieftains said: ``It is essential that the government not
insert itself as a competitor in private markets providing
technology goods and services, nor seek to excessively regulate
such markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to a question on the government's proper role in
fostering Internet privacy, Schmidt said:: ``We're concerned that
very, very fast action can have unforeseen consequences. ... We
think now is not the time. Give us some more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, the Federal Trade Commission, by a slim
majority, contended that industry self-regulation of Internet
privacy had failed. They called on Congress to legislate firm
consumer safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   Following that agency report, 10 Democratic members of Senate
Commerce Committee announced plans to introduce sweeping privacy
legislation.

&HT;     INTERNET AUCTION HOUSE PLANS E-CHECK PAYMENT OPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. and the leading on-line
auction site eBay Inc. are introducing an option to pay for
purchases over the Internet with an electronic check.
</P>
<P>
   The service could transform the traditional, if somewhat shaky,
honor system that dominates on-line buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   The method mainly benefits small-time auction site sellers who
do not have merchant accounts to receive payment by credit card,
and who do not want to wait the days or weeks that it can take for
buyers to send checks or money orders by mail.
</P>
<P>
   It will also aid on-line buyers who do not use credit cards or
who are still reluctant to give out credit card numbers over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on what we've been able to research with eBay, sellers
have to wait for a buyer to write a check or obtain a money order,
and go to the post office,'' said Debra Rossi, Wells Fargo's vice
president of Business Internet Services. ``It could be weeks before
the seller gets their funds. What we're providing is faster receipt
of your funds, the payment is guaranteed, and it's
cost-effective.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, buyers promised to send payments by mail and
sellers promised to ship goods, and reputations of buyers and
sellers were made and lost on auction sites' feedback bulletin
boards. But more recently, entire industries have sprung up around
such transactions to ensure both parties are satisfied, including
escrow firms that act as clearinghouses to make sure customers are
satisfied with goods and sellers receive their funds.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Kelley, president of i-Escrow Inc., a company that provides
such services for auctions on eBay, Yahoo and Amazon.com, said
features like electronic check payment may boost the completion
rate of auctions by alleviating wariness of on-line fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's significant because it's another arrow in eBay's
quiver of payment options,'' Kelley said. ``It'll be interesting to
see, with the trust consumers have in a large money center like
Wells, if they can get some traction to overcome this wariness
consumers have to disclose their account routing numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The system will require both buyer and seller to provide their
bank routing and account numbers so the cash transfer can take
place.
</P>
<P>
   Rossi said Wells' research showed that 80 percent of the
transactions from on-line auction sites were completed by mail.
Other industry experts say payment delays _ and, less frequently,
lack of any payment _ are of paramount concern to on-line
auctioneers.
</P>
<P>
   But more secure forms of payment have also sprung up, including
person-to-person on-line credit card transactions like the one
announced in April by Billpoint, a joint venture between eBay and
Wells Fargo. Banks usually take fees of 3 to 5 percent to perform
the credit card transactions, while the on-line check costs 35
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Users can be customers of any bank, not necessarily San
Francisco-based Wells Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we want to do is keep the transaction on line, keep the
people on line,'' Rossi said.

&HT;     WIRELESS WEB SURFING ISN'T MAKING WAVES WITH CONSUMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROY BRAGG  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The marshaled forces of high technology are touting wireless
Internet access as the next must-have, something indispensable and
vital to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But a skeptical America looks on indifferently. Wireless devices
are selling, but consumers aren't flocking to the service. Instead,
they are asking: Is this freedom, or is this nonsense?
</P>
<P>
   The corporate excitement over a wireless future is fueled by a
few reports, such as a recent one by wireless research group Ovum
that says 484 million people will make wireless connections by
2005.
</P>
<P>
   But another survey of 800 wireless phone users by The Strategis
Group think tank shows that 66 percent aren't interested in
wireless access to the Internet, and 63 percent don't pine for
wireless e-mail services.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Hswe, a Strategis Group senior analyst, blames that on
the perception that wireless Web service is expensive and phone
displays can't be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Expect that perception to change. Prices are dropping and phone
screens are getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely going to take a while to change minds,'' she
said. ``It's not going to happen in two months. These sort of
things take a while'' to gain popularity).
</P>
<P>
   A road test of the latest in Web-enabled phones shows that
they're all pretty much the same, although phone companies will
tell you differently.
</P>
<P>
   Each phone is text-based, requiring specific, specially designed
Web sites. Each operates between 14.4 and 19.2 kps. Each requires
extensive thumb typing to input specific data on the phone keypad,
though each has set-up procedures that will let a user input basic
personal information once.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel Online is one of the newest entries, offering Web access
starting at $14.95. Wireless minutes don't count against air time.
The three Web-enabled phones start at $99.
</P>
<P>
   The opening menu gives users options to shop Amazon.com and
entry to the MSN Mobile Portal, which includes truncated versions
of MSNBC.com news, weather, sports and financial information.
There's Hotmail.com, a free Web-based e-mail service, and
Expedia.com, which lets travelers check itineraries booked on line.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint, meanwhile, has been advertising the dickens out of its
PCS Wireless Web phones. The company is offering Wireless Web (or
another option) for free with all of its Free and Clear phone
plans. Seventeen models of phone are Web-enabled, Sprint says,
ranging in price from $30 refurbished models to top-of-the-line
versions at 10 times that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the bunch might be the NP 1000 ($300) because of its
huge display window, which shows 11 lines, bigger than most other
phones.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers other Web-enabled models with smaller
screens and other features.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint also has been at this longer, so there are a lot of
offerings on the phone, such as Yahoo.com, CNN.com, Fidelity.com,
Bloomberg.com, FOX Sports.com, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The Sprint phone also comes with software that loads onto your
personal computer, allowing you to synchronize dates, addresses and
memos between the two devices. And with a $100 connection kit, the
phone functions as a modem, providing a 14.4 kps connection. That's
not greased lightning, but it beats tapping out e-mail messages
with your well-worn thumbs on the phone's keypad.
</P>
<P>
   The AT&AMP;T Digital PocketNet service is the latest incarnation of
a product that's been around for years. Using the faster CDPD
system, it offers three tiers of service _ free, $7 and $15 _ with
different levels of unlimited Web access for each.
</P>
<P>
   PocketNet comes on two phones _ a slim $100 Ericsson, and a $200
Mitsubishi, which has a bigger screen.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is the 500-pound gorilla of telecommunications and the
Digital PocketNet service is yet another example of why.
</P>
<P>
   It offers more choices in terms of news, shopping and other
information.
</P>
<P>
   As for specific products, each has pros and cons.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless phones do provide basic Internet information, but at
the expense of your thumbs and your time.
</P>
<P>
   In a couple of years, wireless service will stream at broadband
speed, meaning there will be more stuff available, such as video,
music and serious file-downloading. By then, voice-activated
technology will give your thumbs a break.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, frequent travelers will get the most benefit.
They can confirm reservations, get directions, and check e-mail
while out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   Day traders will like these things, since they can get alerts
and consummate stock transactions instantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,''' said Strategis' Hwse. ``You go to
Starbucks, order a caffe latte and you're sitting down. Now what do
you do? You read a book. You read the paper. Well, when wireless
Internet becomes more available, it'll replace certain activities
we do now.''
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of us, a wireless phone's usefulness might be
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Using a wireless phone to speak while driving is dangerous
enough. Imagine trying to tap out the name of the restaurant ``The
Magic Time Machine'' on the ``Find A'' site while driving 70 mph.
To use it safely, a driver would have to pull over.
</P>
<P>
   If you're pulling over, why not just stop at a gas station and
ask for directions? Or dial 411, call the restaurant, and get
directions the old-fashioned way?
</P>
<P>
   Why spend time squinting at news stories on a phone? Turn on the
car radio. Buy a paper.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe wait a few years until the promise of the wireless Web
is realized.

one of the lasting ironies of the 2000 campaign may prove to be
that the ``lightweight'' Bush grabbed the intellectual edge from

   KFAR KILA, LEBANON _ As a procession of helicopters swept in to
land, loudspeakers blasted Wagner's ``Ride of the Valkyries'' over
the hillsides southern Lebanon. The U.N. peacekeepers' noisy
display was a deliberate reference to the Vietnam War, as depicted
in the film ``Apocalypse Now.'' Pundits had predicted an apocalypse
in Lebanon if Israel made good its promise to withdraw from the
country's southern fringes even without a peace deal with Syria.
But the Israeli-Lebanese border has remained remarkably quiet since
Israel's army retreated to its side on May 24, ending a 22-year
occupation. &QL;

was a tough place for greens. Where the right laws existed, they

plenty of space and careless habits meant that few Russians took
environmental housekeeping seriously. Now, a mix of business
interests, criminal activity and government paranoia threatens to
make matters far worse. On top of all this, the new government of
Vladimir Putin announced ambitious plans on May 25 to build 40 new
fast-breeder nuclear-power station in Russia over the next 30

political activism that his electoral shenanigans have unleashed? &QL;

   RICHMOND, VA. _ Once, America's trucking industry was a cozy,
regulated semi-cartel, with a few big companies dominating most
regions. CB radio and the call of the open road made every boy
dream of one day driving his own 18-wheel rig. But when
deregulation hit in the 1980s, the business quickly lost its charm.
Yet a radical transformation of the trucking industry is now under
way, thanks to e-business. CB radio has given way to e-mail, GPS
tracking and wired hubs. Who knows? As e-commerce restores
trucking's glory days, a new generation of kids might even dream of
being truckers again. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ An etymology researcher has discovered that the
ubiquitous computer term ``software'' was coined way ahead of its
time _ though in a quite different context. Back in 1850,
``soft-ware'' and ``hard-ware'' were terms used by trash-can
scavengers to distinguish compost from non-biodegradable matter. So
a Victorian would have been baffled by the modern use of the
term.... Garbage in, garbage out, as computer programmers like to
say. &QL;

CHARLES AND CAMILLA REWRITE THE FAIRY TALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The tabloids used to call her The Other Woman. Now
they're calling her The Next Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Never has a mistress of an heir to the throne undergone a more
swift and thorough rehabilitation than has Camilla Parker Bowles,
Prince Charles' longtime consort.
</P>
<P>
   When the prince's mother, Queen Elizabeth II, ended her
prolonged snub of Parker Bowles and exchanged pleasantries with her
during a barbecue at the prince's Highgrove estate last Saturday,
the tabloids breathlessly suggested a royal wedding was in the air.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when it emerged that Parker Bowles has been holding
secret talks with the Archbishop of Canterbury, even the staid BBC
reported that speculation was rife that the Prince of Wales and his
mistress planned to eventually marry. Because the prince is a
divorcee, the Church of England, of which he is titular governor,
would have to approve of his remarrying.
</P>
<P>
   But while the British people seem to have forgiven Parker Bowles
for being the other woman in a love triangle that doomed the
fairytale marriage of Charles and Diana, Princess of Wales, there
are no signs they want her as their queen.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been no reliable polling done, telephone polls
by the tabloids suggest the prince should proceed with caution.
While 68 percent of readers polled by the Mirror said they wanted
the couple to marry, 83 percent said Parker Bowles should never be
queen.
</P>
<P>
   But if Charles decides to marry her, the public won't have a
say. According to David Starkey, the constitutional historian whose
television show on the life of Elizabeth I was a surprise ratings
success in Britain last week, the law is quite clear that whoever
is married to Charles if or when he becomes king will be queen.
Starkey says that if Buckingham Palace doesn't want Camilla to
become queen, the palace will have to petition the government to
change the law.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Charles and Parker Bowles, who is also divorced, have
insisted all along that they have no intentions of marrying. But
there is a growing belief here that the carefully choreographed
rehabilitation of both their images is aimed at making their
relationship more acceptable to his potential subjects. Bookmakers
here, generally accurate barometers of public opinion, this week
lowered the odds of their marriage from 3-1 to 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The prince's aides at St. James's Palace were stunned and elated
16 months ago when the couple's first public appearance together at
the Ritz Hotel was greeted with widespread approval or, at worst,
indifference by most Britons.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, there has been a seemingly calibrated increase in
the couple's public appearances, while the Queen's decision on
Saturday to grant Parker Bowles not only an audience but cordial
conversation was seen as the boldest step to rehabilitate a couple
who only a few years ago were seen by many as cruel adulterers who
drove Diana to a lonely pursuit of affection and, eventually, her
death with a reckless playboy in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   While the tabloids crank out the violin music, not everyone is
cheering for love to prevail. Ros Coward, a writer, is less than
impressed by what she sees as a mundane relationship that is being
milked cynically by both the royal family and the tabloids they
profess to hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This blanket coverage is not just tedious. It's maddening,''
Coward complained in The Guardian. ``Since Princess Diana's death,
royal coverage has been relatively muted. Uncertainty about just
how far public distate distaste for the whole royal family had gone
has kept this stuff off the front page. Now the signs are the press
is heading back _ no holds barred _ to royal fantasyland.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the more serious papers that support the monarchy seem as
accepting of the increasingly public relationship as the tabloids,
which cynically milk the royals for circulation. But while The
Times predicted a marriage within five years, the biggest-selling
conservative papers, The Mail and The Daily Telegraph, urged
caution. The Telegraph urged the prince to consider the
relationship ``not so much a moral matter as one of taste and
tact.''
</P>
<P>
   Coward, ever the cynic, thinks the British people will soon tire
of the hysteria, and a couple she sees as horsey, tweedy, and
boring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to imagine Camilla's life ever resonating with
anyone outside the hunting set,'' Coward said. ``Editors might be
rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of the next episodes
in the royal soap _ family reconciliation, engagement, marriage _
but the tedious saga of this odd couple is more likely to be a
total ratings disaster.''

AMERICANS SHOULD DOMINATE AT THE GAMES DOWN UNDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cargo ships, loaded with tables, chairs, computers, judo
mats, and a volleyball floor, already are headed across the
Pacific. The horses, sailboats, kayaks, and racing shells will
follow later. By mid-August, the 600 athletes will be outfitted and
given physicals at a San Diego naval facility before flying across
the international date line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like going to war,'' said Greg Harney, the US
Olympic Committee's director of international games preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The Games of the XXVIIth Olympiad are still 100 days off, but
the American expeditionary force already is gearing up for its
longest trip since the 1988 Games in Seoul. And though Uncle Sam's
athletes never have performed as well on the road as they have at
home (they haven't topped the medal table at a foreign Olympics
since 1968 in Mexico City), that will change this time.
</P>
<P>
   While the Americans probably will win fewer than 90 medals,
their lightest haul since 1960, they'll still be well ahead of the
rest of the world. The breakup of the Soviet Union into 15 pieces
and the disappearance of East Germany has everything to do with
that.
</P>
<P>
   Had the former USSR competed as one nation in Atlanta, as it did
(as the Unified Team) in Barcelona in 1992, it would have grabbed
123 medals to the Americans' 101. Alone, the Russians won but 63 in
1996. And the combined Germany won barely half as many medals (65)
as the drug-fueled DDR did by itself in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the benefit of home cooking, the Yanks still should
get fat Down Under. The track and field team is still No. 1. The
swimmers should match the Aussies medal for medal in their home
pool. And the basketball squads should sweep again. Some things
about the Games don't change, whatever the latitude.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 15-hour flight from California will be daunting (``I
tell them it's nine hours, 360 minutes _ it sounds better,'' said
Harney), it means that the Americans also will be 15 hours away
from the U-S-A! U-S-A! pressure-cooker they labored in last time.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bela Karolyi, the women's gymnastics team coordinator,
``All the media reminders about medals, the promises of this and
that, the we're-going-to-beat-the world . . . It might be more
favorable for us in Sydney than if the Games were at home.''
</P>
<P>
   A look at the US medal prospects:
</P>
<P>
   ARCHERY: Even with Justin Huish (drug charges) and Shane Parker
(cheating at trials) off the roster, the men still have a shot at a
team medal. But there will be no double gold this time, and the
women are still off-target.
</P>
<P>
   BADMINTON: The Americans are literally a one-man team (Kevin
Han), and he'll be happy to survive the first round.
</P>
<P>
   BASEBALL: Boggsie wearing the stars and stripes? If a few Hall
of Famers can be coaxed out of recent retirement to play alongside
top minor leaguers, the US could upgrade from bronze to gold. But
the Japanese and Koreans will be using their pros, too.
</P>
<P>
   BASKETBALL: Since the Dream Team showed up at Barcelona, the US
males haven't come close to losing a game. The women have won three
of the last four titles. Double gold _ again.
</P>
<P>
   BOXING: Best team since 1976? Possibly. The US won four world
titles in their home ring last year and three of the victors (light
flyweight Brian Viloria, featherweight Ricardo Juarez, heavyweight
Michael Bennett) made the Olympic team. But matching the five golds
by Sugar Ray &AMP; Co. at Montreal is a pipedream.
</P>
<P>
   CANOE/KAYAK: Where have you gone, Greg Barton? Gold medals are
fantasies for the paddlers these days. But a silver from Scott
Shipley in the kayak slalom is within reach.
</P>
<P>
   CYCLING: Better hope Lance Armstrong stays in the saddle. If he
does, there could be a medal of each color, with Marty Nothstein in
the match sprint and Alison Dunlap in mountain biking.
</P>
<P>
   DIVING: Last time, the Americans were off the gold standard for
the first time since 1912. This time, they could be off the podium
entirely. Somebody had better make sure Mark Ruiz gets his wakeup
calls.
</P>
<P>
   EQUESTRIAN: The US was the only country to make the medal stand
in all three team events in Atlanta. A repeat is possible _ but so
is a handful of fourths.
</P>
<P>
   FENCING: No American has won a medal against a full Olympic
field since Albert Axelrod in 1960, but Iris Zimmermann could do it
in women's foil. A bronze would seem like gold.
</P>
<P>
   FIELD HOCKEY: Neither team qualified.
</P>
<P>
   GYMNASTICS: How can they top Atlanta? The Magnificent Seven
capped the best showing ever (five medals) at a non-boycotted
Games, but the entire program took a tumble at the next world meet.
A gold medal is unlikely _ the US has won only one (Trent Dimas in
1992) at an overseas Games in 76 years. But bronzes from the
women's team and Blaine Wilson in the men's all-around are worth
betting on.
</P>
<P>
   HANDBALL: Neither team qualified.
</P>
<P>
   JUDO: No Yank ever has won Olympic gold in Japan's national
pastime, but Lawrence's Jim Pedro is lightweight world champ. On
his best day, he's the man.
</P>
<P>
   MODERN PENTATHLON: The medals have dried up (none since 1984) as
George Patton's old sport has dropped off the radar screen. But new
face Chad Senior could slip in for a bronze if the planets align
for him.
</P>
<P>
   ROWING: The star-spangled flotilla hasn't won gold against a
full Olympic field since 1964 but the men's eight, three-time world
champs, has the goods. If the women can outpull nemesis Romania,
the daily double is there. Pencil in the lightweight women's double
of Sarah Garner and Worcester's Christine Collins for a silver.
</P>
<P>
   SAILING: After the worst showing in 60 years (two bronzes),
anything has to be an improvement over Atlanta. But the US sailors
won't come anywhere near the nine medals they won eight years ago.
Three _ in Star, Europe, and men's 470 _ is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING: The trapshooters bagged one of each last time behind
deadeye Kim Rhode. Now, things are looking up on the rifle range,
too, with world champ Thomas Tamas. If they keep their powder dry,
the Yanks could fire off half a dozen medals.
</P>
<P>
   SOCCER: Last hurrah for the women, who'll need their A game and
then some to hold off the Chinese. The men, loaded with MLS pros,
should make the quarters, but a medal is still a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   SOFTBALL: The US women still rule the world but the days of
knockouts and no-hitters are over. The Australians and Chinese can
match them inning for inning now. The price of gold is sharply
higher overseas.
</P>
<P>
   SWIMMING: The wet set hit a gold rush with a stunning 13 in
Atlanta. Matching that against the cranked-up Aussies in their own
chlorine is a tall order, but the Americans could do it. The Jenny
(Thompson) and Lenny (Krayzelburg) Show might be good for four
between them, the relays are worth at least three, and there are
enough soloists like vets Amy Van Dyken and Tom Dolan to pick up
another half-dozen.
</P>
<P>
   SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING: The days of slam-dunk gold are over. The
Americans now rank behind the Russians and Japanese in the team
event and their best man in the duet (Bill May) is staying home
because he's a man.
</P>
<P>
   TABLE TENNIS: Ping-Pong diplomacy has its limits. The Chinese
yield nothing at this table. The US won't survive the prelims.
</P>
<P>
   TAEKWONDO: It may be a Korean thing, but the Americans may be
able to kick their way to a medal or two. Juan Moreno has the best
shot.
</P>
<P>
   TENNIS: The Americans parlayed the home-court advantage into
three gold medals under Georgia's sizzling sun. Olympus isn't the
Australian Open, but Andre Agassi and Lindsay Davenport could
repeat.
</P>
<P>
   TRACK AND FIELD: Last time, the Yanks won more medals (23) than
the next three countries combined. Even with half a dozen fewer,
they'll still top the table. Maurice Greene, Michael Johnson,
Marion Jones, and Inger Miller are good for five golds in the
sprints, the relays should produce three and there should be four
more in the men's shot (C.J. Hunter) and discus (Anthony
Washington) and the women's hurdles (Gail Devers) and pole vault
(Stacy Dragila).
</P>
<P>
   TRIATHLON: America may have invented the Ironman but the Aussies
are the iron, especially in their shark-flavored waters. A bronze
from Barb Lindquist, though, is reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   VOLLEYBALL: The indoor teams, who crashed in Atlanta, are still
under construction. The medals, again, are on the beach, but there
may only be one this time _ a bronze from the women.
</P>
<P>
   WATER POLO: The men washed out in Atlanta and the women are
making their debut. Both should be respectable, but medals appear
out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   WEIGHTLIFTING: Cheryl Haworth, the 16-year-old Samsonette,
figures to hoist the first US medal against a full field since
1976. No chance for the men _ unless they pump up on funny
vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   WRESTLING: After grabbing eight medals at each of the last two
Games, the Americans may have to settle for half as many this time.
But three of them (with freestylers Steve Neal, Lincoln McIlravy
and Les Gutches) could be gold.

ACHIEVEMENT TEST IS NOT ONLY SILLY, IT'S RACIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The difference between a diploma and doomsday cannot possibly
come down to a byzantine trivial pursuit. That is, unless you can
make the implausible case that six or seven years from now, when
these students are trembling job applicants, that their bosses will
look them dead in the eye and actually ask:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm, your resume looks interesting, but to get this job you
must tell me why King Henry issued the Edict of Nantes, the purpose
of the Treaty of Tordesillas, and the function of the lord of the
estate in medieval Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are real _ or surreal _ requests of students from last
month's Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System 10th-grade
history and social sciences test. Some educators let me read the
full test last week.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents, educators, and business leaders are already
concerned about the more subjective aspects of the MCAS. Some have
called for any high stakes testing for graduation in 2003 to be
limited to basic literacy and math.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-grade history test should call into question the
political intentions of the entire test. At best, it is silly. At
worst, it is racist.
</P>
<P>
   The test, which focuses on ``world'' history, had 57 items.
There are 12 slightly different forms of the test. Of the 57 items,
about 40 referred to Europe, from the Byzantine Empire to the Cold
War. Five are questions about capitalism. Only 12 are about the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   For Europe, students needed specifics on wars, innovations,
cities, and individual writers, economists and artists. They had to
know, ``In 1429, which military commander led a French army that
defeated the English at Orleans? A. Joan of Arc; B. Catherine the
Great; C. Napoleon Bonaparte; D. Charlemagne.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the MCAS really should be renamed the Mutual
Charlemagne Admiration Society. The founder of the first empire in
western Europe after the fall of Rome was also in this question:
``Many separate groups attacked Charlemagne's empire. The fiercest
of these groups came from the north and was known as the A.
Magyars; B. Visigoths; C. Huns; D. Vikings.''
</P>
<P>
   Students were given detailed maps of Eurasia and asked if the
dotted routes represent the Crusades or the spice trade. About all
students got for Africa was a bare outline of the continent and
asked to point out the desert _ where there are no people to have a
history. Asians are reduced to shoguns, samurais, and the split
between China and Taiwan. Latin America is but a colonial appendage
of Europe, and women, other than Joan of Arc and Catherine the
Great, are almost invisible.
</P>
<P>
   One teacher told me the heads of black and brown students of
color slumped lower and lower during the history test. ``We work so
hard at teaching them useful information and critical thinking
skills and then we give them a test that tells them that their
people are nothing,'' she said. ``It's crushing.''
</P>
<P>
   Telling African-American and Latino students their history is
worth nothing is having a crushing effect. The failure rate for
African-American and Latino on last year's 8th-grade history test
was 77 percent and 85 percent, respectively, higher than even their
well-publicized failure rates in math. The effect is so crushing
that questions must be answered before the state can proceed to the
2003 deadline for any section of the test. It is not enough to can
the history part, for it may also be a Freudian slip about math and
English. Is it a mere coincidence that the same state that so
easily renders people of color nonexistent in world history also
has no plan to give failing students the courses they need to pass
the 10th grade math test?
</P>
<P>
   A test that shows if students are literate is fine. A test that
is mired in a trivially narrow vision of yesterday is cruel.
American thinker William James said, ``Things learned thus in a few
hours, on one occasion, for one purpose, cannot possibly have
formed many associations with other things in the mind. Their
brain-processes are led into by few paths, and are relatively
little liable to be awakened again. Speedy oblivion is the almost
inevitable fate of all that is committed to memory in this simple
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Speedy oblivion is where the MCAS history test should go.

THOUSANDS IN US TURN TO ANCIENT AFRICAN RELIGION YORUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Some people start their day with a prayer or
meditation. Tony Van Der Meer brings positive spiritual vibes into
his life with the help of a little water. Every morning, he goes to
a religious shrine erected in his home and sprinkles the fluid on
an icon representing esu, a trickster divinity in the Ifa
divination system practiced by the Yoruba people.
</P>
<P>
   Giving esu (EH-shoe) this simple sacrifice, says Van Der Meer,
is how he ``asks for blessings, asks for safety, asks for a good
day, asks to be the best person I can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Der Meer is finding spiritual solace in a 5,000-year-old
Nigerian religion, called either Ifa (ee-FAH) or Yoruba, that
wended its way into the culture of the Americas via the slave
trade. Although white masters forced the African newcomers to
abandon their traditional beliefs, aspects of the old ways
survived, melding with Christianity to become the syncretic
religions Candomble, Macumba, Lucumi, and Voodoo.
</P>
<P>
   Now Van Der Meer, 46, is part of a growing number of
African-Americans divesting Yoruba of its Christian trappings. They
are setting up shrines, communing with their ancestors, and
chanting in foreign languages in order to discover the religion of
their African forefathers. The reason they give for this return to
their roots is both spiritual and cultural.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the religion ``shows that black people in this
country didn't just come out of slavery,'' says Van Der Meer, an
Africana studies professor at the University of Massachusetts at
Boston. ``Our legacy goes deeper than that. We have a way of
thinking, a way of life that has a high cultural aspect to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, more than 100,000 people nationwide practice some form of
Yoruba-based religion, according to Wande Abimbola, a Yoruba
scholar who teaches religion at Boston University. They are a
melting pot of African-Americans, whites, Latinos, and Asians who
are responding to a belief system that counsels respect for the
environment and stresses spiritual self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are disenchanted with the Western way of conquesting
nature,'' says Abimbola. ``They are looking for a more humane and
natural way of life. It leads them to Yoruba.''
</P>
<P>
   While a renaissance of spirituality in the 1990s has popularized
everything from Buddhism to cabala, the practice of Yoruba is still
looked upon skeptically by the general public, say its followers.
Onlookers stereotype them as chicken killers who practice some
strange form of mysticism, they complain.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the religion is slowly becoming demystified as people begin
to publicly practice an ideology that has been kept secretive for
centuries. Consumers now snatch up the best-selling self-help books
of Iyanla Vanzant, a Yoruba priestess. You can step into the
spiritual house Ile Ase Sango Ewelere (ee-LAY ah-SHAY shang-GO
EH-WAY-lay-ray) in Roxbury and take Yoruba 101-style classes (some
taught by Abimbola) that explain Yoruba thought, divination, music,
and chanting.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're involved in this process of orisa (divinity) worship
and you feel ashamed of it, how are you going to move forward?''
reasons Elizabeth Coleman, who with Barbara Eaton leads the Ile,
which started in the early 1990s. ``It should be out there, it
should be very much a part of your life and identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a sparsely decorated Boston University office,
Abimbola explains the tenets of the Yoruba religion with quiet
intensity. It's part of his job as awise agbaye (ah-wee-shay
ah-bay-YAY), a religious title that means spokesperson of Yoruba in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The scholar, whom local adherents respectfully call baba (Yoruba
for father), comes from a family that has clung to Ifa even as
other Africans turned to the Christian and Muslim faiths. In
addition to acting as a bridge between Yoruba followers in West
Africa and the Americas, he gives individual consultations and
recently delivered an invocation during the April opening of a
Metropolitan Museum of Art exhibition of objects used in
divinations.
</P>
<P>
   Yoruba devotees believe in one high god, Olodumare
(oh-LOH-dumare), explains Abimbola, but the cosmos is filled with
other entities as well. The good divinities, or orisas, come in the
form of trees, forests, mountains, or metal. The ajogun
(a-joe-gun), or bad spirits, represent death, deceit, imprisonment,
or disease.
</P>
<P>
   The orisa and ajogun ``are eternally set against each other,''
says Abimbola, dressed in a traditional outfit of long embroidered
tunic and pants. ``It's sacrifice that brings balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many who worship Western gods, Yoruba followers don't
attend services once a week. When a practitioner has a problem, he
or she confers with a babalawo (BAH-BAH-LAH-woah), or priest, who
provides counsel, makes sacrifices, creates herbal remedies, or
performs divinations that analyze individual problems.
</P>
<P>
   How does the religion work in daily life? Walter Clark, 45, a
Yoruba devotee, gives an example as he sits in the Ile, located in
a house painted blood red to represent the divinity of thunder,
Shango. About a year ago, Clark started a job working as a welder.
On his second day of work, he got hit by a car and fractured a leg.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's problems _ the car accident, the cracked bone _ were
traced to Ogun, a divinity of iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had to remind me, `Look, you're doing your god's work
and you haven't acknowledged it,' '' says Clark, who then gave an
offering of a yam to Ogun (oh-GOON). ``I went back to work and had
two pay raises.''
</P>
<P>
   That yam offering brings us to Yoruba's bete noire: sacrifice.
In Yoruba, explains Abimbola, ``sacrifice is a code of
communication. We don't think that verbalization is enough. It's
our own myopia and arrogance that makes us think that every
divinity will hear us.''
</P>
<P>
   The perception of followers killing goats and chickens has made
the religion controversial among organizations concerned with
animal protection. What people don't understand, says Abimbola, is
that a sacrifice can consist of liquid, clothes, food (like Clark's
yam), or animals. Of the latter form of sacrifice, Abimbola notes,
``there is not a preponderance of it. And 99.9 percent of the
animals that are sacrificed are eaten by us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   African-American interest in Yoruba can be traced back to at
least 1959, when a man named Walter King traveled to Cuba to be
initiated in a syncretic religion. By 1971, King had changed his
name to Oba Oseijeman Adefumni, had been crowned the Yoruba King of
the Americas in Nigeria, and was reigning over a traditional Yoruba
village in Sheldon, N.C., that has become a popular tourist spot.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, blacks were introduced to Yoruba as an
influx of immigrants arrived from the African diaspora and as
African-Americans traveled to Africa to unearth the roots Alex
Haley wrote about. They were enticed by an ideology that gives them
a stronger spiritual connection than Christianity ever did, say
Yoruba converts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came up, I was just empty,'' says Heywood Fennell Sr.,
52, who was a Baptist and Episcopalian before discovering the
Yoruba faith. ``I had tried the churches but I just knew there had
to be something better.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark had that nagging feeling as well. ``I knew,'' he says,
``there was something deeper than Christianity because we didn't
practice Christianity in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Their disaffection with Western religion, says Abimbola, may be
related to the way it's practiced. ``Christianity seems not to be
able to help its devotees beyond prayer,'' Abimbola notes, ``hoping
that when you die, you'll go to heaven and, perhaps, if you pray,
your condition here on earth will be better.'' Yoruba, however,
``is based on the fact that you can help yourself,'' says Abimbola.
</P>
<P>
   As Fennell, a Yoruba priest who was introduced to the religion
in the late 1970s, points out, ``This is living. You don't wait
until you die to get your blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Van Der Meer, ``It teaches you that you can redeem
yourself. That something can happen to you and you don't have to be
completely devastated. You're able to recover from that and move
ahead, but you have learned the lesson that's invovled in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Those teachings weren't always apparent to Van Der Meer when he
began practicing Lucumi in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucumi was very difficult,'' says Van Der Meer, who found that
questions he had about the theory behind the religion were left
unanswered. ``They began to kind of create this type of mystery
about the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yoruba Van Der Meer studies under Abimbola is different, he
says, because it's based on an ancient Yoruba text similar to the
Bible, Koran, and Torah.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that's secret, you know,'' says Van Der
Meer. ``It's something we should know, should study, and should
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet information about Yoruba remains vague, with various books
and Web pages disseminating conflicting facts. With so much
inaccurate information circulating, the religion continues to be a
target of derision.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, a sculptor who incorporates African divinities into his
art, discovered this firsthand while exhibiting his work at a local
library. As Clark explained the African divinities to a curious
onlooker, the man became increasingly agitated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like, `No. Uh-uh. Not me. I'll never fall down before
this,' '' recalls Clark. ``It hit me kind of heavy that he would go
off like that. But that is the general feel that I get from a lot
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Those perceptions seem to be slowly changing as experts like
Abimbola explain how the religion is practiced in Africa and Yoruba
devotees gently introduce the religion to family and friends. Take
the example of Van Der Meer, who recently went home to Harlem to
celebrate the 50th birthday of his twin siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the festivities started, Van Der Meer convinced his
family to connect with their ancestors by participating in a
Yoruba-style chant. In this instance, there was no drama, just a
spirit of well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt very good about it,'' says Van Der Meer, ``to the
point where they said, `You know, we need to do this more.' ''

A STRATEGY FOR THE HEARTS, MINDS AND BEARDS OF THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was all ribbon-cuttings and speeches Monday when
Gillette Co. chairman and chief executive Michael C. Hawley
dedicated a new $40 million razor-blade factory in St. Petersburg,
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   When it was his turn to speak, Hawley noted that during the
early part of the year, ``Russia was our fastest-growing major
market worldwide'' during the first three months of this year, up
40 percent from the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's sales growth in Russia is impressive. A decade ago,
sales were insignificant in a country where
turn-of-the-18th-century czar Peter the Great once deemed the 5
o'clock shadow an uncivilizing influence and levied a tax on
beards. Now Gillette's Russian sales could soon exceed $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing facility in St. Petersburg is more than just a
razor-blade factory; it's also a beachhead, the latest installment
in an ongoing ``foot-on-the-ground'' strategy that aims to secure
Gillette's global razor domination. It's a strategy that Gillette
has used for more than 40 years as it seeks to win over consumers
the world over.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the strategy that can be described as: Infiltrate a
developing country, buy a local razor brand, familiarize the locals
with Gillette products, gain marketing intelligence, then build a
modern factory.
</P>
<P>
   While these are the core principles, the strategy is flexible
enough to be adapted to a wide variety of countries, said Jorgen
Wedel, Gillette's executive vice president of commercial operations
for the Eastern Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tailor-make the approach to the individual country and type
of market,'' Wedel said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, most consumers are familiar with
Gillette's product lines. They shave with SensorExcel razors. They
brush their teeth with Oral-B toothbrushes. They percolate their
morning joe with a Braun coffee maker and power their boomboxes and
flashlights with Duracell batteries.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 40 percent of Gillette's $9.9 billion in 1999
sales came from purchases made by US consumers. The rest of
Gillette's revenue comes from overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Gillette's exposure to overseas markets has been both
a liability and an asset. After years of strong profit increases,
fluctuations in foreign currency rates have helped to slow
Gillette's momentum and batter its stock price. Gillette stock
closed Tuesday at $34.75 on the New York Stock Exchange, up 12.5
cents for the day but far below its 52-week high of $52.375. On the
upside, foreign markets mean big growth opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   That aside, what many foreign consumers are buying from Gillette
today are not the Mach3, Gillette's latest razor, or the Duracell
Ultra, but the double-edged blades and earlier generation of zinc
batteries that were popular with the grandfathers of today's
American consumers.
</P>
<P>
   There's a simple explanation for this. Many foreign consumers
have less disposable income than their US counterparts. What they
can afford are the product lines that Gillette originally developed
for the US market 20 or 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of shaving, many Russians are at the sixth-grade
level, while Americans are in graduate school,'' said Fredric E.
Russell of Fredric E. Russell Investment Management Co., an
Oklahoma firm that owns a large number of Gillette shares.
</P>
<P>
   It's these older product lines that are often being made in St.
Petersburg and many of the other sites that Gillette operates
manufacturing plants in developing countries. All told, Gillette
has 54 manufacturing facilities in 20 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette made its move into Russia about the time the Soviet
Union was dissolving and Russian president Vladimir V. Putin, then
a local official, was helping to establish a special economic zone
for multinational companies in the city now known as St.
Petersburg. In 1993, Gillette entered a joint venture with the
Leninets Concern, a local company that made a razor blade known as
the Sputnik.
</P>
<P>
   The mid-1990s might be described as a sort of Russian
reconnaissance mission for Gillette. As it helped Leninets to
continue to make Sputnik razors, Gillette studied Russian consumer
habits and tested marketing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gillette began to import some of its brands into
Russia. As these brands became more popular, the decision was made
to build a state-of-the-art facility in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   This foot-on-the-ground approach offers several advantages. For
openers, it allows Gillette to avoid some of the high tariffs that
many countries slap on imports.
</P>
<P>
   There's a second benefit. Many countries throw all sorts of
bureaucratic hurdles into the path of a multinational company that
wants to build a local factory.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its joint ventures, Gillette can enlist the aid of
its local partner to cut through some of the red tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help us with political maneuvering, which is very
important,'' Wedel said of Gillette's local partners.
</P>
<P>
   A variation of this foot-on-the-ground strategy has been used
several times before. In China, Gillette bought a stake in local
razor brand called the Flying Eagle more than 20 years ago. In
India, which Gillette entered in the early 1980s, one of the razor
brands that Gillette markets is called the 7 O'Clock.
</P>
<P>
   Many US consumers are familiar with Gillette's ``trade-up''
philosophy for making money. Every seven years or so, Gillette
introduces a new generation of razor, one it claims represents a
major advance in shaving technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new razor costs more than its predecessor. But if Gillette
can persuade many consumers in developed countries to put down
their SensorExcel razors and ``trade up'' to the more expensive,
next-generation Mach3, it can add millions of dollars to its bottom
line.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure consumers hear the argument that they should trade
up, Gillette saturates the airwaves with big ad campaigns, spending
$606 million on global advertising last year.
</P>
<P>
   Similar tactics are used in developing countries, though often
with older-generation products. In Russia, for example, one goal is
to get consumers to swap their Sputniks for an Atra razor and maybe
some day a Sensor or a Mach3.
</P>
<P>
   This approach isn't just used for blades and razors. In general,
Gillette has also had success with applying this same formula to
its battery and oral-care product lines.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has worked less well for its stationery products
and household appliances. That may be one reason why Gillette
recently announced that it is negotiating to sell its Parker, Paper
Mate cq, and Waterman pen lines to Newell Rubbermaid Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For much the same reason, Gillette has hinted that it may sell
the household appliance business that it markets under the Braun
brand name.
</P>
<P>
   But whether the product is a razor blade or a toothbrush, and
regardless of whether the consumer lives in Boston, Beijing, or St.
Petersburg, Gillette is always looking to persuade that consumer to
trade up.
</P>
<P>
   The extra cost to a Russian or Chinese consumer who trades up
from a Sputnik or Flying Eagle razor to one of Gillette's snazzier
brands is only a couple of pennies, but multiply those pennies by a
couple of billion times and it might even generate enough money to
get Gillette back into Wall Street's good graces some day.

BEFORE RETIRING EARLY, PAY OFF MORTGAGE, DEBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am married with three children, the youngest of whom are 15
and 17 years old; both of them will probably attend junior college
for two years and then go to local universities. I have worked for
the city of Los Angeles for the past 27 years, and all of my
pension options include a full cost-of-living adjustment with no
cap. Although the pension would increase considerably if I worked
longer, I don't know if I can last three more years. I want to
retire and coach high school baseball and enjoy life. I am
considering selling the condo to pay off some debt. The condo
brings me $1,100 a month rental income, minus $500 for taxes and
fees. It is fully depreciated and is no longer a tax write-off. I
would incur about $20,000 in taxes if I sold. Beyond my mortgage, I
have no debt aside from $5,000 in credit cards. I also owe my
family a nice vacation. How am I positioned for retirement? Should
I work three more years?
</P>
<P>
   B.M., Thousand Oaks, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The more I have been pondering this situation, the tougher it
gets to be satisfied with an answer.
</P>
<P>
   Here is some of my thinking: After deducting your contributions
to the deferred savings plan, you have pretax income of $72,250.
Assuming you used the income from your rental condo to pay the
taxes on your home, you still would be spending $31,200, or 43.2
percent of your pretax take-home pay, on your mortgage. After what
I would guess are substantial state and federal tax liabilities, it
would seem to me you don't have a whole lot to live on.
</P>
<P>
   So I am combining that situation with your remark that you're
not sure you can last three more years at your job to infer that
you are earning a substantial amount of overtime, and that your
$85,000 base salary therefore doesn't reflect your actual income.
For that reason, I have a hard time trying to calculate whether you
could maintain your current standard of living, or even one only
modestly reduced, upon retirement.
</P>
<P>
   But let's start with the easy one. If you would come out with
$145,000 after taxes upon selling your condo, you could calculate
that you are achieving a 4.9 percent return on the value of your
investment. That might be acceptable if you feel there is a
substantial potential for growth in the value of the condo. But if
there's not a big upside potential there, I agree selling the condo
probably would be a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Were you to sell the condo, use $5,000 to pay off the
credit-card debt, apply $125,000 against your home mortgage, and
then devote the remaining $15,000 to that long-overdue vacation,
you then would be in a position where you would need only 25 months
to pay off the rest of the mortgage. Taking that vacation seems to
be a good idea _ and perhaps a vacation you need as much as your
family. Perhaps that refreshment might allow you to face another
two to three years of work _ and the retirement situation would be
brightened dramatically once you get those substantial mortgage
payments off your back.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason you might want to consider delaying retirement a
bit is that you soon will be facing the costs of your children's
college education; even if they choose public schooling and obtain
substantial amounts in student loans and other financial aid, you
doubtlessly will face significant costs associated with their
education. Take it from me; I've been there.
</P>
<P>
   In all of this discussion, I purposely have left your $175,000
accumulation in the deferred compensation plan aside. This is
because whether you retire at age 50, 53, or 55, you should
anticipate many years of retirement, and although your pension will
come with annual cost-of-living adjustments, if I were you I would
feel much more secure if there were some additional savings that
could pull you through in the event those adjustments do not quite
keep pace with changes in your own cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   In summary, I am not saying either yes, retire now, or no, put
it off a couple of years. I suggest you begin the analysis by
calculating how much you are actually spending, and then coming up
with a budget showing how much you would need in retirement. If you
can make the numbers work, go for it. My guess is that it probably
will work fine, but only after you have finally burned that
mortgage note.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. I have owned 1,000 shares of Reebok International common
stock for the past five years and have lost more than half of what
I paid for the position. I don't want to sell right now because I
would really take a bath. With the stock market turning into a bear
market and Reebok going nowhere, what do I do?
</P>
<P>
   S.W., Worcester, Mass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, most of the past five years have been pretty dismal for
Reebok, but both in terms of its stock price and its earnings
picture things seem to be turning up. And, of course, its
price-to-earnings ratio of 11 is always appealing to an old value
hound such as myself. First-quarter earnings of 56 cents per share
compared nicely to the 32 cents per share of a year ago, and
analyst estimates for the full year range from a low of $1.10 per
share to a high of $1.55. Results for 1999 were 20 cents per share
earned, down from 42 cents per share in 1998 and $2 plus from 1995
to 1997. In short, the fundamentals seem to be on the way back, so
why sell now, particularly since you would be selling into a market
that just hates value stocks, which is what Reebok has become.
</P>
<P>
   The one situation in which I might consider selling, if I were
you, would be if you have a capital gain on another stock that
might be sold, and the capital loss on Reebok could be used to
offset the gain from your other holding.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My sister and I are widowed and are looking to invest
$340,000 accumulated from an insurance settlement and an
inheritance. What do you suggest we do? We also plan to sell the
family home and purchase a condo or a smaller house.
</P>
<P>
   M.S., Boston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Normally in a situation such as this I'd suggest a solid GNMA
fund such as Vanguard GNMA. But with five-year CD rates running as
high as 8.01 percent (for a CD of $100,000 or more) why expose
yourself to the potential of further interest rate increases, which
could drive the principal of a bond fund down?
</P>
<P>
   Even though at this point there isn't even a hint of trouble
within the banking system, I suggest you take the cautionary step
of not exceeding the FDIC insurance limits at any single
institution. For example, if $200,000 of the money is owned jointly
by your sister and yourself, you could place $200,000 in a CD at a
single institution and be fully insured, but any amount in excess
of that would not be covered.
</P>
<P>
   If the money is individually owned, I suggest you take the
cautionary step of limiting the amount of a CD at any single
institution to $100,000, the minimum amount that qualifies for the
jumbo rate, which is typically (but not always) slightly higher
than the rate for a smaller CD. Right now, there's not much
variance, with the highest rate for a jumbo CD entering this week
at 8.01 percent, and the highest rate for a CD of less than
$100,000 a flat 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a major variance in the best rates in the nation
and the average for all rates, which was 6.52 percent for a
five-year jumbo entering this week. You can find the institutions
with the best rates at many sites online (the site I have
bookmarked is www.bankrate.com) or in the DataBank page of the
Sunday New York Times. The online site also will let you seek out
the highest rates in your region of the country.

A REPORT FROM THE TRENCHES OF A NET START-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of us write about the new economy. Some of us participate
in it.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ashbrook does both.
</P>
<P>
   A former reporter and editor at The Boston Globe, Ashbrook left
journalism four years ago to join the Internet revolution. His new
book, ``The Leap,'' chronicles his journey from the old world to
the new. It is also the story of his often painful attempt to build
HomePortfolio Inc., a Newton, Mass. company that serves the home
design business. The company recently received $48 million in
venture financing.
</P>
<P>
   We caught up with Ashbrook the other day to hear what he had to
say about creating a dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Until recently, there's been a sense that the new economy was
a can't-miss proposition. Yet at your company you were always one
step away from running out of money and shutting the door.
</P>
<P>
   A. The impression grew up during last year's Internet mania that
this whole thing was risk-free, that if you put a dot-com on your
name a billion dollars would drop on your head. This was never
risk-free. Many people who joined the fray will not walk away rich.
This new economy is more fluid. It has fewer safe islands. It asks
participants to put their security and the stability of their life
at risk in a way that most Americans are not used to.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You and your partner used credit cards to keep the company
going. How much debt did you amass?
</P>
<P>
   A. More than $250,000, all of it personal. Think about it. That
means that if you are 40 or 45 years old and you have to go back to
a regular job, you are going to have to work for the next 10 years
to pay off the debt acquired pursuing a wild dream that didn't work
out.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But the risk is more than financial, right?
</P>
<P>
   A. That's right. People talk about the burn rate for money but
there is another burn rate _ the burning up of faith and hope, and
intimacy and ultimately the fiber of a relationship. Because I had
to throw everything into getting a new venture off the ground, I
came within a hair's breath of losing my house, my wife, and my
family. You burn up so many hours _ hours that you are not reading
to your kids, hours not talking to your wife. You can't get those
hours back.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The time and energy people put into these start-ups is
amazing. What is the motivation?
</P>
<P>
   A. You don't just do it for the money. If that is all you come
for I don't know how you stick it out. It is too dry. Part of the
answer is the Web itself. It promised a revolution. It was going to
change everything. All that can make you feel like a crusader
marching behind the cross. It brings out a crazed commitment to the
cause. People are willing to make extraordinary sacrifices and
investments in energy and time. No sacrifice is too great when you
are changing the world. As a boomer I was susceptible to that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. But that manic energy gives start-ups a real competitive edge
over established companies, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   A. It is a competitive edge. The big companies look around and
say: Who are these flyspecks? They never stop coming. And because
of that energy and technology some of these little flyspecks will
become major global players in a very short time. That is
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You guys were turned down by a zillion venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   A. We saw at least 100.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Still, I got the sense from your book that even the people
who turned you down forced you to improve your product.
</P>
<P>
   A. We learned something from every single meeting _ even the
ones with guys who had three eyes and nose hair. The Internet
encouraged vast dreaming, titanic ambitions, and we were infected
with that. The VCs helped us to take it one step at a time. They
taught us that if you can't narrow down your plan to actionable
steps, you will never get to the big dream. They were relentlessly
disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Q. We've been through a period in which dot-coms could do
nothing wrong and now we are in one in which they can do nothing
right. Where do we go from here?
</P>
<P>
   A. I continue to think the ultimate impact of the Web has been
underestimated. We were in a bubble mentality last year. I am happy
to see some of the crazy extremes disappear. I think this
sobering-up period is a healthy thing. It will weed out some of the
just plain flaky stuff and get people focused on real value. We
welcome that.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a real businessman.

<P>
   It didn't take long for Brent Tocci to realize a four-year
college degree wasn't for him. He enrolled at a community college
``to get my feet wet,'' but had no desire to continue.
</P>
<P>
   But after a friend told him he could make better money splicing,
testing, and maintaining fiber optic cable, the Braintree High
School graduate entered a four-year union-sponsored apprenticeship
program in 1994 and learned the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Today, just two years out of the program, Tocci's total annual
compensation _ including a $10,000 employer pension contribution
and free health and dental benefits _ is about $70,000. Tack on
overtime, and the figure balloons to $90,000, a salary package that
has allowed him to buy a home in Abington.
</P>
<P>
   Former Newbury Street hairstylist Eileen Farr of Quincy doubled
her salary after graduating from a four-year, union-sponsored
apprenticeship program in Dorchester. Now a fully certified
voice-data-video installer, she says the career switch has improved
her quality of life and enabled her family to buy a home and take
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the day I graduated from the training program, I've
never been unemployed,'' said Farr. ``There is always work out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being locked out of the New Economy, thousands of
blue-collar workers are commanding top salaries by exchanging old
economy skills for technical training in the digital world,
particularly telecommunications. As the Internet revolution moves
at breakneck speed, it is this blue-collar work force that is
laboring behind the scenes installing and trouble-shooting systems
that allow companies to use tools such as video conferencing, the
Internet, and voice recognition systems.
</P>
<P>
   With the right skills, today's blue-collar workers are just as
likely to be members of the up-and-coming e-class as are the recent
graduates with degrees in computer science, programming, or
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Germarshausen, director of systems technology for the
National Electrical Contractors Association, says the
telecommunications industry is exploding.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an annual basis, when you look at growth, the electrical
industry now has a growth rate in the single digit numbers ranging
from 3 to 5 percent,'' says Germarshausen. ``But when you look at
the voice-data-video sector within the telecommunications industry
you are looking at, conservatively, a growth rate of 19 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, industry experts say 55,000 newly trained
voice-data-video installers and technicians are needed annually to
meet what many now see as a critical shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we think about technology, we often think about how it is
applied, but there are people who support it in other ways who are
critically important and are being highly rewarded for what is,
essentially, a demanding job,'' says Fred Breimyer, chief economist
at State Street Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these people have gone through extensive training,
which also focuses attention on the transformation of traditional
union operations that are continuing to adapt and change as these
growth industries adapt and change.''
</P>
<P>
   Farr, 36, of Quincy, was earning between $35,000 to $40,000 a
year as a hairstylist in 1991 when she switched careers and
enrolled in a four-year, apprenticeship training program at the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 103 training
hall in Dorchester. She'd heard about the Internet and what was
then described as the coming explosion in telecommunications, and
she didn't want to be left out. Five years ago, Farr completed the
training; now she wires buildings, providing client companies with
Internet and cable access.
</P>
<P>
   ``My income, when you look at the benefits and the pay, has
doubled,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Farr, whose husband is an electrician, says her new career also
improved her family's lifestyle. ``We purchased a home in Quincy, a
three-bedroom Cape, soon after I got a job. We can afford to send
our son to Boston College High School, which we could not have
afforded in the past. Things have improved. I'm not counting every
penny I spend.''
</P>
<P>
   For Farr the gains are tangible: a new four-door Plymouth Breeze
and yearly trips to her family in Ireland, including an upcoming
trip this summer in which the family ``will see the country like
real tourists instead of just visiting friends.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the training she acquired was demanding, requiring
four years on-the-job apprenticeship as well as regular weekly
coursework at a training site run by the Local. Moreover, the
initial pay is a scant $9 per hour, though each trainee received
full benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voice-data-video person is working all the time,'' said
Germarshausen. ``This is the person who programs systems and
trouble-shoots systems that allow companies to use video
conferencing, closed circuit TV, the Internet, security access
programs, and voice systems. Eventually, we are going to see more
techs working than standard electricians. That's because the work
is changing so radically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is a huge demand for people who are trained
at every level,'' she said, ``apprentices, installers, and
technicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Electricians willing to update their skills are not the only
ones who stand to gain. Steamfitters who used to manipulate pipes
are now being trained to use computer-aided temperature controls,
wiring, and fiber optic cabling.
</P>
<P>
   Annual compensation for these New Economy technicians ranges
from $35,000 for video-data-voice apprentices, to up to $90,000 for
installers and technicians with at least five years' experience.
Project managers, with either college degrees or several years'
experience can earn up to $120,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is that the skilled trades are evolving as
a result of the Internet, the new technology, and the deregulation
of the telecommunications industry,'' says Germarshausen, ``and the
demand for people is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh McLaughlin, owner of Sullivan &AMP; McLaughlin Communications
Group in Dorchester, can't hire enough people fast enough. He
currently employs 185 but says he could easily use 25 more. The
problem is finding them.
</P>
<P>
   Says McLaughlin, who last year pulled in $25 million in sales,
``I would never have envisioned having that much in sales five
years ago. Not a chance. But the industry is exploding and it won't
let up. We have work booked for the next three years. Even if the
stock market dropped and the economy bottomed out, it would be
three years before we'd even begin to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many others in the greater Boston area, McLaughlin is
benefitting from the break up of the old Bell Telephone system. His
clients are the new telecommunications companies that have sprung
up to compete for local consumer dollars and are looking for
highly-skilled technicians to service their systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are good jobs,'' he says. ``These jobs allow the working
class guy to have a beautiful home and buy a decent car and live
moderately comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, not every new entrant into the New Economy is reaping
big gains. For those without the benefit of union backing, breaking
into the field can be more difficult. Tom Schrafft, 31, of Revere
was making $12 per hour as an administrative assistant last
December when he enrolled in a two-week technical training course
and began volunteering in computer companies' warehouses to get
more hands-on experience maintaining, installing, and repairing
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Schrafft has done some temporary work but has not
had any success finding a permanent position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to succeed in the field,'' he said. ``I figure this is
where the future is. If I'm going to survive in  &UR; today &LR; 's world,
this is where I have to go.''

LABOR HISTORIAN JIM GREEN GETS BEHIND THE PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When James Green took the microphone at this year's May
Day rally in the Massachusetts Capitol in support of home-care
workers, he spoke ``not only from my head but also from my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the history and labor studies professor officially came
to spotlight low pay ($8.62 to $9.15 for entry-level positions)
``in the most prosperous era in our state's history,'' he told
legislators, union leaders, and social activists that he was there
not just ``to speak of my findings as a researcher, but of my
feelings as a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Green, born 20 years ago with severe cerebral palsy,
``has been well-served by many home-care workers,'' Green said,
``especially during the past seven years, when she has been a
resident of two group homes for young people.''
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the rally may have been particularly
emotional, but Green argues that putting head and heart together is
essential for the health of social movements _ a point he argues in
his new book, ``Taking History to Heart,'' published this spring by
the University of Massachusetts Press.
</P>
<P>
   While a study of social movements, the book is also part
autobiography. As Green says, ``I don't see myself as an activist,
but as a participant.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, 53, teaches at the University of Massachusetts at Boston
and lives in East Somerville with his wife, Janet Grogan, a
community activist herself, and their son, Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   As a graduate student at Yale, he studied under the legendary
Southern historian C. Vann Woodward, who inspired his students to
write what he called ``history with a purpose.'' Green came to
UMass after not only failing to get tenure at Brandeis, but after
realizing that its interest in labor history was so minimal that he
had landed in what he now jokingly calls ``the folding chair of
labor history.''
</P>
<P>
   But at UMass, Green said, ``I'm at a place where the things I
wanted to do have priority. There's no break between what I do here
and what I do outside.''
</P>
<P>
   At the university, Green works out of a windowless office
brightened with posters commemorating such landmarks in labor
history as the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire, the 1912 Lawrence
textile workers strike, and the last big May Day rally in New York
a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his students, said Green, are ``white working-class
people who don't have a sense of being connected with anything
bigger. There's a need to be active, but they aren't finding it in
electoral politics.''
</P>
<P>
   What fills their ``hollowness'' _ or at least what Green offers
as a way to fill it _ is an introduction to social movements,
especially the labor movement where Green's most vivid experience
lies.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the historic photographs in ``Taking History to
Heart'' _ Norman Thomas addressing tenant farmers, Boston
packinghouse workers celebrating a strike victory _ there is an
unexpected one of Green, in sunglasses and a union T-shirt, in the
field with a video camera.
</P>
<P>
   He is standing next to documentary filmmaker Barbara Koppel _
best-known for her Academy Award-winning film ``Harlan County,
USA'' _ as they film an interview with a striking Pittston, West
Va., coal miner in 1990. The interviews _ ``in every kind of coal
field accent,'' Green said _ became ``Out of Darkness: The Mine
Workers' Story''
</P>
<P>
   Green had met United Mine Workers president Richard Trumka when
he spoke at Harvard Trade Union program. Some of his favorite
students there, Green recalled, were ``brilliant miners who had
left the coal fields'' to work for Trumka.
</P>
<P>
   ``He liked my approach to UMW history,'' Green said of Trumka,
who invited him to come down to Beckley, West Va., the headquarters
for the Pittston strike, and teach labor history to the strike
organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a labor historian,'' Green said, ``this was a terrific
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   And turning that experience to academic use, Green said, ``I get
great response from white trade unionists who want to convert their
unions into social movements.''
</P>
<P>
   At Pittston, ``the moral leader was Jesse Jackson,'' not Lane
Kirkland, the president of the AFL-CIO at the time. ``The miners
picked up the lingo from him and were saying that what they had was
not just a strike, but a people's movement.''
</P>
<P>
   And labor support at the May Day rally for home-care workers is
unlike a traditional union action, Green noted. The Service
Employees International Union ``doesn't represent them, but they're
fighting to get them a pay raise. . . . That's a big shift in how
unions think.''

DISHING THE DIRT ON RESTAURANT KITCHENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE YONAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Given Anthony Bourdain's criminal sensibility, his
fascination with the Mafia, and his gritty new tell-all memoir
about the restaurant business, it would be tempting to dismiss him
as a rat in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   But the differences between Bourdain and your run-of-the-mill
snitch emerge just as easily as the action unfolds in ``Kitchen
Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly'' (Bloomsbury
USA). Bourdain weaves hilarious tales of the bloody (a line cook
grimaces and curses as he sews up his own knife wound), the profane
(a chef leaves his station to give a sexual ``send-off'' to a bride
in her wedding gown), and the cautionary (Friday's fish turns into
Monday's fish special). And along the way, something else becomes
clear: This man adores the business _ blood, sex, bacteria, and all
_ as no mere rat could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately in the New York press the book's being treated as an
expose, as if I'm trying to settle hash, I'm bitter about the
business, I'm somehow looking to change it,'' he says,
chain-smoking at a window table at Brasserie Les Halles in
Manhattan, where he is executive chef. ``I'm not. I love it. It was
the lifestyle that attracted me to the business in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   What a lifestyle. Bourdain writes of his favorite sous-chef and
prankster, Steven, who once bragged of snorting cocaine through
uncooked penne and who ``has a tattoo of a cartoon cat wearing a
chef's toque on his crotch.''
</P>
<P>
   He writes of Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown, the ``loud, dirty,
unkempt, obnoxious, uncontrollable, megalomaniacal madman'' whose
divine bread has seduced Bourdain into hiring him on countless
occasions, and whose psychopathic behavior has always cost him the
job within months.
</P>
<P>
   He writes of practical jokes, such as food made to look like
grisly dismembered fingers, toes, or sexual organs and left for
waiters to find.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, he writes of restaurants _ good, bad, and in
between, run by control freaks and well-meaning incompetents.
Bourdain has worked at dozens of such places in his 28 years in the
business, and in the past decade has found himself at the helm of
many a sinking ship.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, what's not to love?
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's the child's dream of running your own pirate
crew,'' says Bourdain, 43, who is shown holding two sabers on his
book cover. ``So I look at it perhaps overromantically.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the restaurants that employed him, ``Kitchen
Confidential'' shows signs of longevity. Before the hardcover was
even in stores, paperback rights were sold, director David Fincher
(``Fight Club'') optioned it for a movie, and Bourdain started
getting national coverage in just about every medium. Sunday, it
will be number 7 on the New York Times bestseller list for
hardcover nonfiction.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for something that began as a ``much more foul-mouthed
and frank sort of a rant'' in the wake of another restaurant death.
Bourdain happily landed at Brasserie Les Halles, toned down the
essay, and ``on a lark'' sent it to The New Yorker. Within weeks,
editor David Remnick called to snap up the piece, which became the
titillating ``Don't Eat Before Reading This'' in April 1999,
warning restaurant-goers about Monday fish specials, mussels,
Sunday seafood frittatas, dirty bathrooms, and recycled bread and
butter. Bloomsbury USA immediately commissioned the book, and gave
him a mere six months to write it.
</P>
<P>
   Having written the mystery novels ``Bone in the Throat'' and
``Gone Bamboo'' in the 1990s, Bourdain plunged ahead, relieved that
he ``didn't have to worry about plot, for a change, or moving
characters through space, or story arc.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended up doing much of that anyway, creating a cast stranger
than fiction and pulling the reader right into the obscenity-laced
clamor that lurks behind the swinging kitchen door. As for story
arc, he has a knack for pinpointing crucial moments in his life of
food, starting with the boyhood defiance that led him to taste an
oyster on a boat in southwestern France _ the experience he credits
with turning him into ``a thrill-seeking, pleasure-hungry
sensualist.''
</P>
<P>
   Other milestones include a 1970s Provincetown dishwashing job,
where he witnessed the chef having sex with a bride, still in her
gown, in the garbage stockade (``I knew then . . . I wanted to be a
chef''); his training at the hands of ``Bigfoot,'' who turned him
``from a bright but druggie (expletive) into a serious, capable and
responsible chef''; and the steakhouse job he desperately needed,
and missed out on, because he mistakenly heard ``me'' instead of
``meat'' when the owner/interviewer asked, ``What do you know about
meat?'' (His answer: ``Next to nothing!'')
</P>
<P>
   As the latter example would indicate, Bourdain does not exempt
himself from the glare of his spotlight. ``You know, I was someone
you absolutely would not want to have working for you from 1982 to
1987,'' he says. ``Had I tried to portray myself as any different
than I was would have been a bald-faced and provable lie. There are
plenty of people who remember me from back then. I'm not saying
it's a noble instinct on my part; I count myself among the wounded,
that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the mischief, Bourdain also offers up homages to great
chefs he's known and worked for, and even allows a few tastes of
practicality, from warnings aimed at the restaurant-going public to
advice aimed at aspiring cooks, professional and amateur.
</P>
<P>
   But he clearly had more fun with the stories of tattooed
sous-chef Steven and baker Adam Real-Last-Name-Unknown, who signed
releases allowing him to describe their ``utterly disgusting
personal habits.''
</P>
<P>
   His favorite chapter, he says, is ``The Level of Discourse,''
devoted to the bilingual, sex-obsessed language of kitchens. It
recalls comedian George Carlin's litany of obscenities, and as such
is largely unprintable in a family newspaper, but Bourdain does
manage an expletive-free explanation of what such patter says about
the nature of restaurant work.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the system seeks, what it requires, is someone, anyone,
who can hold up their station, play the game without getting bent
out of shape and taking things personally,'' he writes. ``If you
are easily offended by direct aspersions on your lineage, the
circumstances of your birth, your sexuality, your appearance, the
mention of your parents possibly commingling with livestock, then
the world of professional cooking is not for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the book's wisecracking tone, its writing was not
without peril, though nothing so concrete as a burned steak or a
jailed line cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I'm doing in the kitchen,'' Bourdain says.
``Anybody who gets in my way I will bully, bludgeon, humiliate, do
anything necessary to move forward, and when I go home at the end
of the night, more often than not, I will know I did about as well
as anyone could do under the circumstances. I have nothing to be
ashamed of. I have a good writing day, on the other hand, and I'm
just racked with self-doubt and terror and uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he's back at his keyboard. His next book projects
are one on Typhoid Mary as a misunderstood cook, and ``The Cook's
Tour,'' in which he'll visit Burma to eat monkey brain, Africa to
eat gigantic beetles, Japan for fugu.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the simple act of eating can be a victory, it's eating at
its best,'' he says. ``You're trying something new, and you pay a
price for getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bourdain worries that he may end up paying a price for the
success of ``Kitchen Confidential,'' that it will take him away
from the best job he's ever had. But he still hopes that he has
whipped up something worthwhile on the page.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a dream of mine that in 10 years a line cook who
just started out on the line, the vegetable station, and is having
a hard time of it, is getting his (expletive) kicked by some
maniacal chef . . . stumbles across my book in the library, and it
makes him feel the way I felt when I came across `Down and Out in
Paris and London' for the first time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That my suffering, however temporary, that some of the more
ludicrous aspects of the business, that they weren't just happening
to me. That my experience is part of a continuum going back to 1900
and before, that this is just part of the life that we endure and
learn to love and find funny and ugly and poignant, and that at the
end of the day it's worth doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL; 
A FEW CUTTING REMARKS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Bourdain dishes out his frank judgments as easily in an
interview as he does in ``Kitchen Confidential.'' Here are his
assessments on a variety of culinary topics:
</P>
<P>
   --Organic versus genetically modified food. ``I see a lot of
organic produce, and it's not necessarily great. What does organic
mean, grown in (expletive) by hippies? That doesn't sound like a
good thing. If the genetically modified stuff is good, if it's
crunchy, if it tastes better, if it holds up better in my fridge,
no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   --Vegetarians and vegans. ``You know, people who worship their
body as this hygienic vessel, not to be polluted by the world,
that's just freakish to me. I see the body as an amusement park. I
mean, we live in the world. We leave a wake. We leave marks, and
the world should leave marks on us as well. . . . Obviously, I'm
very pro-carnivore.''
</P>
<P>
   --Julia Child. ``It's so easy to make fun of her, but she's
always been there, a visionary, and just cool. Some people just
are. It's the Orson Welles syndome. The man made `Citizen Kane.' If
he wanted to make (expletive) wine commercials late in his career
or go on Dean Martin roasts, he's still cool for life. It's the
same with Julia.''
</P>
<P>
   --Martha Stewart. ``She stands for everything I distrust in
television entertainment and TV chefs, but if you watch her show,
not only can she cook, but she's got moves. She moves with real
speed and economy back there. She's not clumsy, like some of the TV
chefs, where you throw up your hands like, `Oh my God, look what
they're doing.' I get this terrible sense that if it was Saturday
night at 8 o'clock, and Martha Stewart's in the dining room, and my
saute man just died of a heart attack, I could probably throw her
back there and she could dig us out of the weeds.''
</P>
<P>
   --Emeril Lagasse. ``I don't think I'd want Emeril anywhere near
my restaurant. The catch phrases alone would be painful.''
</P>
<P>
   --Ferran Adria, who has made waves with such extreme food as hot
and cold foams at El Bulli in Spain. ``That's so bogus. That's
novelty food. Others will steal the more useful of his
presentations, and they'll hopefully make more sensible use of it.
You already see that. There are already some foamy sauces now, and
hey, good idea, fine. But I don't want to be the foam guy, all
right? `Let's go to the foam restaurant.' Give me a (expletive)
steak already.''

<HEADLINE>
RECTOR'S BOOK ON CLERGY, SEX IS BESTSELLER _ AMONG PRIESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A slender volume of somber reflections on the priesthood by the
rector of a Catholic seminary has become an unexpected hit among
priests, raising eyebrows with its unsparing discussion of
celibacy, homosexuality, and sexual abuse among the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, ``The Changing Face of the Priesthood,'' the Rev.
Donald B. Cozzens suggests that the priesthood is, or is becoming,
a gay profession.
</P>
<P>
   He obliquely criticizes the church hierarchy for its refusal to
allow discussion of the issue of celibacy. And he warns that ``the
scandal of clergy misconduct with minors has cast a long shadow on
the credibility and authority of priests and bishops _ a shadow
that will last well into'' the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little doubt in the minds of priests that the church
stands at a precarious point at the turn of the millennium,''
Cozzens writes. ``The honesty and courage required of the church,
especially of its . . . leaders, is considerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The thoughts expressed in the book are remarkable less because
of their content than because of their author. Cozzens who heads
Saint Mary Seminary and Graduate School of Theology in Cleveland,
is a respected priest who previously authored a well-received book
on priestly spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priests are talking about it,'' said the Rev. Frank J. McNulty
of Newark, N.J., who represented US priests in a 1986 meeting with
the pope. ``Some critics are saying, `Why is he jumping on this
stuff?' But I think it's good for priests to read a book that's
honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozzens said he has received letters from about 100 priests
since the book's release in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that he's making some great revelation that nobody
knows about, but he's saying what some people don't want to have
said,'' said Sandra M. Schneiders, a theologican at the Jesuit
School of Theology in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Schneiders called the book ``the best thing that's been written
on the current state of the Catholic priesthood in recent times.''
That sentiment was echoed by Dean Hoge, a sociologist and
specialist on the priesthood at Catholic University of America, who
said ``it's the most important book on Catholic priests that we've
seen for years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If another person did this, they would be dismissed as a
sorehead, but he's a totally credible reporter because he's the
rector of a seminary in good standing and nobody claims he's some
kind of radical,'' Hoge said. ``These topics are being talked about
openly by the laity and the (academic) research community, but they
are not being talked about openly by the Catholic leadership, and
that's a tragic situation because these are real problems and
should be discussed rationally.''
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Cozzens asserts that priests have ``lost their once
unquestioned authority'' as a result of an emphasis on the
importance of the laity over the last 35 years, and that priests
increasingly are isolated from one another as a shortage of clergy
has caused greater geographic dispersion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Priests today stand awash in a floodlight of suspicion in the
eyes of contemporary American culture,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither macho playboy nor successful careerist, they go about
their work without wife and children, without a home of their own,
without the cultural symbols that define achievement. In the eyes
of many, their manliness drifts about in a sea of ambiguity, and
recent clerical scandals of sexual misconduct with young boys have
severely tarnished their collective reputation. They have lost
their innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozzens addresses a wide variety of concerns plaguing the
priesthood, including ``the relentless demands of pastoral
ministry'' and oversight by bishops, some of whom ``encourage and
reward an unthinking docility.'' But it is his comments on
sexuality that are garnering the most attention.
</P>
<P>
   Cozzens did not conduct his own social science research, but he
cites published studies and articles, as well as his own firsthand
impressions, in declaring that: ``At issue at the beginning of the
twenty-first century is the growing perception _ one seldom
contested by those who know the priesthood well _ that the
priesthood is or is becoming a gay profession.''
</P>
<P>
   Cozzens does not address the question of whether gay priests, or
straight priests, are honoring their vows of celibacy, but he does
say that the number of gay seminarians is high enough to make some
straight seminarians uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not infrequently . . . the sexual contacts and romantic unions
among gay seminarians creates intense and complicated webs of
intrigue and jealousy leading to considerable inner conflict,'' he
writes. ``... The straight seminarian, meanwhile, feels out of
place and may interpret his inner destabilization as a sign that he
does not have a vocation to the priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   In one of his most provocative sections, Cozzens takes on the
issue of sexual abuse among clergy and asserts that most priests
who are abusers target teenage boys as victims, unlike most other
child abusers, who, he said, tend to target girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``To insist that there is simply no correlation between
mandatory celibacy and the present crisis over clergy misconduct
with minors looks like bureaucratic bullying as long as the Vatican
remains opposed to even discussion concerning the systems
undergirding the priestly lifestyle,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   Few priests are ready to speak publicly about the book. In
Boston, Bishop Richard J. Malone said he was just given the book by
a friend and intends to read it; the Rev. Robert M. Blaney, who
helps recruit new priests to Boston, said he, too, was given the
book but has not yet read it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Dennis J. Sheehan, pastor of St. Paul's in Cambridge,
Mass., said he heard the book being discussed at a gathering and
ordered it from Amazon.com; at a Catholic-Muslim function in
Wayland, Mass. recently, as the Rev. John E. MacInnis was telling a
reporter he intended to read the book, the Rev. David C. Michael
broke in to say that he, too, had just picked up a copy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's far and away the best-selling small book we've done in
the last five years,'' said Peter Dwyer, marketing manager for the
Liturgical Press, which published Cozzens' book. Dwyer said the
company, based in Collegeville, Minn., has sold most of the 20,000
copies in print.
</P>
<P>
   The book has received positive reviews in Catholic periodicals.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Pilot, the official archdiocesan newspaper in
Boston, the Rev. William Murphy, spiritual director at St. John
Seminary, complained that the book is overly negative, but said
that ``nothing of what he said is untrue'' and that ``it is a
strong book and should be read by all who love the priesthood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many readers whose experience of priests is limited to
weekends and occasional pastoral visits, or less, will find this
book disturbing, if not scandalous,'' Murphy wrote. ``The reaction
of priests and other persons familiar with the troubles and
tensions in priestly life will be recognition, for better or for
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewer Paul Wilkes, writing in the Jesuit magazine America,
said ``when the history of this difficult time for the American
clergy is written, this book will surely mark one of its signal
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Cardinal Bernard F. Law had no comment on the book, but
Cozzens said he has heard from a handful of bishops and cardinals
who are reading the book and talking about it. And one bishop,
Robert Morneau of Green Bay, Wisc., is quoted on the back of
Cozzens' book praising the author for ``great courage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is going to cause controversy and argument and
discussion, but I think he raises some very important issues,''
Morneau said in an interview. ``We need to look at what's going on,
because we're having a major shortage of priest personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cleveland, the reaction has been more mixed. Cozzens said
that some of his colleagues have been critical of the book, and
that ``a few'' Cleveland priests have suggested that he shouldn't
be rector of the seminary anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some will think that this book is disloyal to the Church and
the priesthood, but I hope that it is an act of loyalty and care
and regard,'' Cozzens said in a telephone interview. ``I think that
we as Christians don't have to be afraid of the truth. But I love
being a priest, and I love the Church.''

THE VICIOUS RECORD OF WHITEY BULGER AND HIS PROTECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The myth portrayed Whitey Bulger the two-fisted wiseguy,
streetwise, politically connected, always flouting the law and
fixing his way out of it, South Boston's own Robin Hood.
</P>
<P>
   They got the hood part right. But the 70-year-old gangster
unmasked in a new book about his deceptions emerges as a vicious,
heartless extorter, the despoiler of the very neighborhood whose
values he claimed to epitomize, a broker of drugs and guns, a
threatener of children, who preyed on the weak and weak-minded
wherever he found them, including inside the FBI and the US
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   The book is ``Black Mass; the Irish Mob, the FBI and a Devil's
Deal,'' by my Globe colleagues Dick Lehr and Gerard O'Neill, two
diligent excavators of the local criminal scene. Already into its
second printing (Public Affairs Press), it is flying out of Boston
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   After digesting the sad and seamy 381-page account of
braggadocio, balderdash, and betrayal, I put it down feeling that
the title might have been ``It Takes One to Catch One,'' whether
one is a thief or a murderer. Because some of the catchers come off
almost as bad as the catchees in this chronicle of criminality.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston police official who suspected for years that the South
Boston mob's political and FBI connections were protecting
dangerous criminals said these revelations ``go to the very heart
of government.''
</P>
<P>
   What nonfiction writers do is capture, compress, and sculpt
complicated and interlocking tales into a single narrative. The
stunner in this volume is the weight of the crimes committed by two
FBI informants _ Bulger, known as ``Jim'' to his intimates, and
Stevie Flemmi _ with the connivance of a number of FBI agents, most
notably John Connolly, a Bulger acolyte from the old Southie.
Several murders followed.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who never immersed ourselves in the 17,000 pages
of testimony unearthed by US District Court Judge Mark Wolf, or
dwelt upon his 661-page summary, or tracked the various hearings,
depositions, and hundreds of newspaper accounts of Bulger's Irish
gang, the book assembles between two covers several lifetimes of
criminality and coverups.
</P>
<P>
   For the good guys who were trying to do the right thing, the FBI
colleagues who were led astray, the State Police detectives whose
painstaking surveillances were betrayed, the Drug Enforcement
agents and Boston cops whose tip-sharing was squandered or
round-filed or misused by Bulger's protectors in the Bureau,
``Black Mass'' finally squares the account.
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI supervisor John Morris, who met with Bulger and
Flemmi maybe 20 times after being drawn into their orbit by former
agent Connolly, took his first step down the corrupt path by taking
$1,000 from Bulger to fly his FBI secretary to a romantic
assignation. Then Connolly got Morris in deeper.
</P>
<P>
   Morris: ``Connolly called me and said `I have something for you
from these guys. Why don't you come over and pick it up?' I went
over; I picked it up. It was a case of wine. On the way out he
said, `Be careful with it; there's something in the bottom for
you.' So I took the case of wine . . . there was an envelope on the
bottom that contained $1,000 in it.''
</P>
<P>
   For less than $10,000 in bribes, Morris, an agent with great
accomplishments in prosecuting the Angiulo family's criminal
enterprises, destroyed his career and reputation. He's confessed,
been given immunity, and awaits testifying if Bulger is ever
captured alive. Connolly disputes Morris's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Lehr and O'Neill scanned thousands of pages of court
transcripts, checked wiretap logs against court testimony, and
interviewed all who would talk. It's all stitched together. The
weight of detail, with all the quotations and the mountain of
evidence, amounts to a massive indictment of Connolly, Morris, and
FBI superiors who let them turn a rogue operation into a major
league perversion of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it spare the Justice Department. Jeremiah O'Sullivan, a
former assistant US attorney, is faulted for looking the other way
on some crimes, protecting Whitey from an FBI review, and denying
entrance to the witness protection program for a Bulger enemy,
Brian Halloran, who was murdered five days later.
</P>
<P>
   O'Sullivan also cleared Whitey Bulger's brother, former state
Senate president William Bulger, of criminal involvement in a case
involving a $500,000 fee from Boston's largest landlord, Harold
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   City Council President James Kelly also figures in the book,
tangled up in the case of a realtor threatened with death by Whitey
for not paying a $50,000 protection fee. A former Whitey associate,
Kevin Weeks, apparently led police to the Dorchester graves of John
McIntyre, Deborah Hussey, and safecracker Bucky Barrett, all three
tied to Bulger's criminal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Southie version of ``The Sopranos,'' unmasking
Bulger, Flemmi, Connolly and Morris as betraying those to whom
they'd professed allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   There are some heroes: federal prosecutor Fred Wyshak and some
allies who pressed the cases his predecessors ignored; Judge Mark
Wolf, ``who was willing to go where no court has ever gone'' in
unmasking FBI corruption, in the words of author Lehr, and honest
cops like State Police Detective Bob Long and former Quincy police
official Dick Bergeron. Connolly faces racketeering and other
charges, and Wolf found that 18 FBI agents broke laws or violated
policies in this tangled affair. And the book obliterates the myth
of Whitey as the standup Southie guy.

BALLOT INITIATIVES: GOOD AND BAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ To begin with, Hiram Johnson hated his
father. That fact helps explain the growing fondness of Americans
for initiatives, referendums, and other forms of direct democracy.
Johnson was the godfather of the ``progressive'' movement, which
introduced ballot law to California after he was elected governor
90 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   David Broder thinks that initiatives and electronics, ``taken
together, could make our 18th-century Constitution irrelevant.'' In
``Democracy Derailed: Initiative Campaigns and the Power of
Money,'' he asks, ``Do we really wish to keep this a republic? That
question is coming at us with the speed of e-mail.'' Broder trusts
Madison, Hamilton, Franklin, and the other framers over the
consultants, sharpies, and sultans of signature-gathering he
describes in characteristically diligent reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Hiram Johnson was a reluctant candidate in 1910, according to
``Inventing the Dream,'' part of Kevin Starr's masterful
multivolume history of California. ``He hated his hometown of
Sacramento, for one thing _ and for deeply personal reasons. As an
anti-railroad candidate, moreover, he would have to square off
against his own father, Grove Johnson, a prominent pro-railroad
attorney and state legislator with whom son Hiram had never really
gotten along _ whom he had fled Sacramento, in fact, to escape.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Pacific pretty much owned the Legislature then, but
it doesn't now. Scandals are rare here, especially since
initiative-imposed term limits. Most politicians agree that big
money has perverted the ballot process as much as it has corrupted
any other form of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Hiram Johnson offered ``a way for the citizens to get around the
special interests running the Legislature. Now it's a way for the
special interests to get around the Legislature,'' says John L.
Burton, the state senate president pro tem and the Legislature's
top Democrat. Few Republicans would argue. ``The only real people's
initiative that I can recall is the coastal commission back in the
'70s,'' Burton adds. The real estate lobby was heedless of
environmental arguments then and would have erected high-rises
along the shoreline had voters not protected the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Some initiatives are sound, but most are not, depending on
gridlock conditions. ``A split in party control,'' Broder writes,
``results in the increased use of the initiative.'' But even though
Democrats dominate Sacramento, Californians faced 20 ballot
questions in the March presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Miller, assistant secretary of state, offers another
variable. ``After an election with record turnout, the number of
ballot questions usually drops,'' she says, predicting only five
statewide questions for this November's ballot. She also notes that
the number of votes on questions seldom varies with big-bucks
advertising. Unlike the drop-off from governor to legislative
offices, nary-a-nickel Question 19 attracts as many voters as
Question 1, with millions spent on television. Citizens may
actually read the ballot summary the secretary of state's office
mails out in a pamphlet as hefty as the Fresno white pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Constitution began with ``We, the people,''
politicians seeking their votes have treated with solemn reverence
the collective judgment of citizens. Broder is too polite to say
so, but ``the people'' can often be foolish, mean, and venal. ``The
people'' are the same folks who make millionaires of Jerry Springer
and the sponsors of televised wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Hiram Johnson was self-righteous, bolting his party to run as a
Bull Moose candidate. He was an isolationist who opposed both world
wars and was overall a dour chap. The next time Dave Broder is
hereabouts, I'll invite him to pour some Pepsi on Johnson's
elaborate grave in Colma. Johnson's ideas have been distorted, and
the initiative process should be curbed, but probably not
eliminated.

<P>
   BURLINGTON, Mass. _ Although he is now known from here to Kuala
Lumpur as ``The Sexiest Geek Alive,'' Tony Northrup has discovered
that some things haven't changed with fame. People make fun of him
behind his back. Women basically ignore him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being in middle school again,'' Northrup sighed over
lunch in a generic suburban restaurant here packed with other
hungry foot soldiers of the technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
   One thing _ and a big thing it is _ has changed, though.
Northrup, 26, is proud to call himself a geek. So are the 16,000
people from around the world who competed against him for the
Sexiest Geek honor, bestowed by the entertainment Web site Geek &AMP;
Guru. So are the many who attended the Geek Pride Festival in
Boston in March, or who patronize such Web sites as Geek.com or
GeekCulture.com.
</P>
<P>
   They are leading the geek backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make geeks proud, and make the jocks jealous. I want
to show the world that even if you can't get a date or throw a
football, you can still be a success,'' Northrup wrote in his
contest application.
</P>
<P>
   If you ask the people at Geek &AMP; Guru, or anyone who admires Bill
Gates, the geek will inherit the earth. Or already has.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the geek has pretty much taken over the country, so we
wanted to celebrate that,'' said Jim ``Roz'' Rosnack, the creative
director of Geek &AMP; Guru, based in Austin, Texas. ``It's those who
were tortured in high school who grew up to pretty much own
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sexiest Geek Alive application was designed to reveal both
intelligence and impressive technical knowledge. After answering
the requisite Star Trek questions, entrants had to explain
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle _ anyone who cut and pasted an
encyclopedia answer was disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   The judges were equally unforgiving of contestants who named a
geographical location in answer to this question: ``In what state
is Compaq Computers?'' A first-caliber geek, Rosnack says, knows
the answer should be ``disarray or confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Looks and charm came into play at the March pageant in Austin,
where 12 finalists met the judges. One performed his signature
geeky dance. One read her speech off her Palm Pilot. Several used
cell phones on stage so friends could coach them through the
proceedings, Rosnack said.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup stood a head above the rest based on his technical
expertise and ``his awkwardness and shyness, and his fashion sense,
or lack thereof,'' Rosnack said. But judges also saw some attitude
in Northrup. They wanted someone with edge, a winner who was ``a
little Gen-X, or a little anti-Gen-X.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest the number of applicants _ 16,000 _ sound unimpressive,
consider that that there was no prize, and finalists had to pay
their own way to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The contest's popularity is a sign that geeks are no longer
content to scurry into dark corners with their graphing
calculators. These days, geeks are sassy and in-your-face. The Geek
Pride Festival, next hitting San Francisco in September, loudly
proclaims ``Be there AND be square!'' Last weekend, the New York
Times Magazine called high school geeks ``a new kind of elite,
bound for real-world fame and fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The explanations for Geek Chic are obvious at a time when it
seems that everyone works for a start-up, when the dot-com nouveaux
riches are thumbing their noses at everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   But are the geeks really cool? A closer examination of Northrup
reveals that, maybe, just maybe, a geek's idea of sexiness is
getting as close as possible to nongeekiness while still knowing
your way around your operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Northrup, the anointed poster-boy for geeks around the world, is
almost disappointingly normal. Granted, his life revolves around
computers. He does Web hosting (whatever that means) for
Burlington-based Genuity Inc., and on the side writes technical
books that have been published in a half-dozen languages.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a result of standing in the media glare for a while,
but he has polished his social graces _ like holding open a door
for a woman. And he says he'd rather talk about his hobbies _
hiking, rollerblading, photography _ than computers. He likes to
party. He has a girlfriend, who, he stresses, he did not meet
online.
</P>
<P>
   He's good-looking, too, in a nondescript way _ 6-foot-1, medium
build, with pleasing features and a widow's peak. Though his sense
of style is, by his own admission, lacking. He shows up for lunch
with his gray flannel shirt unbuttoned halfway down (with a white
T-shirt underneath).
</P>
<P>
   Queried about his seeming normality, Northrup replied, ``A lot
of geeks wouldn't consider me a geek because I'm not as geeky as
them, but I know people who are just regular people and I am
definitely a geek.''
</P>
<P>
   Although everyone has a general notion of what a geek is, no one
seems confident of an exact definition. To Northrup, it's ``anyone
who is really, really into computers.'' To Merriam Webster's
Collegiate Dictionary, it's ``a person often of an intellectual
bent who is disapproved of.''
</P>
<P>
   Northrup's geek credentials are rooted in childhood. At the age
of 8, he started taking computers apart and putting them together
in his home town of Pflugerville, Texas. He calls himself an ugly
kid (overweight, bad skin) who hung out with the band crowd and
played trombone. ``I guess I couldn't find a more awkward
instrument,'' he said. He remembers suffering his share of minor
indignities at the hands of ``cooler'' kids.
</P>
<P>
   Being Sexiest Geek Alive has attracted him considerable media
attention. The contest has been featured on CNN, ``Good Morning
America,'' ``The Montel Williams Show,'' and in plenty of
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But women, Northrup laments, have been unimpressed. No one has
hit on him. He's gotten only a few e-mails from women he's never
met. ``You're not that bad-looking,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   Men he knows have not always taken his ``sexy'' designation with
good humor. ``Guys in general are completely uncomfortable with
it,'' he said. ``I hear that people at work say things like, `What
makes him such a big shot?' It's clearly a joke!''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Northrup filled out the application just for fun, when
he was bored listening in on a conference call at work one day. It
turns out he doesn't really want revenge on the jocks and
cheerleaders.
</P>
<P>
   So the question remains, how hip is geekiness really? Rosnack
admits that the contest's creators were interested in a winner who
would be an appealing ambassador to the nongeek world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the world, hey, geeks can be cool,'' Rosnack
said.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Filing into a cramped room for the spring
session's first day of classes, the eager Harvard seniors opened
fresh notebooks, examined crisp sheets of paper listing future
lectures, and anxiously exchanged gossip before the seminar on
human nature began.
</P>
<P>
   Many wore sweaters, though it was a warm day in late May. The
women pulled books from large purses, not knapsacks. And the
juiciest gossip wasn't about sports or keg parties, but about a
classmate's surgery.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't any undergraduate philosophy seminar: These seniors
were real seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all were at least 65 years old, and they weren't
concerned about such things as job offers, high grades, or graduate
diplomas. They had come to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to prevent the dying of my gray matter,'' Gertrude
Kline, 71, of Newton, said before a previous class surveying the
history of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The students at Harvard's Institute of Learning in Retirement
are part of an explosion of the lifelong learning movement, as
college campuses increasingly host educational programs for people
older than 55. Spurred by increasing life spans, and the
realization that graying baby boomers want more from retirement
than bingo, travel and bouncing grandchildren, schools are finding
that many in this college-educated generation are hungry for
intellectual stimulation. And these older students want to learn
about everything from quantum theory to the short stories of Henry
James.
</P>
<P>
   When Harvard started its program in 1977, it was the second of
its kind in the country, following the New School in New York, now
the New School University.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few programs opened in the 1980s, but the trickle led to
a deluge. Today, there are about 350 such accredited programs
around the country, according to the Elderhostel Institute Network,
a Boston-based umbrella organization for institutions of learning
in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, 14 college-sponsored elderly education
programs are affiliated with Elderhostel, and at least two more are
opening in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Harvard, schools with post-retirement classes in
the area include Boston College, Williams College, Middlesex
Community College, Lasell College, and the University of
Massachusetts at Boston and Lowell. In September, Brandeis and
Tufts are starting programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, indeed, an explosion, and it's only continuing,''
said Nancy Merz, director of Elderhostel, which has 72,000 members
and plans to open 52 more institutes soon. ``The only problem is
responding to the demand. We get five to 10 calls a week from
colleges or people who want to open new institutes. The programs
now often have to refuse people.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past century, the average life span in the United States
has increased to 77 years from 47. While today about 21 percent of
the population is older than 55, the Census Bureau projects that in
2030 the percentage will jump to about 31 percent, an increase of
48 million people.
</P>
<P>
   At many post-retirement educational programs, that translates
into a competitive admissions process.
</P>
<P>
   With about 500 lifetime students accepted, Harvard can take only
25 new students a year. Soon after announcing its program, Brandeis
officials received about 800 applications for 400 spaces. And
despite more class space and better parking than Harvard, Boston
College has an eight-year-old program that routinely turns away
prospective students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so competitive we find ourselves having to make some
extremely invidious choices,'' said Leonie Gordon, director of
Harvard's program. ``We would love to have more people, but we
don't have the room.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, reasons other than intellectual
stimulation that lure so many older people to college classes.
Chief among them is the chance to get out of the house and
socialize. ``I've made a lot of friends since I've been here,''
Kline said. ``That's an integral part of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Another motive is to spend time on college campuses, which in
addition to nostalgia include the charm of youth, ideas, and
structure.
</P>
<P>
   For retired professors like Marie Callahan, the classes offer a
chance to prevent the atrophying of teaching skills. At most of the
programs, students do the teaching, requiring them to spend time
planning their courses, writing syllabuses, and preparing lectures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program offers a lot of opportunities, but for me, it
really helps keep my academic faculties alive,'' said Callahan, a
retired community college professor of French history who teaches
Kline's class on Irish history at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The post-retirement education programs serve two main purposes,
Gordon said: preventing the withdrawal of seniors from society and
increasing contacts between the young and the old.
</P>
<P>
   While she doesn't believe every school needs such a program, she
says, people now more than ever should know there's life after
retirement. Gordon conceives of a third level of education, a
system that one day might become as normal as an 18-year-old
graduating from high school and going to college. In the third
level, retirees would have the option of returning to school.
</P>
<P>
   A similar vision spurred Bernard Reisman, 73, to launch such a
program at Brandeis. Before retiring last June from teaching Jewish
studies at Brandeis, Reisman wondered how he might stay involved
with the academic community.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after months of planning, he has 20 classes lined up for
the fall semester with seminars ranging from religion to the
history of science. ``People 55 and over are bountiful and eager
for some sophisticated and stimulating activity,'' he said. ``The
notion of coming to a college for classes really has people getting
in line.''
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard, with canes propped in a corner, balding men craning
to read the blackboard through thick glasses, with an eagerness for
knowledge absent in many college classes, the seniors in the
philosophy seminar titled ``A Glorious Accident'' chatted about eye
surgery and trips to the Orient.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the professor turned out the lights for the main event: a
documentary on free will featuring biochemist Rupert Sheldrake.
After a while, as in other college classes, some students intensely
scribbled notes, others gazed blankly out a window, and a few fell
fast asleep.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, however, made the difference clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this exciting?'' she whispered.

SOUPED-UP SCOOTER COULD DRIVE A TRANSPORTATION REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This season's hot new accessory not only goes
anywhere, it takes you almost anywhere you want to go.
</P>
<P>
   Scooters, those icons of suburban childhood circa 1950, are
suddenly popular with people who were barely old enough to ride a
bicycle back then; or who were not even born yet. Powered by gas,
battery, or old-fashioned foot power, they can be spotted here
wherever an errand is being run or a cup of coffee is being
grabbed, especially in places where parking spots are few and far
between.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Oshirak sometimes totes her scooter on the ferry, then
rides it the rest of the way to work. She takes it to lunch, to
meetings, anywhere she needs to get to fast. The other night she
scooted downtown in just seven minutes, a third of the time it
would have taken by car in rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be tooling down the street and the biggest disruption
isn't cars or potholes or pedestrians; it's people asking, `Hey,
where'd you get that?' '' said Oshirak, 31, marketing and events
director at the San Francisco-based Joe Boxer Corp. ``It's perfect
for a city this size. I haven't run out of charge yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The model Oshirak prefers is known as the Zappy, a 37-pound,
$599 electric scooter that got priceless publicity when actor Kevin
Spacey rode his onto the set of David Letterman's late-night talk
show and declared it the only way to get around New York. Sales
were strong before, with more than 20,000 already on the streets in
the United States and other countries. Now there's a backlog of
several thousand for scooters that come in what Ian Olson, manager
of Zapworld.com's local store, dubbed ``electric'' red, blue, and
yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Slower than a bicycle, faster than two feet, Zappies travel
about 13 miles per hour, depending on the weight of the rider and
the hilliness of the terrain. The more oomph the rider puts into
it, the farther the cruise range, which Zapworld officials put at
as much as 8 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are saying, `Why Zappies? Why now?' '' said
Gary Starr, chief executive officer of Zapworld, based in
Sebastopol. ``But we always thought it would take off. It's
efficient . . . and it's a blast.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Farrell, senior vice president of creative services at
Sharper Image, which is based here, said he has no ready
explanation for the sudden demand for the scooter, which has become
the top seller at the retail chain's stores and No. 2 when catalog
sales are included. Named the Razor and manufactered in China, the
$99 nonmotorized scooter first swept Japan, then Australia, Hawaii,
and California. Weekly sales are in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Now its popularity is moving East, Farrell said, with the Razor
already evident in New York and expected in quantity in Boston
sometime this summer. Zapworld, which just shipped $200,000 worth
of Zappies to Norway, recently brought out its own version of the
so-called kick scooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those magical, fad-driven things,'' said
Farrell, whose employer also sells an upscale version of the Razor
that costs about $400 and travels at four times a walking pace.
``Utility is not the whole story. It's just a phenonemon that we
can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, part of the explanation is portability. Both types of
scooters fold up easily for carrying. Unlike the also-popular
Go-Peds, powered by 1.2 horsepower engines and able to travel 25
miles on a tank of gas, Zappies and Razors do not require fuel.
That means they are allowed on public trains, buses, and boats, no
small advantage in a city where traffic congestion is among the top
laments of the dot.com employees remaking San Francisco in their
own image.
</P>
<P>
   Parking, or the lack of it, was the reason Douglas Watson cited
for test driving a Zappy the other day. Helmet on, he practiced
kick-starting, picking up speed, slowing down, and stopping behind
the company's San Francisco outlet, where shoppers can also buy
regular bicycles, battery-powered bicycles, and other
energy-efficient means of transportation. Still, Watson was
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's kind of silly looking, but I don't really care,''
said Watson, 24, an audiovisual technician at a hotel. ``It would
be great for covering short distances. And it's getting really,
really hard to find parking.''
</P>
<P>
   The parking problem was what moved the owners of Black Rocket
Marketing to decide that Zappies were just what its 30 or so
employees needed. The firm bought four for itself, and gave another
two away. Now they're used at any hour of the day to courier
packages, run office errands, or go out for a quick lunch.
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Mumford, a 25-year-old production artist who leaves
his Zown appy at Black Rocket for colleagues to use, put it, ``I
unplug it, I run over to the sandwich shop, I take it right in the
store, I put the food in the bag, and I'm gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend has drawn the attention of state lawmakers, who now
require riders to wear helmets, and to stay off sidewalks and roads
where the speed limit exceeds 25 miles per hour. Only riders 16 or
older can use public roadways at all, and then they are forbidden
from pushing their scooters past 15 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the dangers _ in May a San Mateo man was killed when he
drove his electrically powered scooter into traffic, and dozens of
people have been injured on their motorized scooters _ Oshirak said
she is about to start wearing a helmet. What she can't imagine
doing is getting around town any other way than on her Zappy, a
fleet of which Joe Boxer acquired in August 1999 after featuring
them in a fashion show along with models showing the company's
underwear collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing a big grand finale and we wanted to show
underwear in a new way,'' said Oshirak. ``We just thought of
Zappies. . . . It's the way to go.''

BISHOPS URGE LIFELONG RELIGIOUS EDUCATION FOR CATHOLICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned that many adult Catholics do not know enough about
their own religion, the 29 Catholic bishops of New England have
taken the unusual step of issuing a joint call for intensified
lifelong religious education.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops, from the 11 Roman Catholic and two Eastern Catholic
dioceses in the six New England states, issued a pastoral letter
declaring that ``with ever greater urgency, we are all called in
this new millennium to know our faith and to pass it on in all its
fullness to the next generation.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, which the bishops plan to distribute through
diocesan newspapers, over the Internet, and in parishes, does not
lay out specific proposals for reforming adult education, but
stated: ``We want all adults to have the opportunity to deepen
their understanding of the Christian message by means of
theological instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Bishop Richard J. Malone of Boston said the
region's Catholic leaders are working on ways to improve the
education of adults, but that the hierarchy also expects clergy and
laypeople to come up with ideas for translating the pastoral letter
into action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our formal religious education usually stops with
confirmation, and people go through adulthood with what is
sometimes an adolescent understanding of faith,'' said Malone, who
is the top education official for the Archdiocese of Boston.
``We're trying to shift the paradigm from thinking of religious
education as exclusively something for children to a sense that
religious education is a lifelong process.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said surveys have indicated weak understanding of some
tenets of Catholicism among Catholic adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like them to learn more about Catholic doctrine,
liturgy and the sacraments, the Catholic moral life, and prayer,''
Malone said. ``In other words, what we believe, and how we
celebrate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone said some parishes are already doing innovative things to
draw adults further into the church, such as appointing mentors for
new parents who arrive at church to baptize a child. But he said
too many churches depend on poorly attended lecture series as their
adult education program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very engaging adult things going on in many
parishes, but in general it can be a lot stronger,'' Malone said.
``We're trying to stretch people creatively beyond the lecture
thing. How can we infuse all the different activities, even social
activities, with a little bit stronger adult education component?
We need to look over the whole of parish life.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the bishops' document is titled ``A Pastoral Letter on
Catechetics,'' Malone said forms of instruction should be more
sophisticated than the question-and-answer format historically
associated with the word catechism.
</P>
<P>
   The letter follows more pointed documents issued by Pope John
Paul II and by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops aimed at
rejuvenating Catholic religious education, especially for adults.
According to Thomas Groome, a Boston College theology professor who
specializes in religious education, Catholic Sunday school programs
for children have become increasingly vibrant in recent years, with
increasing enrollments and more effective teaching methods, but
with the new documents church leaders are trying to emphasize the
importance of ongoing faith formation by adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much empirical evidence of new vitality in the
church's catechetical ministry, and for adults as well as for
children,'' Groome said. ``I am grateful that our New England
bishops celebrate and encourage the success of this all important
ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Other religious denominations are also grappling with adult
education, and some have moved more aggressively than the Catholic
Church to take advantage of a resurgent interest in religion and
spirituality among some Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Malone spoke approvingly of the Me'ah program, a two-year
intensive adult education program launched by the Boston Jewish
community that has been enjoying considerable success.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church has been a leader among Protestant
denominations at offering rigorous religious education for adults.
More than 640,000 Methodists have taken part in a 34-week program
called Disciple Bible Studies, a lay-led weekly Bible study course
for adults conducted in small groups.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government was
thrown into tumult Wednesday when parliament, by a substantial
majority, approved a preliminary bill to disperse and head toward
new elections.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires three more hearings to become law, and it
could end up being derailed by political maneuvering or the basic
desire of members of parliament to cling to their jobs and
perquisites. But it seemed inevitable Wednesday that the vote would
break up the governing coalition and create a chaotic interlude at
a diplomatically inopportune moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the final peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians
that were supposed to consume Barak's energies this summer.
Instead, he will be forced to devote considerable time to domestic
negotiations _ ``Poker time!'' his Cabinet secretary, Yitzhak
Herzog, said. Barak could face the endgame of the peace effort and
the endgame of his year-old government at almost the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the threshold of a new era, and from here it looks
like it will be a mess,'' said Nahum Barnea, a veteran political
analyst, as he surveyed the frenzied politicking in the bustling
halls of the flat-roofed parliament building Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did not make any statements directly after the vote, which
was 61-48 with 11 of 120 members absent. But right before the vote,
when the outcome was already clear, he told Israel Radio: ``I have
a positive disposition by nature. This government will continue to
rule.''
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday evening, he addressed the nation with a completely
unruffled manner. Saying that the Cabinet would meet on Sunday and
figure out how to proceed, his advised all Israelis to relax, enjoy
the holiday of Shavuout that begins Thursday, and trust him to
restore calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust will settle,'' he said confidently. ``There aren't
going to be any elections.''
</P>
<P>
   A former general who was elected by an overwhelming majority
last May, Barak went to great effort to cobble together a broad
coalition of left and right, religious and secular parties in what
he portrayed as an effort to heal the diverse rifts in Israeli
society. He also believed that he needed a broad government to back
his peacemaking plans.
</P>
<P>
   But from the time Barak took office last July, the coalition was
fractious.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday three of the six parties in his 68-member
government voted against him: the National Religious Party, which
was on its way to quitting anyway; the Russian immigrant party,
Yisrael B'Aliyah, led by the interior minister, Natan Sharansky;
and Shas, the ultra-Orthodox movement that is the third-largest
political party in Israel, after the Liberal/One Israel and the
Likud parties.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All three parties voting against Barak served in the right-wing
Cabinet of the former prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. A former
chief of staff of Netanyahu's, Avigdor Lieberman, who heads a
second Russian immigrant party, introduced the bill. Shas members
encouraged him to do so, and when the vote passed, they surrounded
Lieberman for an extended group hug.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several feet away, Ophir Pines-Paz, the
chairman of Barak's faction, sat alone, looking shocked and
crestfallen.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, which with 17 members of parliament represents Jews of
North African and Middle Eastern origin, has been the balkiest
party in the coalition, fighting for money and respect from the
first day. The other two parties more specifically opposed Barak's
peace moves, and long felt out of place in a center-left
government, frequently siding with the right-wing opposition that
was weakened without them.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces several options in the immediate future, as this
bill wends its way through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He could try once more to save his broad coalition, which
experts considered unlikely. Before the vote, Barak's office put
out a statement suggesting that he would dismiss any ministers who
cast their ballot against the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister has decided to put a stop to a situation in
which ministers warm their Cabinet seat but act as though they're
in the opposition,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   He could reshape the coalition as a narrow minority government
that depends on Arab parties for majority votes on peacemaking
issues, which is the most likely. That would give him a government
that echoed the one led by his mentor, the late Yitzhak Rabin,
which faced a strong right-wing opposition. Barak had aspired not
to copy it because he felt it was divisive and undermined the peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Or he could bypass parliament and ask outgoing Israeli President
Ezer Weizman for permission to resign, which would force new
elections in 90 days from the time the request was granted. That
would be much quicker than if the elections came about as a result
of Wednesday's bill, and it would allow Barak to seize the momentum
and profit from his surge in popularity after the Israeli troop
withdrawal from Lebanon last month.
</P>
<P>
   Several ministers of the government wrung their hands Wednesday
and claimed that the politicians who voted to shake things up were
tone-deaf to the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote has nothing to do with what people want,'' said Haim
Ramon, a minister charged with Jerusalem affairs. ``Your desire,''
he told the lawmakers, ``is disconnected from reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Melchior, a dovish rabbi in Barak's Cabinet, said the
vote revealed the ``sectorialism'' of parliament and predicted that
it would infuriate the public. ``What? They want a period of
uncertainty?'' he said. ``No one will want this. Everyone outside
this building will hate us.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they feared that the country's diplomatic efforts
would suffer most. ``This is not just a government crisis,'' said
Naomi Chazan, a leftist lawmaker. ``It's the future of the peace
process, and everyone who voted for this is exercising maximum
irresponsibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the right-wing Likud Party did not waste time in
proclaiming Barak's days to be numbered. ``I'm running around
trying to form a new coalition right now,'' said Silvan Shalom, a
young lawmaker who aspires to take over the Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom acknowledged that the peace effort, which is not his
priority, might be hurt. `Obviously the other side will understand
that they are negotiating with a lame duck, and they won't want to
make decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shas party, whose power base is built on a social service
network that includes a large religious school system, has been
battling for money to cover its schools' debts. Shas' leader, Eli
Yishai, has butted heads with the leftist education minister, Yossi
Sarid, on funding, educational reform and power issues. And Shas'
spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, is under police investigation
for inciting violence against Sarid in his sermons.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' vote Wednesday was the culmination of its threats against
the government, which followed Barak's suspension of negotiations
over the problems of its school system earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided on Monday morning to vote in favor of Avigdor
Lieberman's bill,'' said Yitzhak Suderi, the spokesman for Shas.
``When we gave him our word, he decided to introduce his bill. We
warned the prime minister a few weeks ago that Lieberman was
preparing the bill and that we might support it if we were to
continue to be persecuted by Meretz,'' which is Sarid's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for the prime minister to make a decision,''
Suderi continued. ``Does he want a narrow coalition that will
endure only two or three weeks, or does he want to try to maintain
his broad coalition. He can either show leadership, as we know he
is capable of, given the experience with the withdrawal from
Lebanon, or he can do Yossi Sarid's bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberal, secular members of the Israeli public who voted
Barak into office are hoping that he will finally turn his back on
Shas. Several ministers said they imagined he would.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ramon, long a political ally of Shas, sounded fed up
Wednesday. ``One thing's for sure,'' he said. ``The mess is over.
And the next coalition will be organized so that whoever votes
against us is out the same day.''

homes in 22 states. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say that the fees
were added to the principal and the plaintiffs were never told

CHRISTOVAL, Texas: living,'' she said. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet, days later, after her family had been called to her
bedside, Buchholz sat up in bed and was quickly able to walk.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmelite nuns had been praying for her. Doctors concluded
that she was suffering from a rare fungal disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm alive because a whole bunch of prayers were said,'' she
insists. ``We came through it. In a strange way, it was a
blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other stories about the power of the nuns' prayers,
Chandler said. Many in the community attest that the sisters'
prayers are ``almighty powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   And the community has shown its gratitude.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 years, the Carmelite sisters have been saving money for a
new monastery. Their hope was simply to expand their old site,
maybe bring in a few more nuns, even recruit more women to their
calling.
</P>
<P>
   They never dreamed of the missionlike compound that is being
built.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, a Christoval family offered the nuns a section of
ranch land on which to build their monastery. Pierce Holt, the
landowner, graduated from Angelo State University in 1987 as one of
the university's top football players.
</P>
<P>
   He was a consensus All-American in college and went on to play
in the National Football League, becoming a Pro Bowl lineman with
the San Francisco 49ers and the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``His wife was teaching a catechism class and wanted to bring
her students to our monastery to learn more about it,'' Sister
Marie said. ``While they were here, we told them we planned to
build a new monastery for a jubilee birthday gift for Jesus. They
were excited about that and later came back with her husband and
three children and said they would offer part of their land for the
monastery.''
</P>
<P>
   Then more benefactors arrived. One man put in a road to the
building site; others donated materials. People paid $100 each to
have their names etched on stones for a ``Pathway of Prayer''
outside the nuns' cottages.
</P>
<P>
   And Eva Tucker, a legendary San Angelo native, donated hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   At 89, Tucker is active in the Catholic church and has twice had
private audiences with the pope.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in San Angelo in 1911, attended Incarnate Word
Academy in San Antonio, and then became the first Hispanic to
graduate from what then was San Angelo High School. She also
attended San Angelo Business College and San Angelo College.
</P>
<P>
   She taught school in Mertzon and headed a school for Hispanic
students in Ballinger before the system integrated. During World
War II, she served as a translator for the State Department in
Washington, D.C. After the war, she married Art Tucker, a prominent
oil producer who died in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Tucker is a very charitable person,'' Sister Marie said.
</P>
<P>
   As the project progressed, one of the nuns, Sister Annunciata,
studied the building plans and eventually began supervising
construction. Most of the workers came to know her as Sister
Contractor.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to open the monastery this spring, and the sisters
have moved to their new home. But the monastery isn't completed and
won't be for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just rough it,'' Sister Marie said. ``We are about
$200,000 short, and we're still looking for ways to raise the
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Already women are writing to the sisters, inquiring about
joining the monastery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interestingly, in these days when there is a decrease in
vocations like mine, in religious life in general, there is a
surprising new interest in this deeper way of life,'' Bishop
Pfeifer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a new hunger for God in people, a new spirituality.
We are in a world of noise, constant activity, people judge by the
dollar sign,'' he said. ``Here are people who commit themselves to
God, give up material things and help us to realize the meaning of
life is found in the soul.'' ``The new monastery's address is
Carmelite Monastery of Our Lady of Grace, 1 Via Maria, Christoval
TX 76935. The phone number is (915) 853-1722.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   NUNS TRACE HISTORY TO 13TH CENTURY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Carmelites trace their history to a band of Christian soldiers
who settled in the caves ``near the fountain of Elijah'' on Mount
Carmel in Palestine after the Crusades in the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
   They sought to live as hermits and to meditate in silence and
solitude. They became a recognized religious order about 1215 A.D.
</P>
<P>
   The first monasteries of nuns were founded in the 15th century.
There are two orders of Carmelite nuns. The original order is
called Carmelites of the Ancient Observance. The Discalced Order
was established in the 16th century. Discalced, which means
``barefoot,'' is the reformed order.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmelite Monastery of Our Lady of Grace near San Angelo is
from the original order.
</P>
<P>
   Their vestment is a large brown scapular, a sleeveless outer
garment worn on the shoulders. The nuns believe it is the same as
the scapular that the Virgin Mary gave to St. Simon Stock in 1247.

   TINY-APARTMENTS (New York) _ In the most ingenious small
Manhattan apartments, designers and their clients become
illusionists. They make beds disappear, tables double in height and
televisions spin between two rooms at once. By Elaine Louie.
</P>
<P>
   With photos, NYT8,9.
</P>
<P>
   SURFER-SHACK (Undated) _ It is a well-known fact that there is a
corollary between the size of a house and the number of headaches
it causes. And in the Hamptons, their severity increase
exponentially as one proceeds east along Route 27 to the windmill
in East Hampton. Cynthia Rowley, the fashion designer, and her
husband, Bill Keenan, a designer and sculptor, shucked the
headaches involved in owning a four-bedroom shingled stunner in the
estate section of East Hampton and moved instead to a surfer's
shack in Montauk. By Julie Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   TOWER-BY-THE-SEA (Undated) _ In tower building, small is lovely.
It is the tall imagination that counts. A few summers ago in Maine,
I built a tower on a high hill overlooking the sea. My tower is
only 12 by 12 1/2 feet and three stories high, if you generously
include the observation deck. Building up to that deck _ with
simple tools, no electricity and little help _ was a major
satisfaction, indeed a salvation, during a year that saw my
marriage shaken, and my faith often in shambles. By Bill Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   TINY-APARTMENT-LIFE (New York) _ A lot of New Yorkers live in
small spaces, some smaller than others. My own, for example,
measures 250 square feet as the crow walks. But I'm not alone, as I
found out when I went in search of other small-apartment lovers in
Manhattan. By Stephen Mihm.
</P>
<P>
   AIRSTREAM-TRAILER (Undated) _ ``The property is like a
collection of little events,'' said Barbara Jakobson of her summer
place in East Hampton. ``It's a little compound.'' She listed the
small pieces: main house, shed, summer room, tennis court, pool,
and _ parked in a poof of wild grasses _ a garden folly posing as
pool house: an old, 21-foot-long, aluminum travel trailer. But it's
not just any old metal trailer. It's an Airstream land yacht circa
1974 (complete with the original orange shag carpet). By Barbara
Flanagan.

CARMELITE NUNS TURN TO A NEW TEXAS HOLY LAND FOR SOLITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHRISTOVAL, Texas _ On a hot and gusty West Texas day, Sister
Marie hurries across the chalky construction site with her
traditional brown habit lapping at the top of her blue cowboy
boots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have cowboy boots,'' she says of the six cloistered
nuns who have made the new monastery their home. ``They warned us
there were a lot of snakes out here, but they said the snakes
wouldn't strike higher than six inches, and we would be safe as
long as we had our boots on.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Carmelite Monastery of Our Lady of Grace is rising,
stone by stone, above the twisted mesquite and live oak trees. It
is a new Texas holy land on the rocky pastures, a place of prayer
and deep spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   Also a place of goats and cattle and rattlesnakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to learn to live out here,'' the
55-year-old Carmelite nun says with girlish enthusiasm. ``It's like
a different planet.''
</P>
<P>
   She points to what will be the kitchen and then hurries off to
the chapel, talking excitedly and stirring up a whirl of dust with
her unconventional footwear. She warns, ``Watch your step.''
</P>
<P>
   The nuns have become familiar with the serpents. ``One of our
sisters was hanging clothes on a line out here when she saw
something sparkling in the grass,'' Sister Marie recalled. ``She
thought it was rosary beads, but when she looked closer, she saw it
was a snake.''
</P>
<P>
   The snake didn't strike, Sister Marie believes, because it
sensed the ``calmness and serenity'' of the nun. ``Sister had 10
guardian angels on her shoulder that day,'' Sister Marie said.
``She came running in to tell us about the snake, and we all went
out and chopped its head off.''
</P>
<P>
   Life will be different for the nuns on the West Texas pastures.
The rolling hills, harsh and drought-hardened, bristle with cactus.
Rocks litter the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, quiet pervades this 640-acre site. Solitude is
essential to the Carmelite nuns, and they had almost none at their
old home in San Angelo about 25 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   Their small frame monastery at the edge of Goodfellow Air Force
Base in San Angelo had been their home and sanctuary for 11 years,
although its crowded rooms made life difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old neighborhood is pretty peaceful'' except, she said,
for loud rock 'n' roll music on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   But the nuns' little ranch house wasn't conducive to their life
of prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be more like the first hermits of Mount Carmel,''
she explained, referring to 13th-century Christian veterans of the
Crusades who sought a contemplative life in the caves on Mount
Carmel in Palestine. ``They had separate caves. They had silence
and solitude and would only come together for prayer and their
meals.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Marie arrived in San Angelo from a monastery in North
Dakota in 1989. Life was different there. The monastery was
established, roomy and set on a lush farm.
</P>
<P>
   She knew life would be different in Texas, she said, but she
welcomed the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually looked forward to the heat and doing our gardens
all year round,'' she said. ``It was very delightful in more ways
than one, because the people were just as warm as the weather. We
were so amazed. It was unexpected to us: the warmth of the people,
their eagerness to help in every way. It was just one miracle after
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The people of the San Angelo area, Catholic and non-Catholic,
were eager to embrace the nuns. Bishop Michael Pfeifer of the San
Angelo Diocese invited the sisters to establish a monastery in
town, and on their arrival they asked him what he wanted them to
pray for first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rain,'' he answered. The night of the monastery dedication,
four inches of rain fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bishop announced they were coming, there was
jubilation,'' said Tilly Chandler, a member of Holy Angel parish.
``It is such an asset to have them here, knowing what they are and
how they lead their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had to be 1,100-1,500 people for the dedication of the
monastery, and the old chapel only seats 40. Hundreds of people
stood outside in the rain listening to Mass.''
</P>
<P>
   Chandler said it was comforting to know that San Angelo had a
group of women ``at that height of spirituality whose sole purpose
is to pray for the needs of this community.''
</P>
<P>
   And some in the community insist that the prayers are being
answered.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Buchholz, a 47-year-old San Angelo resident, credits the
nuns with a life-saving ``miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I have a paper on my wall that says it was a miracle,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Buchholz became desperately ill and was taken to a San
Antonio hospital. She soon fell into a coma and her organs began to
fail. More than 20 specialists examined her, she said, but no one
offered a diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paper I have on my wall is from my consultation with an
infectious disease specialist who figured my mortality chances at
95 percent. I was given only a 5 percent chance at living,'' she
said.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Sonoma and Mendocino coasts have always been
a paradise for abalone divers, the last sanctuary for the beloved
red abalone.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's highly publicized sweep of Bay Area abalone
poachers unveiled again how greed and a lucrative black market has
severely affected a species.
</P>
<P>
   According to the California Department of Fish and Game, three
sophisticated poaching rings working simultaneously raped that
paradise in the past six years for more than 70,000 abalone worth
$2.5 million. In an arrest sweep, 18 suspects from Bay Area
counties were picked up and booked, many for felony conspiracy.
That brings the number of arrests to 100 in the past two years for
the illegal take, and often sale, of the cherished mollusk.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested include groups of divers, wholesalers, buyers and
delivery transporters, said Fred Cole, a deputy chief of DFG's
Enforcement Branch.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoma and Mendocino coast is one of the best areas in the
world for sport abalone diving, where divers will free-dive,
holding their breath, often using snorkels. Any kind of air assist,
such as using a scuba tank, is illegal, and so is selling any
abalone taken there. According to biologists, that is why abalone
on the Northern California coast have flourished while being picked
clean in areas where commercial diving has been permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Game wardens working undercover have discovered that abalone
typically sell illegally for $35 each, and occasionally as high as
$80.
</P>
<P>
   That also is why this area has always represented a forbidden
paradise for Bay Area poachers. Four years ago, DFG game warden
Dave Bezzone, often working on his own to track abalone poachers,
uncovered the biggest felony wildlife poaching operation in
California history with links to San Francisco, Los Angeles, San
Diego, Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature then mandated a new Special Operations
Unit for the DFG. In the past two years, this new unit, often
working undercover, has made three major sweep arrests in the Bay
Area.
</P>
<P>
   Each investigation has uncovered similar operations, said state
game warden Mark Lucero, starting with the illegal take of abalone
in large quantities from the Mendocino and Sonoma coast.
</P>
<P>
   The damage to wildlife health can be staggering.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reef where we found them targeting was outside Mote Creek
in Mendocino County,'' Steve Martarano said. ``They had just picked
it clean.''
</P>
<P>
   In such areas, it will take 15 years to undo the damage,
according to Konstatin Karpov, a state marine biologist. He said it
is vital to catch abalone poachers, and that they ``threaten the
sustainability'' of the species in areas where they have been
overfished.
</P>
<P>
   Martarano added that undercover wardens believe the past two
years of ongoing investigations has put a significant dent in the
illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last September's arrests, we noticed a decrease in
activity right away,'' Martarano said. ``Then we noticed that there
were a lot more women involved and arrested last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for that, he said, is ``because their male partners
had been arrested last year'' and were in jail, so it fell to their
spouses to continue the illegal operations.

<P>
   BOERNE, Texas _ The sun was just beginning its daily climb over
Boerne Lake when Jason Pipoly rolled his wheelchair down the
gravel-covered boat ramp and into the cool, green water.
</P>
<P>
   He wheeled himself out about 20 feet, until the thin tires were
imbedded in the lake bottom and his paralyzed legs were half
submerged. Then he pushed his body weight onto his arms, leaned
forward and gently rolled into the water.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Pipoly did this, the police thought they had a
suicide on their hands. Now they know better.
</P>
<P>
   Pipoly makes this trip just about every day, motivated not by
desperation, but by his determination to conquer a physical
handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Pipoly, 29, a paraplegic since breaking his back in a car
accident two years ago, is determined to swim the English Channel,
a feat he first attempted when he was 11 years old, a crossing his
father made 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   When he will again try the grueling swim from England to France
is still undetermined. But the training has begun in earnest on
this small, quiet lake northwest of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a journey that I'm so happy I've gone on,'' Pipoly
said before another three-hour swim back and forth across the lake.
``The training has become the best part of my day. It's spiritual.
I feel the presence of God out there.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 swimmers have crossed the English Channel since
British Capt. Matthew Webb made the first recorded crossing in
1875. Hundreds more have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is challenging by any standards. The Channel is 21
miles wide at its narrowest point _ the Strait of Dover _ but
winds, tides and currents can carry swimmers far off that track,
adding miles and hours to the journey. Water temperatures, even in
the summer, are a crisp 60 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, his father, Carl Pipoly, swam the Channel. Jason was 9
at the time, and remembers being more excited over the trip to
Britain than awed by his father's accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   But two years later, a more grown-up Jason Pipoly tried to
become the youngest Channel swimmer of that time. He lasted eight
hours in the water before adverse weather halted his swim.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the athletic effort made the young swimmer famous enough
for an appearance on Johnny Carson's ``Tonight Show,'' where Pipoly
confidently told the talk-show host that he would return to conquer
the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Those dreams faded, though. In 1998, Pipoly was living in Aspen,
Colo., and more focused on skiing and a budding career in
photography. His life took an abrupt turn one morning when his car
slid off the road and down an embankment, flipping onto its side
and slamming roof-first into a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately knew I broke my back,'' Pipoly said. ``I
couldn't feel my legs, and I knew something was seriously wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Months of rehab followed, and Pipoly was forced to accept the
realization that he was paralyzed from the middle of his chest
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn how to do everything all over again, even
breathing,'' he said. ``You have to learn how to dress yourself,
how to take care of yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to have this attitude of saying, `This is your new
life.' I knew sulking wasn't going to solve anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved to San Antonio in 1999 to live closer to his father,
who is a lawyer in the South Texas city. Months later, while
visiting relatives, an aunt pulled out the old tapes of the
``Tonight Show,'' and replayed the 11-year-old's unfulfilled
promise about returning to conquer the English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just stuck with me,'' Pipoly said. ``I told Johnny I was
going back, and I never went back.''
</P>
<P>
   He went to a pool but could barely stay afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could do was pull myself across the pool,'' Pipoly said.
``I told myself, `You're insane. Go home and forget about it.'
Well, I couldn't forget about it.''
</P>
<P>
   By early this year, Pipoly was ready to start training in colder
water and more natural conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On his first swim at Boerne Lake, he returned to shore to find a
police officer waiting. Someone had seen Pipoly's empty, partly
submerged wheelchair and reported a possible drowning. The officer
was ready to summon rescue crews to begin dragging the lake for a
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cop just shook his head when I swam up,'' Pipoly said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the solitary morning swim is the best part of his day,
Pipoly said. Alone in the water, he thinks about polar bears
swimming in the freezing arctic waters; he travels to far-off
lands; he prays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come up with wonderful ideas,'' he said. ``It's the clearest
my mind is throughout the day.''
</P>
<P>
   His partner and biggest supporter in the endeavor is his sister,
Gina Safranic of Minneapolis. They are working to raise the
estimated $20,000 to $30,000 he will need to train, travel and
attempt the crossing.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Pipoly said the challenge and the training have brought his
son to a new level of acceptance about the turn of events in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you come through what he's come through,
there is a normal anger there,'' the father said. ``This has
diminished the anger and gotten him to accept the injury. He's
setting goals and moving on with his life.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Pipoly would not be the first handicapped swimmer to strike out
across the channel. The Channel Swimming Association, which
regulates and authenticates Channel swims, has seen attempts by
amputees and deaf and blind individuals, said Duncan Taylor,
secretary of the association.
</P>
<P>
   The first record of a paraplegic crossing was in 1998, when
Australian John Maclean swam from England to France in just under
13 hours. A year later, a Baltimore Vietnam veteran with missing
legs attempted the crossing but was foiled by mechanical problems
in the boat that must accompany all swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   Pipoly admits doubt sometimes creeps into his mind. The
logistics of raising money, setting up the trip and actually
striking out from Dover can overwhelm him. He doesn't doubt his
ability to succeed, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``When stuff enters my mind, the best thing for me to do is to
come out here and swim,'' Pipoly said. ``When I get a good workout,
I start to think the whole thing is possible and I can actually do
this.''

&HT;     BLACK HOLES A CENTRAL TOPIC FOR ASTRONOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They are the vacuum cleaners of the universe:
black holes, those pitch-black cosmic monsters that devour stars
with nary a burp.
</P>
<P>
   They are not rare: Scientists say a super-size black hole
occupies the centers of each of at least 33 galaxies. One is a
super-massive black hole that squats at the center of Earth's
galaxy, the Milky Way.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 years after the first modern speculations about
black holes, they have become a central topic of astronomical
study. That is clear from the topics at the American Astronomical
Society meeting this week in Rochester, N.Y.:
</P>
<P>
   _ Researchers at Stanford University are planning a laboratory
simulation of a mysterious process thought to occur in the vicinity
of black holes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
used a space-based super-telescope to watch a black hole generate
intense radiation as it disrupts a nearby gas cloud.
</P>
<P>
   Rogue black holes drift through space, threatening whatever
stars or planets they pass. These juvenile delinquents of the
galaxy are omnipresent. An estimated 10 million black holes float
in the plane of our galaxy alone, said John Kormendy, an astronomer
at the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not worried that Earth eventually will disappear into
a black hole. The galaxy is so huge, about 100,000 light-years
wide, that it's highly unlikely we will encounter one, he said. (A
light-year is 6 trillion miles, the distance that light travels in
a year.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The probability that one of those will come near us during our
civilization is an enormous number of times smaller than that some
stupid (asteroid) floating around the solar system will hit us,''
said Kormendy, who spoke at the Rochester conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if one were to wonder which dangers from space we should
worry about, we should worry about rocks from space _ they've hit
us before and they will hit us again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As far back as the 18th century, astronomers speculated that a
star might be so massive that its gravity would trap light, making
the star invisible. But the idea was not taken seriously until the
1930s, when scientists used physicist Albert Einstein's equations
to show that such stars might really exist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the notion remained a backwater of science-fiction
writing until the 1960s and 1970s. That is when astronomers began
discovering extremely violent, star-like objects _ quasars, for
quasi-stellar objects _ on the edge of the known universe.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, quasars are generally thought to represent torrents of
radiation from matter plunging into giant black holes in galactic
cores.
</P>
<P>
   The closest black hole is the Milky Way, shielded from direct
view by immense interstellar clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers know it is there because their dish-shaped radio
telescopes can see through the clouds. They detect intense
radiation coming from the galactic center. The radiation is X-rays
and gamma rays, lethal to matter plunging into the black hole.
</P>
<P>
   About 33 super-massive black holes have been detected by
Kormendy, his colleagues and other scientific teams, he said at the
Rochester conference.
</P>
<P>
   A super-massive black hole is at least 1 million times the mass
of the sun. Ordinary black holes are mere runts, just a few times
as heavy as the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary black holes could be relics of stars that explode with
their residual matter collapsing under gravitational pull.
</P>
<P>
   But super-massive black holes must have formed ``in a completely
different way. How they originally formed, we don't know,''
Kormendy, 52, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.

TEXAS NATIVE A TONY-NOMINATED KNOCKOUT IN `CONTACT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARK LOWRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She doesn't sing. Doesn't utter a word, in fact. Her character
doesn't even have a name.
</P>
<P>
   And she's the biggest thing on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Yates, a Texas native and honors graduate of Southern
Methodist University in Dallas, is the Girl in the Yellow Dress in
``Contact,'' the acclaimed ``dance-play'' that won Best Musical at
the Tony Awards on Sunday. Yates herself was nominated, a fact
she's still coming to terms with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could say it's a dream come true,'' she said. ``But it's not
even that, because I never even allowed myself to dream about
getting a Tony nomination. I already feel like I've won.''
</P>
<P>
   The twentysomething dancer _ ``Dancers never give their age,''
she demurs _ didn't win for Best Featured Actress in a Musical
(co-star Karen Ziemba took home the Tony in the category), but the
show swept most of the top awards, including Best Choreography for
director Susan Stroman and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for
Boyd Gaines, to go along with the Best Musical prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact'' is three stories dealing with relationships, told
through dance, with no dialogue. In the third piece, in which Yates
appears, an advertising executive who seems to have it all wanders
into a swing club, where he sees The Girl in the Yellow Dress on
the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   As men dance with her, the exec decides he must meet her, but
then he discovers there's one thing he doesn't have in his life:
rhythym. ``She represents his salvation,'' Yates says. ``She's the
lioness of the den, she's in control.''
</P>
<P>
   The show has taken the Great White Way by storm, but
traditionalists, as well as the musicians' union, felt ``Contact''
shouldn't have been nominated for Best Musical because the
``dance-play'' has no original music, live orchestra or singing.
The debate about what constitutes a musical has been brewing since
last year, when the dance revue ``Fosse'' took home Best Musical.
There has even been talk of creating a new category.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's certainly one solution,'' Yates says. ``But I
think they're perhaps being just a bit rigid about what a musical
actually is. An art form always evolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the experience of `Contact' is very much a musical
theater experience. The three pieces have three distinct
narratives. No, it's not an original score, but the music is
absolutely essential to what is going on. And the dance is, as
well. If you had a show that had all singing and very little
staging or dancing, people would have no qualms calling that a
musical. But when the situation is reversed, and there's not
singing, people won't call it a musical.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether people want to call her show a musical or not, one
thing's for sure: Yates' life has changed dramatically since she
took on the role of The Girl in the Yellow Dress. The nomination,
she says, was just the icing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part of being a nominee is that you meet all the
other nominees, the creme de la creme of Broadway,'' she says
excitedly. I met ``legendary performers: Eartha Kitt, Rosemary
Harris, Gabriel Byrne, Derek Jacobi.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not be long before other young actors are saying the
same about Yates.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Dallas, but her family moved to the small East
Texas town of Jacksonsville, about 30 minutes south of Tyler, when
she was very young. There, she participated in gymnastics and
studied ballet and tap.
</P>
<P>
   Always an excellent scholar (she qualifies for Mensa), she was
an honor student through high school and college, although her
heart was not in the classroom but onstage. Her major at SMU was
radio/TV, but she never let dance out of her sight. After
graduation, she knew what she had to do.
</P>
<P>
   She moved to Chicago, but her first regular professional
performing gig wasn't in the Windy City but on the open seas _ as a
dancer on Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines. After six months, she got
herself back on dry land and immediately headed to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Her family ``thought I was a bit nuts at first,'' she says.
``Nobody in my family is in show business and didn't know anything
about it. Now they're very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   With her long legs and indefatigable athleticism, she quickly
landed a high-profile job in the Big Apple, as a Rockette at Radio
City Music Hall. ``It's a privilege to be a part of them,'' she
says of the famous dancing group. ``There's an incredible tradition
to them. Generations have come to see their Christmas
spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   When she wasn't high-kicking at Radio City, she was auditioning
for shows and doing temp work to make ends meet. She appeared in
the short-lived Broadway show ``Dreams'' and in several productions
in the City Center's Encore Series.
</P>
<P>
   In autumn '98 she heard about a new kind of dance show and
secured an audition. She was hired and started workshops in January
'99. By August, ``Contact'' was in full rehearsals, although no one
knew whether anything would come of it. The show opened
off-Broadway in September and quickly garnered rave reviews. In
March, it moved to Broadway, where the raves _ especially for Yates
_ intensified.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times review, theater critic Ben Brantley said,
``Ms. Yates has the daunting assignment of incarnating the woman
whom every man wants, and remarkably, that is exactly how she comes
across. She's not only dangerously beautiful, suggesting a
razor-edged Grace Kelly; she also has an exquisite balletic poise
and extensions to die for. She can act, too, projecting the
requisite fire of wistfulness beneath the icy exterior. A pinup
girl for straight men in a New York musical: Who would have thought
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Stroman, for one, says she knew her show was going to make Yates
a Broadway star. Yates has nothing but praise for her
choreographer, comparing her to the theater's dance greats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the tradition of Jerome Robbins and Bob Fosse,'' Yates says
of Stroman's choreography, ``it is the movement itself that is
telling the story, versus using a song or a scene and then doing a
production number. You don't have to separate the two with her.
It's always completely logical. I think she's very creative. One of
her greatest strengths is that she casts people very well, and
allows them to do what they do. She allows them to bring their
creativity to the role.''

&HT;     MISMANAGEMENT BLAMED FOR MISSING WAR RELICS

   WATERVLIET, N.Y. _ Hundreds of valuable military artifacts have
disappeared from armories and small museums in New York following
decades of mismanagement and shoddy bookkeeping at these
facilities, which collectively contain one of the nation's most
prestigious wartime collections.
</P>
<P>
   The state Division of Military and Naval Affairs, operating out
of the Watervliet Arsenal, has launched an intensive project to
recover the missing artifacts, which are being meticulously
cataloged and stored in two giant brick warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had ever done anything effective about this,'' said
Col. R.H. von Hasseln, history director for the Division of
Military and Naval Affairs. ``It was not properly inventoried and
not properly protected.''
</P>
<P>
   The artifacts, many of which have real historical significance,
have been targeted by professional thieves or misplaced over
decades, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, collectibles have been tracked to former armory
employees and even the offices of state legislators, investigators
say, though they declined to identify the lawmakers. Often, an item
will mysteriously reappear after investigators begin making
inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery effort began five years ago and is relying heavily
on State Police investigators to help track down dozens of stolen
and missing items. Some have been found being offered for sale on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Division of Military and Naval Affairs is
responsible for oversight of the estimated 300,000 pieces of
military memorabilia that are kept primarily at armories statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items date back to the 1600s. The collections
include the uniform of the first soldier killed in the Civil War _
complete with the hole from the bullet that felled him _ to
documents signed by George Washington. There are machine guns,
howitzers, Civil War flags with cannonball holes in them, sterling
silver plaques, swords and thousands of other wartime memorabilia.
</P>
<P>
   Many items were stolen or misplaced so long ago that police
officers tracing their trail have found themselves interviewing
residents of nursing homes and reading obituaries in search of
leads.
</P>
<P>
   There are 65 state armories. Many of the armories served both as
recruiting offices during wartime and local museums for military
artifacts that were meaningful to their communities, historians
said. Historically, regiments and other units often were raised
locally and came back with war booty.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened with the closing down of many of these
facilities is it took an already bad situation and made it worse by
forcing more and more artifacts into the hands of administrators
who had to make a decision about what to do with them,'' said
Assemblyman Jack McEneny, D-Albany, who is the former Albany County
historian.
</P>
<P>
   When the inventory effort began, state historians found
priceless artifacts stuffed in the attics, basements and even
closed-down bathrooms of some armories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in parts of buildings that most people never knew
existed,'' said Michael Aikey, a librarian and archivist for the
New York State Military Museum. ``The first door I walked into was
the Schenectady Armory. By the time I walked out the next day, they
knew (at armories) in Buffalo that something was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Aikey and others involved in the project say it was not unusual
to find that a former caretaker had given away items, sometimes to
local veterans groups that would hang them in private lodges like
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found one field piece (a Civil War cannon) missing out of
Rochester that was in somebody's garage,'' said State Police Capt.
John Byrne, a Civil War buff who is helping lead the recovery
effort.
</P>
<P>
   The value of memorabilia from that conflict has skyrocketed in
recent years, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's such a market in military hardware that people don't
realize how much some of this stuff is worth,'' Byrne said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no one has been arrested in connection with the recovery
of an artifact, primarily because the new owner usually doesn't
know it was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the State Police found a silver plaque offered for
sale on the Internet auction site eBay.
</P>
<P>
   On June 2, 1898, the plaque had been given by the Sons of the
Revolution to an infantry regiment that had fought in the
Spanish-American War. The small sterling silver plaque apparently
had been taken off a memorial flagpole in New York City years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The police did not charge the Long Island man who was willing to
sell it for $275 _ the bid made by undercover investigators. The
man quickly turned it over to investigators when he was informed
that it was state property, Byrne said. The plaque had changed
hands so many times among antiques dealers that investigators gave
up trying to find who stole it.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, State Police have been visiting gun shows
around the state looking for pilfered antique weapons. With the
assistance of military historians, investigators also have entered
the serial numbers of missing guns in a nationwide police computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain investigators throughout the state who love
to do this,'' Byrne said. ``They're history buffs, and these cases
are worked on when we can get to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the thefts have been spread over decades, but Byrne said
that as recently as two months ago thieves raided a monument in a
Columbia County cemetery and made off with a pair of World War II
machine guns. They had been welded to the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a subculture. You can't believe the underground in
artifacts,'' Byrne said. ``What's really hot right now is Civil War
items ... and there's a lot of that stuff missing out of the
armories.''

</P>
<P>
   Dozens of artifacts were discovered missing when the state
inventoried much of the collection in 1959 at the New York State
Military Museum. The work was done as part of the state's effort to
refurbish the museum before it reopened its doors to the public in
the east lobby of the Capitol in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was decimated 25 years ago when professional
burglars pulled off what historians consider the single largest
theft of state war memorabilia in history.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 5, 1975, thieves struck the museum's storage warehouse
and made off with more than 20 ``presentation swords,'' most of
which were captured from Confederate officers during the Civil War.
Even 25 years later, the whereabouts of the swords, each valued at
tens of thousands of dollars, is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (burglary) was investigated when it happened, but we still
go around to these gun shows looking for these swords,'' Byrne
said. ``We believe it was people who knew what they were after and
knew how valuable some of these pieces were. It was a major hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The success stories among the artifacts that have been recovered
so far include the dress uniform of Capt. George W. Yates. The 7th
Calvary officer died June 25, 1876, next to a river in southeast
Montana at the Battle of Little Big Horn _ Custer's Last Stand.
</P>
<P>
   Several decades ago _ no one exactly knows when _ the uniform
was loaned by New York officials to a Civil War museum at Fort
Knox. But there was no written record about the loan, so New York
officials were relieved when the Kentucky museum returned the
uniform, which is valued at $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to make some great recoveries,'' von Hasseln
said.

 &HT;    GECKOS MAY USE MOLECULAR FORCES FOR CLIMBING SKILLS
 &HT;    EDS: Originally scheduled for weekend use, now moving spot.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Geckos, the small lizards that chirp through
tropical nights, appear to invoke an obscure molecular force when
they scurry along vertical surfaces or even upside down in seeming
defiance of the law of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The tens of millions of microscopic hairs on geckos' toes are so
fine that they are able to interact with the molecules of the
surfaces on which a lizard is walking or running, said University
of California, Berkeley, biologist Robert Full.
</P>
<P>
   He and collaborators from Stanford University and Lewis and
Clark College describe their gecko studies in Thursday's issue of
the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Geckos can race along the face of a piece of polished glass,
such as a hanging mirror, or easily crawl upside down on the
ceiling of a room. A gecko can even hang from the ceiling by a
single toe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their hand-like hairy feet do not have suction cups or
glands that produce any known form of glue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Geckos have developed an amazing way of walking that rolls
these hairs onto the surface, and then peels them off again, just
like tape,'' Full said in a telephone interview. ``But it's better
than tape.''
</P>
<P>
   If the observations and calculations hold up, a century-old
mystery is solved and a possible new principle has been found for
creating an adhesive that is both dry and extremely strong.
</P>
<P>
   Using high-speed video cameras to record the mechanics of gecko
locomotion, the scientists discovered that the creatures attach
their toes to surfaces by ``unrolling'' them _ somewhat like a
``Happy New Year'' party toy unrolls when you blow through it.
</P>
<P>
   Then they lift the toes by peeling them from the surface, like
peeling off adhesive tape, Full said.
</P>
<P>
   Both actions, happening 15 times a second, are necessary for the
tips of the hairs to invoke the molecular force and withdraw from
it, Full said.
</P>
<P>
   The force that Full and his collaborators believe the lizards
are using is called the ``van der Waals force.''
</P>
<P>
   Named for the Dutch physicist who discovered it, the force
causes molecules to cling together, like magnets. However, it works
only at extremely small distances. As the space between two
molecules increases by, say, the diameter of an atom, the
attraction between them weakens at an exponential rate.
</P>
<P>
   Full and his collaborators believe that when the gecko plants
his hairy little toe on the surface of a mirror, the extremely fine
toe hair gets close enough to the molecules of the mirror to
establish a van der Waals force attraction.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the contact between the hairs and the molecules of the
mirror becomes so intimate that, for a split second, the hairs are
actually ``part of'' the mirror, Full said. And that's about as
sticky as anything ever gets.
</P>
<P>
   The hairs on the bottom of a gecko foot are known as setae,
pronounced ``SEE-tee.'' A gecko has around 500,000 of these hairs,
each about one-tenth the diameter of a human hair, on each foot.
The tip of each of the setae is further divided into between
several hundred and 1,000 even tinier hairs called spatulae, the
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These billion spatulae, which look like broccoli on the tips
of the hairs, are outstanding adhesives,'' said Full, a professor
of biology at UC Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all the tiny hairs on the four feet of a single gecko
could theoretically produce enough holding power to lift nearly 100
pounds, the scientists calculated.
</P>
<P>
   When the angle at which the hairs are pushed into the surface is
changed, they appear to lose touch with the molecular van der Waals
force, and easily disengage.

San Francisco _  OFF THE WALL  _ Reggie Glow leads a double life:
subtle and hardly noticeable during the day, but a real standout
when the lights go down. Reggie Glow is not anyone you'll ever

 Editors note: The San Francisco Chronicle rounds up the best
of  the unusual for home and garden in this regular feature, Off
the 
 Wall.   OFF THE WALL: Dishwashers Go in Disguise  
   
   
 By Holly Ocasio Rizzo  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  A fashionable dishwasher can't wear a dishwasher's
face these days. It masquerades as a fine wooden drawer, or it's
dolled up with stainless steel, like a surgical cabinet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now it also can sport a waist-high magnetic art mural disguising
it as a wine cooler, a china cabinet or even a small pet.
</P>
<P>
   The chemistry behind the panels belongs to Janie Atkinson and
her son, Gregory. Janie Atkinson started a decorative painting
business in 1976 in Atlanta, specializing in faux fax  &LR; finishes,
murals and stenciling. Gregory Atkinson spent three years in the
sign-making business before branching into real estate renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Atkinsons saw a link between their talents and the
need for lovelier kitchens in hot housing markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kitchens are becoming more of a focal point in the home,''
Janie Atkinson says.
</P>
<P>
   Mother painted in her customary trompe l'oeil style; son
searched for the perfect screen printer and the perfect background
material, which turns out to feel like canvas, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The panels measure 231/2 inches wide by 181/2 inches high for
dishwashers, plus one cabinet design measuring 24 by 341/2 inches.
A light adhesive attaches the cabinet panel; light adhesive with
magnetic material fastens the dishwasher panels.
</P>
<P>
   What can a dishwasher look like besides itself? Like art works,
the possibilities have titles: ``Wine Cooler,'' ``Blue &AMP; White
China,'' ``Herb Garden.'' ``Children's Drawing Board'' features an
empty area on which children can write with washable crayons. For
winter, there's ``Holiday Wreath.'' For pet owners or wannabes,
``Cat &AMP; Mouse,'' ``The Aquarium'' and, for cabinets, ``The Perfect
Pet,'' depicting a dog asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the dial to ``heavy wash.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHERE TO GET IT
</P>
<P>
   Door Decor panels _ seven for dishwashers and one for a base-end
cabinet _ are available for $69.95 plus shipping and handling by
calling (877) 884-8058 or visiting  &LR;  &QL;

 Tap Into the Fun of Wooden Toys  
   
 SAN RAFAEL, Calif. _  There's something about wooden toys that
sparks the imagination. Solid to the touch, sturdy and bright, they
stand up to boisterous play. Now, a San Rafael company _
 allwoodtoys.com  _ makes it easy to find a variety of high-quality
wooden toys from woodworkers in Vermont, New York, the Bay Area and
elsewhere.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Company owner is Tex Dunlap, dad to 4-year-old Colin. Wooden
toys, Dunlap explains, allow kids to play in a way that today's
video games can't. ``It adds more creative play,'' he says.
``That's what you want, to get the child to interact with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's dollhouse selection includes the pictured
Hollyhock House (above, 22x22x11 inches, $100), made by the Reprint
Mint in Oakland and imprinted with climbing vines and patterned
wallpaper. Make it homelike with wooden furniture sets ($15-$22)
and dolls with solid wood heads, bendable bodies and fabric
clothing ($10 each, $30 for family of four, available in various
ethnicities).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Blocks abound, like some with colorful Plexiglass insets
(14-piece set, $50); tree-branch-shaped blocks ($40-$45); and
pieces that form skyscrapers, a barnyard setting or a castle.
Wooden trains are ready to roll; wooden puzzles and games await
rainy afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Little hands can grab onto friendly wooden critters or clowns
($14-$22), shake wooden rattles ($6-$8), push a chunky car ($10),
or pull a colorful, stackable Convoy ($34).
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap takes care to select toys from manufacturers who adhere
to child-safe standards, and he's carved out a niche with durable
toys that let kids turn off the TV and really &LR;  play &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best tester, obviously,'' he notes, ``is our son.''

 &UR; Gardening Specialty Store Branches Out &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; ST. HELENA, Calif. _ &LR;  Given Napa Valley's climate, so conducive to
life outdoors, it's not surprising that the owner of
Berkeley's &UR; Gardenhome  &LR; sensed opportunity in wine country. What
might surprise Charles Cross's Berkeley customers, however, is the
scale of his new venture. Opened in late May on the south end of
St. Helena's busy Main Street, the second Gardenhome is three times
the size of its Fourth Street sister and designed to make a bold
retailing statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the store the whole country is talking about,''
says Cross, whose 10,000-square-foot emporium is merchandised
around the idea of erasing the boundary between house and garden.
In a former prune dehydrating plant, later a Dansk outlet, Cross
and his team have created an inviting series of open rooms
displaying plants, china, glassware, furniture, tabletop
accessories, floating candles, candelabras, soaps, lotions and
vases.
</P>
<P>
   To showcase their outdoor furniture, fountains and pots, they
installed a flagstone courtyard with mature olive trees and locally
made iron gates.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the vast, skylighted building, shoppers can wander from
``room'' to ``room,'' perusing fabric choices for upholstered
furnishings in a design corner, choosing an orchid and having it
potted up into a handsome container (Cross is the former president
of the Rod McClellan Co., a Bay Area-based orchid company) or
sniffing their way through a huge selection of scented soaps.
</P>
<P>
   Buyer Martin Spector, formerly with Gump's, has sought out
dinnerware from France and Italy made exclusively for the store,
painted pine furniture from Belgium and high-quality Indonesian
teak outdoor furniture. Reflecting Cross's roots in northern
England, the store also sells custom British conservatories and has
a fully furnished one on display.

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; First came the commercial-style home kitchen. This
summer the patio goes high end with high-quality,
professional-style barbecues.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't your father's cookers. These heavy-duty gas grills
come with brushed stainless steel finishes and promises of adding
panache to picnics.
</P>
<P>
   The  &UR; Jenn-Air Pro-Style &LR;  outdoor grill offers two 25,000 BTU
burners _ enough to heat a house, though not recommended for such
use, parent company Maytag says. The burners, guaranteed to last a
lifetime or until barbecues go out of style, are nestled in a
30-inch-wide cart with 554 square inches of grilling space,
fold-down side trays and a closed storage cabinet underneath.
</P>
<P>
   The grill's suggested price is $1,499, plus a rotisserie
accessory for $199 and an optional grill cover for $99.
</P>
<P>
   Throw a few pizzas and streudels on the grill with &UR; Kenmore's &LR; 
 &UR; Elite  &LR; series _ the three models come with instructions for baking,
deep frying, simmering and stir-frying. Each includes a high lid to
accommodate roasting and baking, and each has a warming rack.
</P>
<P>
   Some specs: Elite 9904 Graphite grill, 555-square-inch cooking
area and four burners, $550; Elite 9904 Stainless Steel grill
(pictured at direction), adds a side burner, $750; Elite 9906
Graphite &AMP; Stainless Steel grill, six burners and 815-square-inch
cooking area, $980.

 &HT;    INTERNET PIRACY SAID A THREAT TO AMERICAN INTELLECTUAL STRENGTH
 &HT;    With TECH-SUMMIT-TAX. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The growing ease with which consumers can pirate
movies and music through the Internet is ``the most devastating
thing that's happened to the entertainment business in, I think,
the last 75 years,'' Michael Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney
Co., told Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If such piracy continues to grow, musicians, writers, movie
directors and many others will lose their jobs as industry profits
wither, he predicted. When that day comes, ``you have ended, in
effect, the American intellectual strength that we have had,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner made a pitch for stronger legal protection of
intellectual property on the second day of the ``High-Tech Summit''
organized by the congressional Joint Economic Committee.
Intellectual property includes the movies, music, books, software
and other copyrighted materials that can be passed around the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the click of a mouse, pirated copies of intellectual
property can be transmitted around the world,'' Eisner said. ``The
artists who compose and perform music have already been
victimized.''
</P>
<P>
   As Internet technology improves, ``it will be possible to
transmit perfect copies (of movies) without our knowledge,
participation or consent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This growing piracy could lead to the financial collapse of the
entertainment industry, which would have a broad economic impact,
Eisner said. ``American copyright industries lead all major
industry sectors in foreign sales and exports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner urged Congress to ``explore with us'' the possibility of
requiring computer manufacturers and Internet service providers to
install technologies that could look for digital ``watermarks'' on
copyrighted materials. If a consumer tried to download a bootlegged
movie without such a mark, the operation would fail.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also asked Congress to ``work with governments around the
world to respect our rights.'' He said he wants the federal
government to help educate consumers about piracy, saying many
people don't realize the harm they are doing when they download
stolen materials.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner wasn't alone in his pleadings Wednesday, At a news
conference, the Business Software Alliance called upon the
presumptive presidential candidates, Vice President Al Gore and
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, to take strong anti-piracy positions.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition of top software executives predicted that in the
next five years, two-thirds of all software will be distributed
over the Internet, and this ``makes it more important than ever to
ensure strong copyright protection for computer software.'' The
executives pointed to a new study by the International Planning and
Research Corp., which estimated that global software piracy rate
was 36 percent in 1999. But in some countries, the piracy rate was
more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives at the new conference conceded that software
makers could revise their products to better protect them from
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technical standpoint, it's quite true that we could do
that,'' said Carol Bartz, chairman and chief executive of Autodesk
Inc. ``But I'm not at all sure you would like the results. Those
changes could create a tremendous inconvenience for consumers.''

NYSE IN TALKS TO FORM GLOBAL STOCK MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talks are under way between the New York Stock Exchange and
seven other exchanges in Europe, Asia and the Americas to form a
global stock market that would allow investors to trade around the
clock, officials of the exchanges announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance would involve the Big Board; Euronext, a merger of
exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels; the Tokyo Stock
Exchange; the Hong Kong exchange; and exchanges in Australia,
Toronto, Mexico and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The global market would focus on the world's largest companies
and have a stock market capitalization of close to $20 trillion, or
60 percent of the world's total market capitalization, according to
the Toronto Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic trading systems of the partners in the so-called
Global Equity Market would be linked, with the aim of reducing the
costs of cross-border stock trades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agreement will strengthen and globalize our markets within
North America as well as between time zones,'' Richard Grasso,
chairman and chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange, said
in a statement. ``It is an ambitious and exciting challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The details will be worked out in the coming months, after the
officials at the exchanges consult with regulators in their
respective countries. No significant regulatory hurdles are
expected, a representative of the Amsterdam Stock Exchange said,
since the deal is an alliance rather than an outright merger.
</P>
<P>
   Stock exchanges across the globe are seeking out mergers and
alliances to cut costs and survive in the face of an increasingly
borderless world for capital flows. Europe has taken the lead,
driven by its common currency, the euro.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have the same currency, it doesn't make sense to have
fragmented markets,'' said Bruno Rossignol, a spokesman for the
Paris Stock Exchange. ``This is answering the needs of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the exchanges in Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels
announced they would merge to form Euronext to rival a planned
union between the London Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq market has formed joint ventures
with London and Frankfurt to trade European and American technology
stocks. And Nasdaq Japan is set to begin later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nasdaq has had an international strategy for a while,''
Rossignol said. The New York Stock Exchange, meanwhile, as the
world's largest exchange, has been reluctant to develop a global
strategy. ``They are the No. 1 exchange in the world, and you're
not necessarily aware that others want to compete and take your
business.''
</P>
<P>
   But as stock trading goes global, ``it is normal for the NYSE to
begin to realize that it isn't just a U.S.-based exchange,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board began bilateral talks earlier this year with
exchanges around the world, but a deal involving seven exchanges
from all corners of the globe marks the most ambitious plan yet,
Rossignol said.
</P>
<P>
   The venture is on the agenda of the European Federation of Stock
Exchanges, which is to begin meeting Wednesday night in Lucerne,
Switzerland. A solid roadmap of how the seven exchanges will
proceed is expected by the fall, but trading is not expected to
begin until next year.

BRITISH AIRWAYS, KLM CONFIRM MERGER TALKS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Consolidation for the airline industry is rife with
possibilities on both sides of the Atlantic, if Wednesday's news is
any indication.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways (BAB:NYSE ADR) and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
(KLM:NYSE) confirmed Wednesday that they are in merger discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions were first reported in Monday's edition of The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are in a ``preliminary'' stage, with ``no assurance
that they will result in any transaction between the parties,'' the
companies said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the U.S., spurred on by a $4.3 billion agreement
for UAL's (UAL:NYSE) United Airlines, the largest airline in the
world, to buy US Airways Group (U:NYSE) last month, the second- and
third-largest airlines in the U.S. reportedly held talks which may
well lead to a merger
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 American Airlines, owned by AMR (AMR:NYSE), and No. 3
Delta Air Lines (DAL:NYSE) held preliminary talks on industry
consolidation on Monday in New York, according to Wednesday's
edition of The Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Together, United and US Airways would control over 27 percent of
the U.S. market. Currently, the three largest airlines -- United,
American and Delta -- hold relatively equal market shares of 17
percent to 20 percent, while No. 4 Northwest Airlines
(NWAC:Nasdaq), No. 5 Continental Airlines (CAL:NYSE) and No. 6 US
Airways collectively control just under 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller airlines such as Southwest Airlines (LUV:NYSE), America
West Holdings' (AWA:NYSE) America West Airlines, Trans World
Airlines (TWA:Amex) and Alaska Air Group's (ALK:NYSE) Alaska
Airlines together have a share just under 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of a combined United/US Airways naturally concerns
United's rivals, like American, based in Fort Worth, Texas, and
Atlanta-based Delta, who are exploring ways to compete more
effectively against a much larger No. 1 airline. One of those ways
could be to merge, though U.S. regulators could well stymie a
second massive consolidation in the airline industry, should they
approve the first between United and US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Justice has been historically tough on the
airline industry. ``In the past the DOJ seems to have seen more
that they dislike about competitive activity (or lack thereof) in
the airline industry than they like,'' wrote Samuel Buttrick, an
analyst at PaineWebber. The DOJ has now been ceded antitrust
authority over airline mergers from the Department of
Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the DOJ's objections in the mid-1980s to the mergers of
TWA with Ozark Airlines and Northwest with Republic Airlines. In
the early 1990s, the DOJ also came out against Eastern Airlines'
proposed sale of takeoff/landing slots and gates in Washington,
D.C. to United. More recently, the department has challenged
American on predatory pricing and Northwest on its ownership of a
controlling stake in Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Buttrick also addressed the chances of approval of a United/US
Airways merger, Northwest's stake in Continental and an additional
merger like one between American and Delta. ``Approval of three
mega-mergers without astounding remedies would amount to a total
abrogation of professional responsibilities by the DOJ -- pretty
inconceivable,'' Buttrick wrote. He rates UAL an attractive and US
Airways a neutral and has a buy rating on both AMR and Delta. His
firm has done no recent underwriting for any of these companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are other merger possibilities out there.
Indeed, American is also said to be mulling an acquisition of
Northwest, while Continental could also be a strong partner.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for AMR, Dale Morris, said, ``As a matter of policy,
we do not comment on rumors or speculation.'' A call to Delta for
comment was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AMR rose 1/8 to 28 7/16 in Wednesday morning trading,
while shares of Delta were up 1 7/32, or 2 percent, to 52.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of British Airways dropped 15/16 or 2 percent to 58 5/8,
while shares of KLM rose 2 1/2, or 9 percent, to 29.

MP3.COM, WARNER MUSIC REPORTEDLY NEAR SETTLEMENT

<P>
   Internet music company MP3.com (MPPP:Nasdaq) is said to be close
to settling a copyright infringement suit with Time Warner's
(TWX:NYSE) Warner Music Group.
</P>
<P>
   MP3, which distributes music over the Web through a digital
format, is expected to pay between $15 million and $20 million to
New York-based Warner Music to settle the claims of copyright
infringement, according to Wednesday's edition of The Wall Street
Journal. The terms may be announced as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a plan for San Diego-based MP3 to license music
from Warner Music.
</P>
<P>
   The music industry sued MP3 after the company made computerized
copies of more than 40,000 CDs without permission. MP3 was found
liable for copyright infringement on April 30. On that day, MP3's
stock tumbled 40 percent to 7.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to MP3 and Time Warner for comment were not immediately
returned.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's shares have since rebounded in hopes of a
settlement, closing Tuesday trading at 11 5/8, up 1/16, or 1
percent. Shares of Time Warner closed Tuesday trading at 81 1/8,
down 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of MP3 also rose 12 percent, or 1 3/8, to 13 in Wednesday
pre-market trading, according to Island ECN.

UNILEVER EARNINGS JUMP 12 PERCENT

<P>
   Unilever (UL:NYSE ADR), the British-Dutch consumer goods giant,
reported a 12 percent jump in its first-quarter earnings Wednesday
as the company's restructuring efforts helped to lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever, whose products include Lipton teas and Dove skin-care
products, said its net profit, excluding exceptional items, rose to
716 million euros ($659 million), or 0.71 euro a share, from 640
million euros, or 0.57 euro a share, in the year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose a modest 1 percent, to 9.69 billion euros from 9.64
billion euros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy of focusing resources on leading brands is on
track,'' Unilever Chairman Niall FitzGerald said in a statement.
``We are managing the migration to a faster-growth portfolio
without endangering our profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Unilever is currently in the process of divesting its
nonstrategic holdings while acquiring companies seen as capable of
contributing to long-term growth. Unilever recently agreed to
acquire SlimFast Foods and Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade (BJICA:NASDAQ)
for a total of about $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Unilever's 400 leading brands grew over 3 percent in
the quarter even as sales in Europe, the company's largest region,
slipped 3 percent. Operating profit, however, rose 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose by 3 percent in North America, the company's second
biggest region, and by 9 percent in the Asia and Pacific region.
Operating profits were up 17 percent in North America and 41
percent in the Asia and Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Unilever's ADRs were up 7/8, or 4 percent, to 25 3/8 in early
trading Wednesday.

ARCHIVES TELL STORY OF GERMAN WHO HID JEW FROM NAZIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Lilli Wolff and Mati Driessen rarely spoke of
their remarkable past. A few close friends and relatives knew; most
others never questioned how the two German women, living in Dallas,
had come to be like sisters. They worked together, lived together
and reared Mati's son, Klaus, together.
</P>
<P>
   It was only in their later years, and then after their deaths,
that Lilli and Mati's story came to the attention of a wider
audience, was recognized for its magnitude and has, more recently,
found its official place in history.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, Arlington educator Klaus Driessen donated 121
original documents, including photographs and letters, to the U.S.
Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington. The papers once belonged
to Lilli, a German Jew who escaped the Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   She had Mati to thank for her life.
</P>
<P>
   Klaus Driessen, 51, has told his mother and Lilli's story many
times in the past decade _ to school groups, at Rotary club
meetings, in synagogues. In 1991, he traveled to Yad Vashem, the
Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, to see his mother's name unveiled
in the Garden of the Righteous Among Nations. Mati had died a year
earlier, but she is permanently remembered as one of the thousands
of gentiles who saved Jews from Hitler's Final Solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nicest part is that my mother is listed,'' Driessen says.
``It took a lot of courage for her to save just one.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1940 to 1945, Mati hid Lilli in a Vienna apartment, out of
Hitler's murderous reach. At the slightest threat of discovery,
Lilli would take refuge in an armoire with a false lining. To peek
out the window or to leave two dirty dishes in the sink might have
given her away. Mati would certainly have perished at the hands of
the Nazis, too.
</P>
<P>
   The women had met in Cologne before World War II. Both were in a
dressmaking school and opened a business together. They designed
theater costumes and eventually employed 40 women in one of
Cologne's main retail districts. They prospered.
</P>
<P>
   But growing German anti-Semitism would not allow it. During
Kristallnacht, the night in November 1938 when Nazis plundered and
burned Jewish storefronts and synagogues, Lilli and Mati's
employees sat in the staircase that led to the shop and blocked the
Nazis' entry. The women succeeded that evening, but intensifying
restrictions on Jews soon forced them to close the business.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Lilli's parents had been sent to a work camp in
Berlin. The correspondence between Lilli and her father during that
time makes up much of the papers saved by Klaus Driessen and now
archived in Washington. On Nov. 10, 1940, Richard Wolff wrote to
his family, describing life in the Jewish ghetto in Berlin:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our room is small but we at least have heat. There are so many
changes we have no control over, we should be happy to just have a
roof over our heads ...''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wolff was 70 years old. Soon after he wrote that letter,
he and his wife died of starvation. Only one of Lilli's six
siblings would survive the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Lilli moved to Vienna and into the city's Jewish
ghetto. Mati followed, setting up a dress shop in her apartment.
``There was no work in Germany for a dress designer who had tried
to protect a Jew,'' Driessen says of his mother.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the movement of Jews around the city and the jobs
they could hold were severely limited. Beyond the confines of the
ghetto, Jews had to walk in the gutter. They could not take public
transportation. They were required to wear a Star of David on their
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Mati and Lilli worked out a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving the ghetto each day, Lilli would wear her Jewish
star prominently on her scarf. Several blocks later, she would
subtly button the scarf a different way, so that the star was not
visible. She made her way to Mati's and the two sewed all day.
Lilli would be back in the ghetto by curfew.
</P>
<P>
   But each day when she returned, another block of the ghetto
would be empty, the Jews who had been there that morning gone. To
where exactly, Lilli was unsure, but she knew she did not want to
go there. One night, instead of returning to the ghetto, she stayed
at Mati's. It would be 4 1/2 years before she could walk the
streets freely.
</P>
<P>
   She left the apartment twice. Once, Mati acquired false papers
for Lilli and arranged for her to have stomach surgery at a local
hospital. The doctor and nurses knew Lilli was a Jew. Anyone could
have given her away. They kept silent.
</P>
<P>
   The second time, Lilli wanted only to steal a few moments in the
park on a beautiful spring day. She narrowly escaped an encounter
with a German officer who asked for her identity papers.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians liberated Vienna in 1945, and two years later Lilli
was in New York City. Her sister Alice, who had fled to the United
States in 1937, had sponsored Lilli's immigration. Ten years later,
Lilli helped bring Mati and her 8-year-old son, Klaus, to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the two women opened a dressmaking business. They
struggled financially although their dresses were popular with the
city's debutantes and society women, such as Mrs. Trammell Crow and
Mrs. H.L. Hunt. But for the longest time, the only furniture the
two women owned were two sofas.
</P>
<P>
   Lilli died in 1983 at age 86; Mati was 80 when she died in 1990.
Since then, Mati's name has been added to the list of Righteous
Among Nations at the Holocaust museums in Dallas and Washington,
D.C. Driessen donated his mother's Yad Vashem medallion to the
Dallas museum and has spoken there to teacher groups and museum
docents.
</P>
<P>
   He is determined to keep his mother's and Lilli's experiences
alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember what happened during World War II and
continue to tell the story of the Holocaust,'' he says. ``The past
... can be repeated.''

BIG FIVE ACCOUNTING FIRMS TO OPEN BOOKS TO SEC 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM ARANGO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In response to a continuing inquiry into possible breaches in
the independence of corporate auditors, the Big Five accounting
firms have agreed to open up the investment portfolios of their
partners and top managers to the Securities and Exchange Commission
in exchange for immunity from enforcement, the SEC said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ``look-back program'' will review investments held
by certain managers and partners for a period of at least nine
months prior to March 31 to determine whether those employees held
stock in firms they were auditing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a significant chapter in the commission's and the
profession's efforts to reinforce the importance of auditor
independence,'' Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman, said in a
statement. ``This serious and comprehensive review will enhance
investor confidence and lead to improved quality control systems
going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The firms agreed to hire independent counsel to conduct a
review, and to report violations to the SEC. In return, the firms
will not be subject to enforcement except for the most serious
violations, such as when a firm itself or senior employees working
on an audit own stock in a client.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes a few weeks after Levitt, in a speech at
New York University, criticized the accounting industry for cutting
off financing for a public oversight board that delves into such
conflicts of interests.
</P>
<P>
   The historical roots of the issue date back about 20 years, when
accounting firms branched into consulting, according to Geoffrey
Pickard, a spokesman of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, which represents the nation's largest accounting
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in the independence of auditors has suffered
as well, Pickard said. Most firms, such as PricewaterhouseCoopers,
are in the process of spinning off their consulting businesses, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Five accounting firms are PricewaterhouseCoopers,
Deloitte and Touche, Arthur Anderson, Ernst &AMP; Young and KPMG.

IBM, NORTEL, TOSHIBA, OTHERS TO START TECH B2B MARKETPLACE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUSTIN DINI

<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM(IBM:NYSE), Nortel Networks(NT:NYSE), Toshiba and several
other big global technology players said Wednesday that they would
create a business-to-business marketplace for the computer,
electronics and telecommunications businesses, joining a movement
that has already attracted a number of big industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture, dubbed e2open.com, has raised more than $200
million in financing from a group of partners that includes Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter(MWD:NYSE) and the consulting firm McKinsey &AMP;
Co.. Software companies Ariba (ARBA:Nasdaq) and i2 (ITWO:Nasdaq)
are providing technology assistance for the new venture.
</P>
<P>
   The venture will provide an online marketplace for member
companies and their customers to buy and sell components used in
consumer electronics, computers and telecom equipment. The
companies said they expect e2open.com to begin operations by
mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   The other partners in the venture are Japan's Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co. and Hitachi Ltd.(HIT:NYSE), South Korea's
LG Electronics Inc., U.S. electronics parts manufacturer Solectron
(SLR:NYSE) and U.S. hard-disc maker Seagate Technology (SEG:NYSE).
</P>
<P>
   The venture expects transactions worth at least $1 billion on
its virtual marketplace during the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement is only the latest in a series of B2B
marketplaces rolled out recently. In February, the Big Three
automakers announced a marketplace for car parts. That same month,
Sears, Roebuck(S:NYSE) and Carrefour of France said they were
working with Oracle(ORCL:Nasdaq) to form an online exchange.

 &HT;    SECOND TOP TECH EXEC URGES TAXATION OF ONLINE SALES
 &HT;    With TECH-SUMMIT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ High-tech executives and members of Congress who
want to block states from taxing online purchases should end their
``unrealistic'' battle, Carly Fiorina, chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard Co., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not realistic of our industry to stand and say, 'This
taxation should never be applied to e-commerce,' `` Fiorina said on
the second day of the ``High-Tech Summit'' sponsored by the
congressional Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Fiorina also conceded that the existing sales tax system is
far too complicated to work well on the Internet. Trying to collect
all the taxes now imposed by some 30,000 state and local
jurisdictions would be ``disastrous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The best course of action is for state and federal lawmakers to
work together to streamline sales taxes, making them uniform enough
to fit ``the borderless nature of the online economy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Congress is considering several bills that would
extend a moratorium on new Internet taxes. Under existing law,
states can require merchants operating within their borders to
collect sales taxes on purchases. But states cannot force retailers
in other states to collect taxes. So an online merchant in one
state can sell goods to residents of the other 49 states without
collecting sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many state officials fear that as electronic commerce grows,
sales tax losses will grow into the tens of billions of dollars. To
prevent that, the National Governors' Association is coordinating a
drive among states to streamline sales taxes and is asking Congress
to support that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina applauded such efforts. ``What we are calling for is a
concerted effort to do the heavy lifting and bring our taxation
system into the modern age so that we can tax _ in a fair way _
both online and offline transactions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina's comments echoed those of Intel Corp. Chairman Andy
Grove, who spoke to the summit Tuesday. Grove said that blocking
states from collecting sales taxes on online purchases would amount
to giving electronic merchants an unfair subsidy. ``As a matter of
public policy, I don't see the justification for it,'' he said.

FLENS ISN'T WORTH THE BOTTLE IT COMES IN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL BOURGEOIS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flens is more notable for the bottle than what's in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's made by Flensburger Braueri in Flensburg, Germany, where it
proudly claims to be ``Germany's No. 1 Swing-Top Beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now this is much like saying the Mavericks are the No. 1 NBA
team in all of North Texas. Which also reminds me of my
second-to-last ex-mother-in-law. ``The best thing I can say about
you is you are my very favorite son-in-law,'' she would tell me. Of
course, I was her only son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   It's faint praise, but what else can you do to tout Flens when
the brew, particularly by German standards, is highly ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Flens appears cloudy. The color is a dull burnt orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably cloudy because of fiber and minerals,'' said The
Rev, a part-time friend, full-time neighbor and self-frocked
minister.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent tasting, The Rev was more interested in rounding up
the empties than savoring the brew.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, I've never understood the need for a beer that is
easily reclosed, particularly when it comes in a puny 12-ounce
bottle, as does the Flens.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few rules in life worth remembering: Clean up your
messes; treat your neighbor nice 'cause you know how those ``quiet
types who keep to themselves'' can turn on you; and if you open a
bottle of beer, finish it.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev said he's never had the need to reclose a bottle of
beer, but he finds the bottles handy.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad that Flens isn't worth the bottles it comes in.
</P>
<P>
   It has a nice aroma of hops, but the taste is thin and
undistinguished. It has a very slight bitter aftertaste.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev and I give Flens a 1 on the 0-5 international scale. The
bottle rates a 4.

HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP ACCUSES NATO OF WAR CRIMES IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ In an extensive report that has
infuriated NATO leaders, Amnesty International said Wednesday that
NATO violated international law in its bombing war over Yugoslavia
by hitting targets where civilians were sure to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the London-based human-rights group said that
NATO's bombing of the Belgrade headquarters of Radio Television
Serbia, on April 23, 1999, ``was a deliberate attack on a civilian
object and as such constitutes a war crime.'' Sixteen people died
in the pre-dawn attack, nearly all of them technicians, security
staff and make-up artists. NATO has defended the bombing as an
attack on the ``propaganda machine'' of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   International law forbids direct attacks on civilians and
civilian targets and requires all feasible precautions to prevent
civilian deaths. In some cases, Amnesty said, NATO failed to take
sufficient precautions to minimize civilian casualties. The number
of civilian deaths from NATO air strikes ``could have been
significantly reduced if NATO forces had fully adhered to the laws
of war during Operation Allied Force,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty also condemned a NATO attack on a bridge at Varvarin on
May 30, 1999, in which at least 11 civilians died. ``NATO forces
failed to suspend their attack after it was evident that they had
struck civilians,'' the report said, and it criticized NATO for
ordering its pilots to fly so high that they could not take proper
precautions against bombing civilians. In particular, the report
criticized the bombing of civilian convoys of Albanian refugees
near Djakovica on April 14 and Korisa on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released less than a week after Carla del Ponte,
the chief prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for
the former Yugoslavia, told the U.N. Security Council that her
investigation found no basis for charging NATO or its leaders with
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said that although ``some mistakes were made by
NATO,'' she was ``very satisfied that there was no deliberate
targeting of civilians or unlawful military targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some tribunal officials said privately that they hoped
their report would cause NATO countries to review their rules of
engagement in order to lessen the chances of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials quickly rejected the Amnesty findings. NATO
Secretary-General George Robertson called the allegations
``baseless and ill-founded.'' He said, ``NATO scrupulously adhered
to international law, including the law of war, throughout the
conflict and made every effort to minimize civilian casualties.''
NATO's mistakes, he said, were few and should be weighed ``against
the atrocities that NATO's action stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty report is similar in its findings to an even more
detailed report issued in February by Human Rights Watch. Of the
approximately 500 Yugoslav civilians killed in Serbia and Kosovo by
NATO bombs, half died unnecessarily because of NATO violations of
humanitarian law and practice, said Kenneth Roth, executive
director of Human Rights Watch, in a telephone interview from New
York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Roth criticized NATO in four areas: the use of cluster bombs,
``inherently indiscriminate weapons,'' near civilian areas; the
deliberate bombing of targets with little or no military
significance, including the television station, Belgrade's heating
plant, bridges, some factories and other infrastructure; the
bombing of targets, like the Varvarin bridge, during the daytime,
when civilians would be nearby at a market; and the failure to take
sufficient precautions to identify mobile targets before bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's spokesman, Jamie Shea, said that Del Ponte's
``opinion carries more weight'' than Amnesty's. But Roth said that
it is very difficult to make a criminal case against a wartime
general or leader. ``The fact that the tribunal has decided not to
indict anyone is no reason to pop champagne at the Pentagon,'' he
said. ``There were some serious violations of humanitarian law that
must be acknowledged and corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs
Committee said that while the NATO war against Yugoslavia was
morally just, it was illegal, because NATO had not secured
authorization from the U.N. Security Council. ``We conclude that
NATO's military action, if of dubious legality in the current state
of international law, was justified on moral grounds,'' the
cross-party committee said in a report. Noting that nothing in
NATO's charter allows it to conduct a war on even humanitarian
grounds without U.N. authorization, the committee called for a
revision of the NATO treaty.

RADIO-FREQUENCY TAGS COULD PIERCE SOME OF THE FOGS OF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL SORID    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The same kinds of tags that let cars move quickly past
tollbooths may soon help the armed forces keep track of their
vehicles, weapons and people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The end game of this,'' said Ron Gilbert, a senior scientist
at the Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory, in Richland, Wash., ``is to tag everybody and
everything and know what it is, what its status is, and know where
it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The small rectangular tags respond to radio waves sent by a
special transmitter called an interrogator. This is how it works: A
soldier operating an interrogator sends a radio signal to a tag
placed on an object. A tiny antenna on the tag is stimulated by the
signal and sends information about its identity and location to the
interrogator.
</P>
<P>
   The communicators are called radio-frequency tags, or RF tags.
Bulkier versions have been used for several years to keep track of
tolls or inventory, both by private companies and by the
government. But the new tags are being designed to be as small as a
few inches long and to be capable of handling more information.
</P>
<P>
   The interrogators should be able to find the new tags from as
far away as several hundred feet. From that distance, a helicopter
flying over a storage container could determine exactly what was
inside the unit. The interrogators could also scan several items at
once, allowing them to check an entire case of battlefield
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tags will be able to operate without batteries,
absorbing and recycling energy from an interrogator's signal. These
new tags are expected to have a range of 30 feet, compared with
less than 5 feet for the current tags, Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Slightly larger tags that are equipped with small batteries will
not only have a greater range _ several hundred feet, Gilbert said
_ but will be able to connect to sensors that can monitor
conditions like temperature and humidity.
</P>
<P>
   In one application, the new tags might be programmed to keep an
object like a pair of night vision goggles disabled until they were
scanned. That would deter theft, Gilbert said. ``Unless you're the
right soldier with the right ID code,'' he said, ``we can render
the item useless.''
</P>
<P>
   The new tags are being prepared for field testing by the Navy.
Depending on the outcome of those tests, the tags could be sent
back for changes, approved for use or canceled outright.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any object could be tagged. In a study by the Defense
Department last year, researchers attached tiny tags to honeybees
to determine whether the bees could be tracked. The idea is that
researchers might someday be able to locate things like land mines
by analyzing particles carried back to the hive by each bee and
correlating those particles with where the bee had been that day.
But the tags were too heavy for the bees and are being redesigned.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, radio-frequency tags have been used in
many commercial applications. Railroads, for example, use the tags
to keep track of trains. And on many toll roads and bridges,
vehicles equipped with special radio-frequency tags, like E-ZPass
tags, can move through through tollbooths without stopping. The tag
tells an interrogator at the booth to let the car through without
sounding an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   But as the tags become smaller and able to handle more
information, new uses will be possible. One application being
developed is an radio-frequency dog tag that could replace the
metal identification tags that soldiers wear on chains around their
necks. Medics would be able to read information like the soldier's
name, age, allergies and blood type from the tag. The Department of
Energy laboratory has developed a working prototype and may be
ready to produce the tags for the military within two years,
Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   After treating a wounded soldier on the battlefield, a medic
could send a signal that would inscribe on the dog tag the type of
medical care the soldier has received. When the soldier arrived at
the hospital, Gilbert said, ``they know who he is, what he does,
and what the corpsman did to him in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Navy medics, for example, record information about a
sailor's injury and treatment on a slip of paper, which can be
soiled or misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that many of the interrogator units to be used
with the new tags are the size of toolboxes, Gilbert said. But
Gilbert said his laboratory might try to convert personal digital
assistants for use as radio-frequency interrogators.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said the laboratory would probably use something like
the Handspring Visor, which has expansion slots that add to the
device's capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Petty Officer First Class Michael Stiney, who is helping to
evaluate the electronic dog tag at the Naval Aerospace Medical
Research Laboratory in Pensacola, Fla., said that a major advantage
of the tag was that information about injuries could be sent from
the medic's interrogator to a central computer, where patterns
could be analyzed. ``If you pick up a certain batch of symptoms in
a certain area of conflict, you could diagnose or predict an
outbreak of a food-borne illness or a chemical attack,'' he said.

BEYOND LEMONADE STANDS: A GIRL SEEKS HER FORTUNE ONLINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHEL MARRIOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the small screen _ no, not television's, but the personal
computer's _ Ashley Power is becoming a big star. And yes, that's
her real name.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley, a 15-year-old from Southern California who posts her
experiences, her schoolgirl insights and her Hollywood good looks
on her Web site (www.goosehead.com), is starting to be recognized
these days with a chorus of ``Hey, isn't she that girl on the
Internet?''
</P>
<P>
   She created her site after an especially trying eighth grade,
she said in a recent interview in her Goosehead.com office in
Studio City, Calif., just north of Los Angeles. The site features
message boards oriented toward teen-agers, weekly chats with
Ashley, digital games and music for downloading, free e-mail and a
homework-helper page with links to an online dictionary, a
thesaurus and language translation services.
</P>
<P>
   But the site's breakout hit is ``Whatever,'' an episodic
offering of original comedy, delivered by streaming video with
considerable attitude. Goosehead.com attracts more than 100,000
visitors a day.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her success, Ashley said: ``This stuff is so amazing
to me. It has so blown my mind that I can't even comprehend it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever'' stars Ashley and is written by her and her
stepfather, Mark Schilder (who is also the director). The
popularity of the 15-minute episodes has attracted the attention of
the actor Richard Dreyfuss, who joined Goosehead.com as a partner
this spring to help create more Web-based shows. (Dreyfuss' brother
is the business partner of Ashley's mother, Michelle Schilder, an
advertising executive.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of what persuaded him to become involved with the site, he
said, was what he described as Ashley's ``purity of vision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are trying to remember their past, or they are
people trying to make money,'' Dreyfuss said in a telephone
interview, talking about some of Goosehead.com's competitors.
``They're certainly not talking to their audience the way Ashley
can connect with hers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's company is now negotiating with two networks about
spinning off ``Whatever'' into a television show. Without a hint of
self-consciousness, Ashley said she was determined to make
Goosehead.com into a major Web site for teen-agers by emphasizing
``quality over quantity, definitely.'' She also said she had always
wanted to direct.
</P>
<P>
   And while the teen-age Web maven can merrily chat with
laser-sharp clarity about what her site needs to be, Goosehead.com
appears to be the product of two different versions of Ashley
Power. The first is a girl who, like many others, found her voice
online and began sharing it with anyone who would visit her site.
The other is an attractive teen-ager who is the center of a
franchise-in-the-making that is capitalizing on the untested
star-making muscle of the Internet, an electronic emporium where
facts and fantasies are often indistinguishable and sometimes very
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every section of Goosehead.com opens with a page bearing
Ashley's image. One shows a dimple-cheeked girl-next-door, while
another reveals her wearing a tight T-shirt and a pouty expression.
In a soft-focus shot on her Homework page, Ashley is dressed in
what looks like a skirt from a Catholic school with thigh-high
white stockings more reminiscent of Britney Spears than Esther
Dyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Ashley dealing with her own sexuality, trying to show
another side of herself,'' said her stepfather, who is an artist
and writer who has also shot television commercials. ``We don't
want her to do anything totally funky, but we want her to control
her own image.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley said she didn't understand why anyone would care about
how she looked on her site. Like a typical teen-ager, she said, she
frets about her body _ she wishes that she was thinner, or not so
tall. But even Goosehead.com's new 14-year-old columnist, Stephanie
Joy Pruner, recently wrote about Ashley and the ``sex appeal'' she
displays on the site. ``I'm tired of seeing a million pictures of
Ashley looking like a !(NU)%&AMP;$! supermodel!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley said her site had not started out as a tool to reach the
masses. It was just for herself and her friends, she said, when she
began Goosehead.com in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley's mother, Michelle Schilder, said Ashley had always been
independent. Schilder said she was single when she gave birth to
Ashley at the age of 18. She carried her baby daughter from
classroom to classroom as she completed her college education.
Schilder recalled that Ashley would occupy herself in classrooms by
doing creative things with paper and crayons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't really surprise me from a creative point of view
that she would do creative things with her computer,'' said
Schilder, whose company shares office space with Ashley's company.
</P>
<P>
   Like many people her age, Ashley practically grew up with a
mouse in her hand. She has had a succession of Macintosh computers
since she was 8 years old, she said, so she instinctively turned to
the Web as a ready means of expression and communication. At 13 she
began teaching herself from a book how to write HTML files so she
could work on her Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Online, by way of e-mail exchanges, she found fellow computer
geeks, men sometimes three times her age, who eagerly helped her
over snags with getting Goosehead.com off the ground and on the
Web, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today Ashley employs at least a half-dozen of them as partners.
One of them is Pat Galvin, 44, who lives in nearby Valencia, Calif.
``I was just trying to be a nice guy,'' he said, recalling when he
had first begun answering a flood of e-mail questions from Ashley
about building and maintaining Web sites. In the beginning, he
said, he did not realize that Ashley was 14. Nonetheless, he
recognized that she had ``great vision,'' he said. ``She is
extremely sweet,'' he added. ``The smile gets you.''
</P>
<P>
   When her stepfather learned that Ashley had enlisted the help of
men she had met on the Internet, he insisted on finding out who
they were. Ashley said she had given Schilder the men's e-mail
addresses and telephone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   After talking to each of the men, Schilder said, he was
satisfied that they sincerely wanted to help Ashley, who then had
her site up and was attracting considerable attention among
teen-agers. He organized a meeting last August in Las Vegas, where
all the Webmasters _ some lived as far away as Florida and Ohio,
and each paid his own way _ met to map out a strategy to turn
Goosehead.com into a bona fide online business.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you sit down with someone, when you really meet them, you
get a sense of what they are about,'' Schilder said. ``I wanted to
have Ashley talking to everyone in the room. I wanted to see how
they responded to Ashley.''
</P>
<P>
   Goosehead.com was incorporated last November. The site's name
comes from a childhood incident when Ashley accidentally
decapitated a cement goose that decorated the family's front lawn.
Even before Goosehead.com was incorporated, Ashley listed it with
some of the Web's most popular search engines. As a result, it
started getting 40,000 hits a day and tidal waves of e-mail
messages, sometimes thousands in a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of months, Ashley's site had propelled her (with the
guidance of her stepfather's business sense) into the hyperspeed
world of the Internet entrepreneur. As the founder and chief
executive of Goosehead.com., she had moved in blazing Internet time
from being a computer geek (with a mother and a stepfather who
quickly recognized the site's enormous potential) to being the soul
of an Internet portal for teen-agers, a business with 31 employees,
22 of them working full time for Goosehead.com.

</P>
<P>
   Along with ``Whatever,'' Goosehead.com's programming includes
installments from Ivan Tell, a roving teen-age reporter who turns
in pithy dispatches as he roams Los Angeles in a 1963 Cadillac
convertible. More shows are in production, Ashley said, like ones
called ``Cornman,'' a mock documentary about a zoologist tracking
down a Bigfoot-like creature, and ``The Janitor,'' which follows a
school custodian who fantasizes about being a superhero.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has really created a clear personality for the site,''
said Jeff Thomas, a marketing team leader at iSyndicate, an online
syndication service based in San Francisco that provides
Goosehead.com with content like its movie page. ``It's really a
kind of unique thing. It feels like there's a real teen-ager in
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Production on new episodes of ``Whatever'' began last week. The
mounting workload means that Ashley works on Goosehead.com business
not just because she wants to but also because she has to, she
said. The site generates most of its revenue from corporate
partnerships and advertising, said Schilder, who is co-chairman of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Goosehead.com is also dipping its corporate toe into e-commerce
by selling T-shirts and caps bearing the site's logo, a smiling
cartoon goose face. While the site has yet to make a profit, Ashley
and her family are not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are spending money faster than we are getting it,''
Schilder said, ``but we are in a position to make money very
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley said her company was securing investment capital, and she
predicted a future for her Web site that would be as bright as a
smog-free California noon.
</P>
<P>
   She knows that much of the responsibility for Goosehead.com's
success rests on her shoulders, she said. As a result, Ashley said,
she occasionally has to miss school to attend an important business
meeting or deliver a speech to an Internet group. Her grades have
suffered, she said, which is something her teachers have prodded
her about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just hang in there,'' she said. ``I keep going with what I
feel is right in my heart.''  &QL;

INSPECTING CHIMNEYS, VERY CAREFULLY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Spring is a good time to inspect your chimney. An early
inspection alerts you to any defects and allows plenty of time to
schedule and perform maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, you will have to climb on the roof to make the
inspection. Climbing onto a high roof can be dangerous, especially
if it has a steep pitch. Wait for a calm, dry day for the
inspection. Wear rubber-soled shoes; do not attempt to climb on a
wet roof. Make sure that you understand, and follow, all ladder
safety rules.
</P>
<P>
   When moving about on the roof, watch for loose or torn shingles,
moss, wet leaves or debris. If you are unsure of yourself on a high
roof, call a professional to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Start at the top of the chimney with the crown. The crown is the
masonry cap that covers and protects the rest of the chimney. If it
is cracked or broken, rainwater will seep into the core holes of
the brick. The thaw-freeze cycle that occurs during the winter
months will cause the water to expand and eventually split the
chimney apart. A professional contractor should replace a cracked
or damaged crown.
</P>
<P>
   Also inspect the gap between the cap and flue. If there is a
wide gap, it should be caulked to prevent water seepage. Use
concrete caulk for this. It is available in cartridges at home
centers.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to apply the caulk; simply insert the cartridge in a
caulking gun and draw a bead around the flue. Smoothing the bead
may be a little difficult because the caulk is very sticky. You can
smooth it by dragging an ice cube across the surface of the bead.
</P>
<P>
   Look carefully at the bricks and mortar in the chimney for
cracks and crumbling brick or mortar. Mortar that is cracked or
deteriorating should be chiseled out and replaced. This repair
technique is called repointing, or tuckpointing.
</P>
<P>
   If you decide to repoint, you will need a few tools: a cold
chisel (it should be narrower than the mortar joint), a two-pound
sledgehammer, a mason's trowel (for mixing and holding mortar), a
pointing tool (for pushing the mortar into the joint), a jointing
tool (for shaping the contour of the joint) and a stiff-bristle
brush to remove residual mortar. You'll also need the proper safety
gear: safety goggles for your eyes, heavy-duty gloves for your
hands and work shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll need new mortar. You can make this by mixing
type N masonry cement and masonry sand (do not use beach sand).
There are different types of masonry cement (designated by the
letters M, S, N and O, indicating the varying proportions of their
ingredients) but type N is a good, all-purpose mix. The sand is an
aggregate that softens the mortar and allows it to expand and
contract with the surrounding bricks.
</P>
<P>
   Start by chiseling out the deteriorated mortar from between the
bricks to a depth of about two and a half times the width of the
joint. Work carefully to remove the old mortar without damaging the
surrounding brick.
</P>
<P>
   After you've chiseled out all the old mortar, wash the joints by
brushing them with the stiff-bristled brush dipped in water. Next,
mix the mortar ingredients with the trowel; it's best to do this on
the ground and carry the mix to the roof in a small bucket. Mix
three parts sand to one part masonry cement and mix only as much as
you can work with in about 30 minutes. Dry-mix these ingredients
first before adding water. Add water slowly until the mix has the
consistency of a stiff paste.
</P>
<P>
   Position a ball of mortar on the bottom of the trowel. Use the
pointing tool to push it from the trowel into the joint. Allow the
mortar to harden slightly, then shape the contour by running the
joint tool along the joint. Shape the vertical joints first, then
the horizontal ones. Use the stiff-bristled brush to remove excess
mortar.
</P>
<P>
   After you have repointed the brick, allow time for the mortar to
dry, then seal the entire chimney by brushing the surfaces with a
sealant.
</P>
<P>
   A good chimney sealant is a water-repellent called siloxane (one
brand is called Sure Klean and is available from building
suppliers); it repels water but allows chimney gases to escape
through the masonry. Siloxane is combustible, so read the package
directions carefully first. Turn off all gas appliances and
extinguish open flames before treating the chimney.
</P>
<P>
   You should also install a chimney cover if your chimney doesn't
have one. Chimney covers keep out water that could rust the damper
and metal flue liner. They also keep birds and small animals from
nesting in your chimney.
</P>
<P>
   To find a dealer, look in the Yellow Pages under ''Chimney
Materials.'' Be sure to measure the furnace flue and flue liner
before ordering the cover.

   Keeping Climbers at Bay
</P>
<P>
   Q. There is a creeping plant next to my front porch that a
neighbor tells me is a climbing hydrangea. If this is so, I'm
afraid it will get too big for the location. (The porch rail is
only a few feet high.) But I think I read somewhere about a
Japanese ``creeping'' hydrangea. Do you know about such a thing?
How big is it likely to get?
</P>
<P>
   A. Whether you have a true climbing hydrangea (Hydrangea anomala
ssp. petiolaris) or its near look-alike, the Japanese hydrangea
vine (Schizophragma hydrangeoides), growth _ 30 feet or more _ is
in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered the best climbing vine for its combination of
large beautiful flowers, wonderful three-dimensional structure and
lustrous dark-green leaves, climbing hydrangea is nearly unlimited
in its ability to creep over, scamper onto or climb up anything
that its little aerial rootlets can glue themselves to.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophragma is very similar in appearance and behavior,
differing mainly in its hardiness (zone 6), in the details of
flower construction and in having a more relaxed, yet still
elegant, way of holding its flowers. In addition to the straight
species, it is available in several cultivars, including the
silvery-leaved Moonlight, the rosy pink-flowered Roseum and
Strawberry Leaf. Schizophragma shares climbing hydrangea's shaggy
bark for winter appeal, although to a lesser extent. While climbing
hydrangea often takes a few years to bloom, Schizophragma blooms
after a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   While both of these vines will probably grow too large for your
space, they can be pruned to keep them shorter. They bloom on short
spurs emerging from last year's growth, so prune them in summer,
soon after they flower.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling its size will be an annual chore, and you will
probably tire of it long before the vine tires of growing. It would
be better to move it to a location where it can stretch out and wow
you.
</P>
<P>
   Schizophragma hydrangeoides may not be easy to find. Sources
include Windrose, 1093 Mill Rd., Pen Argyl, PA 18072, (610)
588-1037, catalog $3; and Gossler Farms Nursery, 1200 Weaver Rd.,
Springfield, OR. 97478, (541) 746-3922, catalog $2.
</P>
<P>
   Those Gelatinous Blobs
</P>
<P>
   Q. While walking by some outdoor flower boxes that are
maintained by our local garden club, I noticed transparent,
gelatinous blobs nearly covering the soil. I asked a friend, a
member of the garden club, who told me it was a water-saving gel
added to the soil, and that the recent heavy rains must have caused
the problem. Since it looks so peculiar, I am wondering if there is
a way to prevent this from happening, and whether the gels are
worth the effort?
</P>
<P>
   A. Follow the directions and don't expect miracles. Hydrogels,
sold at most garden centers under several brand names, are small
granules of polyacrylamide or other similar materials, which can
absorb up to 400 times their own weight in water. As the soil
around them dries out, these water-savers gradually release the
water, thus keeping the soil moist. Using them in a well-drained
potting mixture can extend the period you don't need to water by
two or three days at most.
</P>
<P>
   Intuitively, you would think using more than the recommended
amount (about a teaspoon for an 8-inch pot) would let you water
once and take off for a trip around the world, but it doesn't work
that way. Using too much can leave the soil soggy and the roots
gasping for air. Sorry, the art of watering is still important.
</P>
<P>
   The other instruction the package will give is not to use the
gels in the upper 2 inches of soil. The manufacturers say the
reason is that you want to have the gels down where the roots are,
but since the water they release will disperse throughout the pot,
the real reason may be to avoid having the water-saturated granules
rising to the top like bloated bodies emerging from a lake in a bad
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Address questions to Garden Q&AMP;A, The New York Times, 229 W. 43rd
St., New York, NY 10036, or by e-mail to gardening(at)nytimes.com.
Those of general interest will be published. Unpublished questions
cannot be answered individually.

&HT;     ZOO OFFERS REWARD FOR MISSING OTTER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Whoever stole Harriet the river otter from the
Oakland Zoo in the dead of night will not get the cuddly, playful
creature they might have expected, assistant zoo director Allison
Lindquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has really sharp claws and she bites. They don't make good
pets,'' Lindquist said of the 15-year-old American River Otter
nabbed from its exhibit early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials said thieves apparently jumped two fences, cut
through a third and broke a lock to grab Harriet and spirit her
away in a tan, kennel-type carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo keepers found the damage while doing 8 a.m. rounds at the
facility, which is home to more than 380 exotic and native animals.
</P>
<P>
   Lindquist pleaded for a safe and speedy return, saying the
animal could die without professional care and precise dieting,
including vitamin supplements required to treat a metabolic
ailment.
</P>
<P>
   The otter's offspring, which remains at the zoo and is not yet 1
year old, is also in danger without the care, instruction and
nursing of its mother, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A $5,000 reward for the return of the otter is being offered.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet came to Oakland from a Minnesota zoo in 1987 and hooked
up in an exhibit with a male otter named Ozzie. Handlers had been
trying to mate the two for almost a decade before finally finding
success last year.
</P>
<P>
   Harriet weighs about 20 pounds and is 2 1/2 feet in length.
American River Otters eat fish, frogs, turtles and rodents, among
other small creatures, and spend about one-third of their time in
water.

IF YOU GO &QL; 
GETTING THERE: The Normandy D-Day sites are about 170 miles
northwest of Paris. Take the Autoroute de l'Ouest (the A-13, a toll
highway) from Paris to Caen, then take highway N-13 to Bayeux. The
train is an excellent way to get around France (as is the case for
most of Europe). Generally, three or four trains leave each morning
from Paris' Gare St.-Lazare for Bayeux, with several return options
available in the late afternoon and evening. It's most cost
effective to buy some sort of France Railpass from a travel agent
before you leave the U.S. (depending on how much rail travel you
plan on doing), but if you buy this trip at the last minute in
France, expect to pay $58 round trip for second class, $84 for
first class. Web: www.sncf.fr and voyages.sncf.fr (click on the
British flag icon to get information in English).
</P>
<P>
   TOURS: The region's official Web site, www.normandy-tourism.org,
lists five companies that conduct D-Day tours. The two most
interesting options appear to be Bus Fly Tours (www.busfly.com) and
Tours International (www.tours-international.co.uk). An official
for the American Battle Monuments Commission said the organization
has gotten good reports on two other tours. One is directed by a
University of Texas professor: Division of Continuing Education,
University of Texas, Attn.: Thomas M. Hatfield, P.O. Box 7879,
Austin, Texas, 78713. The other, if you're planning ahead to next
year, is the Beaches to the Bulge Tour, which traces the route of
the U.S. forces across Europe. It is conducted each June by
Eurostar. Phone: (800) 622-4004. Web: www.eurostartours.com. If you
choose to wing a one-day tour of D-Day sites, flag or call for a
cab at the Bayeux train station. &QL;

BAYEUX, France _ How could the weather change so radically so
quickly?
</P>
<P>
   Just a few minutes ago, at the American Cemetery in Normandy,
the sun was glinting brightly off the white crosses and Stars of
David that stretch into an appalling infinity. Wildflowers were
waving near the edge of the bluff. The chirps of birds were
audible. The setting was one of great peace and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   And now, just a few miles away, just a few minutes later, it was
as if the sky had furrowed its brow in rage. On a stretch of French
coastline once known as the Dog Green and Charlie sectors of Omaha
Beach, a biting rain was coming in sideways, the wind was ripping
across the bluff, the sea was rough. It was as if, once again, any
living thing was being defied to approach this beach in any state
of ease.
</P>
<P>
   This was April last year in Normandy, site of one of the most
indefatigable displays of bravery, sacrifice and achievement in
U.S. military history. On June 6, 1944, American forces, along with
servicemen from Great Britain, Canada and other allies, gained a
toehold on a European continent almost entirely controlled by
Germany's Nazis _ at considerable cost. But the landing along the
coast of northwest France initiated a relentless push east that
would end with the fall of a tyrannical regime.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder so many people from across the generations are drawn
to the scene. Interest has climbed noticeably over the last two
years, after baby boomers and their children were given a glimpse
of the chaos and horror of that assault in the first 25 minutes of
Steven Spielberg's 1998 film ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha Sell, chief of operations for the American Battle
Monuments Commission, which administers America's overseas military
cemeteries, says the American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer saw a
16 percent jump in visitation from 1997 to last year, from 1.27
million to 1.48 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although many veterans of the conflict have decried some of the
movie's Hollywood-like departures from reality, they seem to
welcome the heightened sense of awareness it brought about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us felt that the movie was worth being told,'' said
Thomas Herring of Charlotte, N.C., national secretary for the
Ranger Battalions Association of World War II. ``If people got the
idea that things were that bad, then it served a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Herring was a 19-year-old corporal when he hit the beach just
after dawn on June 6. ``People ask me if that (the movie) was what
it was like. I say, `Multiply it by five and you'll have it about
right.'''
</P>
<P>
   The area can be toured in a wide variety of ways today. At
Normandy's official tourist Web site (www.normandy-tourism.org),
five tour companies are listed, offering guided excursions that
range in duration from one to five days.
</P>
<P>
   If you're inclined to explore on your own with a rental car, the
region lies about 170 miles northwest of Paris. But even if you can
only free up enough time for a day trip via train from Paris,
that's still sufficient for a visit (although an overnight stay
would probably be ideal).
</P>
<P>
   Rail service runs regularly from Paris' Gare St.-Lazare to
Bayeux, and the pleasant ride through the Normandy countryside
takes just over two hours. At the Bayeux train station, the taxi
drivers know this drill well. Ours understood only a few words of
English _ and seemed to struggle even more with our fractured
French _ but he handed us an English-language flier that gave us a
number of options for visiting the D-Day sites.
</P>
<P>
   We opted for a two-hour excursion that would include the
American Cemetery, a stretch of Omaha Beach and the ruined
fortifications of Pointe du Hoc for 390 francs. With the tip we
ultimately tacked on, it seemed a bargain at about $70. The driver
whisked us to each of the three sites, pointed to his watch to
indicate when he'd be back for us, then would disappear for a
discreet interval.
</P>
<P>
   Brace your heart for the first stop. Our driver pulled into a
parking area near the Visitors Building of the American Cemetery,
and dropped us off next to a thick, tall stand of shrubbery. We
walked around its edge _ and nearly fainted. Stretching out in
front of us was a sea of white crosses and Stars of David. All are
positioned in neat rows on a flat, grassy expanse, literally as far
as you can see.
</P>
<P>
   There are 9,387 grave markers here, with 1,557 more names on a
semicircular wall in the Garden of the Missing. All of these deaths
occurred over the 49-day period of the Normandy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   You walk among the markers in a daze, immersed in the sense of
sacrifice, realizing that families and sweethearts mourned for each
name. A father and son are buried here. And 38 pairs of brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Remains couldn't always be identified, and it's particularly
wrenching the first time you encounter a cross with this
inscription: ``Here rests in honored glory a comrade in arms known
but to God.'' There are 307 of those.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of families visit here, but you don't encounter any
horseplay on the grounds. Or even raised voices.
</P>
<P>
   We had been silent for many minutes when it was time to
rendezvous with our cab. Apparently accustomed to the effect the
American Cemetery has on its visitors, the driver spoke not a word
as he turned the wheel toward Vierville.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are dropped off at this stretch of Omaha Beach _ the
extreme western edge _ because of its convenience. Below the bluff
at the American Cemetery, we had spotted signs warning walkers
away; wild boars roam the area, it said.
</P>
<P>
   So at Vierville, we climbed out of the cab _ and into that
piercing rainstorm and relentless wind. As I ducked my head into
this onslaught while climbing a path up the bluff, I couldn't help
but think about those soldiers making the same ascent 56 years ago.
They were bending into a rain of mayhem and death.
</P>
<P>
   Military historian Stephen E. Ambrose, in his exhaustive work
``D-Day'' (Simon &AMP; Shuster; $17), characterized the German defenses
at Omaha as a ``triple crossfire.'' The German commander for the
region, Erwin Rommel, had configured the fortifications
meticulously and devilishly, with pillboxes facing not out to sea
but diagonally down on the beach. A GI trying to cross the 165
yards of tidal flat, Ambrose wrote, encountered machine gun and
artillery fire from the sides, small-arms fire from the front, and
mortars being lobbed down from the top of the bluff.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of the assault, the chances of being killed or
wounded at Omaha or Juno beaches has been gauged at one in two.
</P>
<P>
   Peering over the top of the bluff, you can gain a profound sense
of the advantage of high ground in combat. Far below, that narrow
strip of beach appears so tiny and defenseless. Essentially, it
was.
</P>
<P>
   We got another sense of the defenders' point of view at our
third and final stop, Pointe du Hoc. Eerily, it has been left in
much the same condition the Allies found it when they overran it
during the invasion _ no small thanks to the Rangers who scaled the
precipitous, 100-foot cliff with rocket-fired ropes and rope
ladders.
</P>
<P>
   All around, covering an area of 30 acres, are giant shell holes,
now overgrown with green grass and yellow wildflowers. The
landscape is strewn with great concrete chunks of blown-apart
bunkers, stretches of barbed wire, and twisted, rusted riots of
reinforcing steel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bunkers and an observation post are in surprisingly
good shape, considering the air and naval bombardment they endured.
Kids climb over them, frolic in them. Tourists pose for photos in
the gun emplacements, peering out through the slits.
</P>
<P>
   Rommel was manic about the mixing of concrete for his
fortifications. In some cases, he ordered walls built to a
thickness of nearly 7 feet. The bunkers here were dug 23 feet into
the earth, with reinforced tunnels _ and even rail lines so that
ammunition could be transported by handcarts. Atop the concrete he
had workers pile dirt and sod.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took this ground and then beat back German
counterattacks at an extreme cost, and the French erected a
monument here (and later turned the land over to the United States)
in their honor. According to Ambrose, more than 200 Rangers mounted
this particular assault. By the end of the battle, only 50 were
still capable of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Herring, of the Ranger Battalion Association, said he gets a
common inquiry these days. After the death of a D-Day veteran,
he'll receive a call or an e-mail from a son, daughter or nephew,
asking for details of the man's service in the Normandy invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, 'Our father passed on, and in all the years, he
never talked about it,''' Herring said. ``There are some (veterans)
to this day who can't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One who agreed to was William Campbell of Bakersfield. He plans
to be at the Queen Mary in Long Beach on Tuesday for a western
chapter reunion of World War II Rangers. ``We were fighting for a
cause, basically,'' he said, ``because we wanted to overthrow
tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   A sense of the mission and its accomplishment probably won't
fade away, even though the D-Day soldiers are beginning to. In
their late teens or early 20s then, many are in their mid-70s now.
Herring says his organization puts out a national newsletter twice
a year, and ``each time, we have 40 to 60 people who have died
since the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   But their legacy endures at the American Cemetery and at Pointe
du Hoc and at Arromanches and at any number of sites and memorials
in the area of the Normandy landing beaches. Also, apparently, it
endures in nearby Bayeux, the first town liberated in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After our cab returned us to the train station, we hunted down a
small cafe in search of some refreshment and sandwiches for the
ride back.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans who pass by this establishment on a visit might be
heartened by a large sign, written in English, that the proprietor
has hanging in the window. More than half a century after the
event, it reads: ``Welcome to our liberators.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Martha Sell, chief of operations for the American Battle
Monuments Commission, which administers America's overseas military
cemeteries, says the American Cemetery at Colleville-sur-Mer saw a
16 percent jump in visitation from 1997 to last year, from 1.27
million to 1.48 million.
</P>
<P>
   Although many veterans of the conflict have decried some of the
movie's Hollywood-like departures from reality, they seem to
welcome the heightened sense of awareness it brought about.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us felt that the movie was worth being told,'' said
Thomas Herring of Charlotte, N.C., national secretary for the
Ranger Battalions Association of World War II. ``If people got the
idea that things were that bad, then it served a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Herring was a 19-year-old corporal when he hit the beach just
after dawn on June 6. ``People ask me if that (the movie) was what
it was like. I say, `Multiply it by five and you'll have it about
right.'''
</P>
<P>
   The area can be toured in a wide variety of ways today. At
Normandy's official tourist Web site (www.normandy-tourism.org),
five tour companies are listed, offering guided excursions that
range in duration from one to five days.
</P>
<P>
   If you're inclined to explore on your own with a rental car, the
region lies about 170 miles northwest of Paris. But even if you can
only free up enough time for a day trip via train from Paris,
that's still sufficient for a visit (although an overnight stay
would probably be ideal).
</P>
<P>
   Rail service runs regularly from Paris' Gare St.-Lazare to
Bayeux, and the pleasant ride through the Normandy countryside
takes just over two hours. At the Bayeux train station, the taxi
drivers know this drill well. Ours understood only a few words of
English _ and seemed to struggle even more with our fractured
French _ but he handed us an English-language flier that gave us a
number of options for visiting the D-Day sites.
</P>
<P>
   We opted for a two-hour excursion that would include the
American Cemetery, a stretch of Omaha Beach and the ruined
fortifications of Pointe du Hoc for 390 francs. With the tip we
ultimately tacked on, it seemed a bargain at about $70. The driver
whisked us to each of the three sites, pointed to his watch to
indicate when he'd be back for us, then would disappear for a
discreet interval.
</P>
<P>
   Brace your heart for the first stop. Our driver pulled into a
parking area near the Visitors Building of the American Cemetery,
and dropped us off next to a thick, tall stand of shrubbery. We
walked around its edge _ and nearly fainted. Stretching out in
front of us was a sea of white crosses and Stars of David. All are
positioned in neat rows on a flat, grassy expanse, literally as far
as you can see.
</P>
<P>
   There are 9,387 grave markers here, with 1,557 more names on a
semicircular wall in the Garden of the Missing. All of these deaths
occurred over the 49-day period of the Normandy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   You walk among the markers in a daze, immersed in the sense of
sacrifice, realizing that families and sweethearts mourned for each
name. A father and son are buried here. And 38 pairs of brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Remains couldn't always be identified, and it's particularly
wrenching the first time you encounter a cross with this
inscription: ``Here rests in honored glory a comrade in arms known
but to God.'' There are 307 of those.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of families visit here, but you don't encounter any
horseplay on the grounds. Or even raised voices.
</P>
<P>
   We had been silent for many minutes when it was time to
rendezvous with our cab. Apparently accustomed to the effect the
American Cemetery has on its visitors, the driver spoke not a word
as he turned the wheel toward Vierville.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are dropped off at this stretch of Omaha Beach _ the
extreme western edge _ because of its convenience. Below the bluff
at the American Cemetery, we had spotted signs warning walkers
away; wild boars roam the area, it said.
</P>
<P>
   So at Vierville, we climbed out of the cab _ and into that
piercing rainstorm and relentless wind. As I ducked my head into
this onslaught while climbing a path up the bluff, I couldn't help
but think about those soldiers making the same ascent 56 years ago.
They were bending into a rain of mayhem and death.
</P>
<P>
   Military historian Stephen E. Ambrose, in his exhaustive work
``D-Day'' (Simon &AMP; Shuster; $17), characterized the German defenses
at Omaha as a ``triple crossfire.'' The German commander for the
region, Erwin Rommel, had configured the fortifications
meticulously and devilishly, with pillboxes facing not out to sea
but diagonally down on the beach. A GI trying to cross the 165
yards of tidal flat, Ambrose wrote, encountered machine gun and
artillery fire from the sides, small-arms fire from the front, and
mortars being lobbed down from the top of the bluff.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of the assault, the chances of being killed or
wounded at Omaha or Juno beaches has been gauged at one in two.
</P>
<P>
   Peering over the top of the bluff, you can gain a profound sense
of the advantage of high ground in combat. Far below, that narrow
strip of beach appears so tiny and defenseless. Essentially, it
was.
</P>
<P>
   We got another sense of the defenders' point of view at our
third and final stop, Pointe du Hoc. Eerily, it has been left in
much the same condition the Allies found it when they overran it
during the invasion _ no small thanks to the Rangers who scaled the
precipitous, 100-foot cliff with rocket-fired ropes and rope
ladders.
</P>
<P>
   All around, covering an area of 30 acres, are giant shell holes,
now overgrown with green grass and yellow wildflowers. The
landscape is strewn with great concrete chunks of blown-apart
bunkers, stretches of barbed wire, and twisted, rusted riots of
reinforcing steel.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the bunkers and an observation post are in surprisingly
good shape, considering the air and naval bombardment they endured.
Kids climb over them, frolic in them. Tourists pose for photos in
the gun emplacements, peering out through the slits.
</P>
<P>
   Rommel was manic about the mixing of concrete for his
fortifications. In some cases, he ordered walls built to a
thickness of nearly 7 feet. The bunkers here were dug 23 feet into
the earth, with reinforced tunnels _ and even rail lines so that
ammunition could be transported by handcarts. Atop the concrete he
had workers pile dirt and sod.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took this ground and then beat back German
counterattacks at an extreme cost, and the French erected a
monument here (and later turned the land over to the United States)
in their honor. According to Ambrose, more than 200 Rangers mounted
this particular assault. By the end of the battle, only 50 were
still capable of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Herring, of the Ranger Battalion Association, said he gets a
common inquiry these days. After the death of a D-Day veteran,
he'll receive a call or an e-mail from a son, daughter or nephew,
asking for details of the man's service in the Normandy invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, 'Our father passed on, and in all the years, he
never talked about it,''' Herring said. ``There are some (veterans)
to this day who can't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One who agreed to was William Campbell of Bakersfield. He plans
to be at the Queen Mary in Long Beach on Tuesday for a western
chapter reunion of World War II Rangers. ``We were fighting for a
cause, basically,'' he said, ``because we wanted to overthrow
tyranny.''
</P>
<P>
   A sense of the mission and its accomplishment probably won't
fade away, even though the D-Day soldiers are beginning to. In
their late teens or early 20s then, many are in their mid-70s now.
Herring says his organization puts out a national newsletter twice
a year, and ``each time, we have 40 to 60 people who have died
since the last one.''
</P>
<P>
   But their legacy endures at the American Cemetery and at Pointe
du Hoc and at Arromanches and at any number of sites and memorials
in the area of the Normandy landing beaches. Also, apparently, it
endures in nearby Bayeux, the first town liberated in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   After our cab returned us to the train station, we hunted down a
small cafe in search of some refreshment and sandwiches for the
ride back.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans who pass by this establishment on a visit might be
heartened by a large sign, written in English, that the proprietor
has hanging in the window. More than half a century after the
event, it reads: ``Welcome to our liberators.'' &QL;

&HT;     GINGRICH HAS A NEW ROLE: FUTURIST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC BRAZIL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ He was the second most powerful politician in
America, the combative, high-profile speaker of the House whose
name was synonymous with militant conservatism, and he left
Congress under a cloud. But Newt Gingrich, his confidence and
ambition unimpaired, is still on a mission, and he's thinking big.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich is now a scholar at Stanford University's Hoover
Institution, a political analyst for Fox News and founder of the
Committee for New American Leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Author of the watershed ``Contract With America,'' the statement
of principles that House Republicans ran on in 1994, leader of the
104th Congress during the fight for a balanced budget and welfare
overhaul, and Time magazine's man of the year in 1995, Gingrich has
morphed himself into a futurist.
</P>
<P>
   America is caught up in ``a very long wave of change'' fraught
with promise and challenge, which is gaining great speed, he said
in a speech here this week.
</P>
<P>
   Changes based on a combination of biology, information and
nanoscience (the science of objects from one to 400 atoms in size)
figure to be even more transforming than those brought on by the
computer revolution, Gingrich said. ``They will be to the 21st
century more than the computer was to the 20th century,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes will be driven to a great degree by a growing
network of venture capitalists who are creating an efficient system
for nurturing entrepreneurs and moving new ideas to the market
rapidly. ``We are creating a culture of entrepreneurship unlike
anything the world has ever seen,'' Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   To sustain the momentum and to obtain the highest rate of
return, ``a dramatic increase in basic science research'' and the
creation of a national science budget are absolute necessities,
Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the federal government has a responsibility to
encourage the former and fund the latter, noting that it was the
Department of Defense that financed ``the entire core of the
computer revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, the nation needs an overhaul of the schools'
mathematics and science curriculum, and it should put computers in
the hands of every 4-year-old American child.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds radical now, Gingrich said, ``but in 1800
universal education was a radical idea,'' and free textbooks were
such a novelty that then-Gov. Huey Long became a hero in Louisiana
in 1928 by making them available to public schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich calls his Committee for New American Leadership ``a new
kind of political activism for the 21st century,'' and it has a
pronounced libertarian bent. Its front-burner issues are a ``max
tax,'' or 25 percent cap on all taxation, federal state and local
combined, and ``Social Security Plus'' accounts for workers who
choose to mix entrepreneurship with their pensions. He claimed that
the second proposal _ similar to one offered by George W. Bush, the
presumptive Republican presidential nominee _ would ``save the
Social Security system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich stepped down as speaker of the House after the
Republicans lost several seats in 1998, a loss that his critics
blamed on his abrasive confrontational tactics.
</P>
<P>
   He had also been hammered politically for ethics violations and
for a messy divorce after he left his then-ailing wife and took up
with a young congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   Has he given up the quest for elective politics for good? ``I'm
not ruling anything out,'' Gingrich said.

A TOWER RISES ABOVE TROUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: This article is adapted from ``Tower: Faith, Vertigo and
Amateur Construction,'' by Bill Henderson (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux,
2000).) 
 By BILL HENDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEDGWICK, Maine _ In tower building, small is lovely. It is the
tall imagination that counts.
</P>
<P>
   A few summers ago in Maine, I built a tower on a high hill
overlooking the sea. My tower is only 12 by 12{ feet and three
stories high, if you generously include the observation deck.
Building up to that deck _ with simple tools, no electricity and
little help _ was a major satisfaction, indeed a salvation, during
a year that saw my marriage shaken and my faith often in shambles.
A plague of cancers had descended on several of my friends, all of
them young women. Their agony was one reason I had to lose myself
in raising the tower. It became a tower of oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   You may wish to go higher than I did, but in many communities
zoning restrictions will hold you below the treetops. You are,
after all, contemplating an impractical, frivolous and
idiosyncratic structure. Also, your next-door neighbor may worry
that you will block the sun. (Try not to.)
</P>
<P>
   And of course, you will have to endure the phallus-substitute
cracks. When this happens, point out that William Butler Yeats also
had to listen to Freudian cheap shots from his friend Ezra Pound,
who called Yeats' Thoor Ballylee ``Ballyphallus.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeats restored his tower, a Norman-era semi-ruin in County
Galway, in 1917, with thick planks and paving stones from an old
mill; it sheltered his family from the Irish Civil War. A winding
staircase became Yeats' symbol for the ``widening gyre'' up the
stairs of consciousness. He recalled his labor in his poem ``To Be
Carved on a Stone at Thoor Ballylee'':
</P>
<P>
   I, the poet William Yeats,
</P>
<P>
   With old mill boards and sea-green slates,
</P>
<P>
   And smithy work from the Gort forge,
</P>
<P>
   Restored this tower for my wife George;
</P>
<P>
   And may these characters remain
</P>
<P>
   When all is ruin once again.
</P>
<P>
   I built my tower near Sedgwick village, overlooking the
Atlantic. Because of its slow and steady pace, many residents of
this peninsula live years longer than people from ``away,'' despite
a climate that can be brutal, especially in winter. The terrific
winds may be why Down East Maine is not known for its towers.
</P>
<P>
   But I had been summering here for many years and had recently
constructed a cottage on nearby Deer Isle. I made up the cottage as
I went along, with good advice from A.J., at the lumberyard. My
tools were a hammer, a handsaw, a tri-square, a tape measure, a
level and a length of Manila rope. I lost 20 unwanted pounds, but
my great joy was in the making of it, an obsession perhaps. I made
a summer home for my little family.
</P>
<P>
   I first heard about Christy Hill from a real estate agent, and
once I saw the lot I wanted to buy it. As my dog, Opie, and I got
out of the car, I looked northeast in the clear cold air to the
crown of Blue Hill, scene of the annual Blue Hill Fair, the
inspiration for E.B. White's tale of Wilbur the pig and Charlotte
the spider. Twenty miles to the east were the mountains of Acadia
National Park on Mount Desert Island, and below me were dozens of
lesser islands and ledges, fringed with ice. Beyond them the open
ocean stirred quietly.
</P>
<P>
   In the distance I imagined I could just make out the top of
Mount Katahdin, Maine's highest peak.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way I could afford it, I thought. What was this
really but a 1.78-acre subdivision in the middle of nowhere? More
important, how could I explain my infatuation to my wife, Annie?
She might remind me that we often couldn't pay our bills,
particularly that fuel bill the previous winter.
</P>
<P>
   I telephoned my friend Doris Grumbach in the little town of
Sargentville, just the other side of the Deer Isle bridge. ``Can I
drive you to church?'' I asked. She said I could, and afterward, I
drove her to the top of the hill and pointed out the distant views
across the fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do here?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' I said. ``Probably leave it as it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Doris, who is always careful with her words, said nothing. In
Maine, you are allowed to go as crazy as you wish.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I had my hill, but I couldn't dig my foundation until the
April thaw, giving me most of the winter to dream of what I had
come to think of as my ``tower for no reason.''
</P>
<P>
   There would be no neighbors near this tower with their
busynesses, and no busynesses of my own. Just me and the wild
turkeys, coyotes, moose, porcupines, skunks, deer, eagles and black
bears. Uncompromised. At full attention. Lifted up. Nearer to the
eternal spirit. Brother of Thoreau.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe just a middle-aged guy and his version of a boy's
treehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Because I couldn't afford help and my wife wanted nothing to do
with the tower, I was going to be one guy alone with lots of lumber
and concrete to haul into the woods, which as yet had no road, not
even a path. And after I chose my site and assembled my materials,
I would have to raise it all alone, and by hand.
</P>
<P>
   As for electricity, a line through the sweet woods from the
poles at the main road? Never. And no gasoline machinery, either.
No generators, no backhoes, no cranes, I pledged. Bad enough that I
drove that smoking Oldsmobile. Someday it too would go. Then I
would rediscover my feet by hiking up and down this magnificent
hill.
</P>
<P>
   Like Yeats _ and like Thoreau, in building his Walden Pond cabin
_ I saved by shopping for leftovers. Early in March, while
bicycling the dead streets of the town on Long Island where I live,
I came across a Dumpster with sections of a sliding glass door
sticking out. Thermal-pane doors are heavy, but since they often
refuse to slide, they are common in Dumpsters. And they are
terrific fixed windows, if you can haul the panels to your car and
to the site without developing a hernia.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick had granted me the freedom to erect whatever I liked.
Now I had only to seek permission from the wind. If I had been
thinking clearly, my model would have been the Eiffel Tower, that
984-foot marvel of wind resistance. The Leaning Tower of Pisa
provided lessons as well. When I was a Sunday school child, I was
taught that you should begin your life on a firm foundation: on
rock, not sand. Only later did I hear about the citizens of Pisa,
and how a lousy foundation beneath their 180-foot tower made them
rich, if not saintly.
</P>
<P>
   My foundation of choice was concrete posts, a terrific
foundation for the amateur builder. All that is required is a
strong back or a sturdy wheelbarrow, a shovel and buckets.
</P>
<P>
   The builder will also need eight-inch-diameter cardboard forms,
premixed concrete, reinforcing bars and J-bolts.
</P>
<P>
   But the soil, unbuilt upon since perhaps forever, was not
interested in my tower vision. When I started to dig, hammer, ax
and shovel progressed only 2 feet into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The local wisdom at the Sedgwick General Store was that a 4-foot
depth was the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   I called for help.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dave Webb arrived later that afternoon with his huge backhoe. We
talked as we walked through the woods to my problem. ``A tower,''
Dave mused. ``Gets breezy up here.'' He said no more. This was my
project.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 and a half feet, the land started to screech in protest
against the backhoe's metal fangs: bedrock. But after I paid Dave
and he roared off down the hill, I realized the simple solution: If
I couldn't get below 2 and a half feet, I'd pile up the earth 1 and
a half feet around each post and achieve my 4-foot burial. And I
had to pour concrete now so that I could begin placement of the
girders and joists when I returned later in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   With an old saw I cut each 12-foot-long tube into three 4-foot
sections and put the sections in two trenches, three on each side.
I checked for level and added or subtracted soil as necessary. Then
it was time for some heavy lifting: ready-mix Sakrete bags weigh 80
pounds each. Each post required somewhat more than two bags of mix,
or 15 bags total. Since the ground was too rough for a wheelbarrow,
my shoulder had to do for the march to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Each sack was followed by a bucket of water, which I hauled with
my car to the top of the hill. With a garden trowel I blended the
water and mix and poured the soup into the tube. I added the
reinforcing bar, and finally pushed the J-bolt into the wet
concrete, ready to receive the nut and the metal plate that would
fasten to the main girder.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-by-6 floor joists would be nailed to these girders, and
the plywood floor would be attached to the top of the joists. This
would be a terrific foundation, I thought as the March night
closed.
</P>
<P>
   When I returned to the spot in June, the tiny birch and beech
leaves were just out, pale and tender. I was halfway along the path
into the woods when something to the right formed out of the fog.
Something very large _ framed and sheathed, it was a two-story
house-in-progress, just 20 feet from my property line.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have to begin all over again: digging six holes inch by inch
in the rocks and roots, shouldering 15 bags of 80-pound concrete
mix and many buckets of water to a new foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I need to build this tower? What was the point? Food for
mosquitoes, flies and worms, I was. Dejected, I sat on an old stone
wall at the center of the property.
</P>
<P>
   Then I noticed a large patch of moss almost the measurement of
my intended tower. Here, nearly 400 feet above sea level (almost as
high as the Great Pyramid of Cheops at Giza) was the archetypal
foundation, solid Big Bang granite. ``Thank you,'' I muttered to
the moss.
</P>
<P>
   That summer I fell into a consuming maelstrom that centered
around my marriage. I suspected that Annie felt the same. I
imagined she wanted me gone. My foundations of home and faith were
evaporating in a marital fury. My daughter, Holly, then 11,
remained, but I couldn't share any of this with her. I was, in
short, hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   And alone in the Maine woods without power tools.
</P>
<P>
   As Thomas Merton observed, tough common work is a great
purifier. Hand-sawing those studs, slamming in those 16-penny
nails, hefting frames into place on the platform with nobody around
to help me if I lost my footing, concentrated my rage and
dissipated my hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   Towers have been built for many reasons. Mine was founded on the
edge of despair and framed in pure frenzy. Later I discovered that
an astonishing series of modern towers had been created by a man
who, in a similar mood, happened to share some of my demons.
</P>
<P>
   The Watts Towers were the creations of Simon Rodia, a
bad-tempered, lyrical little guy with enormous energy. Simon, or
Sam, as he was later known, was born in a village near Naples,
Italy, that annually celebrated a pageant dating from the Middle
Ages featuring great ceremonial towers _ eight of them, six stories
high and three tons each.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rodia left Italy at 15 and wandered here and there until he
was hired in California as a concrete worker. As his third marriage
failed in 1921, he started his first tower, and he didn't quit
until 1955, when he had completed three lacy, intricately decorated
spirals of wire and reinforced concrete in his backyard. Two of
these towers are almost 100 feet tall, the third a mere 55 feet. To
me, his soaring spires, now the center of a state historic park,
are the ultimate in backyard tower construction _ dances of
caprice, anger, joy and nostalgia. They have withstood seven major
earthquakes. They are also the tallest structures ever made by one
man alone.
</P>
<P>
   If you build all day, every day, as I did for many summertime
weeks at age 54, you will emerge a far younger man. I framed out a
rough opening for my handsome red exterior door (found at the East
Hampton dump) and raised a two-by-four stud frame. (Don't try it in
a wind, as I did the first time, unless you have an escape route.)
At the corner of the east and west walls, I tripled the studs and
fitted the north and south walls inside them to support them in a
gale. For the next floor, I decided to use 7-foot wall studs, not
the usual 8-footers _ less height but also less to wobble in the
wind, I guessed. And any tower worth its name should incorporate an
inside stairway, leading to a balcony. (I would let sunlight do my
decorating.)
</P>
<P>
   I guessed that my 10-foot 2-by-6 joists could run across the
girders and stick out at each side. The extra foot at each end
didn't seem like much of an overhang at the time, but it made a
difference in stability that I would profoundly appreciate while
finishing the summit.
</P>
<P>
   As I was ready to nail on the roof sheathing and start with the
tar paper and the rolled roofing, I looked over the edge at the
rocks below.
</P>
<P>
   All sense of balance was gone _ and the tower was definitely
shifting under me. Death was a few feet away, somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In my dreaming, I had ignored a problem: vertigo. As a child, I
could scramble up any tree without a care, but now I couldn't climb
open stairs without clawing for support and inching back down on my
hands and knees. That's one reason the views from the tops of the
great steeples and monuments of Europe and America were unknown to
me.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I discovered the secret of amateur semi-sloping
roof-building: the crab-scuttle butt-sit. I scuttled about that
roof, growing bolder and bolder until, by sunset, I had nailed down
all the sheathing.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the second day, I had a roof that didn't dare leak
and vertigo that had slunk away, defeated by the same spirit that I
also learned could control the panic. Embrace it. Wait. Be still.
</P>
<P>
   If you are thinking of constructing your own tower, I suggest
that you don't become overly analytical. Resist your shrink's
advice that you devote more time and money to psychological
explanations for your urges; avoid your doctor's offers of Prozac
or Viagra; harden your heart against your spouse's complaint that
what you really need is a used Volvo.
</P>
<P>
   By scrounging and following Thoreau's example, I was able to
build my tower for $2,264.56. Putting together that modest tower
was a priceless rediscovery of my spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing else much matters, including all the towers of the
earth.

AT FAILING E-STORES IT'S VULTURE BEWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE SLATALLA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine that some shoppers react sympathetically when a store
goes out of business. My mother, for instance, still feels guilty
about Bonwit Teller and wonders if her decision not to buy a
certain red wool coat there one winter somehow contributed to the
department store's demise. I agree it was a mistake to pass up the
coat, because it looked so good with her hair.
</P>
<P>
   But that is the extent of my remorse. When a store goes out of
business, I drop everything and rush out to the liquidation sale.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine that other people would consider this behavior
unseemly. My mother, for instance, has been heard to refer to the
elbowing shoppers who surround the ``final sale'' pillowcases as
``vultures.'' I prefer the more neutral, and I believe more
accurate, label: foragers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the recent flurry of high-profile online retailers who
have gone out of business _ like the toy seller Redrocket.com and
the arts and crafts supplier Craftshop.com _ shoppers like me have
a new place to graze.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of online businesses are going out of business
faster than offline stores,'' said Bill Blundon, executive vice
president of Extraprise, a consulting firm in Boston, ``because
when their initial funding dries up, venture capital firms will not
be as willing to step in to fill the void.''
</P>
<P>
   So after reading about the financial travails that forced the
trendy online apparel company Boo.com into liquidation last month,
I wondered if I might find some online bargains. Last week I went
to visit.
</P>
<P>
   At Boo.com I found all the glitzy trappings that stopped me from
shopping at the site in the first place: the annoying flashing
screens and confusing graphics that made it difficult to shop, a
gimmicky feature that let shoppers ``try on'' items and even the
site's too-perky mascot, Boo, an animated personal shopper.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was missing: evidence that the site was going out
of business. No sale merchandise. No invitations to the crowds
flying overhead in circles _ I mean, foraging _ for the last
marked-down designer backpack. Instead, the merchandise _ from the
DKNY sweat pants to the Converse sneakers to the Helly Hensen
active wear _ were marked full price, but I was so confused that I
filled a shopping cart anyway. Only when I tried to check out with
a pair of black running shorts that cost $42 and a $20 T-shirt did
I get a clue that things were not right. ``An error has occurred
with your session, please try again,'' the site informed me.
</P>
<P>
   After a few more failures, I realized this was Boo.com's
understated way of saying the store was closed. I called the
liquidators at KPMG in London to find out and learned that Boo.com
had stopped taking orders a week earlier. ``An offline store would
post a sign or something,'' I complained. ``Otherwise, how are
people supposed to know?''
</P>
<P>
   KPMG's Mick McLoughlin said he would be surprised if anyone
didn't know. ``This has probably been the best publicized
insolvency in some time,'' McLoughlin said. In other words, stop
looking at the fashion advertisements and start reading the
financial pages. When traditional stores go out of business, they
have inventory to get rid of before they lock the doors. For online
retailers, who have little or no inventory, the old rules do not
apply. And what if a shopper managed to miss the news that Boo.com
was in trouble and was among the last to place an order?
</P>
<P>
   In troubled stores, online shoppers will face a new risk. ``The
old risk was: If you've never heard of them, how do you know those
guys aren't crooks?'' said Erik Gordon, director of the University
of Florida's Center for Retailing. ``Now the new risk is, I know
they're not crooks, but how do I know they're not going out of
business tomorrow, and if they do, will I get my money back?''
</P>
<P>
   In a real store, the transaction is a simultaneous exchange: you
hand over the payment and immediately receive the merchandise.
``You would feel a little differently if you had to hand over $20
to a store that was going out of business and then come back a week
later for the shirt,'' Gordon said. ``On the Internet, that's what
you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   McLoughlin said that in the case of Boo.com, shoppers would
probably be safe. ``I'm almost sure there will be some unfulfilled
orders,'' he said, ``but I don't know the details. But their credit
cards would not be debited before the purchase shipped. Although
it's inconvenient, they shouldn't lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Where does that leave online stores that are still operating but
about which you may have had a whiff of negative financial
information? The music site CDNow, for example, has been selling
CDs at bargain prices, but the company, which is short of cash, is
looking for a new partner or investor. Should you shop there?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going out of business, and it's safe to shop here,''
said Debbie Vondran, a CDNow spokeswoman. ``You can see that we
have been constantly growing the site, adding features and
functionalities, new promotions and new content. That's an
indication that we have a pretty solid business.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting aside for a moment the fact that Vondran is an
interested party, she does make a good point. When you visit an
unfamiliar online retailer, the first thing you should do is
scrutinize the site for robust, customer-friendly features. A
healthy site should prominently display a toll-free customer
service number, a clear return policy and an assurance that your
credit card will not be charged until after your items are shipped.
</P>
<P>
   And look for hints of trouble. For weeks before Boo.com
announced its difficulties, for instance, the retailer suddenly
started sending prospective customers coupons offering 30 percent
off merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, Fashionmall.com acquired Boo.com. When I visited
again, the old Boo.com site was gone, replaced by an invitation to
join an e-mail list to learn about the reopening of Boo.
</P>
<P>
   I imagine some shoppers might have been leery, but I signed up.
If there is a Grand Opening sale, I will rush over to forage.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the most ingenious small Manhattan apartments,
designers and their clients become illusionists. They make beds
disappear, tables double in height and televisions spin between two
rooms at once.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine David Copperfield channeling Billy Baldwin, the
space-conscious 1950s designer: now you see the furniture, now you
don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``You missed it,'' Jordan Schaps, an editor for special projects
at New York magazine, said gleefully. A visitor to his railroad
flat had walked right by his invisible bed, which was hugging the
ceiling. Double-width, extra-long, it is raised and lowered by
pulley and counterweights to a space that is his desk by day.
</P>
<P>
   At night, with the panache of a 1917 Pullman-car porter, Schaps
transforms his 5-foot-by-8-foot home office into a sleeping
chamber. He takes the telephone off the wall, closes his desk top,
draws a curtain across the bulletin board and lets the bed platform
down, with pillows and comforter neatly folded in place. He uses a
cane to pull the curtain across. ``It's vaudevillian,'' he said,
``or is it Chaplinesque?''
</P>
<P>
   Schaps, who wears bow ties by day but bicycles around the
neighborhood with shirt unbuttoned at night, is decidedly the
playful type. His other design tricks: a television set that pivots
in place between the living room and the dining room, and a dining
table whose center section is glass covered and filled with sand
(dotted with mementos of his favorite beaches around the world). He
also created a cabinet in the shape of the United States whose
doors open where the time zones change. ``I'm very pro-America,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schaps paid $22,000 for the 700-square-foot apartment in a West
Village tenement building in 1981, a momentous day in more ways
than one: It was also, he said, ``the day Prince Charles married
Princess Diana.'' At first, he put his bed in the front room,
facing Perry Street, which is paved with cobblestones. Picturesque,
yes, but vexing. The sound of mounted police trotting along the
street _ clickety-clack, clickety-clack _ and trucks rolling over
the uneven surface _ clunk-clunk, clunk-clunk _ led Schaps to
declare, ``Let's get rid of the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet he is happy with his reduced (hide-the-bed)
circumstances. Although Schaps is considering buying a weekend
apartment in Miami, he has no plan to trade up to a larger home in
Manhattan. ``I'm in apartments all the time, producing stories,''
he said, referring to his special issues on home design and food.
``When I'm in a modern, cutting-edge apartment, I say, `This is is
how I want to live.' When I'm in a traditional apartment, I say,
`This is how I want to live.'''
</P>
<P>
   So he stays put, happily. ``I'm a nester,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The television twirls, too, at Emily Oberman's 750-square-foot
apartment on the Lower East Side. Oberman owns Number Seventeen, a
graphic design company, with Bonnie Siegler. The company creates
opening sequences for television shows, and did graphics for Andre
Balasz's Mercer Hotel in Manhattan and for his Chateau Marmont in
Los Angeles. ``I work in TV, and I love TV, and I wish I could take
my TV on a dolly wherever I went,'' said Oberman, 37.
</P>
<P>
   She paid $120,000 for the 750-square-foot apartment in 1990, and
barely unpacked until 1996, when she asked Marco Pasanella, a
Manhattan interior designer, to renovate it for under $20,000. His
mandate was to figure out a way that the television could follow
her, like a devoted puppy, and at the same time satisfy her
admitted narcissism. (``I'm really vain,'' Oberman said.)
</P>
<P>
   The designer, who just published his first design book, ``Living
in Style Without Losing Your Mind'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), succeeded
in one grand gesture. He cut a hole in the wall between the bedroom
and the living room and framed the television with a cherrywood
cube mirrored on the back. Then he put the cube on a Lazy Susan.
``If I'm not watching TV,'' Oberman said, laughing, ``I can watch
me!''
</P>
<P>
   Pasanella also designed a wall system made of doors of frosted
glass that camouflage the ugly barred windows. A soft muted light
comes in during the day, and at night, when lit from street lamps,
``the windows become light boxes,'' he said. He designed nearly
every panel in the room to do double duties.
</P>
<P>
   In the living room, a pair of wood-framed grates hide the
heating system on one side, and provide storage space on the other.
Between them, a wood panel lifts up and out to become a desk. A
round glass coffee table, 14 inches high, becomes a 28-inch-high
dining table when she stacks the large wood cubes that serve as its
base and adds others that are normally used for stools. Not that
Oberman needs a dining table: she takes all her meals out.

 By STEPHEN MIHM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lot of New Yorkers live in small spaces, some
smaller than others. My own, for example, measures 250 square feet
as the crow walks. Over time, I've become obsessed with making the
most of it, getting up at odd hours to stack file cabinets and weed
my belongings, even removing doors from hinges. Today, within easy
reach, I also have a sofa, a desk, two chairs, three bureaus and an
18-pound cat named Gus, who takes up more than his fair share of
the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Suburbanites with tool sheds bigger than my apartment may have
good reason to wonder whether New Yorkers like me are a bit crazy.
But I'm not alone, as I found out when I went in search of other
small-apartment lovers in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   While financial concerns force many New Yorkers to cling to
small quarters, some actually savor living in the human equivalent
of a beehive. Those I met could have moved long ago into much more
spacious housing outside the city; the average single-family
American home, after all, provides 835 square feet of living space
a person, up from 477 square feet 30 years ago, according to the
U.S. Census.
</P>
<P>
   The city's housing code certainly doesn't coddle the
claustrophobic. Section D26-33.03, adopted in 1967, holds that
every apartment dweller is entitled to 80 square feet of so-called
livable space _ not much bigger than a king-size bed. Though
bathrooms aren't figured in, that's still less than the 94 square
feet allotted to well-behaved inmates at Attica.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Manhattan seems destined for compact living, and downsizing
here has become almost a trend. Costas Kondylis, a well-known
architect of residential buildings, said that in New York in the
1980s ``typically, one-bedrooms used to be 750 square feet.'' He
added, ``Now on average they are 640, even 625 square feet.'' (In
another sign of the times, Manhattan Mini Storage has added 12,000
storage units to its inventory of more than 20,000 units since
1990.)
</P>
<P>
   The first stop in my search was the 400-square-foot Greenwich
Village apartment of Zabel Meshejian. The sign in the elevator put
me in the right mood. ``Maximum Occupancy 6 people,'' it read,
surely a joke given that it measures less than 2 feet by 2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Meshejian works by day as a food stylist, staging photographs
for companies like Godiva, Red Lobster and Nabisco. At night, in a
galley kitchen, she cooks for herself, drawing from a
floor-to-ceiling collection of pots, pans and condiments. ``I have
spices for any kind of cuisine,'' Meshejian said, pointing to
wooden cabinets and boxes overflowing with herbs and bottles of
oils. ``Chinese, Indian, Mexican, Mediterranean. They're all
here.''
</P>
<P>
   But never mind the challenge of preparing dinner in a closet. It
turns out that Meshejian is also a frustrated gardener, and her
apartment seemingly houses more flowerpots than a professional
greenhouse. ``I started with one plant, and all of a sudden I had
hundreds,'' she said. Tiers of glass shelves mounted in three
southern-facing windows catch the afternoon sun, all filled with
her favorite miniature plants: euphorbias, haworthias and lithops,
kept small and root bound in tiny pots.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the apartment, shared with a 19-year-old cat named
Munchkin, doesn't seem crowded, just cozy. Antique bureaus, wooden
boxes and hundreds of cookbooks line the perimeter of the living
room, while odds and ends _ a parasol, some woven baskets, family
photographs _ take up the rest of the wall space. Everything has a
place, even Munchkin, who spends his days dozing in a basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this recurring dream that I go through my closet and
discover another room,'' Meshejian said. Not that she would ever
abandon her apartment of 22 years, which is perfectly positioned
across the street from a community green space, where she tends her
outdoor plants and a rock garden.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if there's anything besides economics that keeps people
chained to small apartments, it's location.
</P>
<P>
   For Doris Tobias, it all comes down to breezy views of the East
River and the United Nations. She lives in a one-bedroom apartment
of a little less than 700 square feet with a kitchen the size of a
bathtub, not all that unusual _ except that Tobias happens to be a
cookbook author. (``The Golden Lemon,'' published in 1979, is being
reissued by iUniverse, and Tobias is also the co-author, with
Jean-Paul Picot, of ``La Bonne Soupe Cookbook'' from Macmillan.)
She is researching her next book, a collection of recipes for
``salads that start the meal and salads that are the meal,'' as she
put it, in the same small space.
</P>
<P>
   ``People love to have grandiose, grand-scale kitchens,'' she
said, wrinkling her nose. ``It's an act of one-upmanship. They're
not for use; they're showy.''
</P>
<P>
   The alcove that passes for her kitchen houses a standard
refrigerator; a diminutive four-burner stove; a Frigidaire
minidishwasher; a convection oven barely big enough for an
eight-pound turkey; and some wooden cabinets that spill into the
living room. A few choice pots and utensils hang at arm's length;
basil and rosemary sit in the windowsill, swaying in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to clean up as you go,'' Tobias added. She not only
washes as she cooks, but also prepares parts of the meal ahead of
time, running her kitchen like a miniature military barracks.
``Tidiness is space,'' she said. ``You have to work and clean, work
and clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she ever move, get a bigger kitchen? Not likely: she's too
attached to the neighborhood, where she has lived since 1979.
``Things have changed,'' she said wistfully. ``But the river is
still there, rolling along.''
</P>
<P>
   Living small isn't for everyone, of course, and it hasn't worked
so well for Richard Mason, a short cherubic man who moved into his
15-by-15-foot studio apartment in 1957, when he was 30. At first,
he said, the size of the place didn't matter. He and his friends
``had great parties,'' he continued, adding, ``We had 25 people
over at one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he acquired a house on Long Island near Hofstra
University, where he taught theater, and he used the apartment only
on weekends. But when he retired, he moved back. Now, ``It's really
a challenge to live here,'' he said. ``There's not a square inch
that your eye will rest on that I actually haven't done something
to.'' He pointed to shelves that cling like barnacles to every
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such efforts, as he sees it, he needs professional
design help. ``For years now I've been trying to neaten this
place,'' he said, but it is always ``on the threshold of continuing
chaos.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Some savor the chaos. Surprisingly, I found that includes
families. My final stop was at the home of Ursula and Nilo Mitra,
who live on Pomander Walk, a 1920s gated community of miniature
Tudor row houses lining a blocklong pedestrians-only alley that
runs from 94th Street to 95th Street between Broadway and West End
Avenue. Their 600-square-foot apartment on a single floor has two
tiny bedrooms, with a home office in the parents' room and a
library lining their son's bedroom walls. There is a modest
dining/living room area and a kitchenette wedged into a walk-in
closet.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitras, who arrived from separate dwellings a few years ago,
are the first to raise a child on Pomander Walk in more than 20
years. Mitra works as bookbinder; her husband, who has a doctorate
in particle physics, works for Ericsson, which makes cell phones.
Their son, Amitav, is 2 and will be joined by a baby sister in
October. Two cats (Samantha and Nimbus), plus a sometime nanny,
round out the household.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner is crazy around here,'' Mitra said.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy is practically nonexistent. ``There are no real borders
in this place, except maybe our bedroom,'' she said. And that
doubles as an office, with a hardwood partition the couple designed
themselves. The floor-to-ceiling unit contains a clothes closet, a
file cabinet, several bookshelves and drawers for linens. Another
storage unit, also of their own design, wraps around one of the
windows, providing space for china and a collection of vases.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitras store bulk purchases of diapers, toilet paper and
canned goods off-site in Mitra's studio in Hoboken. When they get
restless, there is always Central Park. ``We spend half of every
day out there,' Mitra said. ``Amitav loves the sandbox.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mitras can afford to move out, but they are attached to
their community And they are inured. Both grew up in small spaces:
Mitra in India, where extended families make privacy a luxury;
Mitra, in a small apartment in Germany with three siblings. ``My
father was the only one who had a private room,'' she said,
recalling his study.
</P>
<P>
   As she sees it, small is good for children _ and parents. In big
suburban homes, she said, ``the child is often in the farthest
corner of the house. Far too much responsibility is shifted away
from the parents and put elsewhere. Part of being responsible is
being there and seeing what's going on with your kid.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughed. ``That is not a problem in a place like this.''

&HT;     REPORT RECOMMENDS CHANGES IN MINORITY CONTRACTING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CHUCK FINNIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A consultant's report recommends that the San
Francisco Human Rights Commission be stripped of its control over
the city's troubled minority contracting program to limit political
influence over the awarding of big public works contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Moving responsibility for the program, subject of a yearlong FBI
probe, to the controller's office would help restore public
confidence in the process by which disadvantaged minority- and
women-owned companies get a guaranteed share of such jobs as the
expansion at San Francisco International Airport, according to the
KPMG Consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The move also greatly would diminish political influence over
the program by Mayor Willie Brown, whose task force to investigate
the affirmative-action program sought the recommendations of KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   Under KPMG's proposal, responsibility for determining
eligibility for minority contracts and bid preferences would fall
to the largely autonomous controller's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Commission, or HRC, which has run the current
program since its inception in 1984, is overseen by a panel of
commissioners appointed by the mayor and is run by an executive
director chosen by and serving at the pleasure of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The controller, though also appointed by the mayor, enjoys far
greater independence. The post carries a 10-year term and its
occupant can be removed only for cause and with the concurrence of
two-thirds of the full Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Robert O'Neill, head of a team from KPMG Consulting that made
the proposal after six months of study, said the recommendation is
an attempt to bring professional standards to the minority
contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings, coupled with the HRC's perceived loss of
credibility made a compelling case for removing certification and
contract compliance and monitoring functions from the HRC,'' KPMG
said in an executive summary to the report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``As contract dollar amounts rise substantially, independence
from potential political influence and strict adherence to
established procedures become increasingly important,'' the summary
said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed transfer of control over the program, which may
require voter approval of a city Charter amendment, is the most
sweeping of several recommendations by KPMG Consulting, which was
hired by the task force formed by Brown last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who said at the time that he was acting to ``ensure the
integrity'' of the minority contracting program, formed the task
force Aug. 30, five months after the San Francisco Examiner first
reported that the FBI was investigating the program and a week
after the newspaper reported that a company controlled by a large,
white-owned corporation landed $55 million in public works jobs set
aside by the city for disadvantaged minority businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a U.S. grand jury indicted four executives of the
company, Scott-Norman Mechanical Inc., and a top Human Rights
Commission official, Zula Jones, for allegedly participating in a
scheme to defraud the affirmative-action program.
</P>
<P>
   Under city law, economically disadvantaged, local companies that
are owned and controlled by minorities or women receive preferences
when bidding on city construction, professional services and supply
contracts. Contractors seeking major public works jobs must pledge
to set aside a portion of the work for these businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Rights Commission first must certify that the
companies meet eligibility requirements.

<P>
   It is a well-known axiom that there is a correlation between the
size of a house and the number of headaches it causes. And in the
Hamptons, their severity increases exponentially as one proceeds
east along Route 27 to the windmill in East Hampton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Rowley, the fashion designer, and her husband, Bill
Keenan, a designer and sculptor, shucked the headaches involved in
owning a shingled four-bedroom stunner in the estate section of
East Hampton and moved instead to a surfer's shack in
less-prestigious nearby Montauk.
</P>
<P>
   Time, not money, was the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley's witty romantic garb and a company with $20 million in
sales last year have made her a lively presence and serious
contender on the fashion scene. And the couple already own homes in
TriBeCa in lower Manhattan and upstate New York. Their house in
Long Island was meant to be someplace relaxing, someplace to enjoy
with their baby daughter, Kit Clementine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be so busy at work,'' Rowley said of the summer five years
ago, a time when she was building an empire that now includes a
shop in East Hampton and six other stores around the world, in
addition to 27 in-store boutiques in Asia. Also, 1995 was the year
she and her husband set up their East Hampton house on Hedges Lane,
known for its rambling privet-cloaked getaways with a pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley recalled: ``I'd get out there on the weekend, and the
neighbors would call to say, `Hi! Your grass should be cut. It
really is getting a little too long.' And the pool would have some
problem. There'd be something else going wrong with the
air-conditioner. It was such a bad experience.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in addition to the weekend guests. ``Not that I'm not
social, but every weekend, so many people ... '' Rowley said,
trailing off at the memory of so many dirty towels and sheets.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after buying the place for $925,000, they put it back
on the market (where it sold for $1.1 million) and started looking
for something smaller. ``Something that we could clean with a broom
in under five minutes,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   They headed east for Montauk, where turrets and swollen eyebrow
windows are in shorter supply than in the snootier Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Got a shack?'' Rowley asked a local Montauk realtor.
</P>
<P>
   Ada Stevens of Kathleen G. Beckmann Real Estate remembered the
visit. ``They came in a pickup truck, and she was wearing this
little cotton print dress,'' Stevens said. ``They were very
low-keyed, and I had no idea who she was.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowley, 40, doesn't indulge in the fashion diva act that her
mid-size clothing domain would entitle her to. Rather, she behaves
like the quintessential best girlfriend, the one who is a little
ditsy but ever at the ready to lend moral support _ and maybe a
great outfit. Keenan, 47, matches his wife in blithe, borderline
goofy spirit, although he appears to be a tad more on the ball when
it comes to things like taking an extra baby bottle to lunch and
monitoring their daughter's intake of French fries.
</P>
<P>
   They remembered the real estate agent's taking them to Ditch
Plains Road, where bland little houses, surfer's huts and Dew Drop
Inn-type motels vie for obscurity. A two-car-garage-size house,
only 200 yards from the beach, caught their eye.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Keenan said, it was love at first sight. The flat
roof, glass sliding barn door and deep overhang reminded him of
something by Richard Neutra, the California modernist. ``Yeah, if
you squint and drive by real fast,'' Rowley said. To her, it looked
``early gas station.''
</P>
<P>
   Its period modernity appealed to the couple's aesthetic interest
in everything resolutely 20th century, and especially anything with
a spark of midcentury optimism: for them, the World's Fair of 1964
and ``The Jetsons'' cartoons are watersheds in design savvy. And
this place was rife with diner details, like the built-in sofas, no
more than hinged platforms lowered by chain from the wall; Jacques
Cousteau porthole lighting; and combed plywood walls that fairly
screamed 1950s rec room.
</P>
<P>
   They bought the place on the spot, paying the asking price of
$189,000, Stevens said. ``If you tore it down and put in an
upside-down contemporary, you would more than likely get a view of
West Lake,'' she said, referring to the kind of top-heavy houses
straining to get a load of the sea that are so typical in other
parts of the Hamptons. So far, this neighborly street of skinny
plots doesn't have any of them.
</P>
<P>
   But the couple had no intention of making significant changes.
They especially didn't want to make the house larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``No fuss, no muss, no Calvin Klein $12 million shingled house
for us,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   For a guest house, there's an Airstream trailer parked in the
backyard, while the couple await approval to convert a
free-standing garage on the property into a guest house. Meanwhile,
the vintage 1969 trailer is ``the perfect self-contained
environment,'' Rowley said. ``It has everything.'' (She noted
brightly, however, that for weekend guests, ``you can't have people
who are too fancy.'')
</P>
<P>
   The house, basically a single room with a galley kitchen and a
corner partitioned off as a sleeping alcove, turned out to have
some serious structural problems. The roof had to be replaced in
the wake of a 15-year leak, and the couple took the opportunity to
open the place up a bit. ``It was so crowded you had to go outside
to turn around,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   They tore out eight built-in sofas that doubled as bunk beds.
The couple removed a closet in order to fit in a queen-size
mattress and a small bedside table. A sliding panel made of wavy
greenhouse plastic slides back and forth in front of the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``For privacy'' Keenan said. The baby, who just turned 1, sleeps
in a portable crib, for now.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture, too, was kept to a minimum. ``We knew we could only
have a few pieces, so we had to choose carefully,'' Rowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite shopping grounds are flea markets, garage sales and
street curbs. The '60s motel mood is up to the minute, from the
Greek flokati rug to the Ikea dresser that Keenan altered by
tacking on spindly legs and clunky drawer knobs. On the hearth
there is a vintage Bongo Board made quasi famous by Hugh Hefner's
``Playboy After Dark'' television show.
</P>
<P>
   The $350 Dux couch was ordered in the most diminutive size
available and then reupholstered in an expensive nubby green wool.
``You can't skimp on everything,'' said Rowley, who was wearing a
backless top made of two silk scarves that had been found at a flea
market and then sewn together along the bias.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of the furnishings, the tables in the house came in
at less than $10 and were picked up at garage sales. The larger,
metal one in the center of the room, which doubles as a dinner
table because there's no place else to eat, looks as if it were
designed by Richard Schultz, well known for his modern garden
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Future plans include adding a breezeway to the garage, which
Keenan uses as an art studio. He envisions it as a curved arc,
``like the Dulles wing,'' he said referring to the Washington
airport.
</P>
<P>
   But that could take a while. ``The whole idea is to come here
and not do much,'' Keenan said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Rowley added: ``With so few walls and so little floor
space, I consider it done. We can't do anymore.''

TRAILER POSEURS: FROM CABANAS TO OFFICES 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA FLANAGAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The property is like a collection of little events,'' Barbara
Jakobson said of her summer place in East Hampton, N.Y. ``It's a
little compound.'' She listed the small pieces: main house, shed,
summer room, tennis court, pool and, parked in a poof of wild
grasses, a garden folly posing as pool house _ an old, 21-foot-long
aluminum travel trailer.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just any old metal trailer. It's an Airstream land
yacht, circa 1974 (complete with the original orange shag carpet).
Jakobson is a collector of 20th-century industrial design and a
board member of the Museum of Modern Art and the Architectural
League of New York. So when she says, ``The Airstream is one of the
most important artifacts of industrial design of the 20th
century,'' she's not fooling around. She bought her trailer a few
years ago from South Jersey Airstream in Vineland, N.J., which
sells comparable ones for about $5,000 today.
</P>
<P>
   The price has gone up, because she is not alone in her ardor.
Lord Palumbo, the British connoisseur known as a collector of world
architecture, harbors two Airstreams in Plano, Ill., at the
aesthetically serene Farnsworth House, the 1950 Modernist landmark
in steel and glass designed by Mies van der Rohe and later bought
by Lord Palumbo. For now, the Airstreams are sitting idle on the
estate, one near the visitor's gate and the other near a garage.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the cult of loving Airstreams as portable appliances
_ nifty gadgets made of aircraft-grade Alclad aluminum _ isn't new.
What's au courant is the cult of loving Airstreams as indoor and
outdoor architecture: used alone or in conjunction with other
structures. These days, it's chic to buy a vintage Airstream, 25
years old or older, for prices ranging from $1,000 to $9,000, gut
and redecorate (in California, remodelers line them with things
like custom sheepskin and resell them for $16,000 to $28,000) or
preserve and retro-accessorize. The Airstreams are used as cabanas,
guest houses, offices, waiting rooms, think tanks, darkrooms,
studios and garden cottages.
</P>
<P>
   Parking Airstreams quasi-permanently is naughty enough. The 1955
Airstream owner's manual warns, ``Remember the Airstream creed,
`Don't ever let your wheels stop rolling for more than 30 days at a
time.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the practice of using the travel trailers as ad hoc rooms
often challenges zoning codes, which favor big, solid, one-family
houses on big lots. Most towns don't want compounds of little
buildings. And certainly not trailers. (``Inhabited'' and
``permanent'' structures, most codes say, should be assembled,
attached to the ground, hooked to utilities; in other words, should
be real buildings.) And some codes ban large vehicles from parking
on streets and driveways.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Jeffers, a design historian, calls parked Airstreams
``occasional architecture.'' For her, the trend might at least
raise some important questions about how living units ought to be
made, used and regulated. ``There's a lot of potential in low-cost,
modular, prefab housing,'' Jeffers said. ``You can buy a trailer
for less than it costs to add a wing to your house. And for
visiting family members, it's a way of giving them independence and
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Jeffers and Jim Huff, her partner in Inside
Design, a consulting firm, are working with Airstream to introduce
a model with updated interiors. (New Airstreams sell for $30,000 to
$78,000.)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Inside Design showed a revamped Airstream aimed at a
hipster market, with new laminate interiors, at the International
Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York. For many people, though,
the most appealing Airstreams date back to the 1950s, '60s and
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   What's the appeal? ``I've tried to analyze why people respond to
these classic vintage Airstreams,'' Jakobson said. ``I'm sure the
reason is that its form relates to the primitive hut, or a cave,
and it's buried deep within the collective unconscious. The shape
says, `Get into me, and I will take care of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Soeffker, the on-site manager of the Elkhorn Guest Ranch,
near Missoula, Mont., could live in a real house with his
15-year-old son but prefers to live in a trailer park in a 1978
Airstream outfitted with awning and fire pit. ``It forces me into a
certain behavior,'' Soeffker said. ``You can't leave the bed unmade
or let dishes pile up.''
</P>
<P>
   Felderman &AMP; Keatinge Associates, architects in Santa Monica,
Calif., think the trailers are good for the workplace. So far, they
have inserted four Airstreams (and one 1969 Volkswagen bus) into
projects. In the lobby of MTV's West Coast headquarters in Santa
Monica they used one AstroTurf-landscaped Airstream as a waiting
room. ``But we see grown men in there having meetings,'' said Nancy
Keatinge, a partner in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   For Pinnacle Studios, a special effects company, the architects
deployed three Airstreams as living rooms cum editing bays. ``We
don't just do it for the fluke of it,'' Keatinge said. ``The
Airstreams make the editing process more enjoyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hawver, a wall covering designer in New York, has a 1955,
16-foot Bambi, but no property yet. He envisions a kind of
Adirondack camp in Sullivan County, N.Y. ``It would be an Airstream
compound with a cabin as the main house,'' he said. ``After a night
of playing Parcheesi, each couple would retire to their own
Airstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, his Bambi, bought for $3,500 in Los Angeles, resides
at the Jersey Shore Airstream Haven, a ``land yacht harbor'' near
Cape May. Hawver, who lives with a couple Vespas in his TriBeCa
loft, redecorated his Airstream with fabric from his own line of
imported linens _ Hawver Interior Material _ doing curtains, bed
and dinette in ``heavy-duty naturals'' that suit the original hard
surfaces of knotty pine. More tentative is Hawver's idea of
starting an ``urban mobile home community'' made up of Airstreams
on Manhattan rooftops. ``They're more spacious than most studio
apartments,'' he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Some people not only regard Airstreams as artful architecture,
but also actually use them to make art. Anne-Catrin Spiess, a Swiss
artist living in the West Village, uses her 1971 Airstream as a
studio and darkroom in parts of the country so remote she needs a
satellite phone to stay in touch. When the trailer is not in
Nebraska or Newfoundland, it lives in a campground near Blairstown,
N.J. (storage: $40 a month).
</P>
<P>
   John Ringel, Steve Badanes and Jim Adamson, designer-builders
who work under the name Jersey Devil, built a concrete beach house
in Islamorada, Fla., in 1991 and put an Airstream on a patio to
serve as au pair apartment and guest room. ``I still own three of
them,'' Badanes said. ``Hey, the insurance is 60 bucks a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Badanes keeps his trailers in Washington state, Missouri and
Vermont, where he is still assembling his summer ``vacation
estate,'' with one Airstream, one Prairie Schooner (another kind of
trailer), a deck and an outhouse. ``The bottom line is that they
are cool-looking,'' Badanes said. ``It's like living in a little
tube, and when you're lying in bed, you can look at all the
curves.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one downside to the obsession, however. ``Movie stars _
Sean Penn, Jack Nicholson _ are driving up the prices of the old
ones,'' Badanes said. Alas, what's left to buy that's undiscovered,
retro and cheap? Perhaps mobile homes, ranch style, are the last
frontier.

   NJ-ELECT (Trenton, N.J.) _ Robert Franks was not half way
through his acceptance speech Tuesday night when he began ripping
into Jon Corzine, his opponent in the New Jersey Senate race, as a
dangerously out-of-touch spendthrift. The race for the middle began
even before all the votes were counted in the New Jersey primary
Tuesday night that left Franks as the apparent Republican nominee.
And Franks' attack raised a question that could define the race _
can he succeed in turning the liberal politics and record-setting
spending that won Corzine the Democratic nomination into
liabilities big enough to keep Corzine from winning the election?

NEITHER NOTEBOOK NOR PALM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE HUTSKO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somehow the niche between a palm-size organizer and a notebook
has never been successfully colonized. Big companies are about to
withdraw their bigger handheld entries from the market. IBM
withdrew months ago, and Hewlett-Packard will stop production of
its larger handheld this month, although it will continue to
produce its tiny handheld with non-touch-type keyboard, which has
been selling well.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, Sharp, NEC and a few others still make so-called PC
companions, devices with keyboards that are bigger than an
organizer's but smaller than a notebook's. But they run on
Microsoft's Windows CE operating system, which draws its look and
feel from its big brother operating system, Windows 98. And
Microsoft is not saying whether it will allow the Windows CE system
to fade away while it concentrates its marketing muscle on its even
tinier Pocket PC software for palm-size computers.
</P>
<P>
   I hope that Windows CE and the bigger handhelds that run it do
not disappear, but if they do, there is a product from Britain by
Psion PLC waiting in the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The Psions, organizers with keyboards, have always been
competition for the palm-size computers and have been popular in
Europe, with some following here. The new Psion Series 7 is the
most powerful yet. It looks like a notebook computer, but does not
carry all the overhead like a hard drive or the ability to run the
same programs you use on the desktop. Instead it runs scaled-down
applications that offer the bare minimum of services required to
write, calculate, stay on schedule and in touch with contacts, send
and receive e-mail and connect to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   About the size of a large paperback book, the Series 7 weighs in
at just over 2.5 pounds. The black case is made of hard plastic
partially sheathed in bumpy black leather, giving the device a sort
of high-tech-meets-classic-Day Timer appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The $900 Series 7's color screen, which is 7.7 inches from
corner to corner, may seem awfully small when compared with
full-fledged notebook computers costing only a few hundred dollars
more, but if you compare it with a Palm or a Pocket PC handheld,
that is another matter. Like the larger Windows CE handhelds, which
have no hard disks and power on instantly without the lengthy boot
up times of regular computers, the Psion Series 7's attraction lies
not in its ability to be a notebook computer, but rather to offer
the essence of one.
</P>
<P>
   Psion estimates that unlike notebooks, whose batteries fizzle
out after a few hours, the Series 7's rechargeable battery will
last about eight and a half hours before you need to plug the power
adapter into the wall. The battery in the Series 7 I tested lasted
at least four hours with no signs of running out, although I did
not run it longer than that without its being plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   The included synchronization software works with Windows
computers, shuttling word processing, spreadsheet and personal
information manager (PIM) data back and forth. An included cable
plugs into the Psion's serial port on one end and the computer's on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   A double click of the synchronization icon shuttles personal
information between the Psion 7's Agenda, To-Do, e-mail and
Contacts information and any version of Microsoft Outlook running
on a Windows desktop computer. Unfortunately, Microsoft Outlook's
Post-It-like screen notes are not supported in the transfer, which
I find disappointing since I use them frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Where Windows CE manages to do the transfer and translation
between big computer and little computer automatically on all
application fronts, the Psion requires manual intervention to
shuttle documents; Word and Excel files must be dragged and dropped
into and out of the Psion 7's folders, and you have to activate the
file transfer utility to take documents with you or update on the
desktop. It would be nice if the Psion figured out that part by
itself, like Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   The Series 7, however, does something Windows CE has never done:
it works with Macintoshes. Currently, optional software lets Mac
users back up data stored on the Series 7, and Psion says next
month it will offer beefed-up Mac software to enable
synchronization with several popular e-mail and organizer programs.
As for entering information by hand, the device's keyboard is
smaller than the standard desktop keyboard, but the difference is
not very noticeable when touch typing _ except for the awkwardly
placed question mark and slash key. Having to stretch the right
pinky to reach for the question mark key is maddening.
</P>
<P>
   The touch-sensitive screen flips back nicely and is complemented
on either side with 10 on-screen buttons for starting the built-in
programs. All of them, as well as icons and other objects or text
on the screen, respond to the fingernail or the included stylus,
which pops out of the side of the Series 7.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Four of the on-screen buttons may be customized to run secondary
programs _ included applications that are not linked to screen
buttons _ or ones you have installed yourself. Psion thoughtfully
dedicates two buttons to the ability to zoom in and out of the
screen's text in any application and have the system remember that
size for any other application. It is a wonder such a feature is
not easily available on desktop computers, because it eases
eyestrain when the text is enlarged while typing articles like this
and is equally useful for dropping the text size down a few notches
to make more of it fit on the screen when viewing Web pages. Text
views and font sizes can be changed in most Web browsers and word
processing programs, but with much less ease.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Web, the Psion, which uses an operating
system called Symbian EPOC, is not as adept as competing products
that run Windows CE. Figuring out how to connect in the first place
is a bit tricky because of the machine's Eurocentric default
settings. But once the country and area code settings are typed in,
the Psion 7 is ready to make the connection by way of a PC Card
modem slipped into its available slot.
</P>
<P>
   Psion provided its own 56K version for this review, though
almost any PC Card modem should work. Once connected, Web pages
appear nicely in all their colorful glory, though certain sites
built with complicated or multicolumn layouts don't always look
they way they do on a desktop or notebook computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   Besides connecting with a modem, the Psion has an infrared port
for beaming bits of information to other Psions or Palm OS handheld
computers. The infrared port can also be aimed at the infrared port
of GSM-equipped mobile phones for dialing into the Net. GSM (Global
System for Mobile Communications) is a digital cellular telephone
standard in use in more than 60 countries, including much of
Europe. Trial GSM systems have been set up in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A Compact Flash slot accepts memory cards to give the Psion more
room for storing documents and information, but the unit's 16
megabytes of RAM was more than big enough for storing my few
hundred contacts, birthday reminders and two novels. Since the
Psion's programs are built into the unit's ROM, they don't take up
storage space.
</P>
<P>
   Additional touches include a database program, a sketch program
and a notes program. All of the Psion Series 7's applications can
accept and display text scribbled with the stylus and pictures
imported from Web sites or the desktop computer. The extra feature
I am most grateful for is the voluminous spelling and thesaurus
program, which proves indispensable when searching for just the
right word while revising chapters of my next novel.
</P>
<P>
   But helpful as it is, the thesaurus is not reason enough for me
to replace the Hewlett-Packard Jornada 820 running Windows CE that
I rely on for my away-from-home computing. I have three reasons: 1)
It synchronizes all my personal data _ including Outlook Notes _
and documents without my ever having to think about it, whereas the
Psion is prickly in the same matters; 2) it runs AOL Instant
Messenger, which the Psion cannot; and 3) I prefer the Jornada's
notebook-style touchpad to the Psion's stylus-dependent
touchscreen.
</P>
<P>
   But if I did not already own the Jornada 820 _ whose days,
according to HP, are sadly numbered, with production of the device
ending this month _ the Psion Series 7 would probably be my first
choice as a companion to my desktop computer. Given time and a
little tweaking to improve its compatibility with Windows and Macs,
the Psion Series 7 could even unseat the few but significant larger
handhelds running Windows CE. Assuming, that is, that Microsoft
does not pull the plug on its own invention beforehand.

   CHRISTOVAL, Texas _ On a hot and gusty West Texas day, Sister
Marie hurries across the chalky construction site with her
traditional brown habit lapping at the top of her blue cowboy
boots. ``We all have cowboy boots,'' she says of the six cloistered
nuns who have made the new monastery their home. ``They warned us
there were a lot of snakes out here, but they said the snakes
wouldn't strike higher than six inches, and we would be safe as
long as we had our boots on.'' The new Carmelite Monastery of Our
Lady of Grace is rising, stone by stone, above the twisted mesquite
and live oak trees. It is a new Texas holy land on the rocky
pastures, a place of prayer and deep spirituality. Also a place of
goats and cattle and rattlesnakes. By ART CHAPMAN. (With excellent

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 c.2000 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: We have a large screened enclosure around and over our
swimming pool and there is a small tear in one vertical section.
The screen mesh is made of a plastic material that is fairly
flexible.
 &HT;    Hiring someone to replace all the screen mesh in that section
would be expensive, so I would like to simply patch that little
torn area myself.
 &HT;    What is the simplest way to do this?
 &HT;    A: If the tear is very small, you can often patch it by simply
dabbing over the hole with an all-purpose clear household cement.
 &HT;    For larger holes or longer tears you can cement on a square
patch of the same material.
 &HT;    Coat the patch and the area around the tear or hole with a light
coat of the cement, then press this patch firmly into place over
the defect while someone presses firmly on the other side of the
screening with a piece of plywood or stiff cardboard.
 &HT;    If you know the screen is actually fiberglass you may be able to
dispense with the cement and simply ``iron'' it into place with a
regular clothes iron set on medium high heat. Cover the patch with
a piece of cloth before pressing the iron on top.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Some oil was apparently spilled in my garage some years ago
and this oil has soaked into some of the wood framing and siding,
as well as into the concrete floor of the garage.
 &HT;    There is no surface oil left, so there is nothing to mop up on
the surface.
 &HT;    Is there any way I can remove these oil stains from both the
wood and the concrete?
 &HT;    A: Some absorbent materials such as powdered Portland cement or
kitty litter can be used to absorb and remove oil stains from wood
and concrete, if they can be spread on in a thick layer.
 &HT;    However, these are only effective when the stain is still fairly
new, so I don't think they will work on stains that are many years
old and already deeply absorbed.
 &HT;    On the concrete, you can try one of the liquid cleaners sold for
this purpose in most hardware stores, but even these would be
useless on the wood.
 &HT;    The only way to conceal these stains is to paint over them. You
will first have to apply one or two coats of a stain-killing sealer
such as BIN or Kilz.
 &HT;    After this dries the surface can be painted with any type of
latex paint.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: My roof has moss on the shingles, especially on the sides
facing east and west where there is considerable shade.
 &HT;    Is there any way I can remove this moss without damaging the
roof?
 &HT;    A: Moss can usually be removed by washing with a solution of one
part laundry bleach mixed with four parts water.
 &HT;    Scrub this on with a soft brush and allow to dry on the surface,
then flush off with lots of water.
 &HT;    You can also use one of the commercial moss removers that are
sold in garden supply outlets.
 &HT;    In each case, protect plantings from the runoff by covering with
plastic sheets and by hosing them off thoroughly as work
progresses.
 &HT;    None of these solutions will harm the roofing.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: I am building some cabinets out of a solid hardwood that
comes only in odd widths and I have to cut some boards into two or
three equally wide strips.
 &HT;    This means working with small, odd fractions that are hard to
measure accurately.
 &HT;    An old time carpenter once told me that this is easy to do with
an ordinary ruler. Have you heard of this?
 &HT;    A: Angle the ruler across the width of the board so that an even
inch mark on the ruler is at one edge (it doesn't matter which mark
you start with).
 &HT;    Hold this end in place and swing the ruler diagonally across the
width of the board until an even-numbered inch mark is at the
opposite edge, picking a number that will be easy to divide by the
number of widths you want. For example, if you want four equal
widths locate the opposite edge at exactly the 4- or 8-inch marks.
 &HT;    Now make a pencil mark at each of the intermediate inch marks to
divide the board into that number of equal widths you want.
 &HT;    Then use these marks to draw lines parallel to the edges to
indicate where to cut. (Don't forget to allow for the width of the
saw blade as it makes each cut.)
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Q: Some years ago, solar window film was put on our windows.
This film is now wrinkled in several places, so we would like to
remove it completely.
 &HT;    How can we do this?
 &HT;    A. Most solar films can be removed by simply peeling them off
after you work one corner loose by sliding a razor blade under the
edge.
 &HT;    As you start to peel it off, keep wetting the film with a fine
spray of water while pulling gently with a steady pressure. Also
spray water onto the glass behind the film so it runs down behind
it.
 &HT;    Keep spraying and peeling and the sheet of film should come off
in one piece. Otherwise you may have to use a razor blade to scrape
it all off.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general
interest will be answered in this column; Mr. Gladstone regrets
that unpublished letters cannot be answered individually.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    NOTE: Drawing captioned ``PATCHING HOLE IN A SCREEN'' goes with
this column.
 &HT;    CAPTION: Torn plastic screen can be patched by using clear
household cement to hold the patch in place. Or, if the screen is
made of fiberglass, you can simply iron on the patch.

THE INTERNET: INVALUABLE AND INESCAPABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet rules. It's not just boosterism anymore. People are
spending more and more time online _ for business and pleasure,
reshaping our attitudes and the corporate landscape, and
jeopardizing traditional pursuits such as watching TV, reading and
going to the library.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 years ago, when America Online first began running
TV ads, most people didn't know what the heck it was selling. Now
people are doing business entirely online, buying books and
groceries online, finding LOVE online. Dallas even has ``Dotcom
Guy,'' whose goal is to spend a whole year in his home doing
everything via the Internet. Few doubt that he can do it.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen? Even most enthusiasts don't know how the
Internet managed to penetrate our lives quicker and deeper than any
other new technology or medium. Even if you don't have a PC, have
never surfed the Web and have no intention of entering a chat room,
you can't escape the effect the Net is having on society and pop
culture.
</P>
<P>
   So HOW did the Internet take over the world (or at least the
United States)? HOW did we become so dependent _ seemingly
overnight _ on double-clicking a mouse? When did computer viruses
start getting more headlines than the kind that send us to the
doctor?
</P>
<P>
   To answer such questions, we provide an Internet time line,
spotlighting milestones that have made the Net what it is today:
invaluable _ and virtually inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1950s-60s: Panicked by the Soviets beating us into space, the
U.S. Defense Department in 1957 forms the Advance Research Projects
Agency (ARPA), a technical team whose job is to beef up the
burgeoning federal computer system. This leads to the
establishment, a dozen years later, of ARPAnet, the first
decentralized computer network for sharing data. Research centers
and universities quickly begin to join ARPAnet.
</P>
<P>
   1969: Doug Englebart, a researcher at Stanford, comes up with
several ``far-out ideas,'' including the computer mouse and live,
interactive TV pictures. No one outside Englebart's family notices.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1969: The first e-mail message is sent by a team of
computer gurus at UCLA to another team at Stanford Research
Institute. The message is ``LOG IN.'' One letter is sent at a time
_ first ``L,'' then ``O,'' etc. The system crashes on ``G.''
</P>
<P>
   1975: Working out of their garages, twentysomethings Paul Allen
and Bill Gates form Microsoft in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Early to mid-1980s: The sniff of digital money is in the air,
even if it's very faint. The first Internet providers are launched,
including CompuServe, Genie and Quantum, which would be renamed
America Online and reacquaint us with the busy signal.
</P>
<P>
   1989: Tim Berners-Lee, who works at a Swiss particle physics
institute, comes up with the idea of the World Wide Web to share
physics research.
</P>
<P>
   Early to mid-1990s: The number of Internet users soars to 1
million. Building on Berners-Lee's World Wide Web program, the
first graphics-based Web browser, Mosaic, is unveiled, for the
first time giving the Net more than rudimentary visuals. With the
Internet freed from its text-based corset, sex-related sites soon
proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   1994: Netscape is co-founded by Marc Andreessen, the key figure
in the creation of Mosaic. Netscape Navigator quickly becomes the
dominant Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   1994-95: The White House goes online. Dorm-room Webcams help
spur the reality-programming rage that will lead to ``Who Wants To
Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' and ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   1995: Companies that are suddenly considered ``old media''
(read: newspapers and magazines, even TV networks) rush to get
online in a big way, and the marketing of the Net kicks into high
gear. Microsoft launches the Microsoft Network. Many insiders
predict that Gates' innovative MSN will crush AOL within a year. It
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   1996-98: Entertainment, retail and business-to-business
applications push the Internet's original purpose, research, into
the background. With the economy booming, individual investing
online becomes a phenomenon. Cyberhoaxes (Did you read the
``transcript'' of the Columbia astronauts on their ill-fated
launch?) proliferate. Computer games displace video games in
popularity. Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney simulcast Web-only
concerts; retail sites such as Amazon.com make buying CDs and books
on the Web easy. And, oh yes, did we mention sex? Although most
content sites operate at a deficit, online porn peddlers can't
count the money fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   1999-present: Online music community Napster, which allows
anyone with a computer to download and store music without paying
for it, is banned at several college campuses and sued by the band
Metallica, the Recording Industry of America and other
music-related organizations. The Commerce Department reports that
the Internet has contributed to 30 percent of U.S. economic growth
since 1995.

THE INTERNET: INVALUABLE AND INESCAPABLE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The Internet rules. It's not just boosterism anymore. People are
spending more and more time online _ for business and pleasure,
reshaping our attitudes and the corporate landscape, and
jeopardizing traditional pursuits such as watching TV, reading and
going to the library.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 years ago, when America Online first began running
TV ads, most people didn't know what the heck it was selling. Now
people are doing business entirely online, buying books and
groceries online, finding LOVE online. Dallas even has ``Dotcom
Guy,'' whose goal is to spend a whole year in his home doing
everything via the Internet. Few doubt that he can do it.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen? Even most enthusiasts don't know how the
Internet managed to penetrate our lives quicker and deeper than any
other new technology or medium. Even if you don't have a PC, have
never surfed the Web and have no intention of entering a chat room,
you can't escape the effect the Net is having on society and pop
culture.
</P>
<P>
   So HOW did the Internet take over the world (or at least the
United States)? HOW did we become so dependent _ seemingly
overnight _ on double-clicking a mouse? When did computer viruses
start getting more headlines than the kind that send us to the
doctor?
</P>
<P>
   To answer such questions, we provide an Internet time line,
spotlighting milestones that have made the Net what it is today:
invaluable _ and virtually inescapable.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1950s-60s: Panicked by the Soviets beating us into space, the
U.S. Defense Department in 1957 forms the Advance Research Projects
Agency (ARPA), a technical team whose job is to beef up the
burgeoning federal computer system. This leads to the
establishment, a dozen years later, of ARPAnet, the first
decentralized computer network for sharing data. Research centers
and universities quickly begin to join ARPAnet.
</P>
<P>
   1969: Doug Englebart, a researcher at Stanford, comes up with
several ``far-out ideas,'' including the computer mouse and live,
interactive TV pictures. No one outside Englebart's family notices.
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 1, 1969: The first e-mail message is sent by a team of
computer gurus at UCLA to another team at Stanford Research
Institute. The message is ``LOG IN.'' One letter is sent at a time
_ first ``L,'' then ``O,'' etc. The system crashes on ``G.''
</P>
<P>
   1975: Working out of their garages, twentysomethings Paul Allen
and Bill Gates form Microsoft in Albuquerque, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Early to mid-1980s: The sniff of digital money is in the air,
even if it's very faint. The first Internet providers are launched,
including CompuServe, Genie and Quantum, which would be renamed
America Online and reacquaint us with the busy signal.
</P>
<P>
   1989: Tim Berners-Lee, who works at a Swiss particle physics
institute, comes up with the idea of the World Wide Web to share
physics research.
</P>
<P>
   Early to mid-1990s: The number of Internet users soars to 1
million. Building on Berners-Lee's World Wide Web program, the
first graphics-based Web browser, Mosaic, is unveiled, for the
first time giving the Net more than rudimentary visuals. With the
Internet freed from its text-based corset, sex-related sites soon
proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   1994: Netscape is co-founded by Marc Andreessen, the key figure
in the creation of Mosaic. Netscape Navigator quickly becomes the
dominant Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   1994-95: The White House goes online. Dorm-room Webcams help
spur the reality-programming rage that will lead to ``Who Wants To
Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' and ``Survivor.''
</P>
<P>
   1995: Companies that are suddenly considered ``old media''
(read: newspapers and magazines, even TV networks) rush to get
online in a big way, and the marketing of the Net kicks into high
gear. Microsoft launches the Microsoft Network. Many insiders
predict that Gates' innovative MSN will crush AOL within a year. It
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   1996-98: Entertainment, retail and business-to-business
applications push the Internet's original purpose, research, into
the background. With the economy booming, individual investing
online becomes a phenomenon. Cyberhoaxes (Did you read the
``transcript'' of the Columbia astronauts on their ill-fated
launch?) proliferate. Computer games displace video games in
popularity. Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney simulcast Web-only
concerts; retail sites such as Amazon.com make buying CDs and books
on the Web easy. And, oh yes, did we mention sex? Although most
content sites operate at a deficit, online porn peddlers can't
count the money fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   1999-present: Online music community Napster, which allows
anyone with a computer to download and store music without paying
for it, is banned at several college campuses and sued by the band
Metallica, the Recording Industry of America and other
music-related organizations. The Commerce Department reports that
the Internet has contributed to 30 percent of U.S. economic growth
since 1995.

ON A MISSION TO CUBA, BEARING BALANCHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By SUKI JOHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ ``Please don't laugh,'' says Lourdes Lopez, a former
principal dancer of New York City Ballet, ``but I had a sort of
second coming.'' Lopez, who left her native Cuba when she was 1
year old, is describing her first trip back here in 1997, at the
age of 39. ``For the first time I felt like I belonged somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon returning to New York, Lopez called Ben Rodriguez-Cubenas,
a Cuban-American program officer of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund.
``I said, `Ben, now is the time,''' she says. ``So we got our act
together and founded the Cuban Artists Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund supports New York- and Cuba-based artists working in
all mediums. ``We are trying to re-establish cultural bridges, as
well as promote better understanding,'' Rodriguez-Cubenas says.
``The arts are a great force for bringing people together.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has a strong artistic tradition, fostered by a system that
provides free higher education to those who exhibit talent. Working
in old studios where both the floorboards and the pianos are
splintering, the Cuban Escuela Nacional del Arte has a nationwide
enrollment of more than 1,200 and has produced dancers and
musicians of international acclaim. Carlos Acosta of the Houston
and Royal Ballets and Jose Manuel Carreno of American Ballet
Theater are two of the most famous alumni of this system.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban artists work with a wealth of knowledge and a constant
lack of the basic materials of their craft. Their persistence and
resourcefulness impressed Lopez. She and Rodriguez-Cubenas began
traveling to Cuba lugging ``extra suitcases filled with brushes,
oils, canvases, point shoes, tights, CDs, music sheets, clay,
plaster of Paris, pens _ you name it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   They soon learned that carrying donations to Cuba isn't easy.
Most airlines have a weight limit of 44 pounds, and point shoes are
heavy. Although Air Jamaica can be softhearted regarding
humanitarian aid, Marazul, which flies direct from New York to
Havana, charges $3 per overweight pound. ``We had no money,'' says
Lopez. Showing their own resourcefulness, they held a benefit.
Happily, they soon discovered what is now common knowledge: Cuba is
hot. The fund even found support among Cuban-Americans in their 60s
and 70s, frequently the most virulent enforcers of the 38-year-old
United States embargo of the island.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Cuban Artists Fund will hold its second annual
benefit, ``New York for Cuban Artists,'' at Wallace Hall on Park
Avenue. The fund has reason to celebrate. This October, at the
International Havana Festival of Ballet, the hottest ticket will
most likely be ``Ballo Della Regina,'' which George Balanchine made
for the ballerina Merrill Ashley in 1978. In March, Ashley traveled
to Cuba to teach ``Ballo'' to the Ballet Nacional de Cuba, in the
fund's first major collaboration with a Cuban arts organization.
</P>
<P>
   When Lopez first considered traveling to Cuba in the early 90s,
she says: ``It was still dicey. My parents didn't want me to go
because of repercussions in Miami. I was still actively performing
in City Ballet. My mom said, `If you come to Miami to dance, what's
going to happen?' I was afraid for my mother. She was getting some
funny phone calls. Her friends in the tight Cuban community where
she lives said: `I hear your daughter is going to dance in Cuba.
What is she, a Communist?''' Lopez canceled her trip.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, she retired from dancing, joined a WNBC news
team and traveled to Cuba with other journalists. Since it took
place under the aegis of the news media, her trip was overlooked by
Miami Cubans. She interviewed Alicia Alonso, the artistic director
of the Ballet Nacional and a former star of American Ballet
Theater. Alonso lured Lopez out of retirement. (When the younger
ballerina protested that she had already retired, Alonso laughed.
``It's December,'' she said. ``I'm giving you eight months to get
into shape.'')
</P>
<P>
   Lopez didn't dance again in Miami, but she danced in Havana.
While there, she noticed that the Cuban repertory was distressingly
light on Balanchine, and she set about remedying the situation. She
thought it was essential to give the Cuban dancers firsthand
information from someone who would demand the most of them. ``I had
a sense that Merrill and the Balanchine Trust would agree,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Balanchine Trust protects the choreographer's copyrights.
(Paradoxically, because the United States and Cuba have no
diplomatic relations, and intellectual property is as foreign a
concept to Cuba as the Nasdaq, it's unlikely that anyone could
prevent the Cubans from dancing whatever ballets they choose. On
the flip side, the byzantine regulations guiding relations between
Cuba and the United States specify that Cuban artists working in
the United States cannot be paid.) Artistic solidarity prevailed
over political punditry: the Balanchine Trust licensed ``Ballo'' to
the Ballet Nacional for free.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez still had to get Alonso's approval. ``It was like visiting
the Pope,'' she says. Alonso had hoped to get another Balanchine
ballet, ``Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2.'' Lopez felt it was too
difficult for dancers unaccustomed to the Balanchine vernacular,
and began to describe ``Ballo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, `If you could see this, I can send you the
tape.''' To which Alonso, who has had many eye operations and is
almost blind, responded, ``Well, Lourdes, that's just not going to
help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez described ``Ballo's'' ``little variations, hops on point,
brisees, cabrioles, tours to the knee,'' and the engaging energy
contained in the 20 minutes the piece takes to perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``Que sabrosa tu eres,'' said Alonso (``How delicious you
are'').
</P>
<P>
   Lopez laughs at the memory: ``That was the OK''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley describes working with the Ballet Nacional as ``one of
the highlights'' of her life in ballet. ``They were so eager,'' she
says. ``I didn't have to teach the men to do double saut de basques
or multiple pirouettes; they could do them at any speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley noticed an unusual camaraderie among the dancers, ``all
of them rooting for each other, helping, excited by each other's
successes.'' Though the dancers lack good shoes, tights and
vitamins, they have a ``supportive attitude, rather than what I see
in many companies _ each person trying to outshine the next to get
a better role,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lopez, Ashley was surprised by what the dancers did
without. ``It didn't occur to me they wouldn't have a Band-Aid,
silicone pads, normal things ballet dancers now use.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashley anticipates returning to Cuba in October to rehearse
``Ballo'' before the premiere. While Congress considers softening
the embargo to permit exports of medical products to Cuba, the
ballerina considers what to pack. ``I'm inspired to bring a whole
suitcase of dancer medical supplies,'' she says.

CHINESE HERB, LINKED TO KIDNEY FAILURE, MAY ALSO CAUSE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a harsh example of the dangers of untested and unregulated
herbal products, doctors are reporting that a Chinese herb, already
linked to kidney failure, may cause cancer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The herb, Aristolochia fangchi, was given to patients at a
weight-loss clinic in Belgium from 1990 to 1992, according to a
report being published Thursday in the New England Journal of
Medicine. By 1993 more than 100 had kidney damage, and so far, more
than 70 have needed either transplants or dialysis. Now,
substantial numbers are also developing cancers of the urinary
tract.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of kidney failure from this herb have also been reported
in France, the United Kingdom, Spain, Japan and Taiwan. Dr.
Christine Lewis, director of the office of nutritional products,
labeling and dietary supplements at the Food and Drug
Administration, said there had been no reports of Americans being
harmed by Aristolochia. She also said the FDA did not know how much
of the herb might be on the market in this country.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, the FDA sent letters to doctors and to the
supplement industry, with a 6-page list of herbal remedies known or
suspected of containing Aristolochia. The agency urged
manufacturers to test their products for the presence of the herb.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, importation of the herb, including every
item on the 6-page list, will be banned, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Cardellina, vice president for botanicals at the
Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group for the supplement
industry, said Aristolochia was found in some traditional Chinese
medicinal mixtures, but in few other products. Nonetheless, he
said, because Aristolochia is so extremely dangerous, the
supplement industry supports the FDA's decision to list every item
that might possibly contain the herb.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs, amino acids, vitamins and other ``supplements,'' a $15
billion industry, are largely unregulated. Unlike drugs, they do
not have to be proved safe and effective before they are marketed,
and no outside agency even checks to make sure that the products
actually contain the ingredients on the label. Regulation is
lacking because in 1994, Congress passed the 1994 Dietary
Supplement Health and Education Act, which cut back the authority
of the the Food and Drug Administration. Under that law, the FDA
does not have have the authority to take supplements off the market
until they are proved dangerous, in which case people may already
have been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   A report being published Thursday in the New England Journal of
Medicine describes 39 patients given transplants or dialysis at
Erasme Hospital in Brussels, by a team led by Dr. Joelle L.
Nortier. Eighteen of the 39 have also developed cancers of the
urinary system. Nineteen others have abnormal cells in the urinary
tract, possibly precancers.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the article, Dr. David Kessler,
former head of the FDA and now dean of the Yale School of Medicine,
called the prevalence of tumors ``striking.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessler also noted that Aristolochia could still be purchased in
the United States. He said he bought a bottle of Aristolochia
capsules, sold as ``Virginia Snakeroot,'' from an American supplier
via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In his editorial, Kessler urged Congress to change the law to
give the FDA more power over supplements.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgium, Aristolochia was given to patients by mistake;
doctors had prescribed another herb, but the product that patients
received was later found to contain Aristolochia, possibly because
of a manufacturing error. On average, patients took it for about a
year. Those who took highest amounts were most likely to develop
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Aristolochia contains compounds called aristolochic acids, which
are known to damage the kidneys and to cause cancer in lab rats.
The herb was traditionally used in Chinese medicine for a variety
of ailments, but about 25 years ago German researchers found it to
be highly toxic, according to Dr. Varro E. Tyler, an expert on
herbal medicine at Purdue University. Nonetheless, he said, some
manufacturers in China continue to use it.
</P>
<P>
   When a Belgian patient developed cancer, doctors there tested
the other kidney-failure patients for cancer. A high proportion, 18
of 39, had cancer in the kidney, bladder or ureter, the tube
connecting the kidney and bladder. Nineteen other patients had
abnormal cells, possibly precancers, in the urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tissue from every patient had ``DNA adducts'' from
Aristolochia, meaning that molecules derived from the herb had
attached themselves to the patients' genetic material. Adducts can
interfere with DNA function, and are thought to increase the risk
of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said the high incidence of abnormal cells and adducts
even in the patients without tumors was worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   The warning letters and list of products that might contain
Aristolochia can be seen on the FDA Web site, www.fda.gov, by
clicking on ``What's New'' and then on ``dietary supplements.''

NOT MOBY-DICK BUT WHALE-ISH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa, Conn., Wash., Calif.)   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By DON SHEWEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reviewers have often commented on Rinde Eckert's
remarkable stage presence. ``He's tall and bald and he looks a good
deal like an overgrown elf,'' a San Francisco critic once wrote.
``But when he opens his mouth to sing, it's as if there's an angel
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   John Rockwell, writing in The New York Times in 1988, referred
to the persona that emerges from Eckert's texts as that of ``an
American loner-eccentric, with touches of Bertolt Brecht, Samuel
Beckett and Tom Waits.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckert is currently enacting the latest version of this persona
in ``And God Created Great Whales,'' which opens Sunday night in a
world premiere at Dance Theater Workshop's Bessie Schonberg
Theater, where it plays through June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Although inspired by a certain whaling epic by another American
loner-eccentric, Eckert said in a recent interview: ``I'm not
interested in doing `Moby-Dick.' Melville did that very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 80-minute music-theater piece, in which he sings,
speaks and plays the piano and ukulele, ``stands in a clear
relation to the epic but ramifies it in completely different
ways.''
</P>
<P>
   As the youngest of four children born to two music teachers
(Rinde _ pronounced RIN-dee _ is his mother's maiden name), Eckert
practically grew up on the stage. At the age of 8, he went
backstage at intermission to visit his father, who was performing
in ``La Boheme'' at the Amato Opera Company on the Bowery, and
found himself conscripted to play one of the children in the second
act. For him, nothing could have been more natural.
</P>
<P>
   When he went to college at the University of Iowa, his plan was
to study theater. Midway through, however, he found himself annoyed
by the lack of specificity in the training and switched to music,
``because they had a technique they were actually teaching you,''
Eckert recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were asking concrete questions about mechanics and
structure,'' he continued. ``Most of the theater departments I knew
were all over the place. They had no consistent philosophy. I
thought, how is it possible for an intelligent person to arrange
himself idiosyncratically in relation to this emotional chaos?''
</P>
<P>
   That existential question, framed early, could serve as a
unifying theme for the entire body of work the 48-year-old Eckert
has written, performed, directed, composed or recorded in the last
15 years. From the collaborations with the composer Paul Dresher
that began in 1985 with ``Slow Fire'' to Steven Mackey's 1998
two-act solo opera ``Ravenshead,'' Eckert has invented a series of
variations on the character of a smart, slightly cockeyed Everyman
who begins his journey with a pure sense of mission and descends
into the maelstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``And God Created Great Whales'' was conceived several years ago
during a conversation between Eckert and W. David Hancock, the
author of several wildly unconventional Off Off Broadway plays
(including ``The Convention of Cartography'' and ``The Race of the
Ark Tattoo''). Hancock had been in a workshop the performer taught
at the University of Iowa. Impressed with a show called ``The
Gardening of Thomas D.,'' Eckert's adaptation of Dante's ``Divine
Comedy,'' Hancock proposed that they tackle ``Moby-Dick'' together.
Although Hancock did not continue with the project, he did
introduce Eckert to his producer, Melanie Joseph, of the Foundry
Theater, who commissioned ``And God Created Great Whales.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically for Eckert, the work that resulted is several layers
removed from Herman Melville. ``As I did with Dante, I wanted to
find my own way in,'' he said. ``In this case, as I was thinking of
things quintessentially American, I started reading essays by the
leading proponents of 19th-century American pragmatism _ Charles
Sanders Peirce, William James. That led me to thinking about
manufacturing pragmatism and the development of the industrial
standard. Things we take for granted, like the size and shape of
the television screen, were actually decided by some guys sitting
around in a room.''
</P>
<P>
   Translating the notion of an industrial standard into musical
terms led Eckert to consider the development of the standard tuning
that allowed for the creation of a piano keyboard. The hero of the
piece became a piano tuner with a degenerative disease who
struggles to complete his life's work, an opera based on
``Moby-Dick,'' before he loses his memory completely. For this
character, whose name is Nathan, the great white whale is
represented at various times by the piano, by the blank page facing
the composer and by memory itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ends up disappearing into his own opera,'' Eckert
explained. ``As his mind goes down for the last time, he becomes
Ahab and goes down with the whale, never to be seen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckert is aware that tackling ``Moby-Dick'' may conjure
inevitable comparisons to Laurie Anderson, who last year presented
her own fractured take on Melville's classic, ``Songs and Stories
From Moby-Dick.'' Both are the type of multi-talented individuals
the term performance art was invented to describe, although
Anderson came to music from the visual arts while Eckert is steeped
in classical music traditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Performance art is a critical name for people who perform
their own work that doesn't fit into conventional categories,''
Dresher, the composer, said by telephone from his studio in
Berkeley, Calif. ``Most performance artists express their unique
artistry by combining elements of different disciplines, none of
which they master. The difference with Rinde is that he comes from
an extremely disciplined training as singer, musician and theater
artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckert was born in Franklin Lakes, N.J., and received a master's
degree at Yale University, expecting to become an opera singer.
Although he spent four years after graduation studying with the
soprano Phyllis Curtin, he found that he was not spiritually
well-suited for the world of traditional opera. So he followed his
sister Thomasa to Seattle, where they formed the New Performance
Group. They created a piece with George Coates, a San
Francisco-based director, who coaxed Eckert to the Bay Area to help
create ``The Way of How,'' with Dresher, the tenor John Duykers and
the dancer-mime Leonard Pitt. The nonnarrative multimedia show was
a hit and put all of them on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eckert admired Coates' spectacle-based kind of theater
(Robert Wilson and Philip Glass' ``Einstein on the Beach,'' he
said, ``changed my notion of what theater could be''), he soon
found that he preferred making chamber pieces. Over the course of
10 years, he and Dresher collaborated on 12 works that blurred the
lines between theater and dance, between rock and classical music.
Not all of these pieces have been critically well-received, and his
first attempt to direct a piece himself (``Odd Behavior'') was a
resounding failure. Yet his multiple skills and willingness to try
new things helped make Eckert a legendary figure in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my learning has taken place in public,'' said Eckert,
who moved to New York five years ago with his wife, the playwright
and actress Ellen McLaughlin, who portrayed the angel in the
original production of Tony Kushner's ``Angels in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the contract with myself: I'm interested in learning.
If you're interested in learning, you have to take your lumps. If
you don't want to take your lumps, then you don't want to learn. If
you don't want to learn, you're not going to grow. And if you're
not going to grow, you're going to be bored. And I don't want to be
bored.''

 &HT;    Tools, gadgets always make good gifts for Father's Day
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Father's day rolls around June 18, a little more
than a week from now. If you want to buy a tool or gadget gift for
Dad or some other Dad-like person in your life, this weekend would
be a good time to shop.
</P>
<P>
   You can go with anything from a set of screwdrivers from the
nearest anything-for-a-dollar store to a $10,000 gas grill, so you
won't lack choices when looking for father-appropriate gear. But
all that variety may make selecting one thing tough.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion in this kind of situation is that you ask the
potential recipient what he might like.
</P>
<P>
   I personally don't care much for surprises and would find it
hard to work up much enthusiasm if someone spent $700 to buy me a
propane-powered mosquito catcher. Such a device turned up among the
press kits for products being promoted as Father's Day gifts this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few suggestions for gifts that cost less and would
probably be appreciated more.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rotary tool: These handy little items for anyone who enjoys
detail work are like small power drills. The cylindrical body of
the tool fits comfortably in one hand, and it spins a variety of
drilling, cutting, grinding and polishing tools.
</P>
<P>
   A rotary tool fitted with an engraving bit can mark your name
and Social Security number onto expensive electronic equipment.
Insert a sanding bit, and a rotary tool can strip paint from old
furniture or smooth a wooden sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Variable-speed rotary tools of various brands are sold in kits
with a few starter bits for about $60 to $125. If your gift
recipient already has a rotary tool, hundreds of accessories are
available.
</P>
<P>
   For larger projects, the indispensable tool for the home
handyman is a variable-speed drill-driver. If you don't want to ask
the recipient which of the hundreds of models he would prefer, make
a list of jobs he has done or would like to do to and ask a
knowledgeable salesperson which drills best fit those duties.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lawn tools: The lawn tool that gets the most use is the mower,
but many homeowners could also use hedge trimmers, weed cutters,
edgers, snow throwers, leaf blowers, chipper/shredders and
cultivators.
</P>
<P>
   Assess what your lawn keeper might use before heading to the
lawn-equipment retailer. A cultivator suitable for a two-acre
vegetable garden wouldn't be much use to a guy who only turns soil
in a small flower bed once a year.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need to make choices about power supplies. The
simplest way to power tools for a small yard is to plug them in
using an outdoor extension cord. Electricity from a nearby outlet
supplies all the power you'll need for most light-duty tools, and
it's relatively inexpensive and convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Rechargeable tools are an option if your property is so large
that stretching a cord to reach the weeds at the back fence would
be a problem. But remember that rechargeable tools are generally
heavier and more expensive, and they can go dead in the middle of a
job.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline-powered tools are also available, but they, too, tend
to be expensive and heavy. Gasoline motors on small lawn tools are
a major source of air and noise pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Closely related to lawn tools are compressor tools. Power
washers, for example, come in handy for cleaning driveways, washing
cars, washing windows and other jobs that require spraying large
quantities of water under pressure. Small electric models start at
about $150, and gas-powered models suitable for home use start
between $175 and $500 Compressors also come in handy for painting
and blowing up tires and volleyballs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Books: A good home-improvement book or two can increase your
handyman's handy-ness significantly. My favorite do-it-yourself
book publisher is Meredith Books, and it released a good one this
year: ``Ortho's Home Improvement Encyclopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ortho book covers subjects from making houses
handicapped-accessible to obtaining zoning permits. It offers more
than 800 color illustrations explaining how things work around the
house. The book seems to be geared more toward building and
remodeling and is light on routine maintenance topics such as
unstopping a sink or fixing a squeaking floor.
</P>
<P>
   For that kind of information, a good recent book is ``Better
Homes and Gardens New Complete Guide to Home Repair and
Improvement,'' also from Meredith.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Little gifts: Children and others on a tight budget still can
afford a tool gift for Father's Day. In fact, the hardware aisle of
any discount store is a great place to shop for small gifts for any
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Among the things you might consider are work gloves, tape
measures, socket wrench sets, tool belts and aprons, work lights
and flashlights, vises and work benches, tool boxes, soldering
irons and glue guns, hammers and other hand tools.
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb here is to buy something a step up from what
Dad uses now. If he's already got a 12-volt rechargeable drill, a
new 9-volt drill may not impress him.
</P>
<P>
   But if he's currently driving nails with a rock, the simplest
hammer in the store probably would be appreciated.

 &HT;    Go ahead, eat your spinach
 &HT;    By Karen Collins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that people with osteoporosis should avoid
spinach?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not true at all. That idea probably started with someone who
heard that spinach contains oxalate, which binds up the calcium in
spinach making only about a quarter of it actually available to the
body. Getting enough calcium in a form that can be well-absorbed is
an important part of preventing or slowing the progression of
osteoporosis. Spinach does not contain enough oxalate to bind up
all the calcium you get from other foods, however, so there's no
reason to avoid it. Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach and
kale ae excellent sources of beta carotene and other carotenoids,
folate (which may help prevent cancer and other health problems)
and minerals such as magnesium and potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it true that olive oil should be stored in the
refrigerator?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Olive oil producers say that it should maintain its
quality for one year if stored in a tightly closed container in a
cool, dark place such as a pantry. In other words, a refrigerator
is not necessary, but don't store it in a cabinet right over your
stove. Some people find that it stays fresher if refrigerated
during hot months, but that is on the basis of personal preference,
not food safety. Refrigerated olive oil gets cloudy, but it clears
when brought to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Does the sweetener aspartame cause damage to nerves or
metabolism?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Aspartame (listed on many labels as NutraSweet) has been
tested many times, and no such effects show up. People with the
rare illness PKU cannot properly metabolize this sweetener, and
some people seem to react negatively to it for unknown reasons. But
that is no different than people who cannot tolerate tomatoes, MSG
or orange juice; it doesn't make those things less healthy for the
rest of us. Studies in recent years have looked for brain and
nervous system changes that might result from aspartame, and none
have been found. As with all foods, moderation is common sense. And
remember that just because foods sweetened with aspartame may be
low in calories, that doesn't make them ``health foods'' to load up
on at the expense of other healthy foods, such as the fruits and
vegetables that Americans chronically eat in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Q: ``Plant-based diets'' are said to be the healthiest, but
aren't they fattening with all those starchy foods?
</P>
<P>
   A: Plant-based diets _ diets centered on vegetables, fruits and
grains _ are the best advice for good health. Low-fat, balanced
eating combined with regular exercise and weight control could
prevent 30 percent to 40 percent of cancers. Fat and alcohol are
the most concentrated sources of calories, so as long as your
portions are appropriate and the plant foods you choose are not
soaked with fat (like deep-fried veggies or rich croissants), a
healthy, mostly plant-based diet should help, not hurt, weight
control. Remember how to balance food choices: A mostly plant-based
diet is not just high in bread, pasta and other grains; it also
includes lots of fruits and vegetables. Most vegetables contain
only 30 percent to 50 percent of the calories in an equal size
serving of a grain, so besides providing essential nutrients,
vegetables are an important part of weight control. A recent study
at Cornell University found that plant-based diets may cause
changes in metabolism that add up to preventing about 10 pounds of
weight gain per year.

WITH A TORCH AND A PEOPLE'S PRIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia _ Walk through the modest front door of
Nova Peris-Kneebone's Victorian home and you soon come face to
frame with a picture of Muhammad Ali standing on a stage next to
Peris-Kneebone's young daughter Jessica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melbourne 1998 just after the Commonwealth Games,''
Peris-Kneebone explains proudly. ``He was in a boxing ring here for
an appearance, and the people who brought him here, they introduced
us to Muhammad and brought Jessie up on stage, and you know he has
this affiliation with children. So he went straight up to Jessie
and held her hand and would not let it go. It was unbelievable, a
very special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is more linking Ali and Peris-Kneebone than a small
child's grasp. In 1996, when the Summer Olympics were last held,
Ali was the last person to carry the torch. Trembling from disease,
he lit the Olympic flame during the Opening Ceremony in Atlanta,
sending goose bumps down Peris-Kneebone's and a lot of other
spines.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly four years later, it is her turn to play a leading
role, and on June 8 in Australia, when the flame arrives at the
sacred Aboriginal site of Uluru to begin a 100-day tour of the
sprawling continent before reaching Sydney, Peris-Kneebone will be
the first Australian to carry it when it is unloaded from the
plane.
</P>
<P>
   She will do so with the massive and magnificent red monolith _
dubbed Ayers Rock by the white European settlers but long called
Uluru by the Aboriginals _ looming telegenically in the background.
She will do so because Sydney Olympic organizers, eager to project
an inclusive and updated vision of Australia, found her
multifaceted, multicultural background irresistible even though
other Australian athletes have accomplished more. confident that
this moment, her moment, will have resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have an Aboriginal person carrying that flame is going to
make a hell of a lot of people very proud,'' Peris-Kneebone said
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to it than her rich brown skin; there is the
content of her character and of her resume. At 29, Peris-Kneebone
is a mother, an artist and a world-class sportswoman in the midst
of a career change. In 1996 in Atlanta, she became the first
athlete of Aboriginal descent (she also has Filipino and European
ancestors) to win an Olympic gold medal, as a member of the
Australian women's field hockey team. Several months later, she
retired from hockey and decided to train to become an elite
sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was to show you my scrapbook as a kid, track and field
was my first love,'' she said. ''And that's what I'm going after
this year: my first childhood love.''
</P>
<P>
   After surprising the field and herself to win the gold medal in
the 200 meters at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, she is now focusing
her energies on the 200 and the 400 in the lead-up to the much more
competitive races in Sydney. Though her chances of an individual
gold medal are extremely slim _ her goal is to reach a final _ she
and an even more prominent Aboriginal runner, Cathy Freeman, could
win a medal together if Peris-Kneebone manages to qualify for the
4-by-400 relay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she can do it,'' said Freeman, who won a silver medal
in the 400 in Atlanta and has won the last two world titles over
the distance. ``No matter what happens, I have a lot of respect for
Nova, because she's very courageous. She chases her dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   The chase has sometimes resembled an obstacle course. Born in
1971, Peris- Kneebone and her younger sister were raised by their
mother, a single parent, in a two-bedroom house in Darwin in
Australia's Northern Territory. When Peris-Kneebone was 10, her
mother remarried and, according to Peris-Kneebone, the atmosphere
changed dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stepfather was a policeman, a very hard, strict man,'' she
said. ``I was really stubborn as a kid and him coming into our
lives at such a late stage, he was stubborn and I was stubborn and
he had to sort of chase me down to grab hold of me. There was none
of that sit in the corner and face the wall kind of thing. I was
always being chased across the road with a strap. But he was fair.
He hated lying, so as a kid, if you ever told a fib, you got the
belt. If you told the truth, it was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   At 13, largely because of a dearth of track and field programs
in Darwin, Peris-Kneebone focused her energies on field hockey, a
popular sport throughout Australia, and was soon one of the best
prospects in the country. But at 19, she gave birth to Jessica in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole 12 months after Jessie was born, I was just happy
being a mum,'' she said. ``It wasn't until 1991 that I thought,
`The dream is still there: if you want, you can go after it.'''
</P>
<P>
   The following year, she moved with Jessica to the western city
of Perth, where the national hockey team trains. She took a job
with the Australian telephone company and juggled day care,
practice and part-time employment while Jessica's father and
Peris-Kneebone's future husband, Sean Kneebone, remained in Darwin
attempting to build a career of his own in case her hockey career
foundered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put Jessie up in the stands with her coloring books or
dolls and a little lunch box and drinks,'' Peris-Kneebone said.
``There were times on Tuesday evenings, I'd have psychology
meetings and she'd come and sit underneath the table with a
coloring book and the other girls in the room wouldn't even know
she was there. She was just so quiet and did her own thing. She'll
be one of those people when she gets older who will love sport or
hate it, because she's seen the hard work that goes into me
achieving, seen all the highs and lows.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Kneebones divide their time between their rented
house full of photographs in Melbourne and their family and
spiritual base in Darwin. Aboriginal people represent approximately
2 percent of Australia's population of about 19 million but they
make up approximately 20 percent of the population in the Northern
Territory and own about one-fourth of the property because of the
Aboriginal Land Rights Act passed in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Aboriginal landowners are called ``traditional owners'' in
Australia, and Peris-Kneebone is a traditional owner in Kakadu
National Park, where she often fishes, camps and hunts with her
family. As a custodian of the land, Peris-Kneebone is in regular
contact with tribal elders, including her biological father, with
whom she had virtually no contact until he came to visit her after
Jessica's birth. Her father lives a traditional, seminomadic
aboriginal life style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny, I spent 18 years apart from him and yet we are so
much alike in so many ways,'' she said. ``I never see him with a
watch on his wrist because time doesn't matter. He's lived out in
really harsh places on the Coburg Peninsula, living off the land
for eight months at a time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   It is on her people's land and with her father that
Peris-Kneebone has worked through her problems in the last two
years. First came her post-Commonwealth Games depression in late
1998, when she quickly grew weary of the interest in her private
life that accompanied her increased celebrity. It was all very
petty to Peris-Kneebone _ complaints that she wore too much gold
jewelry or that she had grown too arrogant for a society that
values egalitarianism. Irritated, she considered returning to the
more anonymous existence of a hockey team member.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem getting criticized for my performances, but
when they start to get into my personal life, I have a problem,''
she said. ``I have a daughter who goes to school and has to face
the music and people saying, `Is this true about your mum?' And she
gets really upset about it, and I'd had a gut-full, an absolute
gut-full of the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was all ready to go back to hockey,'' Sean said. ``It was
all done and then about a week before it was announced, she was
watching video of the Commonwealth Games final and just turned
around and said, `I can't do this. I'd be quitting, leaving the
sport for the wrong reasons.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There have been calls from many Aboriginal leaders to use the
Games as a platform for increasing international awareness of the
intense discrimination Aboriginals faced after European settlement
in the 18th and 19th centuries. Aboriginals were only granted full
citizenship in 1967, and even now, their life spans are nearly 20
years lower on average than the rest of the Australian population,
while unemployment, child mortality and criminality rates are
significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's attitudes and policies toward Aboriginals have
evolved considerably, but Peris-Kneebone knows there is more
progress to be made. Yet she often feels divided: eager to
capitalize on a unique opportunity and spread the word; worried
about spreading herself thin and missing out on her athletic goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been some discussion of a boycott, but the grass
roots people tell us to run, tell us, `You're the one that inspires
our children and gives hope to our race.''' Peris-Kneebone said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there will certainly be Aboriginal protests of some
type at the Games in September, and there could also be some form
of protest at Uluru when Peris-Kneebone becomes the first of 10,000
Australians, including the golfer Greg Norman, to run with the
torch. Peris-Kneebone understands there is anger out there, but for
now she is more interested in carrying flames than fanning them.
And when she's asked what message she wants to convey to the world
100 days before the Olympics begin, she harkens back to a
conversation she and Sean had not long ago with one of the grizzled
elders from Kakadu known as Old Man Bill. The conversation started
out being about Peris-Kneebone's gold medals but it ended up being
about something more universal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the sudden he sort of looked at Sean and said, `Do you
want to learn?''' Peris-Kneebone said. ``And Sean told him, `Yeah I
want to learn, and Old Man Bill told him, `No matter what color
skin you got, we all got the same color blood.'''

   Fifteen years ago, at the height of his first wave of commercial

talking to a reporter _ on a Monday, no less.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the singer and his band were busy indulging in the
typical rock-star, live-it-up lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every cliche you can think of associated with being a rock
star, we absolutely indulged in it,'' says Jon, calling from a pit
stop on Bon Jovi's current tour, the first in five years. ``Talk
about giving me the key to the candy store. I was 25 years old and
a multimillionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The money remains, even if the memory is sometimes a bit
sketchy. The group's album sales in the '80s, most of which came
from the massively popular 1986 disc ``Slippery When Wet,'' made
his future secure. But the New Jersey-based rocker, and the band
that uses his last name as its moniker, are still around and proud
of their music. The band has considerably changed, the 38-year-old
singer says, and for the better. Everyone's older now, the partying
has stopped and Jon and his crew have something other than partying
on the mind _ namely, is Bon Jovi's forthcoming disc, ``Crush,''
gonna sell in a very non-metal-friendly musical atmosphere? That's
why Jon's talking to reporters at 9 in the morning, trying to hype
the disc and the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a whole new world out there,'' Jon says.
</P>
<P>
   Bon Jovi seems well-prepared, though, because not only has the
band endured, it has matured. Other groups of its ilk have
disappeared or reduced themselves to playing the nostalgia circuit.
Bon Jovi has remained active, grown musically and, even more
important and impressive, remained popular _ with a wide-ranging
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're able to transcend time through their music,'' says
Island/Def Jam Music chairman Jim Caparro, who has worked with the
band for 12 years. ``And emotionally and creatively, they're in
step with what's going on in music today. They're not Korn or Kid
Rock or Limp Bizkit, but in the world of rock and roll, they remain
as credible as you get, if only because their music is honest.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, program director for North Texas rock station
KEGL, says it's Jon's combination of musical prowess and smarts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not only talented, but he has a lot of business savvy,''
says Stevens, who has been in radio 21 years and interviewed Bon
Jovi in San Antonio on its first tour in 1982. ``He does have
personal charisma and he's smart enough to have exploited that, not
only in videos, but through his solo career and movies. He's
working it. He always has.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon would like to think it's the lyrics, the simple phrasings
and stories that chronicle the everyday lives of everyday people.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people relate to songs that have touched them in their
lives, they become memories,'' he says. ``Those memories are looked
back on, hopefully fondly. I'm not trying to rewrite ``Slippery''
for you now. I'm telling you who I am now. And hopefully, I'm
creating new memories, and hopefully that'll draw people back to me
10 more years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Jon Bongiovi in New Jersey, the singer was never much for
school; he ditched a lot, spending a good chunk of his time hanging
at a local recording studio, the Power Station, where he was
eventually hired as a janitor.
</P>
<P>
   There, he met several famous musicians, including members of
Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band. Egged on by his new-found
musician pals, Jon started recording his own demos, including a
track called ``Runaway,'' which wound up in the hands of an
influential New Jersey radio station and, eventually, major labels.
</P>
<P>
   When the song took off, Jon formed a band to nourish the song; a
major-label bidding war ensued, with Mercury coming away the
winner. To downplay his ethnic background, Jon changed his last
name and the band's name to Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   Success came fast: ``Runaway,'' the first single from the band's
self-titled debut, was just that, quickly becoming a Top 40 hit. A
year later, the group followed up with ``7800 Degrees Fahrenheit,''
which went gold. To strengthen their burgeoning fan base, the guys
toured and made several TV appearances, including one on disco show
``Solid Gold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Slippery When Wet,'' the band's 1986 third disc, ushered in a
whole new wave of popularity at the height of the metal-pop era.
Songs like ``You Give Love a Bad Name'' and ``Wanted Dead or
Alive'' became rock-radio staples, while the band tinkered with its
image. Soon the spandex and big hair were gone, replaced with jeans
and T-shirts. As a result, Jon's photogenic mug started popping up
everywhere, overshadowing, to some extent, the band's music. It's a
problem he has had to deal with ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when that was just heartbreaking,'' he says.
``We worked so hard to get where we were, and then the first time
we were on the cover of Rolling Stone, all anyone could talk about
was my haircut.''
</P>
<P>
   His good looks helped keep the music alive during the lean years
that followed, when grunge and then teen pop left the band
searching for an audience. When their records weren't in demand (he
also put out a solo CD that tanked in the mid-'90s), Jon made
movies, like this summer's ``U-571,'' which reminded people that he
was still very much around.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the movies were utter bombs, Jon says he
wouldn't change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back on everything I've done and the band's done very
fondly,'' he says. ``I made a coupla minor stupid mistakes. I
should have zigged when I zagged. But there are no car crashes or
drug addicts in our story. Our ``Behind the Music'' has a happy
ending.''

ROCKER AND WOHLERS PASSING IN THE NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The baseball paths of John Rocker and Mark Wohlers first crossed
in May 1998. Wohlers, the Atlanta Braves' closer, went on the
disabled list, and Rocker was recalled from Richmond to replace him
on the roster. Three weeks later, Wohlers rejoined the Braves,
Rocker remained and the two briefly were teammates. Two years
later, they are opponents, pitching in the International League.
</P>
<P>
   What an unlikely development, not to mention coincidence, but
there they are, Wohlers relieving for the Louisville Riverbats, on
his way back to the major leagues, his control seemingly restored;
Rocker on his way to pitch for the Richmond Braves, demoted to the
minor leagues, having lost control of his pitches and his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At least some, if not most, of the members of the Braves would
be happy if Rocker were never to rejoin them. On the other hand,
they are rooting for Wohlers to make it back, even if it is with
the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wohlers would be the consensus guy,'' a general manager of
another team said Tuesday, commenting on the feelings about each
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers' former teammates, as well as other players, pull for
him because he has always been a good person, a good guy, and he
was the victim of a mystifying loss of control of his pitches. En
route to a brilliant career as a closer, Wohlers suddenly couldn't
throw strikes. A performance that produced 97 saves over three
seasons deteriorated into one that created 33 walks in 201/3 and
one-third innings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A similar performance of 25 walks in 18 and one-third innings
created cover for the Braves to send Rocker to the minors, giving
him time for a refresher course on the strike zone and a more
important course on behavior in life. Had Wohlers not lost the
strike zone and forced the Braves to replace him, first with Kerry
Ligtenberg, then with Rocker, Rocker would not have been in a
position to take on New York's baiting fans last season, then the
world in a magazine interview last winter.
</P>
<P>
   But while Rocker's world is an unappetizing place to live, the
new world Wohlers has discovered is filled with fresh and
sweet-smelling air. Wohlers's agent, Seth Levinson, told Tuesday of
the delight with which his client related details of his
performance of the previous night. With a 2-1 count on the
Scranton-Wilkes Barre cleanup hitter, Wohlers threw a 96
mile-an-hour fastball on the black on one side of the plate, then
fired another 96 mile-an-hour fastball on the black on the other
side.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Wohlers, nearing the end of his rehabilitation
from so-called Tommy John elbow surgery 11 months ago, was making
his first appearance for Class AAA Louisville after three outings
for Class A Dayton. The Reds, who use relief pitchers like chain
smokers use cigarettes, eagerly await his arrival in Cincinnati.
Before they make the move, though, the Reds want to see Wohlers
relieve in consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be another 10 days, a week; they haven't put any
definite timetable on it,'' the pitcher told The Louisville
Courier-Journal. ``And it depends on how I do. There are a lot of
good hitters in this league. You can't just come down here, think
you're going to get your arm in shape and go straight up to the big
leagues. You have to prove yourself at each level you're at. I just
want to stay healthy and throw strikes, no matter where I'm at.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker would do well to heed Wohler's words. If he approaches
his appearances with Richmond with the angry attitude with which he
seemed to have departed from the Atlanta clubhouse Monday, he could
set back the nonexistent timetable the Braves have for his return
to their clubhouse. Now what a shame that would be.
</P>
<P>
   It is premature to talk about Wohlers's return to the majors; he
has suffered too many setbacks in his two-year effort to jump ahead
of his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing at speeds up to 97 mph in his appearance on Monday,
Wohlers threw strikes on 10 of his 18 pitches, struck out two
batters, walked one and gave up one hit. Dave Miley, the Louisville
manager, said Wohlers ``threw the heck out of the ball.'' The
pitcher's only concern, he said, was his inability to throw his
slider where he wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' he said, ``I feel like it's a matter of getting
my slider going. I threw a couple good sliders for guys to swing
and miss, but not good for being in the strike zone. That's the one
pitch giving me a little bit of trouble right now. That's something
that will come with time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers is not prepared to talk in depth about his problems and
his comeback, his agent said. He has not proved anything yet. He
wants to know he's back before he talks about getting back. But how
delightful it would be to have Wohlers pitching in relief for the
Reds, saving games for the Reds. He has worked hard to make it
back.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker's work has only begun. But then, he hasn't shown that he
wants to work at changing the attitude that created his problems. &QL;

 &HT;    BILLS AIM AT CURBING SALE OF 'GRAY MARKET' CIGARETTES
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Gray market'' tobacco has cost U.S. farmers and
wholesalers millions of dollars in the past four years, according
to members of Congress who introduced bills Wednesday that would
make its sale in the United States illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Gray market tobacco is tobacco that is sent abroad for sale in
foreign countries, but then is returned to the United States and is
sold here.
</P>
<P>
   Gray market cigarettes do not meet the required U.S. laws for
content and labeling, and are about $10 a carton cheaper than
cigarettes made to be sold domestically, said Rep. E. Clay Shaw
Jr., R-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., said sales of gray market cigarettes in
the United States increased from 48 million in 1998 to 97 million
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said that these cigarettes cut into money that states will
receive from their settlement with the tobacco companies by
reducing sales of domestic cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``According to settlement payments, domestic tobacco sales have
recently decreased by 14.7 percent, and during the same period of
time gray market sales accounted for 16 percent of total tobacco
sales,'' Shaw said. ``The similarity of these percentages is
telling.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Lewis, R-Ky., said gray market cigarettes violate U.S.
trademark laws and also reduce payments for tobacco farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A loophole in the law allows these cigarettes to get back on
the U.S. market,'' Lewis said. ``It has also reduced payments for
farmers in Kentucky by as much as 45 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill was introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kent Conrad,
D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will ensure that cheap cigarettes don't end
up in the hands of children, and that states receive the settlement
that they deserve,'' Conrad said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Wholesale Marketers Association applauded the
introduction of legislation to make gray market cigarettes illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray market cigarettes have eroded cigarette distributors'
profits,'' said David Strachan, president and chief executive
officer of the association. ``Distributors simply cannot match the
prices that gray market tobacco offers.''

 &HT;    'EDDIE EAGLE' IN THE CROSSFIRE OF GUN SAFETY DEBATE
 &HT;    510&AMP;add. For release Sunday, June 11.
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some call him a champion of gun safety. Others call
him ``Joe Camel with feathers.''
</P>
<P>
   His name is Eddie Eagle, and several million children have seen
him in coloring books, videos and posters as the cartoon star of
the National Rifle Association's gun safety program.
</P>
<P>
   The brown and white mascot, who flies around in high-top
sneakers, has one constant message for children who see a firearm:
Stop. Don't touch. Leave the area. Tell an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gun avoidance program,'' said Nancy Pretto,
spokesperson for the NRA. ``It makes no value judgements whether
guns are good or bad. It just promotes safe behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the NRA pledged $1 million dollars to pay for more
Eddie Eagle programs and challenged the public to match the
contribution. The announcement was the NRA's answer to the Million
Mom March, which brought hundreds of thousands of people to the
National Mall to push for gun control.
</P>
<P>
   But gun-control advocates say Eddie Eagle is no benign force.
</P>
<P>
   They say his main purpose is promotional, to market guns to
children much like the cartoon character Joe Camel entices children
to smoke cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have turned away from guns. ... They are watching video
games and doing other things,'' said Josh Sugarmann(cq), executive
director of the Violence Policy Center, a Washington-based group
that supports gun control measures.
</P>
<P>
   If this trend continues, the NRA ``won't have foot soldiers for
gun-control battles that lie ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is why they need Eddie Eagle, he said: ``to perpetuate the
NRA and the firearms industry.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Pretto said the program does not promote gun use
among children, and that some people oppose the Eddie Eagle program
solely because of its association with the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like Smokey the Bear taught children not to play with
matches, this program teaches young children, don't play with
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the program is not like other public safety
programs because it doesn't warn about the risks of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie Eagle never says that guns can kill,'' said Sugarmann.
``It's like Smokey the Bear without the forest fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA says on its Web site that the program treats firearms
``simply as a fact of everyday life'' much like ``swimming pools,
electrical outlets, matchbooks and household poisons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With firearms found in about half of all American households,
it's a stance that makes sense,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   The Eddie Eagle program has reached 12 million children in every
state since 1988, according to the NRA, who says the program has
contributed to a drop in the rate of accidental shootings of
children under 14 over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   The program is mostly taught in schools and by law enforcement
agencies but has also been used by Boy Scout troops, civic groups,
and other community organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Pretto said NRA headquarters receives about 100 calls a day
requesting information about Eddie Eagle, and that the number
increases about 25 percent during the school year.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates will likely fight the proliferation of
Eddie Eagle, whose look has changed from early incarnations.
</P>
<P>
   In an early coloring book, Eddie had a harsher look, with
sharper features, a more pronounced beak and black claws on his
feet. Now, the character has soft, rounded eyebrows, wears a shirt
with his name on it and sports white high-tops.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the change is an effort to market to children and to
soften the public image of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie Eagle is the warm, friendly face of the NRA,'' Sugarmann
said.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA doesn't deny that it changed Eddie Eagle to make the
safety program more appealing to children.
</P>
<P>
   At the NRA convention last month in Charlotte, N.C., Eddie Eagle
had a definite presence. Cloth bags with his image were handed out
to conventioneers and Eddie Eagle merchandise was for sale,
including stuffed toys.
</P>
<P>
   With his profile on the rise, Eddie Eagle has been the topic of
several recent debates.
</P>
<P>
   The New York General Assembly passed a law last year which would
have allowed school districts to develop Eddie Eagle-style
programs, but the measure was later vetoed by Gov. George Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a New York City police officer angered
parents and gun-control advocates by showing an Eddie Eagle video
to fourth graders. The officer defended his actions and was not
reprimanded.
</P>
<P>
   A day before the Million Mom March, Mayor Scott King of Gary,
Ind., summed up his attitude about the Eddie Eagle program, as he
stood before a memorial wall with the names of 4,000 victims of gun
violence, including that of his nephew, who was killed last year at
the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing solutions to his city's gun violence, the NRA had
proposed bringing the gun safety program to Gary, Ind., schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about bone-headed,'' the mayor said.

 &HT;    JACKSON: A SPHINX-LIKE JUDGE SHOWS HIS TOUGHNESS
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT and JUDGE-BIOBOX. Moving in (w) Washington (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Consider the various public faces of Thomas
Penfield Jackson, the burly U.S. District Court judge who on
Wednesday threw the book at Microsoft for having flouted the
nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ From the government's perspective, Jackson surprisingly proved
to be a nearly perfect draw. In filing their case in 1998, the
Justice Department and 19 states had scant basis to believe that
Jackson would issue sweeping rulings against the mighty software
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was named to bench by President Reagan in 1982 as a
conservative Republican who a decade earlier had defended the
Watergate-tainted Nixon re-election committee. Before the Microsoft
case came along, he had handed down a host of pro-business
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   _ As Microsoft's top brass see it, Jackson's stinging rulings,
neatly written out in blue ink, grasped neither the dynamic nature
of the ``new economy'' nor the company's specific role in setting
workable worldwide standards for most personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   As he drew the landmark trial to an abrupt halt, Jackson angered
chairman and co-founder Bill Gates with his refusal to let him and
other industry leaders testify against the government's ``extreme''
breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ To journalists, who occupied most of the seats in the
Jackson's compact courtroom, the judge remains an enigmatic figure.
Once, in sharing a cab with reporters during a downpour, he said he
had tried hard to sit Sphinx-like on the bench so no one could
deduce anything from his expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson turns down interview requests, although he let three
sketch artists work from an otherwise empty jury box. He has voiced
his contempt for the press, though he is a voracious newspaper
reader and one of his daughters is a Washington-based wire service
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Within this city's close-knit legal fraternity, the
white-haired Jackson is widely viewed as a good-natured and courtly
soul who cannot abide arrogance or evasiveness in his courtroom.
Nor is he known to be overly concerned about seeing his rulings
reversed, an arena where he has run up an above-average score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls them as he sees them,'' said James Schaller, a former
law colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perspective of most antitrust observers before the
Microsoft case began is that the big monopolization case was a
swamp into which the plaintiff's theories went and never emerged
again. It was a place where the government's theories went to
die,'' noted William Kovacic, a scholar at George Washington
University Law School who followed the case closely.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping a tight scheduling grip on the trial and by sharply
limiting the number of witnesses, while still leaving time for a
vain quest for a settlement, Jackson managed to bring the most
watched business trial in decades to the appellate stage in just
over two years. This is an unprecedented feat in the long annals of
antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in most respects, Judge Jackson has done a masterful
job of structuring and managing the litigation,'' Kovacic said.
</P>
<P>
   During the 78-day trial, Jackson would sometimes go into a
Buddha-like trance, punctuated by occasional chomping on ice cubes.
But whenever he felt the situation demanded, the judge leaped into
the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Once, when a Microsoft attorney protested the government's
serialized showings of Gates's videotaped deposition, Jackson
responded: ``I think the problem is with your witness, not with the
way in which his testimony is being presented. ... It's evident to
every spectator that, for whatever reasons, in many respects Mr.
Gates has not been particularly responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's used to seeing what lawyers do, and so I guess he would
be reasonably skeptical of what they do,'' said Jake Stein, a
veteran Washington lawyer who has known Jackson for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson remains rankled by a 1996 Washingtonian magazine article
that ranked him at the bottom among 15 local federal judges.
``Attorneys say he is mean, tyrannical and doesn't know the law,''
Kim Eisler, the magazine's national editor, wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The next issue ran a letter of protest, signed by 26 of his
former law clerks, labeling the piece ``blood sport'' and praising
Jackson as a fair-minded jurist.
</P>
<P>
   Even critics concede that Jackson knows his way about town. He
lives in a high-rise condominium on the edge of Georgetown. In good
weather, he often strolls five miles to the federal courthouse,
across Pennsylvania Avenue from the National Gallery of Art.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in suburban Maryland in 1937, the son of a
well-respected attorney, Thomas Searing Jackson, who co-founded a
firm, Jackson &AMP; Campbell, that still bears the family name.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson attended St. Albans School (where he sang in the choir
until his voice changed) and graduated from Dartmouth.
Subsequently, he served a three-year stint as a naval officer,
mainly aboard a destroyer in the Mediterranean. From Harvard Law
School, he joined his father's firm, where he specialized in
defending doctors accused of malpractice before moving to a
lifetime appointment on the federal bench.

 &HT;    JACKSON: A SPHINX-LIKE JUDGE SHOWS HIS TOUGHNESS
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT and JUDGE-BIOBOX. Moving in (w) Washington (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Consider the various public faces of Thomas
Penfield Jackson, the burly U.S. District Court judge who on
Wednesday threw the book at Microsoft for having flouted the
nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   _ From the government's perspective, Jackson surprisingly proved
to be a nearly perfect draw. In filing their case in 1998, the
Justice Department and 19 states had scant basis to believe that
Jackson would issue sweeping rulings against the mighty software
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was named to bench by President Reagan in 1982 as a
conservative Republican who a decade earlier had defended the
Watergate-tainted Nixon re-election committee. Before the Microsoft
case came along, he had handed down a host of pro-business
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   _ As Microsoft's top brass see it, Jackson's stinging rulings,
neatly written out in blue ink, grasped neither the dynamic nature
of the ``new economy'' nor the company's specific role in setting
workable worldwide standards for most personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   As he drew the landmark trial to an abrupt halt, Jackson angered
chairman and co-founder Bill Gates with his refusal to let him and
other industry leaders testify against the government's ``extreme''
breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ To journalists, who occupied most of the seats in the
Jackson's compact courtroom, the judge remains an enigmatic figure.
Once, in sharing a cab with reporters during a downpour, he said he
had tried hard to sit Sphinx-like on the bench so no one could
deduce anything from his expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson turns down interview requests, although he let three
sketch artists work from an otherwise empty jury box. He has voiced
his contempt for the press, though he is a voracious newspaper
reader and one of his daughters is a Washington-based wire service
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Within this city's close-knit legal fraternity, the
white-haired Jackson is widely viewed as a good-natured and courtly
soul who cannot abide arrogance or evasiveness in his courtroom.
Nor is he known to be overly concerned about seeing his rulings
reversed, an arena where he has run up an above-average score.
</P>
<P>
   ``He calls them as he sees them,'' said James Schaller, a former
law colleague.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perspective of most antitrust observers before the
Microsoft case began is that the big monopolization case was a
swamp into which the plaintiff's theories went and never emerged
again. It was a place where the government's theories went to
die,'' noted William Kovacic, a scholar at George Washington
University Law School who followed the case closely.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping a tight scheduling grip on the trial and by sharply
limiting the number of witnesses, while still leaving time for a
vain quest for a settlement, Jackson managed to bring the most
watched business trial in decades to the appellate stage in just
over two years. This is an unprecedented feat in the long annals of

</P>
<P>
   ``I think in most respects, Judge Jackson has done a masterful

   Rick Lazio is even with Hillary Clinton in their Senate race,
just as Republican predecessor, Rudy Giuliani, was when he dropped
out of the contest last month, according to a poll released today.
Lazio and Clinton were each favored by 44 percent of voters in the
Quinnipiac University survey. That compares to a poll released May
16 with Clinton at 44 percent and Giuliani at 43 percent. ``It's
becoming obvious that the more people get to know Rick, the more
they like him,'' said Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan.
</P>
<P>
   `ELDERCARE' ON THE AGENDA
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was promoting his ``eldercare'' initiative today in Palm
Springs, Calif., at the start of a three-day campaigning and
fund-raising sweep up the West Coast. His proposal is a $30
billion, 10-year program of tax credits, Medicaid coverage and
other aid to help families care for elderly relatives. At the core
are a $3,000-a-year tax credit for families providing long-term
care at home for an elderly or disabled relative, and a grant
program for communities to provide adult day care and respite care
to give stressed-out caregivers an occasional break.
</P>
<P>
   GORE AD BLITZ STARTING
</P>
<P>
   An ad featuring Al Gore discussing prescription drug coverage
and his efforts to get medicine to seniors will hit TV airwaves in
15 states Thursday in the Democratic National Committee's
multimillion-dollar campaign to boost its presidential candidate.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee was finalizing an ad
campaign of its own, but holding its fire for at least a few days,
hoping to pound home their contention that Gore broke a pledge not
to run this sort of ad.
</P>
<P>
   GETTING ALL WIRED UP
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party is trying to shake up the election process in
yet another way, planning to hold the first nationwide online
presidential primary. ABC News reports that the party has been in
talks with Seattle-based eBallot to administer the primary on the
Internet. Gerry Moan, the Reform Party's national vice chair, said
he expects the deal to be finalized soon. Officials at eBallot
declined to comment. As plans now stand, registered voters could
cast their ballots via computer or regular mail in advance of the
nominating convention in August.
</P>
<P>
   GOT THE MONEY? WHAT THE HECK
</P>
<P>
   Ex-investment banker Jon Corzine easily defeated former Gov. Jim
Florio for the New Jersey Democratic Senate nomination, and refused
to talk about the record-shattering $34 million he spent to win it
_ or how much more he'll spend through November. Instead, Corzine
wanted to talk about spending money on domestic programs. His
Republican opponent will be Rep. Bob Franks, who turned aside three
other candidates. Corzine won't have to scrimp on lunches any time
soon; he's still worth pretty close to $400 million.
</P>
<P>
   11 COMMANDMENT: BE SURE TO WIN
</P>
<P>
   Roy Moore, the Alabama county circuit judge who fought to keep
the Ten Commandments displayed in his courtroom, defeated three
opponents in the Republican primary for chief justice of the state
Supreme Court by enough of a margin to avoid a runoff. In November,
he'll face appeals court Judge Sharon Yates, who was unopposed in
the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   PRIMARIES IN MONTANA . . .
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, State Auditor Mark O'Keefe won the Democratic
nomination for governor and will face Republican Lt. Gov. Judy
Martz in November. Farmer Brian Schweitzer, whose battle cry was
higher prescription drug prices on his side of the Canadian border,
won the Democratic nod for the Senate and will take on Republican
Conrad Burns, trying for a third term.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND IN IOWA . . .
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, lawyer Jay Marcus won GOP nomination to face Democratic
Rep. Leonard Boswell. Democrat Bob Simpson, an advocate for the
disabled who has worked for the Legislature, advanced to a November
challenge against 12-term Republican Rep. Jim Leach.
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND IN NEW MEXICO AND SOUTH DAKOTA . . .
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Bill Redmond, who had served briefly in Congress,
won a three-way GOP race for the Senate nomination to face
Democratic incumbent Jeff Bingaman. And in South Dakota, Democrat
Curt Hohn, manager of a water pipeline, won a three-way primary and
will take on two-term Republican Rep. John Thune, the state's lone
House member.
</P>
<P>
   BUT DON'T THEY MAKE EXCEPTIONS FOR A `10'?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood actors who identify themselves as Republicans are
worried their party affiliation might affect their careers. Bo
Derek for one. ``Lurking behind Tinseltown's closed doors, paranoid
members of the GOP are bolting to the exits,'' afraid their
``liberal co-workers will wreck their dreams of stardom and
success,'' the New York Post quoted her as saying.``They are very
adamant and almost militant about their views. It's tough to have a
nice, open conversation of any kind. People get really angry, and
they treat me as though I'm some hateful monster.''
</P>
<P>
   MASSACHUSETTS HURDLE CLEARED
</P>
<P>
   A Republican whose campaign against Sen. Ted Kennedy has been
plagued by trouble officially won a spot on the November ballot.
The Massachusetts secretary of state's office approved 10,139
nominating signatures for Jack E. Robinson, slightly more than the
10,000 he needed. The state's top Republicans withdrew their
support for Robinson, a black businessman who made a fortune in
telecommunications, after embarrassing details of his past were
revealed: a drunken driving arrest (he eventually was cleared), and
an ex-girlfriend taking out a restraining order against him.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSING _ IN GENERAL TERMS
</P>
<P>
   In his first policy speech since he officially began his Senate
run in New York, Rick Lazio told a mayors' conference in Saratoga
Springs that he would continue to back federally supported housing
and community development programs, but offered no new proposals of
his own. He said his philosophy for housing and economic
development includes partnerships between the private sector and
the government to finance and manage programs. Lazio also vowed
support for federal programs that help first-time homebuyers and
the homeless move into permanent housing.
</P>
<P>
   ENCROACHING ON HILLARY STRONGHOLD
</P>
<P>
   Black voters traditionally favor Democrats, and Hillary Clinton
is predicted to win at least 90 percent of the black vote in her
Senate race against Rick Lazio. But New York's black voters are
still making up their minds, and a new Zogby poll finds that Lazio
is doing better than Rudy Giuliani had among the state's 1.2
million black voters. Lazio has increased his support among black
voters to 8 percent, according to the poll, four times what
Giuliani scored before bowing out last month.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOUND OF `SCALIA-THOMAS'
</P>
<P>
   It's assumed that the next president will get to name one or two
justices to a Supreme Court that now decides controversial issues
by one vote. If George W. Bush wins, Democratic thinking goes,
chances are he'd appoint justices cut from the same cloth as its
two most visible conservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
And so their names, uttered condescendingly in one breath, may well
become a campaign catch phrase, the latest Democratic rallying cry:
``Scalia-Thomas.''
</P>
<P>
   FRIENDLIER DISAGREEMENT
</P>
<P>
   The quadrennial wrangling over the Republican Party abortion
platform may not be as bitter this time. Wisconsin Gov. Tommy
Thompson, head of the platform committee, told party activists who
support abortion rights that GOP leaders plan no change in the
strong anti-abortion language and no public hearings on the issue.
Still, Susan Cullman, co-chair of the Republican Pro-choice
Coalition, said she was encouraged by the friendly tone of the
meeting, when Thompson promised them ample private opportunities to
air their views. Cullman: ``This is the beginning of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   THERE, THAT PROVES IT
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush says the U.S. Supreme Court decision throwing out
a Texas inmate's death sentence proves the system works. The high
court ordered a new sentencing hearing for convicted killer Victor
Hugo Saldano after prosecutors conceded his death sentence was
based in part on the fact that he is Hispanic. Bush: ``I think it's
an indication that there are safeguards in the system. ... As I
understand the facts, there is no question that the man did the
crime. It's the penalty phase that needs to be examined. I think
the system is working.''
</P>
<P>
   OPPONENT? AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE?
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore might be understandably obsessed with George W. Bush,
given that the two are battling for the big prize. But these days,
Gore isn't even mentioning Bush's name. In fact, the name ``Bush''
has not passed Gore's lips since May 26, at least in public. During
an interview this week with WSEE-TV in Erie, Pa., Gore referred to
his opponent as ``the other side,'' and on WIFR-TV in Rockford,
Ill., Gore's reference was to ``the other fellow.'' Chris Lehane,
Gore's press secretary, says that for now Gore will appear to be in
this race all by himself _ ``to guarantee that the focus stays
where it should be.''

A DECADE ON, A PIONEER OF RUSSIAN CAPITALISM STILL HAS HIS DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VOLOGDA, Russia _ When this newspaper last looked in on Viktor
Kuzmin, an aeon ago in 1990, Russia was still the Soviet Union. And
Kuzmin, 45, a brash, elfin rebel, was kicking hard at its tottering
legs.
</P>
<P>
   An unrepentant capitalist in a communist state, Kuzmin seemed
destined for greatness, or maybe prison. He was building his own
10,000-square-foot home, a shocking act for someone not even a
Communist Party member. He had subverted state curbs on ownership
by declaring himself a business. He ran his own construction
company and planned to start an investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   He also had gotten himself certified by a doctor as sane,
thwarting local apparatchiks who had summoned him for a psychiatric
examination _ a first step toward the mental hospitals then used to
silence troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old authorities consider me dangerous,'' he boasted, in an
article in The New York Times. ``And, of course, they are right.
Anyone independent is a threat to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Such nose-thumbing at communism's arthritic creed was news
enough back then to make The Times. Today it seems almost quaint.
It is no longer news that capitalism triumphed in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It would nevertheless have been nice to report that Capitalist
Kuzmin triumphed with it. But when the newspaper caught up with him
recently, intent on chewing nearly a decade of post-Soviet fat, his
first words made clear that the facts were otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just laughing today,'' he said, not laughing at all.
``All of us have two higher education degrees, degrees from two
institutions. But our country is such that we have to dig to make a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   In a still-unfinished dirt-floor room in his
still-mostly-roofless house, Kuzmin stood with two sweaty
colleagues. There was no tie on his frayed-at-the-collar shirt.
Instead of a cellular phone, he was grasping a shovel. He was
digging holes in the floor for his latest and considerably less
grandiose business venture, a one-saw sawmill.
</P>
<P>
   There is surely no shame in that. But even he allows that a
shovel is a far cry from what was wrested from his grasp just a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A quick diversion: Viktor Kuzmin is not your ordinary Ivan. He
has two pony-sized guard dogs, a fence plastered with warning
signs, a sawed-off shotgun under his desk and, for some reason, a
dump truck and a brand-new Volvo station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Kuzmin manse, on a glorious, sweeping bend of the Vologda
River, is equally eccentric. His first unfinished house, which he
began in 1987, stands next to the foundation of a second unfinished
house, under construction because House Number One was turned over
to the sawmill, an auto-repair shop and other speculative ventures.
</P>
<P>
   A short walk away, on a plot with the best river view, stands
House Number Three, a tiny wooden bungalow that serves as home
until Houses One and Two are, one hopes, finished.
</P>
<P>
   The place is a metaphor for Kuzmin, a man so tossed by
brainstorms that the latest great scheme is as likely as not to be
tossed by the roadside to accommodate the next. People think he is
strange, said an official of Vologda's regional government. They
are right.
</P>
<P>
   But he is neither crazy nor stupid. At 55, he is an accomplished
architect, an engineer, a self-taught lawyer and, albeit a bit
loquacious, an eloquent advocate for the new Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, you might be a bit strange too, if your story was like
his:
</P>
<P>
   In December 1990, Kuzmin quit a state construction company in
disgust after refusing a demand that he join the Communist Party.
It was a good move: soon, his own building firm had a payroll of 30
people. And by bartering his talents, he had acquired the loveliest
eight acres of a riverside collective farm, where he dug a pond and
began erecting his mansion. There would be arched windows, he said,
and a gymnasium, two greenhouses, workshops and a sheep-breeding
pen.
</P>
<P>
   For a man despised by the authorities, life was pretty good. And
when communism collapsed a year later, things seemed fated to get
better. Kuzmin had his defenders, mostly progressive city officials
who saw opportunity in democracy and the free market.
</P>
<P>
   When an ambitious plan emerged to restore 85 acres of riverfront
construction in this pleasant if slightly homely city of 300,000,
near the site of its founding in 1417, they asked him to execute
it.
</P>
<P>
   Kuzmin immersed himself. He spent a year in Moscow researching
architecture and history. He drafted a plan adorning the city's
squares with new and restored buildings and a rebuilt historic
cathedral. He worked out financing with a Soviet-U.S. venture, and
courted European bankers. He started a company to promote travel
across Russia's northwest, recruited foreign agencies to promote it
and built cabins for Vologda sightseers.
</P>
<P>
   The whole project took on the aroma of serious money. Which in
Russia, in the early 1990s, was a serious mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Kuzmin says his fairy tale lost its gossamer wings in 1992, when
local officials demanded that he build them five cottages in
exchange for their political support. He told them where to get
off.

   ``I said `Where's the money?''' he recalled. ``And they said to
take it where you can; they didn't care. But I never compromised my
conscience. I'm stubborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Retribution was swift. Official support for the project began to
evaporate. When Kuzmin discovered a deputy had taken project money
to build himself a home, he angrily razed its foundation _ and got
arrested. The deputy went scot-free. Kuzmin was fined $30,000 and
given a three-year suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhail Korachev, then and now the region's director of historic
preservation, testified in Kuzmin's defense. Soon, his home was
firebombed. So was Kuzmin's downtown office, where he was directing
the restoration, his travel program and a yet another venture to
sell tourists Russian handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the city seized his 85-acre development, saying it had
failed to materialize. Without the restoration project, his tourism
venture collapsed. His handicrafts business had been firebombed.
His payroll shrank from 30 to two.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, several corrupt officials in the restoration project
did go to jail. The region's governor and a deputy were
investigated, though never prosecuted. It is all cold comfort to
Kuzmin, who has moved from international banking and real-estate to
turning out finished planks for other builders.
</P>
<P>
   He still hoards his plans and architectural drawings,
magnificent panels depicting riverfront architecture done up in a
canary yellow peculiar to Russian buildings, propped for a visitor
this week against the stray cables and broken bricks of Home Number
Two.
</P>
<P>
   ``My pride and my pain,'' he said. ``My great pain.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he is still a capitalist _ that he does not blame
capitalism, because capitalism really never made it to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in office now,'' he said, ``are the same people who
were in office when communism was here. They just moved chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuzmin walked a few yards to a bluff overlooking the broad
river. A mile away, the spires and onion domes of the
Spassapreluski Monastery, newly gilded 600 years after their
creation, rose from the plain, gleaming like some breathtaking
Russian Oz.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only spot in Vologda like this,'' he said, and
fingered the buds of a nearby scrawny bush. ``I planted these apple
trees. I dug that pond.'' The whirring of the gears between his
ears was almost audible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work on that pond,'' he said. ``We're going to put
expensive fish there, you know. It will be a great place for
fishermen.''

CAMCORDERS ALLOW A STEADY SHOT, EVEN WITHOUT A STEADY HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By ROY FURCHGOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although jittery, frenetic images were the height of film
artistry in the early '90s, it isn't a good technique for
immortalizing your 10-year-old's first soccer goal on videotape.
And therein lies a problem. As camcorders have become smaller and
lighter, with greater zoom capabilities, they have magnified the
operator's tiniest tremors. Even breathing can result in a jerky
image.
</P>
<P>
   But the camcorder industry has responded with technology that
can reduce the jiggle. Digital equipment can read a recorded image
and make adjustments to compensate for movement, while mechanical
optical systems can keep an image centered and in focus by using
motion sensors that move the lens to counter unwanted motion.
</P>
<P>
   The problem isn't unique to the camcorder industry. Hollywood
filmmakers have long struggled to move cameras without introducing
unwanted quivers into the picture. Movie makers often put a camera
on a heavy dolly that rolls on smooth railroad-like tracks. ``This
has always been a difficulty,'' said Robert Dickson, a historian
with the American Film Institute. ``The camera has to be pushed
carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Cinematographers began to experience the problems that would
face home video enthusiasts when lighter-weight cameras, about 35
pounds, began to replace their 80-to-110-pound predecessors in the
early 1970s. John Hora, a cinematographer, said he confronted the
problem on ``The Twilight Zone,'' a movie made in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see a little motion if you look right at the edge of
the frame,'' Hora said. In later movies, he went back to heavier
equipment. ``If you run over a little piece of tape on the track
with a heavy piece of equipment, you won't feel it,'' he said.
``It's like being in a Cadillac and hitting a bump _ you float
right over it. A lighter unit is like a sports car _ you'd feel the
bump.'' And see it as well.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the handheld shot created more trouble for
camera operators, who had to develop a gliding Groucho-style walk
to keep from shaking the camera. ``You have to walk with your knees
bent,'' Hora said. ``There's a real skill to it.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed with the Steadicam, a system that suspends a camera
on spring-loaded arms that are attached to a vest worn by a camera
operator. But even the amateur version of the Steadicam costs more
than $1,300.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the home camcorder industry recognized the
shaky-picture problem. Cameras had become so light that hand
tremors would move them; older, heavier models were substantial
enough that a slight tremble wouldn't be noticeable. And longer
lenses made the problem worse. The farther away the subject and the
greater the magnification, the narrower the field of vision. And
just as a small error at the rifle leads to bigger and bigger
errors as targets are farther and farther away, clearing your
throat will appear as an earthquake when you are recording on
videotape at a magnification of 22X.
</P>
<P>
   But the industry came up with a digital solution about 1996.
That is to let the lens illuminate just a portion of the
camcorder's imaging chip. When the camera moves, the whole frame
changes position on the chip, but it still registers in its
entirety. The camera's computer picks a fixed point in the picture,
like the outside edge of the frame, then stabilizes that edge as a
fixed point on the recording.
</P>
<P>
   But the system is fallible. ``You are not sensing motion on the
part of the camera,'' said Mark Weir, product planning manager for
digital imaging at Sony Electronics. ``You are seeing how the image
is changing and assuming its motion.'' If the camera is perfectly
still and a hand is waved past it quickly, it might pan to the
side, changing the frame, because it assumes that the camera has
moved and tries to keep the image of the hand still and at the
center.
</P>
<P>
   The most accurate variation uses a complex moving prism to keep
the image centered, similar to the method used by some telescopes
to compensate for atmospheric distortion. A mechanism typical of
camcorders is Canon's variable-angle prism, which is actually a
pair of prisms that move in relation to each other to change the
spot where the image is projected onto the chip. The movement of
the prisms is controlled by actuators that get signals from a
microcomputer that monitors motion, direction and intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The prism movement adjusts for any shaking of the camcorder,
smoothing out even distant shots. It tends to produce a more
accurate, clearer picture than digital correction, but at a price.
Digital motion correction adds about $100 to the price of a
camcorder, Weir said, but the optical correction adds close to
$300.

VIRUSES COULD HAVE YOUR NUMBER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNE EISENBERG    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as the world is learning to cope with computer viruses and
worms, sophisticated cell phones have become a target of malicious,
or at least mischievous, computer code.
</P>
<P>
   This week in Spain, some people looked at their mobile phones
and found a message protesting the policies of a Spanish
telecommunications operator, Telefonica. The message they saw began
life as an e-mail attachment on a computer. Once the message was
opened, it sent itself to everyone in the address book of the
computer owner, and the cycle repeated over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spanish message had a second, unusual aspect: it made
its way not only to address books, but also to a phone gateway in
Spain, then to some cell phones, which displayed the text message.
The incident was reported on Tuesday by F-Secure Corp., a company
based in Espoo, Finland, that provides security for cell phones,
personal digital assistants, laptops and other computer devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many cell phones are capable of receiving short text messages,
here as well as in Europe,'' said Dr. Steven M. Bellovin, a network
security researcher at AT&AMP;T Laboratories in Florham Park, N.J. The
phone was not taken over by the virus; the only result was an
annoying message. ``It's not doing anything to the phone,''
Bellovin said. ``It's just doing something to the user.''
</P>
<P>
   But more serious viruses affecting cell phones and PDA's may
well emerge. Most mobile phones sold in the United States today are
fairly simple devices that offer no home for a serious virus. But
as more phones become programmable and capable of communicating
with the Internet and downloading information, there will be more
opportunities for computer viruses and worms to erase or steal
telephone numbers and cause other damage.
</P>
<P>
   Bellovin said that with more advanced phones, ``any kind of
`malware' _ malware is a slang expression in computer security for
malicious code _ can be injected into the phone to alter or destroy
its functions.'' Malware can strip the owner's conversations of
privacy, Bellovin said. ``It strikes me as entirely possible to use
the virus to bug people,'' he said, sketching a future in which a
hacker could silently reprogram a person's phone to dial a set of
numbers, turning that phone into an open mike without the user'
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Even simpler, Bellovin said, would be injecting programs into
the phone that would locate the last few phone numbers dialed
because those numbers would still be sitting in memory. ``The
program can gather that information up and send it back on the
Internet to anyone who wants to spy on your list of last calls,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   PDA's may be even more vulnerable to viruses, some researchers
say. ``PDA's are closer to the edge,'' said David M. Chess, a
member of the research staff at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research
Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y. He pointed out that while most
programming in cell phones was fixed in read-only memory burned in
at the factory, making it harder for viruses to find places to
live, ``PDA's do have RAM, and you could in theory get a virus.''
</P>
<P>
   Theory has become fact for one university researcher, Dr. Simon
Foley, a senior lecturer in computer science at University College
in Cork, Ireland. He has shown in recent experiments that viruses
can be created in PDA's.
</P>
<P>
   Foley and his group looked specifically at how easy it would be
to create and propagate malicious code with one type of PDA, a Palm
organizer. ``We concluded that within the Palm handheld itself,
there is no defense against malicious attack,'' he said. Foley
presented his conclusions at the Institute for Electrical and
Electronic Engineers' Symposium on Security and Privacy, held in
Oakland, Calif., on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   The attack could be as simple as changing telephone numbers or
making the device stay on continuously, Foley said. ``We found that
it is easy to create a catastrophic failure where the virus
destroys all the data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Foley also found that it was more difficult to propagate a
virus from one Palm device to another. ``As you make it easier for
people to share data between Palms,'' he said, ``then of course the
potential for the viruses and descendants of viruses increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabriel Acosta-Lopez, senior director of platform alliances and
partner services at Palm Inc., pointed out that ``there is no known
virus anywhere reported so far for Palm.'' If one appears, the
company will be ready to respond, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As PDA's become as capable as the current generation of desktop
computers and cell phones become as capable as the current crop of
PDA's, users will inevitably confront viruses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be up to the owners,'' said Rick Kemper, director of
wireless technology and security for the Cellular
Telecommunications Industry Association in Washington. ``Owners
will need to do good detective work at the front end as the
messages are coming through.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep PDA's from infection, Foley suggested that users avoid
direct exchanges of data between handheld devices and make regular
backups on desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Are manufacturers' aware of the dangers? ``Often people release
their systems,'' Foley said, ``get people to adopt them and then
worry about security.''
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson is one cell phone manufacturer that says it is aware of
the problem of infection. Jan Dellmark, the company's solutions
product manager in Stockholm, said, ``We will build security into
the models that will come.''

REVIVING A FORGOTTEN MILLER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the film and television empire of Southern
California, with the largest talent pool of actors in the world,
legitimate theater is by definition a supporting player. But
between the extremes of the established regional stages and tiny
theatrical groups struggling to survive are a number of surprising
success stories. The Antaeus Co. is one of these.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1991 as a research and study group for classically
trained actors who had strayed from the stage into film and
television, Antaeus (the name derives from the mythical wrestler)
has 70 members, 60 of whom are actors. The roster includes familiar
faces, though many of the names are less well known. But regular
theatergoers will doubtless recognize Douglas Sills, Lillian
Garrett-Groag, Harry Groener and John Vickery, all of whom are
members.
</P>
<P>
   Though the group has mounted only a handful of plays in the last
10 years, its efforts have earned it a loyal following. It is this
audience that has helped the company's latest production, a revival
of Arthur Miller's first commercially produced play, ``The Man Who
Had All the Luck,'' to extend its run twice. It is now scheduled to
close on June 25. Critical comment has been favorable, and a notice
in Time magazine generated the sort of buzz that most Los Angeles
theaters only dream about.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's fablelike drama flopped when it opened on Broadway in
1944. The playwright himself calls it ``a strange play, an
abstraction.'' But the work has long struck Dan Fields, a director
and producer, as ripe for revival. Fields was a young literary
assistant at the Seattle Repertory Theater when he happened upon
Miller's play 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't read anything like this from Miller before,'' Fields
recalled, ``and its themes spoke to my own life questions: does a
man have control of his fate or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, on a visit to Los Angeles, he called an actor friend,
Paul Gutrecht, who had recently joined Antaeus. Fields knew of the
company and its reputation. While studying at UCLA in 1995, he had
seen a well-received Antaeus production of Chekhov's ``Wood Demon''
at the Mark Taper Forum. Fields thought Gutrecht would be ideal for
the lead role in Miller's play, that of a young man blessed beyond
his, and everyone else's, comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially allegorical, ``The Man Who Had All the Luck''
follows the progress of David Beeves as he makes his way through a
mostly ordinary Depression-era life. But the rough spots in his
path have an uncanny habit of disappearing. When his fiancee's
father blocks David's marriage, a ``lucky'' automobile accident
removes him from the scene. When the state decides to build a
highway, it runs right past David's gas station. As others fail, he
seemingly inexplicably prospers.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has not seen the production, said by telephone from
his home in Connecticut that the play deals with a universal
concern: ``Am I being watched or am I just a freewheeling atom in
the universe?'' The theme, he added, was not properly explored when
the play had its debut. ``They didn't know what to do with it in
1944,'' Miller said. ``Frankly, neither did I. And the critics
couldn't dig it. That's why it was basically discarded.''
</P>
<P>
   The play, directed by Fields, is being presented at a converted
power station in the shadow of the old MGM lot in Culver City. But
Antaeus is establishing a permanent home in North Hollywood,
converting a warehouse into a 99-seat theater with a thrust stage.
Dakin Matthews, the managing director of Antaeus, bought the
property for $850,000 and is leasing it to the company. He said the
troupe might take up residence in what will be known as the New
Place Studio Theater by the fall of next year. The move marks
another addition to the NoHo Arts District, an area of commercial
redevelopment that has the support of the city's business and arts
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews gave credit to Gutrecht _ who did get the title role in
``The Man Who Had All the Luck'' _ for starting the process that
has brought Antaeus its greatest success thus far. ``None of us had
heard of the script,'' Matthews said. ``We felt it was an
undiscovered classic. And one of the things we like to do here is
unearth buried treasure.''

 &HT;    Women's meeting can lift standards
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ While families throughout the Western world are
happily attending graduation ceremonies for relatives who have
completed milestones in their educational careers, some 110 million
of the world's children have nothing to celebrate because they
never entered school this year. Two-thirds of those uneducated
children are girls.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why the United Nations meeting on women this
week, a follow-up to the 1995 Beijing conference, is so important.
Giving educational opportunity to girls and women has proven to be
the key to lifting living standards and strengthening families. And
that includes sex education for young girls.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the follow-up conference is to expedite action on
the goals agreed upon by 189 nations. The most important of those
are education for women and girls, ending sexual exploitation and
violence against women, providing access to medical care and
enhancing job opportunities. To most of us in the Western world,
those goals seem innocuous enough.
</P>
<P>
   But the Vatican and some conservative Muslim nations have
continued to work for removal of the crucial landmark declaration
that women have sexual rights independent of men. In closed door
meetings in New York, representatives of Algeria, Iran, Libya and
Pakistan _ countries with the fewest educational opportunities for
women _ tried to weaken the commitment to sexual rights for women
and sex education for adolescent girls. You'd think they would be
focusing instead on the worldwide prostitution trade that preys on
young women from developing nations _ and that is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it is unlikely those benighted voices will prevail.
There is a new generation of women leaders from Africa, Latin
America, the Caribbean and Asia who are insisting on their
fundamental human rights. Calling for an end to the tedious debates
over what ``access to health care'' means in relation to abortion,
Joana Foster, a Zimbabwean who heads Women in Law and Development
in Africa, said, ``African women think debates over nuances and
language are a waste of time.'' She pointed to women's political
gains in Namibia where 44 percent local government system is now
comprised of women and new laws have been enacted against female
genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
   Her message is right on. Speeding up implementation of the
Beijing agenda may be the most effective worldwide human rights
effort in which the United States can engage.

</P>
<P>
   ABE. By Richard Slotkin. (Holt, $27.50.) A nervy historical

life in early-19th-century America.
</P>
<P>
   AFTERBURN. By Colin Harrison. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25.)
Elegant prose and exact description keep this thriller flying with

``The English Patient'' sets his new novel amid the ravages of the
Sri Lankan war.
</P>
<P>
   BEING DEAD. By Jim Crace. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $21.)

how they became so and forward to watch them decompose.
</P>
<P>
   BEOWULF: A New Verse Translation. By Seamus Heaney. (Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, $25.) The Irish poet and Nobel laureate's faithful
rendering of the Anglo-Saxon epic is a distinguished work in its
own right, capturing much of the sound of the original (which is
printed on the facing pages).
</P>
<P>
   THE BINDING CHAIR: Or, A Visit From the Foot Emancipation
Society. By Kathryn Harrison. (Random House, $24.95.) A resonant,
elaborately constructed novel that renders the lives of two women,
an aunt deformed physically and morally by tradition and her
overtly rebellious niece.
</P>
<P>
   BLONDE. By Joyce Carol Oates. (Ecco/HarperCollins, $27.50.) A
fat, messy, fierce and audacious novel that ventures to propose a
plausible interior world for Marilyn Monroe: like the original,
Oates's Monroe fascinates above all because of her perpetual victim
status.
</P>
<P>
   BLUE ANGEL. By Francine Prose. (HarperCollins, $25.) The sexes
and the generations no longer speak in this high comic novel in
which a middle-aged professor is the target of the student he
supposes he is exploiting.
</P>
<P>
   THE BLUE BEDSPREAD. By Raj Kamal Jha. (Random House, $21.95.) A
first novel whose narrator lives a barren existence among the 12
million strangers in Calcutta, writing down (and cleaning up) the
family past for the sake of his conscience and his dead sister's
baby.
</P>
<P>
   A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER. By David Liss. (Random House, $25.) This
engaging first novel traps a mixed bag of characters in the

crash in the English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   THE DANISH GIRL. By David Ebershoff. (Viking, $24.95.) An
arresting first novel whose hero, a landscape painter, discovers
the woman within him one day in 1925; the six-year journey toward
surgical and psychological transformation (with the help of his
wife) dramatizes and affirms the endless adaptability of love.
</P>
<P>
   DIAMOND DUST: Stories. By Anita Desai. (Mariner/Houghton
Mifflin, paper, $12.) A rewarding collection by an Indian writer
who uses food as a metaphor for the offering or withholding of
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   THE DRESS LODGER. By Sheri Holman. (Atlantic Monthly, $24.) This
historical novel, deep in its research and vivid in its
imagination, links a 15-year-old prostitute, a surgeon and a
journalist in the darker byways of the Industrial Revolution in
provincial England in 1831.
</P>
<P>
   ENGLISH PASSENGERS. By Matthew Kneale. (Nan A. Talese/Doubleday,

on his ship.
</P>
<P>
   EQUAL LOVE: Stories. By Peter Ho Davies. (Houghton Mifflin,

</P>
<P>
   THE FEAST OF LOVE. By Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A
luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He (a handsome
toad-like man) and She (Ex-Wife No. 1) unspool contrary narratives
of their life together, with cameos by Ex-Wife No. 2 and a pair of
love-drunk slackers.
</P>
<P>
   THE GATES OF THE ALAMO. By Stephen Harrigan. (Knopf, $25.) A
comprehensive historical novel that uses its space to tell the
story from both the Mexican and Texan sides through a rotating cast
of mainly fictional characters.
</P>
<P>
   GERTRUDE AND CLAUDIUS. By John Updike. (Knopf, $23.) A
free-standing, pleasurable, dexterous novel by a writer who fears
nothing on earth; it ends where Shakespeare's play begins.
</P>
<P>
   THE GOODLIFE. By Keith Scribner. (Riverhead, $23.95.) A novel
that ponders why crime stories so fascinate us while telling a
hair-raising tale of a kidnapping gone wrong, using five narrative
points of view without ever getting confused.
</P>
<P>
   HORSE HEAVEN. By Jane Smiley. (Knopf, $26.) The racing horses in
this spirited novel, which is thoroughly immersed in the anecdotes
and arcana of the track, are every bit as involved in
self-discovery as their human companions.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSE OF LEAVES. By Mark Z. Danielewski. (Pantheon, cloth, $40;
paper, $19.95.) A funny, moving, elaborate first novel in which a
common dream becomes the medium of a peculiarly moral confrontation
with fear and trembling.
</P>
<P>
   THE HUMAN STAIN. By Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The
novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man
passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white. Our old friend Nathan
Zuckerman tells his story, which explores the freighted border
between transformation and trespass.
</P>
<P>
   HUNTS IN DREAMS. By Tom Drury. (Houghton Mifflin, $22.) A sequel
to ``The End of Vandalism'' set in the same bleak farm community,
this novel centers on the ex-vandal, now a plumber (gone straight
more from detachment than maturity), as he confronts the breakup of
his marriage. &QL;

   &UR; FICTION &AMP; POETRY _ CONTINUED &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   IN AMERICA. By Susan Sontag. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $26.) A
daring novel in which, off and on, narrator merges with author and
history with imagination in the career of a grand 19th-century
Polish actress who knocks 'em dead in California.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE FALL. By Jeffrey Lent. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) Yes, a
wounded soldier walks home from the Civil War, but this novel
emerges from the shadow of ``Cold Mountain'' to tell of the hero's
marriage to a runaway slave and their family's disturbing legacy.
</P>
<P>
   IN THE GLOAMING: Stories. By Alice Elliott Dark. (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, $23.) The tone in these stories is muted, mannerly,
controlled _ and so are the people in them, until traditional
habits intersect with unpredictable contemporary life, leaving the
characters in seas they can't navigate.
</P>
<P>
   JERSEY RAIN. By Robert Pinsky. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $21.) A
sensitive, inquisitive mind, uninjured by belonging to the poet
laureate, works in discursive modes in poems that ruminate on the
virtues of public and private life.
</P>
<P>
   THE LAST DANCE: A Novel of the 87th Precinct. By Ed McBain.
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25.) The 50th installment in this celebrated
series of police procedurals shows that McBain remains at the top
of his form.
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING HUMAN: Selected Poems. By Les Murray. (Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $27.) A cosmopolitan temperament sharpens nativisms and
traditional forms in the expansive, energetic work of the closest
thing Australia can offer just now to a truly national poet.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTNING ON THE SUN. By Robert Bingham. (Doubleday, $23.95.) A
pair of privileged young Americans take on a hopeless caper,
intending to outsmart some Cambodian drug lords; the author, dead
last year at 33 of what looked like a heroin overdose, had a
satiric talent that will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   THE LONG HOME. By William Gay. (MacMurray &AMP; Beck, $24.95.) This
first novelist fears no theme, however large; its good versus evil
in Faulkner territory, and good succeeds only when it's better
armed than evil and willing to exert violence.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE BELIEVE. By Joanna Scott. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) Scott's
fifth novel, full of admirable narrative tricks, centers on a
3-year-old boy for whom the author miraculously finds an
appropriate voice to register the custody fight conducted over him
by his dead parents' parents.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAN WHO WROTE THE BOOK. By Erik Tarloff. (Crown, $23.)
Dead-ended at a jerkwater college, the scholar hero of this riotous
novel strikes pseudonymous pay dirt as a pornographer: his magnum
opus, ``Every Inch a Lady,'' out-Potters Potter and draws a glowing
notice _ by John Updike yet _ in this very book review.
</P>
<P>
   THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING. By Martin Clark. (Knopf,
$24.) This first novel by a Southern judge features a Southern
judge, who logs overtime as cuckold, bribe taker, treasure hunter
and devoted tester of controlled substances but by the end has
become a guy worth knowing.
</P>
<P>
   LE MARIAGE. By Diane Johnson. (Dutton, $23.95.) A highly
entertaining novel whose European-American couples misread each
other not just as individuals but as cultural products. A
manuscript is involved, also a murder, maybe a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   THE MARRIAGE AT ANTIBES. By Carol Azadeh. (Carroll &AMP; Graf,
$22.95.) Five restless long stories by a Belfast writer who sends
her protagonists, mostly female, to keenly evoked destinations that
often confound the travelers when they get there.
</P>
<P>
   MEN IN THE OFF HOURS. By Anne Carson. (Knopf, $24.) There is a
startling freshness deep down in these poems, the work of a writer
for whom the ever-sharp world exerts attractive and repulsive
forces in equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   THE MISSING WORLD. By Margot Livesey. (Knopf, $23.) This
vigorous, intelligent novel (the author's third) pits a woman with
amnesia against a lover eager to exploit the handicap; she doesnt
remember rejecting him or the reasons she did it, but she figures
him out again.
</P>
<P>
   MOTH SMOKE. By Mohsin Hamid. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $23.) The
rich live at the expense of the poor in the Pakistan of this first
novel, whose hero mocks the vulgarity and decadence of the top
crust while desperately yearning to join it.
</P>
<P>
   MR. PHILLIPS. By John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $24.95.)
When the accountant at the center of this novel is fired, he begins
a curious new life, involving a bungee jumper, performance art and
a blue movie (these are three separate things).
</P>
<P>
   PASTORALIA: Stories. By George Saunders. (Riverhead, $22.95.)
The author's second story collection focuses on the American urge
for self-improvement, the fear of failure, the need to be accepted.
Generally speaking, his characters dont stand the ghost of a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   PILGRIM. By Timothy Findley. (HarperCollins, $25.) This dense,
ambitious novel mingles religion, history, psychology and mystery
in a hero who may have committed suicide repeatedly for centuries
and undergoes therapy with Carl Jung.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLATO PAPERS: A Prophecy. By Peter Ackroyd. (Nan A.
Talese/Doubleday, $21.95.) An unusual exercise, more akin to an
exposition of the English author's poetics, this book is composed
of long Socratic essays set in a far future that oddly resembles
the ancient past. &QL;

Giroux, $27.) A cosmopolitan temperament sharpens nativisms and
traditional forms in the expansive, energetic work of the closest
thing Australia can offer just now to a truly national poet.
</P>
<P>
   LIGHTNING ON THE SUN. By Robert Bingham. (Doubleday, $23.95.) A
pair of privileged young Americans take on a hopeless caper,
intending to outsmart some Cambodian drug lords; the author, dead
last year at 33 of what looked like a heroin overdose, had a
satiric talent that will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   THE LONG HOME. By William Gay. (MacMurray &AMP; Beck, $24.95.) This
first novelist fears no theme, however large; its good versus evil
in Faulkner territory, and good succeeds only when it's better
armed than evil and willing to exert violence.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE BELIEVE. By Joanna Scott. (Little, Brown, $23.95.) Scott's
fifth novel, full of admirable narrative tricks, centers on a
3-year-old boy for whom the author miraculously finds an
appropriate voice to register the custody fight conducted over him
by his dead parents' parents.
</P>
<P>
   THE MAN WHO WROTE THE BOOK. By Erik Tarloff. (Crown, $23.)
Dead-ended at a jerkwater college, the scholar hero of this riotous
novel strikes pseudonymous pay dirt as a pornographer: his magnum
opus, ``Every Inch a Lady,'' out-Potters Potter and draws a glowing
notice _ by John Updike yet _ in this very book review.
</P>
<P>
   THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING. By Martin Clark. (Knopf,
$24.) This first novel by a Southern judge features a Southern
judge, who logs overtime as cuckold, bribe taker, treasure hunter
and devoted tester of controlled substances but by the end has
become a guy worth knowing.
</P>
<P>
   LE MARIAGE. By Diane Johnson. (Dutton, $23.95.) A highly
entertaining novel whose European-American couples misread each
other not just as individuals but as cultural products. A
manuscript is involved, also a murder, maybe a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   THE MARRIAGE AT ANTIBES. By Carol Azadeh. (Carroll &AMP; Graf,
$22.95.) Five restless long stories by a Belfast writer who sends
her protagonists, mostly female, to keenly evoked destinations that
often confound the travelers when they get there.
</P>
<P>
   MEN IN THE OFF HOURS. By Anne Carson. (Knopf, $24.) There is a
startling freshness deep down in these poems, the work of a writer
for whom the ever-sharp world exerts attractive and repulsive
forces in equal measure.
</P>
<P>
   THE MISSING WORLD. By Margot Livesey. (Knopf, $23.) This
vigorous, intelligent novel (the author's third) pits a woman with
amnesia against a lover eager to exploit the handicap; she doesnt
remember rejecting him or the reasons she did it, but she figures
him out again.
</P>
<P>
   MOTH SMOKE. By Mohsin Hamid. (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $23.) The
rich live at the expense of the poor in the Pakistan of this first
novel, whose hero mocks the vulgarity and decadence of the top
crust while desperately yearning to join it.
</P>
<P>
   MR. PHILLIPS. By John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $24.95.)
When the accountant at the center of this novel is fired, he begins
a curious new life, involving a bungee jumper, performance art and
a blue movie (these are three separate things).
</P>
<P>
   PASTORALIA: Stories. By George Saunders. (Riverhead, $22.95.)
The author's second story collection focuses on the American urge
for self-improvement, the fear of failure, the need to be accepted.
Generally speaking, his characters dont stand the ghost of a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   PILGRIM. By Timothy Findley. (HarperCollins, $25.) This dense,
ambitious novel mingles religion, history, psychology and mystery
in a hero who may have committed suicide repeatedly for centuries
and undergoes therapy with Carl Jung.
</P>
<P>
   THE PLATO PAPERS: A Prophecy. By Peter Ackroyd. (Nan A.
Talese/Doubleday, $21.95.) An unusual exercise, more akin to an
exposition of the English author's poetics, this book is composed
of long Socratic essays set in a far future that oddly resembles
the ancient past. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Erect high hurdles to online gambling
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no need to travel to Las Vegas or Atlantic City or any
of the newer casino resorts to scratch any itch you may have for
games of chance. That kind of action is all-too-available on the
Internet. An online gambler can access more than 250 casino sites,
64 lotteries, 20 bingo games and 139 sports books and run through a
week's wages with a few clicks of his mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed at the corrosive potential of this technological
temptation, the U.S. Senate made a show of outlawing Internet
gaming in a bill passed unanimously last November. However, the
Senate left loopholes in its ban that permit online wagers on horse
and dog races.
</P>
<P>
   That unfortunate precedent set House members to thinking: If
thoroughbreds and greyhounds could win exemptions, why not extend
the same favor for jai lai betting, American Indian casinos and
state lotteries?
</P>
<P>
   So what should have been an across-the-board prohibition could
evolve into a large-scale Internet gaming entitlement. In this
case, no bill is better than the version taking shape in the House.
Besides, since many of the cyber-gambling sites operate from
overseas, such a ban would not apply to them.
</P>
<P>
   A more effective line of attack is incorporated in a bill
co-sponsored by Reps. Jim Leach (R-Iowa) and John LaFalce (D-N.Y.),
the chairman and ranking member of the House Banking Committee.
Their measure would outlaw the use of credit or debit cards,
electronic fund transfers, checks, etc., to conduct any Internet
gambling, period.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-gambling produces no discernible community benefit _ as in
the case of, say, casinos, which at least generate tourism. As for
its downside, individuals who get addicted to point-and-click
wagering often run up crushing credit-card debts, which all too
often have led to family breakups and occasionally suicides.
Moreover, law-enforcement authorities suspect criminal
organizations such as Colombian narcotraffickers use online gaming
transactions for money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The issue before Congress could hardly be clearer. Its members
ought to enact the Leach-LaFalce approach and resist the urge to
load it down with exemptions for favored elements of the gambling
industry.

SIMON BOLIVAR'S FINAL DEFEAT

 By TOMAS ELOY MARTINEZ  
 c.2000 New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGHLAND PARK, N.J. _ Certain words can lose their original
power and meaning with time and misuse. In some political circles,
words like liberty, justice, democracy, order and liberation have
become hollow, unreal, spoken only by those of the Middle Ages. And
the same thing seems to have happened to names. Lately, few names
have been so abused as that of the illustrious Simon Bolivar.
</P>
<P>
   Exalted and revered for 150 years, uncriticized and looked upon
as champion by both dictators and democratic thinkers alike,
Bolivar is still one of the few remaining symbols of Latin
America's greatness.
</P>
<P>
   He had _ besides a unique talent for military strategy _ a
fertile political imagination and a powerful gift for language that
to this day remains seductive.
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities allowed him to frame ideal constitutions for
ideal countries. But the nations of his day, sunk in anarchy or
burdened with oppressive strongmen, rejected those constitutions as
illusory.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of Bolivar's ideas _ such as his proposal for an
authoritarian senate and a democratically elected president who
would hold office for life _ wouldn't fly today. His utopian ideal
of a politically united Hispanic America, though, hasn't lost its
allure.
</P>
<P>
   In his document, the Letter of Jamaica, written in 1815, Bolivar
stressed the need for Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador and Panama to
maintain unity by forming a confederation, with Maracaibo as its
capital. One of his profoundest disappointments was to witness,
before his death in 1830, a factious war that shattered that dream.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Bolivarian ideal of political unity has since
been revived several times on the continent, it has never seemed so
tenable as now. Leaders as divergent as Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez and FARC's (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia)
political leader Manuel ``Tirofijo'' Marulanda have claimed the
liberator's doctrines as the model by which their actions are
guided.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela's new Constitution, promoted by Chavez, gives the
nation a new title: ``Bolivarian Republic.'' This designation also
encompasses the armed forces and every state enterprise. Even a
sector of the Ecuadorian army has claimed this title. And the same
can be said of the Colombian guerrilla forces that protect the so
called ``Zona de Distension,'' southwest of Bogota, and of the
incipient and irregular judicial system that currently rules in
that region. Added to this, the underground political movement with
which the FARC hopes to gain power, is called Bolivarian Movement
for the New Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Whether repeated use of this term is coincidental or part of a
conscious plan for ultimate political unity, it is a question
without an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already are a state within a state,'' declared Commander
Javier Calderon last month in Rio de la Plata, Argentina, alluding
to the territory ceded by Colombia's government to the FARC. ``We
are a state in fact, and will soon be so by law. We have taken up
arms to defend ourselves aginst the terrorist state which oppresses
us, and we have assumed the legacy of liberator Simon Bolivar. No
one is more Bolivarian than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   I heard similar words from Hugo Chavez last August in Caracas.
Chavez _ who has consolidated his mandate in a new election that
has extended his tenure by one more year _ was the leader of a
failed military attempt in 1982 to oust Venezuela's then President
Carlos Andres Perez. Even today, Chavez swears his revolt against
Perez was legitimate _ an oxymoron if I ever heard one _ in that it
was an attack against an ``oppressor and corrupt government'' that
was pillaging national institutions and looting the nation's
wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows of the mediator's cloak Chavez has donned for the
Colombian guerrillas and his frequent contacts with their leaders.
When I asked him what was Colombian President Andres Pastrana's
reaction to those contacts, he said, pointing to the telephone on
his desk, that he immediately advises Pastrana of all discussions
with guerrilla representatives.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Chavez has been accused _ without foundation _
of trying to establish links between his ``Bolivarian'' army and
the armed groups that, under the same name, fight in Colombia and
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   A Washington diplomatic source has suggested to me that part of
Venezuela's huge income earned from current rising oil prices is
being funneled to the FARC in the form of planes and military
equipment. Besides the fact there is no basis to this accusation,
it is quite malicious in that it attempts to portray Chavez as a
reckless adventurer.
</P>
<P>
   However, as in most rumors, there might just be a shred of truth
to be found. One point often noted is that nobody seems to know
where exactly Venezuelan oil revenues go.
</P>
<P>
   The difficult life ordinary Venezuelans have to endure hasn't
improved since Chavez was elected president more than 15 months
ago. And in some ways it has actually worsened, as the escalating
unemployment rate indicates.
</P>
<P>
   Another point to consider is the president's repeated
declarations, in public and private, of his desire to re-create the
Great Colombia that Bolivar dreamed of, and his sympathy for
anyone, whether they are irregular armed groups or opportunistic
politicians, who shares this ideal.
</P>
<P>
   It is unimaginable Bolivar would give his stamp of approval to
such a union today. To him, a perfect government was one that
``would produce the greatest happiness possible, the greatest
social security and the greatest political stability.'' Even though
``Bolivarian'' armies claim this, too, what they are in fact
creating is the exact opposite.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to think of a country in the world that has been so
bloodied as present-day Colombia, torn by the concerted actions of
right wing paramilitary groups, drug cartels, the National
Liberation Army (ELN) and, of course, the FARC.
</P>
<P>
   This perverse use of Bolivar's name has sadly become vogue. A
paramilitary group operating in the Barrancabermeja area, near the
Magdalena River, is actively stealing peasant lands, either by
murder or terror. Yet it calls itself ``Bolivar's Squadron.''
</P>
<P>
   I've read, too, that land north of Bogota which the ELN has
claimed title to, will be called _ if the government finally gives
it to them _ ``Bolivarland.''
</P>
<P>
   A cocaine processing and distributing center in the mountains of
western Colombian, which was recently destroyed, was known as
``Pro-Bolivar.'' This abuse of the name may seem ridiculous, but in
reality it is horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Few men in Latin America fought as fervently as Bolivar to build
a fairer, freer, happier and more civilized society. With this in
mind he wrote some 10,000 documents and fought scores of battles.
The heirs to his legacy, who today so extravagantly use his name
for such immoral activities, are debasing it.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 20 years ago, ``Bolivar'' called to mind
greatness and glory. Today, it is a name so commonly and shamefully
used and abased that soon it may have no significance at all.
</P>
<P>

``Santa Evita.'' He is chairman of the Latin American studies
department at Rutgers University and travels widely as an editor
and journalist.)

BOOK TALK: LITERARY TITANS FACE REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARTIN ARNOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year has been, in a sense, an abounding one for great
American writing. It has brought us novels by three of America's
leading literary icons: the Nobel laureate Saul Bellow and two
potential Nobel Prize winners, Philip Roth and John Updike. Yet
notwithstanding generally strong reviews and tremendous coverage of
the daring literary conceits of the works, only one made The New
York Times' best-seller list, and that for but a week.
</P>
<P>
   Each author had everything going for him, and the publication of
each novel was treated as a cultural event by the newspapers,
magazines, national public radio stations and online magazines that
dote on them.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Updike's ``Gertrude and Claudius'' (Knopf), a sort
of prequel to ``Hamlet,'' did not approach best-seller numbers,
despite interesting word-of-mouth; Bellow's ``Ravelstein'' (Viking)
made the list for one week; Roth's ``Human Stain'' (Houghton
Mifflin) lingered a notch below the list before dropping, despite
exceptional publicity, including a long profile of the author in
The New Yorker by the magazine's editor, David Remnick.
</P>
<P>
   Why was there such a harrowing disconnect between the literary
chatter and the book-buying public? The easy answer is that a list
that includes three Harry Potter novels, one Dr. Seuss and several
ballyhooed by the Oprah Winfrey book club is indeed a tough one for
a literary novel to crack.
</P>
<P>
   But even in that quirky universe, literary fiction can make it.
Michael Ondaatje's ``Anil's Ghost'' (Knopf) will be No. 12 on June
18. Other recent literary best sellers included ``Horse Heaven''
(Knopf) by Jane Smiley and ``Plainsong'' (Knopf) by Kent Haruf.
(Toni Morrison's ``Bluest Eye'' (Knopf) and Isabel Allende's
``Daughters of Fortune'' (HarperCollins), both literary fiction,
were best sellers that were Oprah Winfrey book club selections.)
</P>
<P>
   That Bellows, Roth and Updike have come up so short has
stimulated some theories and stirred some speculation in book
publishing. It should be noted that no one in publishing is
questioning their viability as writers or their ability to hold
onto their fans or even gain new converts. But clearly something
has changed, besides the impact of book clubs and the fact that
chain stores are less apt to push literary fiction than are the
shrinking number of independent book stores.
</P>
<P>
   Many in publishing believe that a generation gap has grown
between the mass of book buyers and these three legends that even
bravura reviews cannot easily leap.
</P>
<P>
   James Silberman, an independent editor who works mostly with
Knopf and Harcourt Brace, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``In every generation the icons get eclipsed by the fashionable
and literary styles change, the tone of voice changes and certainly
commercial styles change, and the type of relationships they write
about are different.
</P>
<P>
   ``These three are in a sense realistic novelists, and to some
degree they write only about the world they know well,'' he said.
``Today there are the great explosion novels that are popular and
also the endless exquisite single relationship novels.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the relationships that Bellows, Roth and Updike write
about are in many ways almost murderous in the way they are torn
apart, but to many younger readers they may seem somewhat remote.
Murder today means murder.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Straus, president and chief executive of Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, linked the books' sales performance to ``the aging
process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all getting old, and critics and the public look for
something really delicious, groundbreaking,'' he said. ``By the
34th novel, the fourth sequel, they say, `So what.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, since these three great writers erupted on the
literary scene, the old issues of Jewish assimilation in American
society often at the core of Bellow's and Roth's novels have been
settled. Three different publishers mentioned that cultural change
that has robbed Bellow's and Roth's writing of urgency for the
current generation of book buyers. (Bellow and Updike did not
return calls for this column. Roth declined, through his
publisher.)
</P>
<P>
   So if their books are not selling in great numbers right now,
they are in libraries and on college syllabuses. Updike and Bellow
have been publishing novels for nearly half a century; Roth since
the 1960s. What makes them icons is that they have withstood the
flashes of the current literary moment, whenever that moment was,
continuing to write and sell books through several generations as
other writers were erased from memory and bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   Silberman noted: `` `Moby-Dick' was a commercial failure, after
Melville had written commercially successful books. His reputation
was in eclipse for a long time. He's certainly back now. When you
read him you know why.''
</P>
<P>
   While great commercial success may have eluded them this time,
there are a lot of doctorates in literature to be earned this
century on these latest novels and on the backlists of Bellow,
Updike and Roth.

 &HT;    SECOND TOP TECH EXEC URGES TAXATION OF ONLINE SALES
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects language in 3rd graf to ``thousands of tax
jurisdictions.''
 &HT;    With TECH-SUMMIT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ High-tech executives and members of Congress who
want to block states from taxing online purchases should end their
``unrealistic'' battle, Carly Fiorina, chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard Co., said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not realistic of our industry to stand and say, 'This
taxation should never be applied to e-commerce,' `` Fiorina said on
the second day of the ``High-Tech Summit'' sponsored by the
congressional Joint Economic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Fiorina also conceded that the existing sales tax system is
far too complicated to work well on the Internet. Trying to collect
all the taxes now imposed by thousands of tax jurisdictions would
be ``disastrous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The best course of action is for state and federal lawmakers to
work together to streamline sales taxes, making them uniform enough
to fit ``the borderless nature of the online economy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Congress is considering several bills that would
extend a moratorium on new Internet taxes. Under existing law,
states can require merchants operating within their borders to
collect sales taxes on purchases. But states cannot force retailers
in other states to collect taxes. So an online merchant in one
state can sell goods to residents of the other 49 states without
collecting sales taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Many state officials fear that as electronic commerce grows,
sales tax losses will grow into the tens of billions of dollars. To
prevent that, the National Governors' Association is coordinating a
drive among states to streamline sales taxes and is asking Congress
to support that approach.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina applauded such efforts. ``What we are calling for is a
concerted effort to do the heavy lifting and bring our taxation
system into the modern age so that we can tax _ in a fair way _
both online and offline transactions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorina's comments echoed those of Intel Corp. Chairman Andy
Grove, who spoke to the summit Tuesday. Grove said that blocking
states from collecting sales taxes on online purchases would amount
to giving electronic merchants an unfair subsidy. ``As a matter of
public policy, I don't see the justification for it,'' he said.

TRADE DEFICIT COULD SIGNAL DANGER AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and adjunct
professor of social sciences at Cooper Union.) 
 By JEFF MADRICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has become one of the most familiar refrains in economic
circles. Every time the trade deficit reaches yet another record,
as it did again this March, economists generally assure us that
there is little, perhaps nothing, to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   We've dealt with high trade deficits for 20 years, the argument
goes, and we're still the leading economy in the world. But in
recent years, the deficit has actually been growing considerably
faster than has the economy itself. And when Americans buy more
from abroad than at home, someone in the United States must borrow
those dollars from foreigners. As a result, the nation's foreign
debt is rising faster than its income. And as the economy begins to
slow at last, the question becomes more urgent because slower
growth may persuade global investors to put their money elsewhere.
The rising level of debt is not sustainable indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Why are we so complacent? One reason is that a couple of
misleading half-truths have become conventional wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these is that, contrary to what you may have
thought, the trade deficit really reflects America's economic
strength, not any inability to compete on the part of companies in
the United States. This year, Americans are buying in excess of
$300 billion more from foreigners than they will buy from the
United States, so the argument goes, because this nation is so much
better off than the rest of the world. If only foreign economies
were as strong as America's. Then their companies and consumers
would buy more American goods.
</P>
<P>
   But, in truth, if foreign consumers and investors suddenly
bought another $300 billion from the United States, Americans
companies could not handle it. Labor markets are tight and business
is already running full out, so an increase in production of
roughly 3 percent of the nation's economic output would be
inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   ``People often seem to forget that because we are approaching
the limits to capacity,'' says Wynne Godley, senior economist at
the Jerome Levy Institute at Bard College, ``an increase in foreign
demand would have to be matched by a comparable decrease in
consumption by Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, we are invariably told that the trade deficit merely
reflects America's record low savings rate. This is true as far as
it goes. When Americans save so little, the nation must attract
enormous sums of capital from overseas to fuel investment.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, right now foreigners are willing to lend a lot of
money to the United States, as well as buy American stocks. This
helps keep the value of the dollar high, which stimulates imports
by pushing prices down and restrains exports by driving their
prices up. According to this reasoning, the trade deficit is simply
a trivial side effect.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not follow from this that all the United States
needs to do is to raise its savings rate and everything would be
fine. If the savings rates were to sharply improve, consumers would
spend much less. The lower spending, in turn, would substantially
reduce output and employment in the economy, running the risk of
outright recession.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these half-truths drown out more useful
discussions about ways to improve America's ability to produce what
Americans themselves want to buy. Low savings rate or high,
Americans like to buy imports more than foreigners like to buy
American products. So the trade deficit does to some extent reflect
how internationally competitive American companies are.
</P>
<P>
   In her comprehensive book, ``Is the U.S. Trade Deficit
Sustainable?'' Catherine L. Mann of the Institute for International
Economics shows clearly that as Americans make more money, a higher
proportion of their purchases are from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   How to correct this? An unusually high dollar, which the Clinton
administration has favored because it simultaneously restrains
inflation and attracts foreign investment, only makes these matters
worse. It reduces incentives to invest in export-producing
companies by keeping prices for these goods unduly high to
foreigners. It also reduces incentives to invest in American
companies that compete with imports by keeping those prices low.
</P>
<P>
   America's inherent competitive advantages would also be better
served, especially in the new economy, if the nation invested more
effectively in its human capital, in research and development and
in infrastructure. At least in part, this will require the efforts
of government.
</P>
<P>
   But those who believe that trade deficits merely reflect the low
savings rate insist that any budget surpluses be used to pay down
Treasury debt. In the short run, this would raise the nation's
total savings, they argue, but what they ignore is that it would
also forgo the best opportunity in decades to improve the nation's
competitive potential through needed public investment.
</P>
<P>
   Because Americans have lived for so long with a high trade
deficit, many seem to believe we have plenty of time to correct the
problem. Aside from a new commission established by Congress to
review the trade deficit, there is little serious policy discussion
of the issue among Democrats or Republicans, or even among
prominent economists.
</P>
<P>
   The current hope _ and it is no more than that _ is for a soft
landing. Foreign economies will grow a little faster and gradually
increase America's exports. The American economy will slow down
moderately, and American consumers will buy fewer imports. The
dollar may also fall slightly, thus stimulating more exports.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the trade deficit will not be eliminated, but at least
it will be dented. America's relentless borrowing from abroad will
be tempered, and, well, the problem will be postponed if not
solved.
</P>
<P>
   But the situation is more delicate than that. The debt Americans
now owe overseas investors, Godley figures, has risen to more than
20 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, easily a record.
Even Mann, a gradualist, believes America may have only a few years
to reverse the current trends.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy does indeed begin to slow even moderately, Mann
and Godley _ no ideological bedfellows _ both agree that foreign
investors may want to rebalance their portfolios (as might domestic
investors) in favor of the securities of other countries. This
would place downward pressure on the dollar and stock prices, and
there is no telling when a small outflow of funds could turn into a
run, especially given the stock market's anxious condition.
</P>
<P>
   The complacent attitude among economists about the trade deficit
was originally a response to exaggerated fears in the past when
America was a creditor. But now that it is a debtor, the nation no
longer enjoys such a luxury.

WHERE TELEVISION SPONSORS THE FILM INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: France, Britain, Germany, Denmark, Poland)   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By KRISTIN HOHENADEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Television may be the dirtiest four-syllable word in the
American cultural lexicon. But if we like to blame the medium for
dragging down our collective taste and IQ, in Europe, television is
still perceived as a cultural institution with a mission to inform
as well as amuse. It may be host to dubbed ``Dukes of Hazzard''
reruns, American-style celebrity magazines and inane game shows,
but turn on network television tonight in France and you're as
likely to see a documentary about poverty in India or a full-length
broadcast of ``Carmen.''
</P>
<P>
   You're also likely to see theatrical films that were not simply
bought by the networks but were also made by them. Yes, there is
made-for-TV drama in Europe, and it runs the gamut from
movie-of-the-week melodrama to educational projects like the
complete plays of Beckett on Channel 4 in Britain and the
forthcoming ``Les Miserables'' with Gerard Depardieu and John
Malkovich on TF1 in France. But there is also what you might call
made-for-movies TV: European television networks, whether public or
private, are the major players in financing feature films for
theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers believe that the dominance of television support
has left Europeans to make small, cheap, character-driven films
that can't compete in a world market. But a number of European
channels _ particularly in France, Germany and Britain _ are
devoting increasing financial resources in an attempt to compete
with Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by the European Audiovisual Observatory in
Strasbourg, France, television investment accounts for between 30
and 74 percent of the financing for the production of feature films
in Europe, depending upon the country. Much of that revenue is
generated by public funds derived from taxes on television
companies and by pre-sale agreements, in which television stations
support projects in exchange for the right to broadcast the films
two years after their theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   The Audiovisual Observatory, which gathers data about broadcast
media in 34 countries, reported that almost 80 percent of the
feature films produced in Europe are made in Germany, France,
Spain, Italy and Britain. And in all those countries, filmmakers
receive some degree of financing from television.
</P>
<P>
   Television companies are the driving force in the business
development of filmmaking in Europe, with Canal-Plus in France,
Britain's Channel 4 and others acting as mini-film studios. In the
last few years, they have expanded their involvement with the
creation of Studio Canal-Plus and FilmFour Limited, stand-alone
entities that receive funds from the channels that own them but
produce movies for theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   The films, of course, have second and third lives on free and
pay channels; but European television serves to support, not
compete with, national film industries. In France, for example,
pre-sale contributions from television networks are generally not
paid until the film is shown in theaters; this prevents the
possibility of straight-to-TV movies, but has created the need for
short-term bank loans to see filmmakers through development,
production and post-production. Film advertising is not allowed on
French television, to provide something of a level playing field
for rich production companies and more modest independent
producers.
</P>
<P>
   American network television's contribution to dramatic
filmmaking is the Movie of the Week, but in Europe even commercial
television isn't automatically dismissed as an ersatz vehicle for
interesting work. ``There's no stigma for actors, writers,
directors, because of the structure and depth of British television
and the history of the BBC,'' said Paul Webster, who heads
FilmFour. ``If Ian Holm does a TV production, it won't affect his
career like it would Gene Hackman's.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a British television performance that led to Ralph
Fiennes' Hollywood career-launching role in ``Schindler's List.''
Ingmar Bergman's ``Scenes From a Marriage'' (1973) is an edited
version of a six-part drama originally made for Swedish TV. Some of
Britain's most experimental directors _ Ken Loach, Mike Leigh and
Danny Boyle _ started in television. (In the case of Leigh, those
were BBC plays done without a script.) Recently, two noted French
directors made challenging films for the French-German channel Arte
_ Claire Denis' ``Beau Travail'' and Erick Zonca's ``Petit Voleur''
_ that were later released theatrically, further obscuring the
boundaries between films made for television and films destined for
the multiplex.
</P>
<P>
   Arte, which is broadcast free in France, Germany, Belgium,
Luxembourg and Switzerland is considered the most broad-minded and
erudite channel in Europe. Europeans grow up reading subtitles, and
Arte's programs are often seen in their original language with
local subtitles. Some 40 percent of Arte's content consists of
documentaries from around the world, many shown in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a European cultural channel, but we try to discover the
world through beautiful films from everywhere,'' said George
Goldenstern, general director of co-production for Arte.
Goldenstern's channel participated in the international
co-production of Lars von Trier's ``Breaking the Waves,'' ``The
Idiots'' and ``Dancer in the Dark,'' which just won the Palme d'Or
at the Cannes International Film Festival and was pre-sold to
several European television channels.
</P>
<P>
   There is continuing debate in Europe about whether it's healthy
for a handful of television executives to exert so much influence
on the taste of feature filmmaking, but Goldenstern insists that he
makes choices based on the strength of the script and if he
interferes at all, it's during the editing stage of a film.
</P>
<P>
   Vibeke Windelov, who produces von Trier's films for the
Denmark-based Zentropa Films, says: ``I've never had a comment from
Arte or Canal-Plus. They have no influence on what I'm doing and
never tried to.''
</P>
<P>
   Windelov estimated that about 25 percent of the funds for
``Dancer in the Dark'' came from television participation,
including contributions from Arte and COBO, a Dutch cultural
broadcasting fund whose revenue derives from reinvested foreign
cable rights fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lars wouldn't be able to make movies if it wasn't for people
like Arte and Canal-Plus who are willing to go in and give the real
money,'' Windelov said. Von Trier now makes his films in English,
like many European filmmakers. It's a way for them to reach a wider
audience and guarantee better distribution, but it also means that
they don't qualify for subsidies intended to promote national
language and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Gomez, the head of Lolafilms, Spain's largest film
distributor, emphasizes that television investment is crucial to
getting projects made in Spain: ``The average cost of a film in
Spain is $2 million; of that, one-third comes from national
subsidies that support Spanish-language films, another third from
television, and the last from theatrical, video and foreign sales.
Today all films end up on the small screen eventually, but European
producers depend on television money because the budgets are lower.
If the average cost of an American studio picture is $56 million,
television is not going to be a determining factor. But for us the
television money becomes crucial. Who's going to buy a $2 million
picture around the world in Spanish?''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez said that Spanish television executives favor films with a
wide appeal that can be shown in prime time. ``They don't support
sex, violence, auteur films,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   But the restrictions, he said, might be considered liberal by
American standards: uncut versions of ``Basic Instinct'' and ``Last
Tango in Paris'' were recently broadcast in Spanish prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to executives at Fox or Disney, he said, Spanish
executives are a piece of cake: ``They're not so pretentious and
aggressive. They don't get too much involved. They either like a
script or don't; but they won't keep you waiting for a year making
changes.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The European Audiovisual Observatory reported that in newly
privatized countries such as Hungary and Poland, television has
sustained film production by taking up the slack left by weakened
public funding. In Poland, for example, 75 percent of film
production is now paid for by television. But some filmmakers feel
that support is geared toward commercial films that are an easy
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Hungary, public television is not so open to the film
industry and was never so important for the film industry as in
western Europe,'' said the Hungarian director Istvan Szabo, who
made his best-known film, ``Mephisto'' (1981), in German. ``Here
there is a low-minded fight between television people and film
people, so there is never very good work between them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the almost 20 years since its founding, Channel 4, the backer
of ``Trainspotting'' and ``East Is East,'' has been widely credited
with pumping life back into the ailing British film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Loach, who has been making films in England for more than three
decades, sees the involvement of television as ``the most important
development in British and European cinema over the last 15
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He began his career at the BBC, directing police shows in the
1960s; his last film, ``Bread and Roses,'' was in competition at
Cannes and is scheduled to open in the United States later this
year. Its $5 million budget included funds from FilmFour and Arte.
``Throughout the 70s,'' he said, ``it was virtually impossible to
make cinema films _ certainly in our country _ that looked to
Europe or to Britain. Everything had to look across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Channel 4s policy of investing in a film that was basically
looking to Britain or Europe on a budget that was appropriate for
that audience, and withholding it on television for two years _
that really opened the doors for everyone. From the '80s up until
now, it made it possible for some of us to work in the cinema.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that the world market is increasingly receptive to
British talent, there is talk in Britain about whether the hand
that has fed the film industry has also stunted its growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always difficult to quantify what makes TV versus
films,'' Webster said. ``But too often material that is better
suited to the small screen ends up on the big screen in the UK, and
that's potentially the downside. I don't think that the power of
television or the quality has held back the film industry in the UK
or Europe in general, in fact, but it may lead to more mistakes; TV
people don't know how difficult it is to get an audience. I think
the immaturity that exists in the industry happens much more often
at the level of sales and distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Making films that can capture worldwide audiences whose
moviegoing tastes have been shaped by the big American-style cinema
experience seems to be the main objective of many European
broadcasters, once content to satisfy their local markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point about movies is they ought to be seen, and quite a
lot of movies go into a black hole in this country,'' said Alan
Yentob, director of drama, entertainment and children's programming
at the BBC, which is in the early stages of stepping up its feature
filmmaking efforts. If nearly every film will end up on the network
anyway, they reason, why not aim to make a go of it at the box
office first?
</P>
<P>
   ``The BBC has always been involved in film,'' Yentob said, ``in
that we've given opportunities to a lot of key talent. We want to
use our leverage and clout now to make more ambitious films,
greater in scale that will get an audience around the world.'' &QL;

&HT;     POLITICAL MERRY-GO-ROUND: ONE PARTY STEALING FROM THE OTHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For Release Sunday, June 11)   &HT;     (For use by NewYork Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery,
then Al Gore and the Democrats should be wallowing in adulation
provided by George W. Bush and the Republican high command.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his fellow GOP leaders have thus far demonstrated
remarkable political wisdom by copying and stealing issues that
Democrats have used successfully in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   To a ``yellow dog'' Democrat _ a staunch party loyalist who
would rather vote for a ``yellow dog'' than a Republican _ the term
``wise Republican'' is an oxymoron. But it is an accurate
description of Bush and the shrewd strategists who are running his
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Name an issue that Democrats have shaped, fostered and converted
into a winning campaign theme and you will find that the new
Republican team has adopted that issue as its own. Bush and his
strategists appear to have learned from their defeats of the past
that wise politics dictates an invasion of Democratic territory.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Republicans lost the 1948 election to Harry
Truman when voters in major farm states such as Iowa, Illinois,
Minnesota and Wisconsin surprised the professional politicians and
the press by voting Democratic. They did so after Truman
barnstormed the Middle West accusing the Republican 80th Congress
of refusing to provide funds for ample grain storage in a year in
which a bumper corn crop was ready to be harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to store their corn in bins approved by the government's
Commodity Credit Corporation, farmers could not qualify for federal
price supports. So many of them faced heavy losses in a year that
should have proved prosperous for them.
</P>
<P>
   At the national plowing contest in Dexter, Iowa, the president
hit the farm issue hard, recalling the desperate days of the Great
Depression when violence erupted in agricultural communities and,
Truman said, ``223,000 farmers'' lost their farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder how many times you have to be hit on the head before
you find out who's hitting you?'' Truman asked the huge throng of
farmers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   He got his answer on Election Day when they cast a majority of
their votes for him and his fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That was long ago. But Republicans have good memories. The
current leaders do not want a repeat of that episode.
</P>
<P>
   So on May 25 the Republican-led Congress approved a $15.3
billion package of programs to aid farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Although George W. Bush was but a teenager in 1960, he no doubt
has learned from his father one of the reasons that the Democratic
presidential nominee that year, John F. Kennedy, won. Kennedy
capitalized on his claim that America had fallen behind the Soviet
Union in missile production and was the victim of a serious
``missile gap.''
</P>
<P>
   In his race against then-Vice President Richard Nixon, Kennedy
hammered relentlessly at the missile gap, attributing it to the
Dwight Eisenhower administration without mentioning the name of the
popular former five-star general.
</P>
<P>
   Since JFK defeated Nixon by a mere 13,673 popular votes out of
nearly 70 million cast for the two candidates, it would appear that
the missile gap argument played a key role in his victory.
</P>
<P>
   After his inauguration, however, Kennedy found that there never
was such a perilous national defense deficiency between the United
States and its No. 1 Cold War foe, the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the current debate, Bush has called for a substantially
larger missile defense system than the one proposed by President
Clinton and supported by Vice President Al Gore and has labled the
administration plan ``flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   To boost his argument, Bush unveiled his plan with two former
secretaries of state, Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, at his
side, along with his father's White House national security
adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and the former chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff, Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   Bush contends that an adequate missile defense shield would
protect America and its allies from nuclear attacks by such rogue
states as North Korea, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also taken up an issue that has been closely identified
with the Democrats _ Social Security, created by Franklin D.
Roosevelt and strongly supported by all subsequent Democratic
presidents and congresses. The vote of seniors who depend on Social
Security played an important part in Clinton's two presidential
victories.
</P>
<P>
   But who was first out of the gate this year with a proposal to
overhaul the program as a means of saving it? Why, George W., of
course.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's various proposals for improving the federal government
raise a lot of questions. But even without much clarification, his
plans appear to have had a favorable impact on voters, according to
public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Democrats has been that when Bush acts, Gore
reacts.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, conservative critics in the GOP would have called
Bush and his colleagues ``me too'' Republicans. But so far the
critics have avoided that designation because Republicans are so
anxious to regain the White House after eight years of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If they were not involved in a political contest with few holds
barred, the Democrats might consider suing the Republicans for
invasion of their domain. It is a facetious idea, but one that
illustrates the dilemma of the Democrats.

ACTRESS OWNED AN ENTIRE TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What town in Georgia does Kim Basinger own? _ G.B., via
the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Basinger was once an owner of Braselton, a town of 450
northeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The actress, a native of Athens, Ga., was part of an investment
group that paid $20 million in 1990 for 1,750 acres. The group
planned to develop a theme park, but the property was sold for $4.3
million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Basinger filed for bankruptcy protection after a Los
Angeles Superior Court ordered her to pay $8.9 million for
breaching a contract to appear in the film ``Boxing Helena.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans can write to her in care of Creative Artists Agency, 9830
Wilshire Blvd., Beverly Hills, CA 90212.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Cape Canaveral was renamed Cape Kennedy after President
Kennedy's death. When was the name changed back? _ O.B., Fort
Myers, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ In March 1973, the Florida Legislature passed a
resolution calling for a change back to Cape Canaveral. The Board
of Geographic Names, an agency of the U.S. Department of the
Interior, made it official five months later.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after Kennedy's assassination, President Johnson
persuaded the board to change the name, which he announced on
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a number of Floridians were peeved about changing the
name of the cape, which had been called Canaveral for more than 400
years,'' ``Straight Dope'' columnist Cecil Adams writes.
</P>
<P>
   The cape, the main launching point for staffed space flights,
Earth satellites and long-range missiles since 1947, is the home of
the John F. Kennedy Manned Space Flight Center.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Where can I write to David Sedaris? _ S.R., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to Sedaris in care of Steven Barclay, 321
Pleasant St., Petaluma, CA 94952.
</P>
<P>
   Sedaris, 39, is an essayist who began contributing to National
Public Radio in 1992, describing his experiences as a Macy's elf.
His fourth book, ``Me Talk Pretty One Day,'' was atop the
``Publishers Weekly'' and ``Newsday'' nonfiction bestseller lists
in May.
</P>
<P>
   From Nov. 2 to 4, Sedaris is scheduled to do five readings from
``Me Talk Pretty'' at the McKinney Avenue Contemporary in Dallas.

JUDGE ORDERS MICROSOFT SPLIT INTO TWO COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Microsoft (MSFT:Nasdaq)
should be split into two separate companies to remedy antitrust
violations and foster competition in the markets for computer
operating systems and software applications.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general devised
the plan, details of which the giant software company and
prosecutors have disputed in public court filings for the past two
weeks. The additional filings have delayed the ruling, which was
widely expected last week.
</P>
<P>
   The judged stayed the breakup portion of the ruling until
appeals are completed. The ruling gives Microsoft four months from
Wednesday to devise a plan to separate the operating system
business from the applications business.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the judgment, a series of restrictions on
Microsoft's business practices, takes effect in 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   In substance, the order closely resembles the original Justice
Department proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond, Wash.-based company has repeatedly vowed to appeal
the three-part ruling note for note, including the judge's Nov. 5
finding that Microsoft sought to extend a monopoly on operating
systems to other markets, his April 3 ruling that such behavior
violated the Sherman Antitrust Act and the remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares closed up 7/8, or 1 percent, at 70 1/2. Adverse
developments in the trial, including the first two portions of
Jackson's ruling and the breakdown of private settlement
negotiations, have dragged the company's stock price down from a
52-week high of 119 15/16, reached in December during settlement
talks.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-long antitrust trial has reverberated across most
sectors of this information and technology economy. For a full
decade, starting with a 1990 Federal Trade Commission
investigation, the government has pursued sanctions against the
25-year-old company.
</P>
<P>
   The widely expected ruling, which applies antitrust law to a
business sector revolving around rapidly changing technology, is
comparable in scope only to the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T's (T:NYSE)
telephone monopoly, the breakup of United Shoe in 1968 and the
historic dismantling of John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust in
1911. While comparable in scope, splitting Microsoft into separate
entities defined by the products they manufacture would be without
much precedent in method. The government's previous trust busting
has nearly always sought to stimulate competition in a single
product, be it footwear, oil or telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup, linchpin of the ruling, would place the ubiquitous
Windows operating system in one company and create a second
business for everything else, including software applications, the
Internet Explorer Web browser and the Microsoft Network Internet
service provider and network of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jackson's attempts to pick up the pace of the trial,
which he has said are partially motivated by a desire to allow
appeals to begin, the time required for those appeals is unknown.
Provisions specific to antitrust law give the U.S. solicitor
general, and not the Justice Department, 15 days to request that
the Supreme Court immediately review the company's appeal. That
would allow the government to leapfrog the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, which reversed Jackson in an
earlier ruling adverse to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The behavioral remedies take effect within 90 days of a ruling.
These remedies include publishing the so-called source code used by
programmers to design software applications for Windows and placing
guidelines on Microsoft's relations with computer-makers and other
software companies.

   Scripture is about humankind's attempts to get along with God,
and vice versa. It's easier to get along with people we understand.
And it's easier for modern Scripture readers to understand the
characters when their milieus are clear.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we're not trying to explain God here. But ``Women in
Scripture'' is an immense help in fathoming why the women in the
Bible _ and that includes the Hebrew Bible, the
Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical books and the New Testament _ did what
they did and elicited the reactions they did.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a regurgitation of unfounded myths, despite the
traditional Protestant Bible's sketchiness about even the most
important women. For example, much of what we've been told about
Mary Magdalene (reformed prostitute, etc.) is set aside here as
totally lacking evidence and is attributed to male fantasy and
jealousy. Few traditional Sunday schools give this Mary her due as
discloser of special revelations from Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Among the book's editors is Toni Craven, a professor of the
Hebrew Bible at Brite Divinity School in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women in Scripture'' is a valuable aid for anyone who wants to

WHICH `LEAR' IS KING? YOU DECIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's one of the great parts of the English-language stage _ and
cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Even as you read this, two new film versions of ``King Lear''
are headed for the multiplexes. One, with a screenplay by Ernst
Kaufmann, is scheduled to be released this year or in early 2001.
Another, Kristian Levring's ``The King Is Alive,'' recently
screened at the Cannes Film Festival. The modern-set film features
Jennifer Jason Leigh, Janet McTeer and Bruce Davison, it is set in
the desert. When a bus breaks down, its passengers decide to stage
``Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   We decided to take a look at some of the memorable film versions
of the Bard's famous tragedy. All are available on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Lear,'' 1997: This Mobil Masterpiece Theatre production
stars Ian Holm in the title role, and makes a 1996 stage production
TV-ready. What's interesting about this is that most of the
characters are cloaked in black, with Lear's daughters, Regan,
Goneril and Cordelia, outfitted in gray power suits. Much of the
opening action takes place in a crimson-red boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Thousand Acres,'' 1997: Jane Smiley's novel was inspired by
``King Lear.'' In the 1997 film, which critics generally panned,
Jennifer Jason Leigh (she must have a thing for ``Lear''), Jessica
Lange and Michelle Pfeiffer play the daughters of farmer Larry,
played by Jason Robards.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Lear,'' 1987: Perhaps the oddest version. After the
Chernobyl nuclear accident, many great works are lost, and it is up
to ``William Shakespeare Jr. the Fifth'' (Peter Sellers) to restore
the lost artworks. At a resort, he finds strange goings-on with mob
boss Don Learo (Burgess Meredith) and his daughter Cordelia (Molly
Ringwald). For some reason, he films it, and the footage is sent to
New York for Mr. Alien (Woody Allen) to edit. Jean-Luc Godard
directs.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Lear,'' 1984:You can't go wrong with Laurence Olivier and
Shakespeare, and you don't here. It's a well-acted version, but the
production, originally for stage, looks as if it were being taped
by a novice using a camcorder. Check out babe Diana Rigg as Regan.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Lear,'' 1982: This BBC version starring Michael Hordern
also has the shaky trappings of a slightly glorified filming of a
stage production. This one is a good introduction for those not
familiar with the play because of its simplicity and faithfulness
to the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``King Lear,'' 1971: Peter Brook directs this stylishly dark and
shadowy black-and-white version, starring Paul Scofield, who may be
to ``King Lear'' what Olivier is to ``Hamlet.''

EMPATHY BEST FOR CONTROLLING CONTROL FREAKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CECELIA GOODNOW  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pity the poor control freak.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he makes your life hell, he's quivering with hidden
anxiety. ``A jellyfish in armor'' is how one expert describes him.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if you understood what's driving him (or her), you'd
sympathize _ up to a point.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, maybe the jerk wouldn't get under your skin
so much, says psychologist Les Parrott III, who wrote the book on
control freaks and admits to some control tendencies himself.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to neutralize overcontrolling behavior, much of
which stems from a fear of being criticized or shamed for making an
error.
</P>
<P>
   But for now just start working on that empathy thing. Parrott
says that's the single best technique for dealing with overly
driven people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risky thing about empathy is it will change you,'' says
Parrott, co-director of the Center for Relationship Development at
Seattle Pacific University. ``It's threatening, because we don't
like to change.''
</P>
<P>
   But he says it's worth the effort:
</P>
<P>
   ``The research has shown that 90 percent of the problems we
encounter in relationships can be resolved, or at least improved,
by doing nothing other than seeing that issue from the other
person's perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrott delves deeper in his new book, ``The Control Freak:
Coping With Those Around You, Controlling the One Within'' (Tyndale
House, 193 pages, $19.99).
</P>
<P>
   Parrott, who writes prolifically on relationship issues, is a
familiar media figure, with past appearances on ``Oprah,'' ``NBC
Nightly News,'' ``CBS This Morning'' and other shows.
</P>
<P>
   His renown stems from his work with SPU's Center for
Relationship Development, which he and his wife, Leslie _ a
marriage and family therapist _ founded and direct. They also teach
the most popular class on the SPU campus, ``Relationships 101.''
</P>
<P>
   This month the Parrotts begin a year as
``marriage-scholars-in-residence'' in Oklahoma as part of the
state's $10 million campaign to reduce its spiraling divorce rate.
</P>
<P>
   So just what is a control freak?
</P>
<P>
   Parrott defines it as ``someone who cares more about something
than you do and becomes pushy to get their way.''
</P>
<P>
   He says their tactics are legion:
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be obnoxious, they can be persistent, they can be
invasive, they can be nit-picky and perfectionist.''
</P>
<P>
   And modern life is making it worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is feeding our control frenzy,'' Parrott maintains.
``People like to-do lists. These Palm Pilots and everything we use
now to get organized make us feel in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Control freaks victimize themselves as well as others. They risk
high blood pressure, heart disease and, at the very least, loss of
enjoyment in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, there's this intense pressure that never
allows you to relax when you're a control freak,'' Parrott says.
``You're doing so much at the same time. You're putting on your
makeup while you're driving the car. There's no sense of peace or
centeredness.''
</P>
<P>
   Parrott has written about other difficult personality types,
from The Wet Blanket and The Critic to The Flirt. He described 15
such party-poopers in a 1997 book, ``High-Maintenance
Relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like the Avon Lady, the control freak pushes a lot of
buttons. After Parrott's ``High-Maintenance'' guide was published,
many readers sent letters asking him to expand on his chapter about
The Control Freak. So he wrote his new book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anyone you talk to will say, `I know a control freak, I
am a control freak,' '' says Parrott, 38, a boyish-looking
professor with a shock of brown hair spilling over his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   He's dressed casually, in navy polo shirt, jeans and mocs
without socks. But he has the tightly coiled manner you'd expect in
a guy who says he has spent his entire married life harping on the
backhanded way his wife cuts carrots. To no avail, incidentally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been married 16 years,'' he notes rhetorically, ``and
how do you think she cuts carrots?''
</P>
<P>
   His control-freak symptoms flared recently after a five-hour
wait at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport made him an hour
late for an appearance in Charlotte, N.C. Stressed and anxious, he
felt driven to control the entire event, from the scheduling to the
seating arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of saying, `What's your opinion?' I began to bark
orders,'' Parrott says.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the host told him, ``You need a vacation. You were
pretty uptight.''
</P>
<P>
   Nervous, high-strung people are more prone to controlling
behavior, but most of us go overboard once in a while. We may be
tired and stressed _ or reacting to a pet peeve like how to hang
the toilet-paper roll.
</P>
<P>
   Up to a point, a drive for control is healthy and even essential
for functioning, Parrott says. The ability to manage pain is one
example.
</P>
<P>
   Even hard-core controllers may have redeeming qualities _
competence and commitment, for example. As Parrott puts it, ``Would
you rather go to a surgeon who's happy-go-lucky or a control
freak?''
</P>
<P>
   Parrott says controlling behavior crosses the line ``when it
starts to interfere with your functioning, when you become an
irritant to the people around you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core types turn every situation into a competition for
control. Most of them will do ``just about anything'' to get their
way, making victims feel not just annoyed but demeaned.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, empathy will get you only so far. If the control
freak is interfering with your ability to enjoy life or function
well, it's time to draw some boundaries. But try to remain tactful
and calm. Avoid ultimatums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Threatening a control freak is not the wisest of things,''
Parrott says, ``because that sends them more wildly out of
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, recognize it may not be in your power to fully remove
the thorn from your side.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person can change the dynamics of the relationship,''
Parrott says. ``But for the control freak to change, it really
comes down to awareness.''

 &HT;    CLINTON ORDERS MEDICARE TO COVER CLINICAL TRIALS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Paving the way for thousands of elderly patients to
receive potentially life-saving experimental medical treatment,
President Clinton ordered Medicare Wednesday to pay for routine
costs associated with clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's executive order expands on legislation which has
languished in Congress for four years that would have paid for
cancer-related clinical trial coverage. The president's action will
cover all approved medical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The order will not cover the actual costs of the trials, many of
which are paid by the drug company or medical equipment company
testing a new medicine or device. Instead, the order which takes
effect immediately means Medicare will now cover the cost of
hospitalization and related care which was not covered for most
patients participating in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has not projected how many of the 38 million
Medicare beneficiaries might participate in clinical trials and the
cost of such coverage has not been calculated. The president's
order will require Medicare to begin keeping such records.
</P>
<P>
   Patient groups and lawmakers involved with the stalled
legislation hailed the president's order as a major step toward
offering hope for many older Americans facing potentially
catastrophic illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of my friends who are senior citizens ... I think this
is a glorious day,'' said Ellen Stoval, executive director of the
National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., a cancer survivor and sponsor, along
with Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., of the cancer trial bill, said
``this is a very exciting moment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that only about 2 or 3 percent of Medicare patients
participate in clinical trials because they cannot afford the
related hospital costs, Mack said the order should give many more
seniors ``the opportunity to participate in what, for them, could
be a life-saving medical procedure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller described prior Medicare rules barring coverage of
clinical trials as a ``blockage'' as deadly to some seniors as a
blocked artery.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst possible scenario is when you have the best possible
care and you don't make them available ... because of some
blockage,'' Rockefeller said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., sponsor of a similar House bill,
said ``I believe firmly that thousands and thousand of our senior
citizens ... are going to have new hope ... longer lives, and some
of them cures,'' because of the order.
</P>
<P>
   Mack said he was concerned that Clinton's order may open the
door for trials that are not scientifically sound to receive
coverage, but Johnson said she was confident that the Health Care
Financing Administration's final rule would specify that only
medically approved trials would be covered.
</P>
<P>
   While nearly two-thirds of cancer patients are older than 65,
only about one-third of all cancer patients enrolled in clinical
trials are in that age group, according to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Among breast cancer patients, 44 percent are elderly, but fewer
than 2 percent are enrolled in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American Cancer Society believes increased access to
clinical trials is a key element in the war on cancer,'' said Dr.
Gerald L. Woolam, the organization's president. ``Today's action
will remove one of the unnecessary roadblocks our seniors face in
their efforts to get state-of-the-art cancer treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent Institute of Medicine report listed the lack of
Medicare coverage of routine patient care as a primary reason why
more elderly do not participate in clinical trials.

FRIEDAN HAS NOT MELLOWED 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I heard Betty Friedan yelling on the radio while I was driving
down the freeway and I started laughing. Good old Betty, giving a
radio interviewer hell, saying something like, ``That's it. I'm
leaving,'' because she didn't like his question.
</P>
<P>
   All the goll darn (but she didn't say goll darn) media ever
wants to talk about is a long-ago falling-out between her and some
other feminist leaders. Do they care that much when men wrangle?
No, she fairly hissed. They're just looking for a cat fight.
</P>
<P>
   She says in her new book, ``I've always been a bad-tempered
bitch.'' And aren't we glad? Had women not learned to be
disagreeable we'd still be crying into our soapsuds, smoldering in
silence. Thirty years of outspokenness has been good for women, and
as Betty Friedan points out, what's good for women is good for men,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The same week I heard her yelling on the radio I went to a book
signing for ``Life So Far,'' her first memoir following six books
that started with ``The Feminine Mystique,'' that basic primer of
discontent. She wore a brimmed hat and a turtleneck and sat in a
wicker chair, next to a brash bouquet of rhododendrons, a good
choice since her presence might have wilted a lesser flower.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Friedan is nearing 80. She's prickly. When you're prickly,
people don't ignore you. It's a trait worth working on.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't open her book to read. She preferred to take
questions, peering at her audience with those lidded Buddha-like
eyes, daring us to say something intelligent.
</P>
<P>
   Someone wondered if feminism had made women happier? She frowned
over the word happy. There was always more to women's equality than
being happy. Happy is a bird in a gilded cage.
</P>
<P>
   What about this continuing crazy focus on body image? ``It's
really quite irritating,'' she agreed. ``We need more women defying
that sort of thing, saying this is a real body. Then we can start
applauding authenticity.''
</P>
<P>
   How is it to be someone who smartened up a whole society, got
people thinking entirely different and encouraged half the
population to feel better about themselves? She seems pretty
humbled by it. ``I don't know who appointed me to lead women out of
the wilderness,'' she said, and then decides it was in the timing.
Women were itching to break free. She wrote about what was going on
in her life and it coincided with a moment in history. Her words
resonated and helped start a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   You might assume that a Betty Friedan is naturally bold and more
confident than others. But if you look inside her life story you
find a woman who was just as scared, guilt-ridden and insecure as
the rest of us. She was a housewife who guiltily squeezed her
writing time around her kids' school hours. Shy about her success,
she was embarrassed when people started referring to her husband as
``Betty's husband'' and then, as she says in the book, paid for it
at home. But the fear of being alone prevented her for a time from
leaving a troubled marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Someone asked at the book signing what the women's movement has
done for men and she said it's been good for them, to no longer
``require a subservient woman'' to feel good about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The male ego is starting to move to a firmer basis than
machismo,'' she said. ``Men have become strong enough to be
tender.''
</P>
<P>
   As for men's role in their families, she thinks our society is
still ``too mother-centered,'' with child-raising primarily a
mother's concern. As soon as fathers become just as involved in
raising their kids, ``we can pick up our skirts and declare
ourselves equal.''
</P>
<P>
   For that to happen will require ``a basic restructuring of
work,'' which allows ``both mother and fathers to effectively
combine work and family.'' The world of business, she says, still
operates on the dinosaur model ``that a working man has a wife at
home to take care of all the details of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's working woman surely doesn't have that at home, but
neither, she points out, does the working man. So business has to
change and feminists _ they being both women and men _ will have to
force it to change.
</P>
<P>
   Oh good. Another revolution.

   WASHINGTON _ Here are sanctions ordered Wednesday by U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in the antitrust case
against Microsoft Corp. Microsoft has 90 days to file an appeal of
these sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   BREAKUP OF THE COMPANY
</P>
<P>
   _ Within four months: Microsoft must submit a plan dividing
itself into two parts. One part would produce and sell the Windows
operating system, and the other would would produce and sell
applications such as Office and the Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   _ 60 days later: The government may submit objections to the
breakup plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ 30 days later: Microsoft may respond to the objections.
</P>
<P>
   RESTRICTIONS ON CONDUCT
</P>
<P>
   For three years after the breakup goes into effect, Microsoft
must operate under certain business practices, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ It cannot take or threaten action against any computer maker
that uses a competing product or service.
</P>
<P>
   _ It cannot restrict companies from displaying computer screens
or icons that direct users to competing products or services.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must provide the technical information needed to make other
software work with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   _ It cannot offer selected companies special discounts or other
incentives to license Windows.
</P>
<P>
   _ It cannot force companies to buy other Microsoft products in
order to get a license to sell Windows.
</P>
<P>
   _ It cannot take actions that make competing software work less
well with Windows unless it notifies the maker and offers to help
it avoid the problem.
</P>
<P>
   _ It must license future versions of Windows to current
customers at a fair price.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Heat will reach record levels for early June in many spots from
the central Rockies to the northern and central Plains on Thursday.
Afternoon temperatures in the 90s to near 100 will be common in
those regions. Late Thursday, scattered potent thunderstorms will
erupt at the edge of the hot air mass from northern Montana to
northern Minnesota. Afternoon thundershowers will also develop over
many of the peaks of the central and southern Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A cold front will move slowly east across the interior West, and
a band of clouds and showers will follow it from northern Nevada to
Idaho. The Pacific Northwest will be cool with variable clouds and
a few showers.
</P>
<P>
   A strong warming trend will blossom in much of the East. Showers
will precede the arrival of the warmth in northern New England.
Meanwhile, a tropical disturbance will send heavy showers toward
the Texas coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WET DAYS
</P>
<P>
   New York City, Boston and Albany, N.Y., all had their wettest
June 6 on record as a late spring storm brought 2-5 inches of rain
on parts of the Northeast. Within the last week, parts of Minnesota
and Texas also set daily records for rain. One of the most notable
climate trends in the United States during the past 100 years has
been a relatively steady increase in wetness. The added
precipitation has been the result of more days with extreme rain
that can produce flash flooding rather than a large increase in the
total number of days with precipitation.

``INVISIBLE MAN'' FILLS MINDLESS AIR TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Holy ahi! Turns out you don't have to be a tuna to get mercury
poisoning. Just stop by your regional fish-and-game office and
they'll administer a quicksilver implant while you wait.
</P>
<P>
   Be warned: Side effects may include headache, bloodshot eyes,
violent tantrums and the urge to quote Nietzsche and Santayana. But
the upside is the ability to go missing at a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   In the newest televersion of ``The Invisible Man,'' petty thief
and inveterate con-man Darien Fawkes has chosen the implant, his
alternative being a lifetime in prison as a third-time offender.
This sci-fi experiment is standard TV stuff in that it goes
horribly awry _ you were expecting it to go horribly right? _ and
Fawkes has little choice but to remain in the employ of U.S. Fish
and Game, the government agency that was experimenting on him
because it had excess funding while the CIA and NSA were
underbudgeted. Besides, it controls the supply of counteragent he
needs to keep from becoming a real monster.
</P>
<P>
   His ability to become invisible makes Fawkes valuable in the
battle against crime, not to mention the battle of deciding what to
wear each morning. The biosynthetic quicksilver gland, developed by
Fawkes' brainy brother, is grafted to his cerebral cortex and looks
like a potsticker with tentacles. Its removal would cause
almost-certain death, for some pseudo-scientific reason that makes
no sense, so Fawkes continues showing up for work, unless it's to
his advantage not to show up, if you get my drift.
</P>
<P>
   This latest adaptation of the 1897 H.G. Wells novel is the fruit
of an idea that once had Kyle MacLachlan mentioned for the title
role and the series earmarked for Fox. MacLachlan and Fox
eventually disappeared, and the producer, Studios USA, is
simultaneously peddling the show to cable (Studios USA and Sci Fi
Channel are part of USA Networks) and to broadcast stations via
syndication. In the Seattle market, KONG/16 will carry episodes of
``The Invisible Man'' a couple of weeks after they run on Sci Fi,
beginning with the two-hour premiere at 9 p.m. June 18 (repeated at
10 p.m. June 25), and subsequent one-hour episodes on Sundays at 10
p.m., starting July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Syndication is an especially appropriate venue for ``The
Invisible Man,'' which has the passionless, assembly-line look of
so many other superficial shows intended not to challenge the actor
and the viewer but to provide an hour of mindless air time on a
weekend night.
</P>
<P>
   Sci Fi Channel describes the series as an action/comedy, and
Vincent Ventresca does play the tormented Fawkes with touches of
bemusement and bewilderment. But with so many folks dying in the
two-hour premiere, it's hard to take the comedy seriously. More
distressing is the disappearance of Fawkes' sometime girlfriend,
Casey (Rebecca Chambers), who promises at the end of tomorrow's
premiere to help him cope with the effects of his intracranial
dumpling. Casey happens to be a neuro-bio-something-or-other
physician, but in Episode 2 her place in the requisite eye-candy
category is usurped by the Keeper, a government doctor who tells
Fawkes to trust her whenever she sticks a needle in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Where Casey seemed to display a spark of real life, Shannon
Kenny's ``Keeper'' is the oh-so-hackneyed humorless scientist who
will no doubt let her hair down sometime this season and display a
warmer side when she discovers she likes Fawkes for more than his
slightly damaged mind.
</P>
<P>
   The cliches don't stop there. The agency partners Fawkes with a
wacky but disgruntled field agent named Hobbes (Paul Ben-Victor),
and his boss, known simply as ``the Official,'' is a rumpled civil
servant with a lot of miles on his weary countenance.
</P>
<P>
   On a gee-whiz level, ``The Invisible Man'' sticks to
slick-but-basic special effects reminiscent of those used on Robert
Patrick's now-you-see-him-now-you-don't melting man in ``Terminator
2: Judgment Day.'' For TV, they're very good, but they'll most
likely pale in comparison to the effects in the upcoming Kevin
Bacon film, ``The Hollow Man,'' which takes the invisible man
concept to the big screen July 28.
</P>
<P>
   Producers don't worry about such comparisons, as long as
interest in the movie _ unrelated though it may be _ generates
interest in the series. Should that happen, ``The Invisible Man''
will be a success in spite of its failure to go very deep into
Darien Fawkes' brain.

INDONESIA'S CENTRAL BANK CHIEF, ACCUSED OF CORRUPTION, REFUSES TO
QUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Two days after Indonesia's central bank
governor was named as a suspect in a financial scandal, he and the
government squared off Wednesday in a bitter showdown that could
erode what little confidence investors have in this fragile
country.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Bank Indonesia, Syahril Sabirin, said he would
not step down despite repeated requests from Indonesia's president,
Abdurrahman Wahid. Sabirin denied any wrongdoing and said he was a
victim of a political witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have stolen any money,'' Sabirin said in an
interview on the CNBC Asia cable TV network. ``In fact, from my
childhood, I don't think I have stolen any money.''
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's chief law enforcement officer, however, said the
governor should be suspended. Attorney General Marzuki Darusman
said Sabirin could not serve as central bank governor while he was
the target of a criminal investigation. He also rejected a decision
by the speaker of Indonesia's parliament to allow Sabirin to keep
his job until his fate was decided in a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of interpretation or politics,'' Darusman
said in an interview Wednesday. ``He has to be suspended
temporarily. That's the law.''
</P>
<P>
   For Indonesians, who are steeped in scandals and political
intrigue, the power struggle is simply another chapter in the
stormy presidency of Wahid. But for foreign investors, who have
watched from the sidelines as Indonesia has struggled to recover
from the upheavals of 1998, it is a worrying sign that the country
is once again spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, fell 0.52 percent in trading
Wednesday, to 8,610 rupiah to the dollar. The rupiah has lost 19
percent of its value since the beginning of the year because of the
political uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole way Wahid handles disputes has been baffling,'' said
Bill Kaye, the senior managing director of the Pacific Group, a
hedge fund in Hong Kong that has so far avoided Indonesia. ``He's
perceived as not only ineffectual, but also tainted by cronyism.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Wahid set off the rupiah's latest slide when he
dismissed two respected cabinet ministers and replaced them with
friends. In a twist typical of Indonesian politics, one of the
ousted ministers, Laksamana Sukardi, is now a candidate to replace
Sabirin at the central bank.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid was also tainted when an official at the state logistics
agency said he had transferred $4.2 million to the president's
masseur. Much of the money has since been returned, and the scandal
seems destined to be a footnote in the annals of Indonesian
chicanery.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sabirin, however, was implicated in a more sensational scandal,
the Bank Bali affair. The governor approved a $63 million payment
from the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Authority to Bank Bali,
ostensibly to cover loans owed to it by other banks. Bank Bali then
funneled much of the money into a company linked to Indonesia's
former ruling party, Golkar.
</P>
<P>
   The money was to be used to finance the presidential campaign of
Wahid's predecessor, B.J. Habibie. Habibie withdrew from the
election when it was clear he would suffer a crushing defeat. The
public outrage over the Bank Bali affair was a major reason for his
downfall.
</P>
<P>
   An outside investigation of the scandal said Sabirin had
attended a meeting in which the use of the money was discussed. He
has denied attending the meeting, but other witnesses have
contradicted him. The attorney general said Sabirin should not have
approved the payment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sabirin, who was appointed by Indonesia's former president,
Suharto, was regarded as a competent and honest bureaucrat before
the scandal broke. A courtly, soft-spoken man, he has nevertheless
emerged as a stubborn foe of Wahid and his attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Darusman said Wednesday that Sabirin was a ``crucial element in
the whole case.'' He said the governor could provide evidence that
would allow it to pursue other senior officials in the Habibie
administration who had helped orchestrate the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the furor it is causing, some experts said the
government's pursuit of Sabirin was a welcome sign. ``This suggests
that the government is going to do something dramatic on the Bank
Bali case soon,'' said James W. Castle, an longtime consultant
here.
</P>
<P>
   For Darusman, who is also leading the government's investigation
of the disgraced former president, Suharto, the Bank Bali case is a
litmus test for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents the massive commercial fraud that took place in
this country for years,'' he said. ``If we are going to be serious
about tackling this problem, this case has got to be resolved. If
we don't resolve it, people will regard the government with
cynicism.'' &QL;

&HT;     DNA EXPERT URGES CONGRESS TO TAKE STEPS AGAINST GENETIC BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c. 2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A pioneer in the quest to complete the human
genetic map warned Congress Wednesday that the possibility of
genetic discrimination threatens to stall advances in
biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   J. Craig Venter, co-founder of Rockville, Md.-based Celera
Genomics Corp., said that as science unravels each individual's
genetic blueprint, insurance companies and employers could use the
DNA information to deny health coverage or jobs to people who are
genetically predisposed to certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's natural that an insurance company would be wary of
insuring someone who has a propensity to getting cancer at an early
age or who likely will be afflicted with Alzheimer's,'' he told the
Joint Economic Committee of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists also fear that genetic discrimination could creep
into other areas of life. For example, banks could refuse to give
loans to people susceptible to debilitating diseases, believing
they would not be able to repay the money.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, who expects individual genetic maps to be available in
the next 10 to 20 years, said that without legislation prohibiting
discrimination, people might be afraid to avail themselves of these
advances in health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``These maps will save lives and make our lives healthier and
better, but most people aren't going to risk their jobs and
insurance for them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, whose company is expected this month to report that it
has completed a draft of the human genetic code, said the issue of
confidentiality would be key to the future of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the assurance that this knowledge will not be used
against people, a field that will revolutionize medicine could slow
to crawl,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, comprises the genetic material
passed on from generation to generation that forms the building
blocks of nearly every living creature.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists estimate that every human has at least 100,000 genes,
each a vital bit of information that can explain everything from
which diseases each person may be at risk of developing, such as
cancer or Alzheimer's disease, to height or hair and eye color.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration earlier this year banned federal
agencies from using genetic testing to deny jobs or promotions to
their workers. In addition, the House and Senate are considering
legislation that would provide some protection against genetic
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee, said during the hearing that he anticipates
congressional passage of genetic discrimination legislation this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe that biotechnology will be to the 21st
century what computers were to the second half of the 20th century,
and we need to ensure America is at the forefront of this
revolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once more is understood about genes, the hope is to use that
information to improve treatments or find cures for diseases. The
data also could be used to create individual genetic passports,
with information on potential diseases and how to prevent them.
</P>
<P>
   But Venter emphasized that humans should not forget that DNA is
not responsible for everything that happens in life _ the
environment and lifestyle matter. For example, smoking and obesity
can make people more susceptible to heart disease and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every disease has a hereditary component, but it
varies, and environment plays a role,'' Venter said, adding that
everyone has genetic flaws.
</P>
<P>
   So far 39 states prohibit, at least in part, discrimination in
health insurance based on genetic tests; 15 have some ban on
discrimination in employment. But many of the laws have loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   However, many employers continue to seek genetic information
about their workers. A 1999 survey by the American Management
Association, a New York City-based business association, found that
30 percent of large and midsize companies obtain such information
on employees. Seven percent use it in hiring and promotions.

A NEW DOG IN TOWN,   STEEL AND SPROUTING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Spain, Australia, Italy)   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When it comes to public sculpture, Jeff Koons' giant
topiary-esque ``Puppy'' is a rarity, a guaranteed crowd-pleaser
with serious art credentials. A 1992 work, it has been seen in
Germany, Spain and Australia and is now stationed in front of 30
Rockefeller Center until Sept. 5. Irresistibly cute, 43 feet high
and quilted with flowers, it occupies the spot traditionally
reserved for New York's most famous Christmas tree and easily holds
down this patch of unusually fetishized turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puppy'' is identifiably a West Highland terrier sitting
attentively on its haunches. When you walk around this canine, you
almost expect to see a tail twitching quietly in anticipation of a
reward or the next command.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally speaking, ``Puppy'' is a hollow stainless-steel
sculpture covered with foam into which thousands of annuals have
been stuck, roots and all (marigolds, begonias and lobelias among
them). A little door near the tail and an interior ladder
facilitate watering. As the summer passes the work will become more
lush, and the plant life, guided by the sculpture's surface, will
look shaggier and shaggier, in a calico (noncat) sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   It seems safe to say that monumentality has never looked so
endearing or tender. The scale and simplicity of the form fend off
sentimentality, even as the zillions of flowers humanize the
towering scale. As soon as the scaffolding came down on Monday
afternoon, tourists started gathering on the eastern edge of the
skating rink (currently an open-air restaurant), cameras in hand.
</P>
<P>
   The dog plus flowers plus bigness is a particularly innocent,
joyful example of the transformation of familiar objects for which
Koons is best known. His strategy has a long history; it descends
from the Duchamp ready-made by way of Jasper Johns and Claes
Oldenburg, whose painted flags and giant vinyl hamburgers were in
essence remade ready-mades. Partly as a result of Koons' influence,
this strategy has been embraced by myriad artists since the early
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Koons' best remade ready-mades make the conversion to art
especially accessible by mating almost ubiquitous objects with
resonant materials. His goal doesn't seem to be to simply ``make it
new,'' in the words of Ezra Pound, but to make it new, beautiful
and oddly pure.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning he simply enhanced actual objects, emerging in
the early 1980s with a series tellingly titled ``The New'' that
consisted of shiny new vacuum cleaners placed in immaculate,
lighted vitrines, as if they were sacred relics.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has veered between innocence and jadedness. His
basketballs floating in fish aquariums took the notion of newness
to almost womblike extremes. Other works seemed deliberately
ironic, as when he translated objects of leisure into expensive
materials that also rendered them useless. In this vein he has cast
a Baccarat decanter in stainless steel and a diving lung and rubber
dinghy in bronze. Somewhere in between, he also used cast stainless
steel to breathe new life into both a kitschy bust of Louis XIV and
a dime-store inflatable bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Koons' goals have always been his own and have repeatedly
reflected a strong interest in communicating with a mass audience.
Thus he has made larger-than-life porcelain sculptures of Michael
Jackson with his pet monkey, and a polychrome wood piece, also
quite large, based on a postcard of a London bobby commiserating
with a bear.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 he seemed to feel that this communication required total
revelation, and innocence and jadedness met head-on. He exhibited
big high-gloss photo-based paintings of him having carefully staged
sex with his wife, the Italian porn star Ciccolina (they're now
divorced), in idealized settings. These images were widely
denounced at the time and probably helped ignite the current wave
of art-about-sex and personal revelation, but they possessed a
weird pre-Raphaelite pristineness.
</P>
<P>
   Even this series, titled ``Made in Heaven,'' included objects
that communicated a simpler, more obvious kind of love: floral
arrangements, a pair of putti and even a poodle, made (like the
bobby and bear) in polychrome carved wood by skilled craftsmen in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   These works in particular were part of a line that leads
directly to the puppy, which Koons has said he considers a
``spiritual work'' because it is intended to ``communicate
happiness,'' pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   It does. Koons, not known for his modesty, also once wrote,
``I've made what the Beatles would have made if they had made
sculpture.'' The Rockefeller Center ``Puppy'' gives this statement

`JIM THE BOY': WISING UP, THOUGH HE AIN'T NO BIGGER THAN A POOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Accurate as it would be to call Tony Earley's first novel a
radiant, knowing, pitch-perfect parable of childhood, it seems
wrong to say things that would make his characters blush. Earley's
book is set during the Depression in the modest, folksy North
Carolina town of Aliceville, where ``Shoot!'' and ``Daggummit'' and
``You knothead'' are the cuss words in common parlance and a
ghostly story still resonates about the little girl for whom the
place was named. In this simple setting, which Earley renders with
a wonderful blend of nostalgia and sophistication, the verities
discovered by 10-year-old Jim have a way of seeming particularly
eternal.
</P>
<P>
   The expert and irony-free minimalism of ``Jim the Boy'' gives it
the plain, wholehearted sound of a book for young readers. But the
forthright and sweetly humorous way in which Jim's story unfolds is
anything but naive. This book's rural characters seem as carefully
chosen as figures in a Greek myth, like the widowed mother who
sounds as if she stepped out of a folk song (``Mama was tall and
pale and handsome; her neck was long and white'') to watch over her
son. The other deities in Jim's universe are the three uncles who
during the course of this quick and unexpectedly elegant fable
teach Jim everything he needs to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all know who I am,'' Jim insists on the morning of his 10th
birthday when Uncles Al, Coran and Zeno teasingly pretend not to
recognize him. ``Can't say that we do,'' Uncle Coran remarks, in a
book that, while not without seriousness, seldom sounds any less
good-natured than that.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that the twins Al and Coran and their older brother
(``His age was considerable, up in the 40s somewhere,'' Jim thinks
about Zeno), mean to surprise Jim with a baseball glove and bat,
which they present with the characteristically wry understatement
that serves as local color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never seen them before,'' says Uncle Coran, when the glove and
Louisville slugger turn up in the middle of the dining room table.
``What are they?''
</P>
<P>
   Jim's Mama urges the uncles to quit kidding. (``Oh, stop it.
Sometimes I could just strangle y'all.'')
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it is Zeno, the book's foremost source of wisdom,
who ends the birthday celebration on a suitably sweeping note. ``He
ain't no bigger than a poot,'' says Zeno, ``but I guess we'll keep
him.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't take many poots to tip a book this slender into the
realm of sugary down-home charm. But Earley, whose first book was a
collection of short stories, retains the economy and purposefulness
that that form demands, as he leads Jim through a series of
exploratory ventures beyond the loving shelter of his Aliceville
home. The book's landscape and cast of characters are so
selectively delineated that each of these forays has the mythic
quality of a major undertaking, even on the journey about which
``Uncle Al would say only that they were going to see a man about a
dog.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the trip on which Jim visits a town big enough to have a
courthouse, a place that affords a tempting sight. (``Jim could no
longer imagine sitting inside a soda shop than in the house of a
king, and did not ask Uncle Al to stop.''). It's the time he first
sets foot in another state. (``South Carolina,'' said Uncle Al.
``Not much to it, huh?'') And provides Jim with his first
experience of the Atlantic Ocean, where he steps into the water
(``A fish no bigger than a thought swam by his feet'') and tries to
imagine where else that water has been. The beauty of ``Jim the
Boy'' lies in its graceful way of describing a boy who is in every
way thus poised on the verge of discovery, thrilled and fearful to
find new wisdom flooding into his familiar world.
</P>
<P>
   The course of the book leads Jim to make peace with thoughts of
his father, who fell dead in a cotton field the week before Jim was
born. It leads him to understand his mother's loneliness,
especially when a genial traveling feed salesman named Whitey
Whiteside begins to court her. (Wondering about Whitey's presence
around his mother made other questions begin ``pulling into his
head like trains into a station.'')
</P>
<P>
   It brings Jim into friendly rivalry with a schoolmate named Penn
who fights with him about baseball and makes him see the contrast
between Penn's life on a nearby mountain and Jim's life in town. It
seems no coincidence that Penn's mother, glimpsed briefly at home,
is in a sky-blue dress and a white apron, as if this symbolic
setting were indeed part of the clouds. The whole book has the
sharp, clean, inviting hyperreality of a detail like that.
</P>
<P>
   The most daunting figure in Jim's world is the grandfather who
will have nothing to do with him and who can also be found
somewhere up the mountain. While it's true that Jim comes to know
about pride, competition, racial tension and disabling illness
during the course of the story, nothing looms larger for him than
the terrifying specter of that mean old man. It is some measure of
Earley's storytelling mettle that he uses Jim's grandfather to
generate the book's closing epiphany without remotely reaching for
the literary equivalent of a big grandfatherly hug.
</P>
<P>
   The novel's matter-of-fact-looking cover illustration ably
conveys the meaning of this last episode. Yet this picture, like
the story itself, has the stealth aspect of something intended for
young readers in an innocent, less cynical time. In fact, ``Jim the
Boy'' is anything but quaint. Earley may not have invented the
coming-of-age novel, but he streamlines and reawakens the genre
with this swift, lovely book.  &QL;

 &HT;    The toys of summer
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   School's out for the summer, and kids throughout metro Atlanta
are shucking their book bags and kicking off their shoes. It's time
to feel the power _ the ``power of play'' as the American Toy
Institute calls it.
</P>
<P>
   To help children make the most of their vacation from the
classroom, we found some very cool toys to occupy them during the
long, hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   These playthings should keep idle hands and heads busy for hours
indoors as well as in the great outdoors. We've zeroed in on a few
items that kids can play with solo and others specifically designed
for group activities.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also notice a couple of oldies but goodies jazzed up with
the latest technology, and of course we couldn't leave out toys
that pay homage to the ongoing Pokemon and dinosaur crazes.
</P>
<P>
   So, forget the three R's for a while. Get ready, get set _ and
play!
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon Monopoly
</P>
<P>
   by Parker Brothers
</P>
<P>
   Their parents might have whiled away hours negotiating a deal on
how to acquire precious real estate such as Marvin Gardens and
Boardwalk, but today's kids seem more interested in snagging
Giovanni's Gym and Master Ball. You guessed it, we're talking
Pokemon _ Monopoly, that is. In this version, kids travel from gym
to gym, battling various Pokemon and racking up real estate.
Instead of dollars, players earn Poke Money, and houses and hotels
have been replaced by neon Poke Centers and Poke Marts. And there's
no more arguing who'll get the hat or the iron. Instead, players
will probably fuss over who gets Pikachu.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ages 8 to adult. About $30. Available at Toys ``R'' Us and
through the Web site at www.toysrus.com.
</P>
<P>
   Hatchling Baby Dinosaur
</P>
<P>
   by Mattel
</P>
<P>
   You can set your calendar by it. Each summer Disney comes up
with a movie event that spawns endless toys, books and trading
cards. Last month, ``Dinosaur'' roared into theaters, and sure
enough, hatchlings are popping out on toy store shelves at record
speed. These soft fabric baby dinos are hatched when you unzip the
plush egg, which emits a soft heartbeat thump. Turn the egg inside
out and a big-eyed baby dinosaur emerges. Press a spot on the
dino's chest and it talks. You can select from the purple Baby
Neera or blue Baby Aladar.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ages 3 and older. $12.99. Available at Target stores.
</P>
<P>
   Street Glide
</P>
<P>
   by Rand
</P>
<P>
   This zippy little number is sure to start a serious tug of war
between adults and kids. It's a two-wheeled crowd pleaser that can
handle riders weighing up to 175 pounds. And the smooth-rolling
scooter really does glide, thanks to high-performance polyurethane
street wheels. About half as wide as a skateboard and made of
lightweight aluminum, it quickly folds up into an easy-to-tote
bundle. Weighing in at only 7 pounds, the Street Glide offers a
portable little run-around perfect for getting you to your
destination pronto. The Street Glide is not made for stunt riding
or racing and riders must wear a helmet.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ages 8 and older. About $100. Available at Toys ``R'' Us and
through www.etoys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Jump Rope Rock by Oddzon
</P>
<P>
   Skip to the music with this jump rope that features seven
electronic songs. You control tempo and add sound effects by
pressing buttons on the plastic handles. The music automatically
shuts off when you stop jumping.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Spin &AMP; Splash
</P>
<P>
   by Fisher-Price
</P>
<P>
   Dogs and children playing in the water is a typical summer
scene. Now your kids can splash courtesy of that wacky pooch Blue.
Just hook her up to a garden hose and her ears will spin and spray
water. Flowers sprout from her bucket and water squirts from her
watering pail. Blue provides an ideal way to cool off on a hot
summer's afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ages 18 months and up. About $19.99. Available at Toys ``R''
Us and through www.etoys.com.

   Firefly Lantern by Coleman
</P>
<P>
   Whether you take the kids camping in the mountains or in the
great outdoors of your back yard, consider the new Firefly Lantern.
Capturing and keeping those elusive fireflies is always a
challenge, but Coleman's lightweight lantern provides a roomy
sanctuary for the flashing critters. Made of plastic with a
screened middle and swivel top, the lantern's light comes from the
fireflies _ no batteries or fuel needed. And no more punching holes
in a jar lid!
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ages 6 and up. $9.99. Available through www.etoys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Tie Dye Kit by Creativity for Kids
</P>
<P>
   Yes, tie dye is back and everything you need to create
individual, colorful designs is included in this tie dye kit. Make
your own rainbow-colored swirls and splashes by wrapping and
knotting fabric with special cords that contain dyes in six colors.
Think beyond wildly colored T-shirts and jeans with this kit
because it also contains items to make a heart-shaped pillow and a
stuffed teddy bear.

<P>
   &QR;  Ages 7 and up. $14.99. Available at Zany Brainy stores.
</P>
<P>
   Wave Hoop by Maui Toys
</P>
<P>
   OK, other than the fact that it comes in glittery, neon colors,
this longtime favorite looks pretty much like the original Wham-O
Hula Hoop we remember from childhood. However, the folks at Maui
Toys want you to know that their version practically ``hoops by
itself.'' Therein lies the difference. The wave in the name refers
to liquid inside the hoop along with a flow-through plug that keeps
the hoop suspended in midair. This toy has hit a variety of ``top
toys'' lists since it was introduced earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ages 3 and up. $5.99. Available at Toys ``R'' Us.

<P>
   JamCam, Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Camera by KB Gear
</P>
<P>
   Kids love to take pictures, but raising a budding Ansel Adams
can get costly when you consider how much film those pint-size
photographers can gobble up. And often the resulting photos consist
of little more than Rover's nose, half a shoe and plenty of grass.
However, with JamCam, Jr. you don't have to worry about film or
developing costs. This sturdy, easy to use digital camera is
designed especially for little hands and curious minds. No film
needed, just snap, then download the pictures into your home
computer and you easily can nix the mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ages 8 and up. $69.99. Available at Zany Brainy stores and
through www.etoys.com.
</P>
<P>
   Matchbox Car Wash by Mattel
</P>
<P>
   To keep your cars looking their best, consider the Matchbox Car
Wash where you can wash, rinse and dry your Matchbox and Hot Wheels
vehicles. You might want to wash those dirty trucks and cars
outside since this toy uses soap and water. The car wash comes with
a Volkswagen ready to cruise through the swinging gates for a buggy
bath. Some adult assembly is required.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ages 3 and up. $17.99. Available at Toys ``R'' Us and through
www.toysrus.com.

 &HT;    Report lauds safety laws protecting kids
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Community educational efforts to keep children safe from
accidental injuries aren't working well enough, and up to 37
children die each day as a result, according to a report being
released today.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by the California-based David and Lucile Packard
Foundation, concludes that laws mandating child-safety efforts _
including everything from seat belt use to swimming-pool fences _
make a greater difference in saving lives than educational
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, a nonprofit organization, examined unintentional
injuries, the major cause of death in childhood in the United
States. Each year, more than 13,000 children and teens die as a
result of car and bike crashes, fires, drownings and other
accidents; for each child that dies, the foundation said, 223
others are treated in emergency departments and released, and 18
are hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, a wide array of local and voluntary programs are
aimed at reducing risks to children, from car-seat giveaways to
driver's education to reminders to replace smoke-alarm batteries.
The foundation's 188-page study, prepared with the help of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, doesn't call those
programs a waste of time or money, but concludes they are not as
effective as regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, it is really laws and regulations that do more
to reduce deaths and injuries than teaching parents about safety or
giving away safety devices,'' said Lisa Deal, editor of the
foundation's journal, ``The Future of Children,'' which published
the report. ``Parents have so much to worry about. It is in many
ways up to policy-makers to take the lead in making kids safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Community efforts, such as encouraging pediatricians to discuss
safety with parents or giving away bike helmets to kids, do make
some difference, the foundation found. But the changes don't last:
According to the study, the more time that passes after a child
receives a bicycle helmet in a giveaway, the less likely it is that
kids will wear the helmets or parents will insist on their use.
</P>
<P>
   The report calls for laws that would mandate the use of some
safety strategies, such as car and booster seats at appropriate
ages, smoke alarms that run on a house's electrical supply rather
than batteries, and graduated ages for drivers' licenses. (Some of
those measures already exist in Georgia: For instance, the state
requires children younger than 3 years old to use car safety seats,
though it does not mandate booster seats for older children, as CDC
recommends.)
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of opposition to laws that restrict personal choice in
favor of public health, such as mandatory motorcycle helmets, the
foundation recommends studying potential legislation to be sure
benefits outweigh costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this would not be controversial,'' Deal said. ``We
feel like children don't have a voice in public debate, so it is up
to society to look at what is best for kids.''
</P>

 &HT;    MTV serves Oscar with extra toppings

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight's ``MTV Movie Awards,'' taped Saturday at cavernous Sony
Pictures Studios in Los Angeles, is all about quantity.
</P>
<P>
   Like, how many different outfits host Sarah Jessica Parker can
stuff herself into? (We lost count at 14, including one bath
towel.) And, if you got a dollar for every ``Matrix'' mention,
clip, joke and Keanu Reeves sighting, it might top the budgets for
``The Matrix 2'' and ``3.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour show has two Greens _ Seth and Tom, the latter
making way too much ``Uma-Oprah'' commotion with his date, a coffee
machine. And three decidedly different musical performances _ the
shirtless D'Angelo singing ``Devil's Pie,'' the ubiquitous 'N Sync
gyrating to ``It's Gonna Be Me'' and hard-core Metallica putting in
one more soundtrack plug for ``Mission: Impossible 2'' by pounding
out ``I Disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this isn't the staid, wake-us-when-it's-over Oscars.
Old Hollywood thought it got down when it nominated ``Blame
Canada'' from the ``South Park'' movie for best song. Wrong cut,
clueless ones. MTV's ``Movie Awards'' is here not only to set the
record straight, but to relish that other ``South Park'' tune _
``Uncle $!&AMP;.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Collins, who won an Oscar for his ``Tarzan'' song, is
nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Who is here represents most every recent movie the
deep-pocketed, megaplex-going youth of America love. Like Freddie
Prinze Jr. (``She's All That''), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me''), Aaliyah (``Romeo Must Die'') and
Ryan Phillippe and Sarah Michelle Gellar (``Cruel Intentions'').
</P>
<P>
   A few hep cats are let in the door _ Samuel L. Jackson, of
course (appropriately sporting a white cap emblazoned with
``Shaft'' in capital letters), George Clooney (here to plug ``The
Perfect Storm'' with Mark Wahlberg; Parker squeezes both of their
butts), Mel Gibson (``The Patriot'' star in a neatly pressed tux;
what was he thinking?) and ``Star Wars'' uberlord George Lucas
(thoroughly stuffed in an ill-fitting suit and sporting silver hair
so highly coiffed they could have tossed a toga on him and he'd be
the perfect Roman senator to tout ``Gladiator'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Movies are just so swell,'' Parker enthuses in outfit No. 1, a
see-through black whiff more negligee than dress. She then sings as
clips behind her show vomiting, beheadings and general mayhem from
films like ``Sleepy Hollow'' and ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   The winners are already known, but winning at this show isn't
nearly as important as being seen or sputtering a joke as tasteless
as anything in ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   In pre-show taped skits, there's a humorous convergence of ``The
Matrix,'' with Parker's HBO comedy ``Sex and the City'' and a
witty-but-overlong ``Being Tom Cruise'' spoof with Tom Crooze (Ben
Stiller). The ``South Park'' kids take on ``Gladiator.'' Just guess
what happens to Kenny.
</P>
<P>
   Halle Berry bares her midriff and exposes her thong. Denise
Richards sports blow-out hair. Adam Sandler wears a yellow DCShoeCo
shirt and shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's dressed young, ``MTV's Movie Awards'' sometimes
feels just a little, well, old.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a summer 2000 event touting ``The Matrix,'' ``Austin
Powers,'' ``The Blair Witch Project,'' ``Fight Club,'' ``Big
Daddy,'' ``The Sixth Sense,'' ``Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   All great films, but don't you feel like you saw them ages ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``MTV Movie Awards''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But because of the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the column
will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag. Write
us at Buyer's Edge Find It, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, P.O.
Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at buyersedge(at)ajc.com

<P>
   Q: I have a friend who has the use of only one hand and arm. I'm
looking for a source for kitchen gadgets and other items to make
her life easier. I'm particularly looking for a fork that has a
knife as one edge. Can you help me find a source for such items?
</P>
<P>
   _ Beverly Cohen, Roswell, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another question: I am a paraplegic who is new to Atlanta.
Do you know of a store or Web site that specializes in clothes and
items for disabled persons?
</P>
<P>
   _ Pete Gray, Norcross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We have several suggestions on saving you time and energy.
One handy book, ``The Best 25 Catalog Resources for Making Life
Easier,'' by Shelley Peterman Schwarz ($8.95 plus shipping) tells
you who might benefit from the products being offered (people with
mobility problems, people with hearing problems, etc.). She lists
the catalogs _ and some of their key products _ with phone numbers
and Web sites. To order, write: Shelley Peterman Schwarz, 9042
Aspen Grove Lane, Madison, WI 53717-2700.
</P>
<P>
   (608-824-0402).
</P>
<P>
   One of the catalogs in Schwarz's book, Easy Street Co., offers a
three-in-one stainless steel utensil from Duro-Med Industries. It
can be used as a spoon, fork and knife and is designed for those
with limited strength and hand control. The utensil is $7.50 plus
$4.50 shipping. Order: 1-800-959-3279.
</P>
<P>
   A handy Web site for clothing and accessories is
www.kansas.net/(tilde)cbaslock/clothint.html. It includes 65
manufacturers, phones numbers and/or Web addresses. Items, for men,
women and children, are designed especially for disabled
individuals and wheelchair users.
</P>
<P>
   Q: For several years, I've used Eliminate Shower, Tub and Tile
Cleaner that I bought at Home Depot. But they no longer carry the
product. Any help you can give in locating it will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   _ James N. Parkman, Cumming, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We looked around a bit and found Eliminate at Home Depot,
2450 Cumberland Parkway (770-432-9930). A 32-ounce bottle is $4.87.
A spokesman said Eliminate should be at most Home Depot stores. The
manufacturer, Unelko Corporation, says its cherry-scented,
biodegradable product ``removes calcium, hard water spots, soap
scum and body oils without offensive odors or the need for
aggressive scrubbing.'' Use it on glass, porcelain, ceramics,
chrome, stainless steel, marble and brass.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Don Imus, the morning talk show host on Sports-talk 790/the
Zone, has a business with his brother Fred. One of the items they
sell is a Southwestern salsa available in grocery stores in New
York and Florida. Is it sold anywhere in the Atlanta area? Thanks!
</P>
<P>
   _ Todd Zinke, Duluth, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bring on the chips. We found Fred Imus Southwest Salsa,
medium or hot, at Kroger, 910 Athens Highway, Loganville
(770-554-1100). A 16-oz. jar is $1.67. Most Krogers are just now
getting in a supply. You can also order it at
www.autobodyexpress.com. Then click on gift accessories. This thick
and chunky salsa is from all natural ingredients, including
tomatoes, onions, green chilies, red jalapeno peppers, red and
green bell peppers and various spices. Good news: No sugar,
additives or preservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A few years ago during a choir tour to Germany, I was
introduced to Grether's Pastilles, a very comforting throat
lozenge. These little glycerin drops are small miracles for a sore
throat. I find it in drug stores in Germany and Switzerland, but
have been unsuccessful in Atlanta. My throat needs a miracle. Can
you help?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ron Cook, Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Soon you will be in fine singing voice. We tracked down
Grether's Pastilles, which are made in Switzerland, at
Caswell-Massey in Phipps Plaza (404-261-9415) where a tin is $6 and
at Wender &AMP; Roberts Drugs, 1262 W. Paces Ferry Road NW
(404-237-7551), where a tin is $6.95. Both stores stock black
currant and red currant flavors. The slogan on the tin reads: ``For
a soothing, deliciously different experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am trying to find a hand-cranked ice cream maker for my
Momma, one like we used to have in the country. I can find the
electric ones, but they don't work as well. The ice cream isn't as
firm as with a hand-cranked freezer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pierson Burke, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We can just taste that yummy ice cream and you will be able
to enjoy it for a July Fourth celebration. Here's the scoop: We
found White Mountain's Hand-cranked Ice Cream Freezer at Handy Ace
Hardware, 4351 Hugh Howell Road, Tucker (770-939-6842). A 4-quart
freezer (shown) is $169.99. Other sizes include an 8-quarter
freezer ($249.99) and a 2-quart size ($98.99). The stainless steel
cream can is surrounded by a natural wood finished tub. And the
cast-iron dasher won't give out as the cream hardens.

 &HT;    `Girl, Interrupted' offers fine performances
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two fine actresses, two fine performances. Based on Susanna
Kaysen's memoir about the two years she spent at an upscale mental
hospital in the late 1960s, this movie, eschewing the potential
touchy-feely pitfalls of the material, goes for a rip-roaring tone
reminiscent of ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.''
</P>
<P>
   As Susanna, Winona Ryder steadies the film and gives it its
emotional center, but Oscar winner Angelina Jolie provides the
fireworks in a fiercely showy turn as a charismatic sociopath.

   &QR;  ``Mr. Death: The Rise and Fall of Fred A. Leuchtre, Jr.''
(PG-13) _ This documentary from Errol Morris (``The Thin Blue
Line'') follows the fascinating, peculiar career of Leuchtre, an
engineer who gained fame finessing the mechanisms of execution
(gas, electric chair, gallows) in order to keep a death sentence
from being ``capital torture.'' Then, in the 1980s, he agreed to
investigate the grounds of Auschwitz-Birkenau to support the claims
of a revisionist historian, on trial in Canada for claiming that
the Holocaust never happened. His dubiously achieved results
pitched Leuchtre into an ethical and media firestorm that brought
him unexpected infamy. Though Morris' arty touches (close-ups and
slo-mo) can be distracting, his film presents a fascinating
portrait of an elusive man who seems to be many things at once: an
earnest dweeb, a dupe, a publicity monger and a smiling
anti-Semite. Grade: A-

<P>
   &QR;  ``Next Friday'' (R) _ It's back to business as usual at the
movies, with the return of this typical dumb comedy starring Ice
Cube and former Atlantan Mike Epps. The best that can be said for
this sequel to the 1995 comedy ``Friday'' is that, unlike in the
first flick, the characters don't spend most of the movie sitting
on the front steps and yakking while they get stoned. No, they go
elsewhere to get stoned. Lamely written, it's a reminder that,
while more complex, mature but still funny African-American
comedies are getting made (``The Wood,'' say, or ``The Best Man''),
there's always a market for flatulence and dog poop jokes.
</P>

   &QR;  ``The Eel'' (unrated) _ This Cannes Film Festival award winner

mixture of comedy and melodrama. In Japanese with subtitles. Grade:

 &HT;    A quick ride through the best of cars on film
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The automobile industry and the movie industry grew up together.
No wonder they work so smoothly together on film, whether it's a
cute little Love Bug named Herbie or a glamorous Thunderbird
convertible carrying Thelma and Louise to their destiny. ``American
Graffiti's'' cars are as much the stars of the picture as the kids
who drive them. And in ``Le Mans,'' the cars probably had more
screen time than the stars inside them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' which opens Friday, looks at the largest
carjacking ever. We'll look at a few less larcenous examples of
auto-mania at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Christine'' (1983): From the pen of Stephen King comes this
1958 Plymouth Fury with a murderous mind of her own and a radio
that only plays '50s rock 'n' roll. Keith Gordon (later to direct
such distinguished films as ``A Midnight Clear'') is the nerdy high
schooler who finds himself becoming possessed by his own jealous
vehicle. The moral? Woman hath no hell like a Plymouth Fury
scorned. Chop shop note: Seventeen identical Christines were used
in the picture; only two survived in mint condition.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Tucker: The Man and His Dream'' (1988): This could just as
easily be called ``Coppola: The Man and His Dream.'' Out of the
true story of Preston Tucker, a 1940s visionary whose dream of a
better, safer and cheaper car suffered a head-on collision with
Detroit, Francis Ford Coppola has fashioned a fable of American
can-do-ism. Jeff Bridges is brashly charming as the
huckster-inventor who wanted to do things his way, not the company
way (read, Francis vs. the Hollywood studios). This project had
obsessed the director for years. At one point he asked Frank Capra
to produce, but the elder statesman of cinematic optimism turned
him down after reading the script. ``I don't think we can make
this,'' Capra said. ``Because, in the end, Tucker didn't get his
dream. Are you saying in America you can't make your dream come
true?''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Ronin'' (1998): The title _ something to do with
dispossessed samurai _ makes about as much sense as the plot, which
has something to do with modern ronin (Cold Warriors without a war)
hired to snatch a mysterious suitcase. The gang includes Robert De
Niro and Jean Reno, which right away suggests something out of the
ordinary. Bt the film's true stars are a pair of high-speed car
chases _ one through the narrow, twisting roads in and around Nice,
France, the other through the heart of Paris. Longtime director
John Frankenheimer knows a great ride is a great ride. And that's
what he delivers. Twice. The script, written by David Mamet under a
pseudonym, is a canny match for Frankenheimer's bold, self-assured
style. You're probably thinking, What about the car chases in
``Bullitt'' and ``The French Connection''? Yeah, I know. Check out
``Ronin.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Great Race'' (1965): This period slapstick farce was, at
the time, the most expensive comedy ever produced (it cost $12
million). Built around a transcontinental car race at the turn of
the century, the movie is director Blake Edwards' tribute to silent
comedies (sometimes, I must say, an overblown tribute, including
the largest pie fight ever staged). The vintage cars are exquisite
to look at, as are stars Tony Curtis and Natalie Wood. He's the
hero in white competing with a comically villainous Jack Lemmon
(who even has a mustache to twirl); she's an intrepid, Nellie
Blye-ish reporter. Unfortunately, the stars didn't get along so
hansdomely off-screen. Reportedly, when asked whether there would
be a wrap party, Edwards said: ``Natalie and Tony are going to set
each other on fire.''

WILLING TO TAKE A WALK IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Ariz., New Zealand, Australia)   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By HOWARD FEINSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The films that I want to do are perceived as a
little bit risky and dark,'' the director Alison Maclean says. Now
that is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Maclean languished in director hell after her debut feature, the
defiantly noirish psychological thriller ``Crush,'' which she shot
in New Zealand in 1992, piqued the interest of a number of American
critics and producers. ``I moved to New York right after `Crush'
and have spent most of the last eight years writing three feature
scripts,'' she says. ``Two seemed like they were almost fully
financed, then fell apart. It's definitely been a frustrating time.
Then this came at me from left field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' is ``Jesus' Son,'' an adaptation of Denis Johnson's
collection of interwoven short stories about alienation, ennui and
drugs in the American heartland in the 70s, which Maclean shot
early last year in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Arizona. It has
proved to be a godsend, pardon the expression. Not only did it
offer her the chance to get back behind the camera for a feature
film, it successfully transcended its $2.5 million budget. It has
received excellent reviews at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals
and at the recent New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of
Modern Art. (Lions Gate will open the film on Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   Maclean, a tall, lean, slightly androgynous woman who looks a
lot younger than her 41 years, is sitting in the living room of her
unpretentious West Village apartment, which is ultraminimalist save
for a bit of furniture and several sculptures she made as an art
student in New Zealand. She says she was approached by the
co-producers and screenwriters of ``Jesus' Son,'' Elizabeth
Cuthrell and David Urrutia, who had just optioned the book. They
had seen ``Crush'' and Maclean's 1989 short, ``Kitchen Sink,'' and
considered her a perfect match for the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted someone who could create a strong sense of tension
that could link Denis' fragmented stories,'' Cuthrell says. ``We
called Alison. She called back in 10 minutes and said: `You don't
understand. This is a book I dearly love.' We met the next day, and
that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   The finished film is fragmented, though accessibly so. Its
structure mimics the mind-set of its protagonist (Billy Crudup), a
heroin user/drinker/petty thief/voyeur/layabout with an unprintable
nickname _ its initials are F.H. _ while he makes his way across
the United States trying to find himself. Essentially an innocent,
F.H. is also a spiritual seeker. (The film's title comes from Lou
Reed's lyrics to the Velvet Underground song ``Heroin.'') He
encounters a motley assortment of wacky, amoral guys, like Georgie
(Jack Black), a hilariously incompetent emergency room orderly with
whom F.H. works as they pop uppers and downers simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   F.H. falls in love with Michelle (Samantha Morton), a tragic
young woman who also shoots up regularly and is the character
closest to those in Maclean's own scripts. F.H. hallucinates all
sorts of things, often objects with religious associations. His
fantasies are not surreal or heavily exaggerated in the style of
Terry Gilliam's ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' or the
psychedelic films of the '60s. They are more akin to what Maclean
calls ``a slightly heightened reality, part of the fabric of daily
life.'' On a snowy night, F.H. walks through a drive-in movie
theater dotted with car-speaker stands and experiences it as a
cemetery with gravestone crosses. In the film's central scene, he
imagines a sacred heart emerging from the chest of a thin, scruffy
man whom he's followed from the Chicago El into a laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   Maclean says that the religious iconography of the book and the
script was one of the project's main attractions. She is interested
in Buddhism. Her mother, Mary Forrest, a potter, lives the
spiritual life in a New Age sort of way, to the point where,
according to one of Maclean's old friends, she dangles crystals
over her food before eating. (Maclean's parents divorced when she
was a teen-ager.) Her maternal grandfather, on the other hand, was
a Christadelphian, a strict fundamentalist who taught his family to
deny themselves pleasure (including movies) and placed
Christ-affirming banners on his front lawn. Those probably would
have caught F.H.'s eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I liked about the project is that there is a lot
of comedy in it, and a lot of optimism as well,'' says Maclean,
who, for someone with such a somber oeuvre and reserved demeanor,
has a deep, endearing laugh. The humor in ``Jesus' Son'' is very
black, but the film is far less disturbing than her earlier work
(in addition to ``Crush'' and ``Kitchen Sink,'' she wrote and
directed four shorts in New Zealand), and those screenplays over
which she has been tenaciously laboring in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She is willing to go for lighter fare _ she directed the first
two episodes of ``Sex and the City'' for HBO _ but her own
sensibilities lead her on precarious journeys into the unconscious.
``I do choose the difficult path,'' she concurs. ``I'm not sure
why.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some clues are provided by Bridget Ikin, a New Zealander who
lives in Sydney, Australia, and a close friend; she produced
``Crush'' and three of Maclean's shorts. ``For me, the journey that
Alison's taken to New York, living as a single woman, hacking it
out for eight years now, has been beyond,'' Ikin says. ``We could
have happily continued to make films together, but Alison always
goes for the hard option. I don't think it's any coincidence that
one of the projects that took her to the States was a film from her
own script of `Moby-Dick.''' (Maclean's version, which she herself
says she ``hijacked,'' has a female Ishmael.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Alison is a troubled person, embattled with demons that she's
dealing with,'' Ikin adds. Like several other longtime associates
of Maclean, Ikin feels that she suffers for her art. ``What
interested me about the work I produced for her was her use of
personal material,'' she says. ``The scripting for `Crush' was a
completely torturous process.
</P>
<P>
   ```Crush' was about an anxious moment in her relationship with
New Zealand, about her sense of alienation from that culture, about
female sexuality and desire, about shifting sexuality and about
shifting power relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Maclean says: ``There's something ominous in me somewhere. I
love the warts-and-all people.'' The two main characters in
``Crush,'' both women, are a New Zealand journalist, Christina
(Donogh Rees), and an American opportunist, Lane (Marcia Gay
Harden), who just might be lovers. Lane is responsible for
Christina's becoming paralyzed in a car accident; she then abandons
Christina and assumes her identity to gain access to _ and
ultimately have a love affair with _ a noted author, Colin (William
Zappa), who lives with his teen-age daughter, Angela (Caitlin
Bossley). Angela becomes lovingly obsessed with Lane, then does a
flip and begins to intensely hate her. At film's end, the severely
damaged Christina musters the energy to climb out of her wheelchair
and, just when you think she's going to hug and forgive Lane, she
shoves her off a cliff, an incident witnessed by the horrified
Angela.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ikin: ``Alison is the young girl, Angela, desiring
the powerful American woman. America is this metaphor of power and
desire, the longing to be in the other, more exotic, unreachable
place. In fact, Alison's never felt at home in any country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' reflects its director's outsider status. ``I
think the film has a European sensibility,'' says Maclean, who
lived in Canada, New Zealand and Australia before moving to New
York. ``It's in the framing, in the way there is a certain distance
or detachment, a certain remove, which is really my temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   On the commercial front, her feelings of estrangement have
resulted in collisions with some powerful people. She came to the
United States at the behest of Disney's Touchstone Pictures, with
the idea of developing projects. The one that most appealed to her
was ``Up Close and Personal'' (eventually directed by Jon Avnet,
starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Redford). ``I read Alanna
Nash's `Golden Girl,''' Maclean says. ``It was about the TV
anchorwoman Jessica Savitch, who had a bad cocaine habit and died
young in this freak car accident with her boyfriend. It was dark
and tragic. I was interested in the real story. But Joan Didion and
John Gregory Dunne, who at that point had written a few drafts of
the screenplay, were interested in `The Star Is Born' element for
the film. They turned Savitch into an ingenue.'' (Dunne's 1997 book
``Monster'' lays at least some of the blame on Touchstone
executives.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Touchstone and I agreed that we disagreed,'' she continues.
``It was a perfectly amicable parting of the ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so with ``Bedlam.'' Maclean was hired by the producer Ruth
Charney to rewrite a John Sayles script based on an atmospheric
1946 thriller produced by the legendary Val Lewton, and then direct
the film. ``Bedlam'' was to be a vehicle for the actress Illeana
Douglas, then the girlfriend of Martin Scorsese, who was the
executive producer. Set in the 18th century, it is the tale of a
Quaker who tries to expose the conditions inside an insane asylum
and who himself becomes an inmate. Douglas was to play his love
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alison was attracted to all aspects of it,'' Charney says.
``It had a lot of morality lessons.'' After much tinkering, Maclean
finally gave up trying to tailor the screenplay to suit Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alison didn't see Illeana in the role, and that is where it
all broke down,'' Charney says. ``Alison is a very moral person, so
she told Marty herself. She was willing to risk her career to do
that. She's incredibly pure that way.'' According to several people
who were involved, Scorsese hit the roof. (Both he and Maclean have
declined to elaborate.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that the reception for ``Jesus' Son'' has changed her luck,
Maclean has been able to begin her next project, ``Iris,'' the
third of the scripts gathering dust at home. To be financed by New
York's Good Machine and Britain's FilmFour, and produced by Good
Machine's Ted Hope, the film could go into production as early as
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iris'' is a contemporary, supernatural, psychological tale
``about a woman who starts remembering things from her childhood
that didn't happen,'' Maclean says. ``One of the things it deals
with is sexual abuse of a child as a metaphor. The deep dark secret
of the family turns out to be that there is not a dark secret.''
But the film is dark nonetheless, and that sounds like Alison
Maclean at her most deliciously unadulterated.  &QL;

MTV MOVIE AWARDS: AND THE WINNER FOR SHORTEST AWARDS SHOW IS ...

<P>
   If nothing else, the ``MTV Movie Awards'' proves to be terrific
public relations for Tom Cruise (as if he needs any). Playing
himself, in a sly spoof of ``behind the scenes'' documentaries, he
is the foil for Tom Crooze, his overeager stunt double, whom Ben
Stiller portrays astutely, with grasping self-importance.
</P>
<P>
   Crooze is a familiar Hollywood type: the underling who mistakes
his association with stars for actual stardom. Dressed in classic
Cruise-wear (black T-shirt, black jeans, black sunglasses), the
Stiller character says haughtily to the fight director for
``M:I-2'': ``I've done 14 films with Tom. I have a pretty good idea
of what Tom wants.'' Of course, what Tom wants _ and gets _ is for
Crooze to step in when it's time for a fist to make contact with
Cruise's face. But he's also sympathetic to his double's plight.
Flashing his best movie star smile, Cruise says of Crooze, ``He's
harmless.'' The spoof works so well that Cruise's magnanimity feels
authentic, not scripted.
</P>
<P>
   The awards show also offers an amusing animated satire. As
punishment for misbehaving at school, the characters from ``South
Park'' face Maximus, the hero of the hit ``Gladiator.'' Just as
Maximus prepares to impale them on his sword, John Travolta drops
in from outer space with a crew of Scientologists, a nod to
``Battlefield Earth,'' the new Travolta movie based on the L. Ron
Hubbard novel.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest, at least it's brief _ 90 minutes, compared with
the numbing four-hour Oscar presentation _ which is the advantage
of a taped, edited program versus live television. In that vein,
give the best presenter award to Nicolas Cage for admirable
succinctness. Striding briskly onstage and apologizing for the
laryngitis that attractively thickens his voice, Cage yells out his
line: ``They've all been kissed, chased, stalked and
double-crossed, and for their hard work they've all been nominated
for best female performance!'' Cut to the clips.
</P>
<P>
   The show began eight years ago as a frisky alternative to the
Oscars, with awards categories like best kiss and best fight. The
prize remains a bucket of gilded popcorn, reflecting the populist
leanings of the awards. Nominees are distinctly not high-minded.
``American Beauty,'' which swept the Oscars, is a blip at the MTV
proceedings, a failed contender for best movie, nothing more.
Perhaps honoring the show's desire to be unconventional, MTV
viewers _ who decide the winners _ give the best kiss award to two
women, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Selma Blair, for their vigorous
bussing in ``Cruel Intentions.''
</P>
<P>
   But except for a more casual, sometimes ostentatiously sloppy
dress code, the MTV awards conform to many Hollywood standards.
Lists are pulled from pockets so the appropriate parties can be
thanked, including agents, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg offers the only political note. Presenting the
best villain award with George Clooney, he says, ``Let's give it to
Charlton Heston for being the head of the NRA.'' Instead, the prize
goes to Mike Myers for ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Poor Sarah Jessica Parker seems rightfully uncomfortable with
her role as spokesmodel. Mocking the Oscar obsession with dresses,
she changes outfits 12 times, appearing onstage in a bizarre
collection of revealing concoctions. But they aren't as silly as
the most outrageous Oscar get-ups, so the joke fizzles.
</P>
<P>
   Though many of these costumes are extremely revealing, none are
as embarrassing as the decision to have Parker flirt awkwardly with
Clooney, rocking back and forth in one of her many gowns like a
giggling teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   She is far more at ease playing a more familiar role, in an
opening sequence that manages to combine ``Sex and the City'' with
``The Matrix.'' While no Billy Crystal, she also is charming as she
performs a singing homage to last year's films. ``They filled us
with joy and laughter and hope for a better tomorrow,'' she says
with mock sincerity, before singing the wistful ``Imagination''
from ``Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' to a backdrop of
gory and grotesque film clips.
</P>
<P>
   More frequently, however, vulgarity is substituted for
irreverence and foul language mistaken for wit. If a smart joke
replaced every obscenity, the show would be hilarious. Instead, it
is often merely crude.

NEW L.A. SCHOOLS CHIEF: AN UNLIKELY CHOICE FOR AN INTIMIDATING
JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ Roy Romer is no stranger to politics. As governor
of Colorado for 12 years, and then general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee for two years, he has seen his share
of infighting, bureaucracy and blood feuds.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps nothing could prepare Romer, 71, for his latest
assignment, as superintendent of the sprawling Los Angeles Unified
School District, the nation's second largest, with 711,000
students, a budget nearly two-thirds the size of Colorado's, and a
list of problems that would stretch from here to Denver: lagging
test scores, severe overcrowding, dilapidated buildings and a
burgeoning population of new immigrant children who speak every
language but English.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the toughest jobs a guy could find,'' said
Romer, virtually the only candidate to seek a job that few wanted,
after his appointment was hastily announced on Tuesday. Though his
appointment was unanimous, at least two of the seven members of the
school board said they had voted for him with some reluctance,
after a search conducted largely in private, and after several
other candidates, including the school board's favorite, former
U.S. Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros, either turned down the job
or expressed little interest.
</P>
<P>
   Romer had the support of influential business leaders, including
Eli Broad, the billionaire executive and philanthropist, who
suggested he apply. He has a longstanding interest in education
policy and was active in national efforts to improve public
education by imposing rigorous standards and goals.
</P>
<P>
   But he has never lived in Los Angeles or run a school system,
and is little known among the city's diverse communities, including
Hispanics, who make up 70 percent of the district's student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bad Fit for the LAUSD,'' is how The Los Angeles Times
greeted Romer's appointment in its lead editorial Wednesday
morning, saying it was ``like choosing a spouse based on which
suitor is most eager; it doesn't make the strongest basis for a
long-term relationship.'' The board was rushing to meet the
self-imposed July 1 deadline for the departure of its interim
superintendent, Ramon C. Cortines, who took on the job last fall
after the ouster of the former superintendent, Ruben Zacarias.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the tragedy is that he was deprived of any opportunity
through the selection process to learn more about Los Angeles and
for Los Angeles to learn more about him,'' Thomas A. Saenz,
regional counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and
Educational Fund, which has filed various lawsuits alleging
inadequacies in the California public schools, said of Romer.
``It's not his fault; it's something they've done to him, and we're
obviously hopeful that he will be a person who seeks to reach out
to the community and incorporate its ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a brief telephone interview Wednesday as he headed to
Sacramento to testify before the state Board of Education, Romer
insisted his first priority would be to introduce himself. He said
he had been looking for ways to start a national policy discussion
on education and decided there was no better approach than to
practice what he has been preaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, it was a crisis of conscience,'' he said. ``I
said, `Romer, do you want to start a think tank or do you want to
go on the street and walk your talk.' This is the last job I intend
to take, so I am very free. I don't have any agenda that I'm
working on. I can come into this job and really call it as I see
it. I recognize it's a tougher job than I had as governor, and will
take more time and energy, but I thought this was the most
important thing I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Romer's first tasks will be to help Cortines select
superintendents for 11 new semi-autonomous subdistricts, which the
board agreed to create in an effort to head off demands for
breaking up the district altogether. The reorganization is to take
effect on July 1, the same week Romer takes over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked with unions, he is very fluent in educational
issues,'' said Day Higuchi, president of the United Teachers of Los
Angeles union, which is in the midst of contract talks. ``I think
maybe the time is right to try going out of the box a little. L.A.
Unified has more students than the smallest 29 states put together.
So having a governorship may not be bad qualifications.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer, an intense, energetic man, was forced out of office as
Colorado's governor by term limits in 1998, and friends say he
seemed a bit bored being out of harness.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton named him to head the Democratic National
Committee in 1997, when the party organization was tangled in
fund-raising controversies from the 1996 campaign. In 1998, Romer
saw his reputation tarnished by his acknowledgment of a 16-year
``very affectionate relationship'' with a former female aide, and
he stepped down from the party chairmanship last year to
concentrate on planning its national convention in Los Angeles this
summer, which is how he first got interested in the schools job.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, Romer led the development of early-childhood
education programs, created a centralized child-care referral
system and intervened to halt a teachers strike in Denver in 1991.
In the early 1990s, he was co-chairman of the National Council on
Educational Standards and Testing, an advisory group that
recommended national curriculum standards.
</P>
<P>
   Now, said Caprice Young, one of the school board members, ``the
real challenge and the real test is whether he can take us from
policy through implementation, and that is not easy in a school
district the size and complexity of L.A.Unified.'' She added, `I
think on balance, the board believes that he can get there.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cisneros, who is now president of Univision, the
Spanish-language television network, turned down the
superintendent's job for family reasons, but urged Romer to pursue
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an incredibly diverse school district and city, and
requires a great deal of understanding of the different roles that
parents play in different cultures and about how education works,''
Cisneros said. ``Governor Romer has some experience in Colorado but
generally that's a much more homogenous state. It is a challenge
which he is up to, he's a wonderfully wise man. But I think
there'll have to be some real tilt toward understanding on those
issues.''

 &HT;    Computer manufacturers and consumers to benefit from Microsoft
ruling
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The biggest winners in a Microsoft Corp. breakup may
be the computer makers and customers who have been dependent on the
software giant that dominates about 90 percent of the world's
desktops PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers such as Dell Computer Corp. should get more
leverage in dealing with Microsoft, and customers could have
greater choice in selecting individual products for the computers
they buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you were really tied down because Microsoft made you
buy their applications,'' said Amir Ahari, an industry analyst at
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ``You'll see tools that are leaner and
a bit more bug-free because they don't have the Windows (operating
system) to hide behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition will be more pervasive,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision Wednesday to
break the company in two, the case, of course, isn't over.
Microsoft plans to appeal, which would delay Jackson's ruling even
if it's upheld.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the PC industry say that much of the impact of
Wednesday's ruling has already been felt. Since the antitrust case
began two years ago, computer makers have managed to weaken
Microsoft's near stranglehold on the PC industry. Manufacturers
such as Dell and Compaq Computer Corp., the two biggest PC makers
in the world, are still reliant on Windows. But already they've
started to embrace the Linux operating system. Dell officials
regularly note in conference calls with analysts the growing
popularity of Linux among Internet companies who buy its servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Linux is alive at all is a product of this
(case),'' said Roger Kay, an analyst with International Data Corp.,
a research firm based in Framingham, Mass. ``(Microsoft has) been
able to totally stifle other competitors in the past that were a
threat to their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers politely sidestep the issue of whether they've got
more bargaining power. Compaq _ which emerged as one of the most
staunch, full-throated defenders of Microsoft by the end of the
case _ argues the breakup will be bad for the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said Compaq spokesman Alan
Hodel. ``(But) we would continue to partner with the companies that
would result and do what we have to do. Obviously, it's easier to
deal with one company than with multiple companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials said that company will deal with Microsoft in
whatever forms the company takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has got lot of products people want,'' said Dell
spokesman T.R. Reid. ``Whether it comes from one company, two
companies or three companies, that's less significant. Provided
customers still want those products, we will provide those products
to them, regardless of the source.''
</P>
<P>
   For computer makers, the relationship with Microsoft has been an
uneasy one. But because Windows emerged several years ago as the
top choice by customers, they've been linked by necessity to the
products coming out of Microsoft's Redmond, Wash. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has been strained in recent recent years as
computer prices have dropped about 25 percent a year, Microsoft's
software prices have remained fairly constant.
</P>
<P>
   But a major reason for the emergence of Linux, aside from being
cheap or even free, is that it's a lean system that's easily
customized. Windows is viewed by many as increasingly bulky and
rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux is good for Microsoft in that a post-split company would
be a lot more focused and dedicated to being more innovative and
responsive to market instead of being Big Brother,'' Ahari said.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt, however, that Microsoft will remain the
industry's 800-pound gorilla for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be sort of the beginning of the sunset years for the
Windows monopoly, but it's only the beginning,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In corporate (accounts), they've got five years before they
can totally disentangle from Windows, given replacement cycles.''

WHEN TO START? HOW ABOUT NOW?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: One of two sidebars to PIANO-LESSONS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When to start? Stay attuned to your child's emotional, mental
and social development. Some children are ready to start music
lessons at 3 or 4, but they are rare.
</P>
<P>
   For many children, 6 is a good age; starting piano lessons and
full days of school at the same time will crowd some children but
will be just the right formula for others. It's never too late to
start, either; 8, 9 or 10 is a very good age for first piano
lessons, and any student of average ability will catch up quickly
to those early starters who had lessons at 5.
</P>
<P>
   Don't purposely wait for the teen-age years to begin lessons,
but don't necessarily be afraid to start at that age, either.
Teen-agers catch up quickly to an advanced level, and a kid who
practices regularly can play ``Happy Birthday,'' a Bach invention,
hymns at church or the latest pop arrangement for their friends
within a year. And by all means, consider lessons for your own
inner child at age 35, 40 or 85.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, students who have some piano ability go into band,
choir or school orchestra with an added advantage, and usually land
in first chair within a few weeks. Piano is the best starting point
for picking up any other band or orchestral instrument in late
grade school or middle school; one of the greatest singers of our
age, tenor Placido Domingo, concentrated on the piano during his
youth.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you are aiming at the 2013 Cliburn Competition, don't be
afraid for your early starter to take a sabbatical year at 7 or 8,
when many children are so socially active that sitting at the piano
for half an hour a day is pure torture. Just go into the year off
with the notion that the child will be back at the piano at 8 or 9,
when there's enough maturity to take on a task like practicing
alone for half an hour a day.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to comprehend by ``reading'' notes _ although not
necessarily reading words _ is absolutely necessary. This can be
beneficial in either direction: A child who can already read is in
good shape to start learning to read music, and a child who can
read music is in good shape to learn to read words.

<P>
   THE PIANO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expect to spend $3,000 for a decent, new acoustic spinet piano
that will take a young student through a decade of lessons; if
you're willing and able to spend more, a very good Steinway upright
is a reasonable choice (actually better than comparably priced baby
grands) at about $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to start on the cheap, a digital electronic
instrument, at about $1,000, will get a beginner through the first
year or two. Beyond that beginner period, the student will need an
acoustic instrument, however. It's a matter of paying more now or
paying more later.
</P>
<P>
   Buying a used piano is about like buying a used car. Unless you
really know what you're doing, it's a risk. If you think you have a
good deal going for a beautiful 1929 Steinway, find a piano
technician in the Yellow Pages and pay $50-$100 to have him or her
to look it over before you buy.
</P>
<P>
   Getting your acoustic piano tuned is no more optional than
changing the oil in your car. That means $50-$100 twice a year; get
a referral from the store where you buy the piano. Please, don't
expose your piano to direct sun or a cold north wall, or place it
in within 10 feet of a lighted fireplace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE LESSONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expect to spend $50-$100 a month for weekly half-hour lessons
for a beginner. In return, expect the teacher to be well-educated,
with a bachelor's degree in music or music education.
</P>
<P>
   Most teachers charge monthly. Don't expect a refund for days off
for the flu, baseball games or the reasonable vacation the teacher
takes at Christmas and the end of summer: The teacher still has to
make the mortgage payments, keep the air conditioner running and
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Again, don't stint. Pay extra for a teacher you trust who has a
good reputation, and don't complain about paying for music, or
festival and contest entry fees, which can run $10-$30 a month.
Having access to plenty of good printed music (the teacher will
either pick it up at the music store for you or let you know where
to buy it) is as necessary as having up-to-date textbooks in
school. And playing in festivals and contests is part of the
experience of connecting with the larger community of pianists.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, it's your job to provide time and kind, gentle
encouragement for daily _ that's right, daily _ practice at home.
Gimmicks and rewards don't work nearly as well as simply making the
piano part of the routine of home life. Taking lessons yourself, to
get a little extra benefit of your own out of the weekly trek to
the piano studio, is a superb example for your child.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour a day of practice is ideal for the student of
average intelligence and ability at the early stages, although that
should expand at more advanced levels; fifteen minutes six days a
week beats two hours once a week anytime.
</P>
<P>
   To find a music teacher, start with recommendations from
professional musicians or friends who have a student in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Or call a professional association. &QL;

(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My editor summoned me into his office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed you leave the office early every Friday
afternoon,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gulp.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because you're taking your son to his piano lesson, I
understand,'' he continued. ``Would you write a column about why
you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Aaaah.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason _ a good one _ that I leave deadlines
dangling, phone calls unanswered and expense accounts unfiled every
Friday afternoon. It goes back to long before I was born, to rural
Oklahoma in the midst of the greatest economic disaster in American
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grand Ol' Opry'' on the radio provided most of the music for
Depression-era folks who lived on the mostly rented dirt farms
north of Lindsay, Okla., where my mother grew up. That and a little
fiddling at square dances, a few hymns at church.
</P>
<P>
   But my grandfather, whose skills (after his third-grade
education) included raising crops and livestock, rolling cigarettes
while driving a pickup and talking bankers into loaning him money
to buy land, for some reason wanted his daughter _ my mother _ to
play the piano.
</P>
<P>
   About 1935, he bought a converted player piano from a movie
theater and moved it out to the farm. He drove my mother into town
for lessons some weeks. Other times, he talked the local
schoolmaster, who had a daughter the same age who also took
lessons, into driving the two girls into town together.
</P>
<P>
   Many years afterward _ and many mules, tractors, cattle, trucks
and acres later _ he happened to be within earshot of my mother as
she played the piano. He was overheard to say, ``Those piano
lessons were the best money we ever spent.''
</P>
<P>
   The legacy continued. My mother gave me my first piano lessons
on the same converted player piano. My playtime as a preschooler
was accompanied by waltzes of Chopin, sonatas of Scarlatti,
impromptus of Schubert.
</P>
<P>
   When I had my own son, I knew what to do. Although I never gave
him lessons myself, I drove him to his lessons whenever I could and
sat through festivals and contests. Along with his mother, I
indoctrinated him with the idea that being able to play the piano
is right up there with being able to read.
</P>
<P>
   It's an expense, but it's also an investment _ not necessarily
one that pays off in financial returns, but one that pays off in
human enrichment. A decent, budget-conscious instrument will cost
$3,000 to $10,000. That's about half the cost of a budget-sized
car, which will wear out in five years; a piano will last about 50
years, and will provide infinitely more pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   If you can play the piano, you can ``own'' a prelude of Chopin
or a sonata of Mozart. That, friends, is as good as owning a sketch
by Rembrandt or Picasso.
</P>
<P>
   Commune with Bach or Beethoven or Joplin. Play a fugue of
Shostakovich, and understand, on a spiritual level, what it was to
live in Stalin's Russia _ and know, beyond doubt, that even in the
most degraded level of human existence, the intellect and the
spirit transcend.
</P>
<P>
   Play an intermezzo or waltz of Brahms, and understand that
passion and intellect can be organized and combined. Wake your
brain every morning with an interactive conversation with Haydn;
exercise your coordination, clean out your mind, keep your memory
working.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime near the end of the 21st century, when I am long gone
and my son is old, he will sit down at a piano and play a bit of
Debussy or Shostakovich or Bach.
</P>
<P>
   It was something my grandfather, who never knew my son, and who
never heard of Debussy or Shostakovich or Bach, wanted him to have.

tacked on attorneys fees to mortages that had gone into default.
There are two plaintiffs from Athens named in the suit and their
lawyers are trying to get a class action declaration from the
judge. Jim Walter's registered agent is in Cobb. The company builds
homes in 22 states. Lawyers for the plaintiffs say that the fees
were added to the principal and the plaintiffs were never told

 &HT;    The Heat Goes On
 &HT;    By Diana Blowers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you have a vegetable garden, you probably have
peppers. If you don't have a vegetable garden, you may have peppers
tucked among the ornamental plants.
</P>
<P>
   Few vegetables, except tomatoes, can beat peppers in the garden
popularity contest. The bell pepper is a longstanding tradition,
but hot peppers are quickly gaining in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The bell pepper is often mistakenly referred to as a mango, but
a mango is an unrelated tropical fruit. Neither are sweet and hot
peppers related to the ground black pepper usually coupled with
salt.
</P>
<P>
   Often bell peppers are referred to as ``green peppers,'' but
they are only green because we pick them before they ripen. When
allowed to ripen, they turn red, orange, yellow, purple or even a
chocolate color, depending on the cultivar.
</P>
<P>
   A bell pepper takes two to three weeks to turn color after it
has reached its mature size. This delay often leads the impatient
gardener to pick peppers before they have a chance to change color,
Richard Funderburg, owner of Funderburg Greenhouses, said.
</P>
<P>
   A popular bell pepper this year is the `Blushing Beauty,' chosen
as a 2000 All-American Selection by the nonprofit All-American
Selections organization that for 67 years has tested and introduced
improved flowers and vegetables. `Blushing Beauty' begins with a
pale green or ivory color and then takes on a pastel pink blush
before turning a deep rosy red at maturity.
</P>
<P>
   All bell peppers have a similar taste, according to Dave Scott,
general manager of Knollwood Garden Center, but the different
colors add to their visual appeal in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new hybrids, probably the most requested bell pepper
is still the `California Wonder.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an old-time pepper. It's open pollinated, not
hybridized, so it's not crossed with anything else,'' said
Funderburg, who raises a variety of heirloom plants. A newer
cultivar that is becoming quite popular is the `Lady Belle,' he
said, because it continues to produce during extreme heat, when
many peppers' blooms fall off.
</P>
<P>
   Hot peppers are becoming hot gardening items, Scott said.
Although they often come with hotness ratings, the heat in the
peppers will be affected by growing conditions and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   People often make the mistake of planting a very hot pepper next
to a mild, sweet pepper, Funderburg said, but because of
cross-pollination, the sweet pepper may ``become quite hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Chile peppers have been one of the biggest sellers in the past
three or four years, especially for use in salsa, Funderburg said,
pointing to `Anaheim' and `Garden Salsa' as two of the more
popular. Among the popular hot peppers are jalapeno, super cayenne,
super chile, and the habanero. One habanero, `Red Savina,' is
``probably one of the hottest peppers in the world,'' Funderburg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Peppers are sometimes selected not just for their hotness but
also for their beauty, said John Evers, owner of Evers' Country
Gardens in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some use them for decoration,'' he said. ``Like the Thai hot
pepper _ it's pretty. It's a little bitty pepper, but it is very
decorative.''
</P>
<P>
   Evers, a third-generation grower of peppers, has more than 20
varieties and marvels at how ``they just keep on getting better and
better,'' becoming not only more productive but also more disease
resistant.
</P>
<P>
   He has a couple of tips for gardeners:
</P>
<P>
   _ Peppers like hot days and warm nights. People who plant them
early, say in April, ``are pretty much wasting their time,'' Evers
said, because ``they really don't grow until it gets hot.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I highly recommend a slow-release fertilizer, like Osmecote
. . .,'' he said. ``This stuff is so good that one application will
last the entire growing season.''
</P>
<P>
   TYPES OF PEPPERS
</P>
<P>
   Sweet Peppers:
</P>
<P>
   _ `Blushing Beauty': All-American Winner. Bell pepper, matures
to red.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Peppourri': Bell pepper that starts out with a bit of a
lavender color and matures to purple.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Gypsy': This tapered or wedge-shaped yellow pepper is one of
the earliest peppers to mature.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sweet banana: Long, yellow pepper that matures to red.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Parks Whopper': Very large bell pepper, good for stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   _ `California Wonder': An old standby bell pepper that turns red
at maturity.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Lady Belle': Continues to produce even in extreme heat. Turns
red at maturity.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Jingle Bells': One of the first to fruit, it is a compact
plant good for container gardening.
</P>
<P>
   _ `Bell Boy': A large bell pepper good for stuffing.
</P>
<P>
   Hot Peppers:
</P>
<P>
   _ Anaheim: Dagger-shaped fruit. Matures from green and mild to
red and hot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Poblano: Moderately hot, heart-shaped fruit, used widely in
Mexican cooking and called ancho when dried.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thai hot: Very small plants with small, cone-shaped green
fruit that matures to one of the hottest red peppers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jalapeno: Deep green fruit that matures to red. One of the
hottest.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hungarian yellow wax: Yellow fruit that turns red at maturity.
Moderately hot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Habanero: One of the hottest. Turns from light green to
orange.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red chile: Green fruit matures to red. Very hot.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red cayenne: Yellow fruit turns flaming red at maturity. Very
hot.

A PRIZEWINNING WRITER HOLDS ONTO HIS DAY JOB AS A FUNERAL
DIRECTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILFORD, Mich. _ Here is Thomas Lynch, poet, National Book Award
nominee for nonfiction, and mortician, sitting in the tactfully
muted light of his office at Lynch &AMP; Sons, Funeral Directors, and
wearing his day job uniform, a somber, dark three-piece suit.
</P>
<P>
   All around, it is quiet. Nearby are the embalming and selection
rooms, the latter filled with coffins of walnut and ebony and pine,
lined with silk and velvet. But Lynch's office is a little
different from that of most funeral directors. Propped up in the
shadows are framed poems for the possible comfort of the grieving.
</P>
<P>
   There is W.H. Auden's ``Funeral Blues'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
</P>
<P>
   Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
</P>
<P>
   Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
</P>
<P>
   Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a humorous poem by Lynch's friend the Irish writer
Matthew Sweeney, about the two of them picnicking out on the ice on
a lake, and falling through.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who is 58, is waiting for a woman to deliver a baby in a
local hospital. The baby has died in utero, and when it is born, he
or one of his people will prepare it for burial. If asked, Lynch
will recommend that the mother be allowed to view her child in its
tiny coffin. ``Anyone who removes from her the right to witness
what happened is not doing a service to her,'' he said. ``Her sense
of attachment to her child began sooner than the death of her
child.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is inevitable: Why would Lynch want to do this kind
of work? After all, he has won publication of a second book of
essays, ``Bodies in Motion and at Rest'' (Norton); the first,
``Undertaking,'' prompted Richard Bernstein to praise him in a
review in The New York Times as a cross between Garrison Keillor
and Yeats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like being a funeral director,'' Lynch said. ``If
you're a teacher you really have to wonder if you have an impact on
people's lives. As a funeral director, in town we know immediately
if we've been a force for good in the lives of the families we
serve. They not only pay us but they also thank us.''
</P>
<P>
   Being a funeral director is ``a way to minister'' to people,
Lynch said. A funeral director is like the ``sin-eater'' in Celtic
culture, a kind of secular priest who symbolically eats the sins of
the community, he said. ``On the one hand, they're appreciated, and
on the other held in contempt,'' he said. ``People are glad to have
some one to call when there's a dead body on the floor; on the
other hand they don't want to get too close to them.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Lynch tell it, the jobs of funeral director and poet are
quite alike. ``The arrangement of flowers and homages, casseroles
and sympathies; the arrangement of images and idioms, words on a
page _ it is all the same,'' he writes in his new book, ``an effort
at meaning and metaphor, an exercise in symbol and ritualized
speech, the heightened acoustics of language raised against what is
reckoned unspeakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good funeral, like a good poem, is driven by voices, images,
intellections and the permanent,'' he continues. ``It moves us up
and back the cognitive and imaginative and emotive register.''
</P>
<P>
   Both funeral directors and poets favor wearing black, he notes.
Plus, both groups have a penchant for ``free drink and horizontal
bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Lynch goes about his jolly way through the streets of
this pretty town with its brightly painted gingerbread houses,
population 15,000. He buries about 200 of his fellow townspeople a
year. He knows people by name, exchanges jokes with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good to see you,'' the manager of the local restaurant, The
Appeteaser, tells him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good to be seen _ considering the alternative,'' says Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch is an honorary Rotarian. Spotting the town clerk and
treasurer having a retirement celebration, he has drinks sent
``over to the rowdy women,'' as he calls them.
</P>
<P>
   And not all his writing is about death. In the new collection
there are essays on sex, alcoholism _ his father's, his own and
that of one of his sons _ about writer's block, about fishing.
</P>
<P>
   One essay is about how much he hated the family cat, a gray
angora much beloved by his son Michael; the cat tore up all the
furniture and also tried to kill Lynch _ he is convinced _ by
crouching on the stairs so he would trip over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the boy who loved her,'' he writes, ``I had to abide
its miseries, its contemptuous green eyes fixed on me with
long-established indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch has also written a poem about the cat: ``Mounds of
furballs littering the house / choking the vacuum cleaner,'' was
part of his litany of complaints. ``Mice / that winter indoors
safely as she sleeps / curled about a table-leg, vigilant / as any
knick-knack in a partial coma.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the cat is ``out in the ground dead, thank God,'' he said in
the interview. ``And there's a stone in the ground to prove it.''

 MILFORD: prove it.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lynch is a largely self-taught poet. His father, Edward, was a
funeral director, and seven of his nine children now either own
funeral parlors or work in them.
</P>
<P>
   The constant presence of death made its mark upon his father,
Lynch said. Because he buried so many children who died prematurely
from illness or accidents, Edward Lynch developed an overweening
terror about the mortality of his own children, fretting whenever
they fell sick or suffered scratches or bruises. It is a terror
that Lynch said he has inherited.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynches were a family that relished language. ``Our dinner
tables were full of contention and argument,'' Lynch said. ``We
loved to throw an idea out and argue it to death.''
</P>
<P>
   He was introduced to poetry through the prayers his mother
taught him:
</P>
<P>
   ``Angel of God, my guardian dear,
</P>
<P>
   to whom God's love commits me here ... ''
</P>
<P>
   ``My first attraction was acoustic,'' he said. ``I knew sounds
had great magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch attended Catholic schools and his religion remains
important to him, though he says he attends Mass irregularly. He
went on to Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., where one of his
teachers was the poet Michael Heffernan. Until he met Heffernan he
didn't think that he could be a poet, that ``to be a poet you had
to be a hippie,'' Lynch said. But he saw in Heffernan, who had a
Buick, a mortgage and a family, ``an ordinary citizen writing
poems.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980 Lynch sent a poem over the transom to Poetry magazine.
It was called ``A Death,'' and it was about a childhood friend who
died of a brain tumor at 32. The poem was accepted. Then Heffernan
suggested that he send his poems to Gordon Lish, an editor at
Knopf. Knopf accepted them and Lynch's first book, ``Skating With
Heather Grace,'' was published in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Another collection followed, ``Grimalkin and Other Poems''
(1994). In 1997 came the National Book Award nomination for a book
of essays, ``The Undertaking,'' which was followed by another
collection of poems, ``Still Life in Milford'' (1998).
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who was divorced in 1985, has four children from that
marriage: Thomas, 26, a fishing guide; Heather, 25, a law student;
Michael 22, a community college student; and Sean, 20, who works at
Lynch &AMP; Sons. When Lynch and his first wife separated in 1984,
their youngest child was 4. The divorce left him with primary
custody of the children. In his new book, he describes the moment
the marriage ended: ``I knew she had arranged to meet her lover. I
sat on a log on the beach with the children, watching the lake and
knowing it was finished. I got a sinker from my tackle box and,
with a bit of shoelace, fashioned it into a kind of necklace. When
she returned from her assignation, I asked her to walk with me down
the beach. I gave her the little necklace and said she'd convinced
me'' that the marriage had to end.
</P>
<P>
   From the break-up also came the poem ``For the Ex-Wife on the
Occasion of Her Birthday'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Tumors or loose stools
</P>
<P>
   blood in your urine, oozing from any orifice
</P>
<P>
   the list is endless of those ills I do not pray befall you.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Lynch was remarried, to Mary Tata, a designer. In ``The
Nines,'' his epithalamium, or marriage poem, for Tata, which was
published in The New Yorker, a man reckons how many years of
happiness he has left with his beloved:
</P>
<P>
   ``Darling, I reckon maybe thirty years,
</P>
<P>
   given our ages and expectancies.
</P>
<P>
   Barring the tragic or untimely, say,
</P>
<P>
   ten thousand mornings, ten thousand evenings,
</P>
<P>
   please God, ten thousand moistened nights like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The next year, Lynch's father, by then a widower, died while he
was with a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors tell him `Easy Does It, Ed _ six weeks, six
months, who knows,'' Lynch wrote of his father's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid excitement, stimulation, sex
</P>
<P>
   with any but familiar partners.'''
</P>
<P>
   In another poem he imagined his father's ghost appearing to him:
</P>
<P>
   ``He lets me hold him, hug him,
</P>
<P>
   weep some, wake repaired again,
</P>
<P>
   says he'll take my kisses home to her,'' his dead mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch and his brother prepared their father's body for burial,
embalming it themselves, just as one day, he says, his brother will
do for him.
</P>
<P>
   These days Lynch is in great demand as a speaker at conventions
of funeral directors. Many funeral parlors are being bought up by
large companies, and he worries that this will bring about a
reduction in the services offered the bereaved, the gestures and
ceremonies that help people mark the death and life of those they
loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funeral has changed from an intergenerational to a
narcissistic thing,'' he said. `'It used to be a thing given by the
living to the dead. Now it is by the dead to the living. We're
going to save time and money, the bother of the funeral, you won't
have to take a day off from work. Just use your gold card and
disappear!''
</P>
<P>
   Funeral directors, like poets, are an endangered species, Lynch
says. ``Whenever funeral directors get together they talk about the
fact that no one likes funerals,'' he writes in his book.
``Whenever poets get together they talk about the fact that no one
likes poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the work of the funeral director and the poet are the mark
of a civilized society, Lynch argues, bringing form and scrutiny to
the dangerous questions. ``Both press our attention to the
existentials, the adverbials,'' he writes, ``the sensual and
overwhelming questions, the mysteries and certainties of life and
death.''

STUDENTS AND COUNTERTERRORISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the bombings of the World Trade Center, the federal
building in Oklahoma City, the El Khobar dormitory of US soldiers
in Saudi Arabia, and, most recently, two US embassies in Africa,
there should be no doubt about America's need to have the best
possible strategies for identifying terrorists and preventing their
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A report issued this week by the 10-member National Commission
on Terrorism recommends several policies. Some of them have
properly stirred debate, however, because they either impinge
unnecessarily on civil liberties or would institute ineffective
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The foreword to the report acknowledges a need to strike ``the
appropriate balance'' between effective counterterrorism policies
and America's ``democratic traditions.'' But the commission's call
for monitoring the courses of study of foreign students in this
country signifies not only a violation of America's democratic
traditions, but also a pointless surveillance of the wrong suspect
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign students here have had hardly any role in terrorist
attacks against Americans. Instead of trying to monitor every
visiting student who changes his or her major from history to
physics, the federal government should be making an honest effort
to determine the true identity of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of
the World Trade Center bombing who arrived in New York with one
Iraqi passport and left with someone else's Pakistani passport.
</P>
<P>
   If Yousef was working with Iraqi intelligence, then perhaps
counterterrorism policy should be weighted more toward prevention
of state-sponsored terrorism rather than the ``loose networks'' of
religious fanatics who have become prime suspects.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is correct, however, to suggest that Washington
be less tolerant of Pakistan and Afghanistan as states that sponsor
or protect terrorists. Most terrorism still has an address _ a
government that can be held responsible for backing or sheltering
the vile cowards who kill civilians to terrorize an entire society.

   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Ledeall: A federal judge
ordered the breakup of Microsoft Corp. on Wedsnesay, saying the
severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft ``has proved
untrustworthy in the past'' and did not appear to be taking
seriously his previous rulings against the company. ``There is
credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft,
convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in
the past and may yet do to other markets what it has already done''
in the markets discussed during the long antitrust trial, Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson said in his ruling. The judge accepted the
government's remedy proposal in its entirety, without alteration,
utterly rejecting Microsoft's repeated assertions that the breakup
plan was ``extreme,'' ``unwarranted'' and ``bad for consumers, the
high tech industry and our economy.'' Microsoft said it would
appeal the ruling immediately. By Joel Brinkley.

   MICROSOFT-ASSESS (Undated) _ With his final order Wednesday in
the Microsoft antitrust case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said
``yes'' to the government one more time. He has agreed with the
government, almost without qualification, on the facts of the case,
on the law and now on the harsh remedy of splitting the company in
two. In Jackson's court, the result has been not just a defeat for
Microsoft but a rout, not a closely fought legal contest but a
judicial ratification of the government's case. Yet the
two-year-old case is far from over. And with a year or two of
appeals ahead, the chances of Microsoft ever being broken up are
uncertain. Microsoft will try to reverse every element in Jackson's
ruling that the big software maker is a monopoly that has
repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws, stifling
competition and innovation. A news analysis by Steve Lohr.

   NON-EDUCATOR-SUPERINDENDENTS (San Diego, Calif.) _ The
superintendent of San Diego schools, Alan Bersin, is a former U.S.
attorney for southern California, and one of the first of a new
breed of high-profile outsiders taking over big-city school
districts. On Tuesday, the Los Angeles board of education named Roy
Romer, the former Colorado governor, as its new superintendent.
Last month, Harold O. Levy, a corporate lawyer, was chosen to lead
the New York City school system, the nation's largest. They are the
first non-educators ever chosen for those jobs. Other urban
districts, too, have turned to law, business government and the

   CHRISTIAN-THRILLER (Wheaton, Ill.) _ The latest thriller in a

Sunday, an unprecedented achievement for a Christian novel. The
book, ``The Indwelling,'' by Tim LaHaye, an evangelical minister,

GOING SOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Puffy TV ads promoting Vice President Al Gore will deservedly
cost him at least a couple of bad press days. The ads represent a
retreat from an offer he made in March to bar the use of soft money
by the Democratic National Committee in the presidential campaign
unless the Republicans went first.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Gore is going forward with the ad campaign anyway
demonstrates how badly the system is broken _ how essentially
corrupt it is.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago, after the two other leading candidates, John
McCain and Bill Bradley, made campaign finance reform a core
initiative, Gore attempted to stake a claim to the issue by
challenging Texas Governor George W. Bush as follows: ``I challenge
you to accept my proposal that we both reject the use of soft money
to run issue ads. I will take the first step by requesting the
Democratic National Committee not to run any issue ads paid for by
soft money unless and until the Republican Party'' does.
</P>
<P>
   Now Gore's supporters are equivocating, saying that Gore made a
challenge, not a pledge, and it became void when Bush failed to
agree. Further, they say, while the Republican National Committee
has not aired any ads, independent groups supporting Bush, also
using unregulated contributions, have.
</P>
<P>
   Neither argument changes the fact that Gore has taken one more
step in turning an issue that should be a political plus _ since
his policy position aligns well with public opinion _ into a
liability. Given the fund-raising phone calls from the White House,
the Buddhist Temple fund-raiser, and new criticism from the FBI,
Gore should be marrying reform.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore is already under fire for waffling on some
other issues.
</P>
<P>
   There has obviously been a judgment in the Gore camp that the
flattering ads will more than compensate for the political price of
changing positions and using soft money. But the ads themselves _
promoting Gore in key electoral states _ make a mockery of the
notion that they are intended as ``party building,'' the loophole
by which the toothless Federal Election Commission allows this
outrage.

TELEFONICA CHAIRMAN TRIES TO REVIVE MERGER TALKS WITH KPN,
EXECUTIVES SAY
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Juan Villalonga, the chairman of Telefonica, the
Spanish telecommunications company, has been trying to rally
support among board members to revive merger talks with the Dutch
telephone operator Royal KPN, executives close to Telefonica said.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga was embarrassed last month when his board succumbed
to political pressure from the Spanish government and Spanish banks
and rejected a $58 billion merger with KPN that Villalonga had
sought. Opponents argued against the deal in part because the Dutch
government would be the biggest shareholder in a merged company.
</P>
<P>
   The failed merger was viewed by telecommunications industry
analysts as a major setback for Telefonica, once a state-owned
monopoly. With KPN, Villalonga had hoped to create a pan-European
network of fixed-line, data and wireless services with the size to
compete against the likes of Vodafone Airtouch PLC and France
Telecom, which recently agreed to buy Orange PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to Telefonica, Villalonga has been
making private overtures to several of the nine board members who
voted against the merger, asking them to reconsider. The executives
cautioned that Villalonga was far from winning the support he
needed to restart talks with KPN, and might decide to abandon the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of Telefonica's 20 board members officially voted for the
deal, nowhere near the unanimous approval regarded as necessary for
such an important change in the company. Some opponents had
privately voted a day earlier in favor of the merger, the
executives said. Villalonga hopes to persuade them to create enough
support to at least return to negotiations with KPN.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, KPN remains somewhat interested in combining with
Telefonica, but only if Telefonica's board fully supports the deal,
executives close to KPN said.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger talks fell apart, KPN's chairman, Paul Smits,
accused the Spanish government and the banks of interfering. ``We
have no interest in an internal political process,'' he said.
``It's not about a merger of emotions, it's about a merger of
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   KPN believed that without the complete support of both
management boards, no deal was possible, Smits said. ``You have to
have a merger with passion con amor and with total commitment for
it to work.''

   Smits apparently remains interested in a merger with Telefonica,
perhaps even more so now because of its relationship with Lycos,
the Internet company based in the United States, the executives
said. They stopped short of saying he would necessarily endorse
resuming negotiations with Telefonica, however, because of the
messy ending to their last merger attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Terra Networks, the Internet unit of
Telefonica, acquired Lycos for $12.5 billion. If KPN and Telefonica
merged, the combined group would be one of the largest Internet
companies in Europe with a strong foothold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   KPN and Qwest, which is based in Denver, are working together in
Europe to create a high-speed network. KPN's mobile arm, KPN
Mobile, also recently entered into an alliance with the Japanese
mobile communications giant NTT DoCoMo, an added attraction for
Villalonga.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Telefonica declined to comment on whether
Villalonga was working to restart talks with KPN. A spokesman for
KPN could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Telefonica stressed that it was too early to
tell whether the company's board was committed enough to reaching a
deal with KPN to justify new talks. One executive said he expected
that a decision on whether Telefonica would try to restart talks
would be made within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts questioned whether Villalonga could revive enough
interest among the board members to try to negotiate a deal with
KPN and whether a deal could in fact be consummated. Nonetheless,
analysts said the deal would be beneficial to both companies,
pointing out that shares of both fell significantly after the
original talks collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be a marriage made in heaven,'' said John Tysoe, a
telecommunications analyst at West LB Panmure in London. ``But some
marriages of convenience end up working out well.''

 &HT;    Microsoft will likely continue to dominate software market
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At almost every software store in the United
States, vast aisles crammed with computer games, word processors
and educational tools written for Windows engulf the tiny, barely
visible shelves bearing Macintosh or Linux programs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Wednesday's ruling, that's not likely to change in the
near future. Spinning off Microsoft Corp.'s Windows system into a
separate, smaller company can't make that dominance disappear _ and
as a result, programmers scripting new software are still likely to
build it around the world's most widely used operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, this will give smaller developers an edge,'' said
S.P. Rana, co-founder of Austin software company Exterprise Inc.
``Before, many weren't interested in doing anything with Windows
because they figured, sooner or later, Microsoft would do it. But
separating Windows from Microsoft's software unit will let others
write with more freedom, and feel empowered to do more for what is
still the dominant operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers, the split will likely feel like a price pinch.
Microsoft will no longer be bundling Windows with its popular
Office software like Word and Excel, meaning shoppers must pick up
those pieces separately and likely at higher cost, according to
analyst Rob Enderle of California-based Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with a lengthy stretch of legal appeals on the way,
shoppers may have more imminent problems with things like
customer-service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people depend on Microsoft support, and the company has
trouble holding employees during the turmoil, then that support
will degrade,'' Enderle said. ``Over the next 18 months (of a
probable appeals process), dealing with Microsoft will be more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   That period of lingering legal turmoil is a boon for Microsoft
competitors. Having reaped benefits from the Microsoft backlash,
companies like Oracle Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. may face
hefty pressure to truly prove themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of excitement created by people like Oracle,
but most of it was based on anti-Microsoft feeling as opposed to
what they're doing and what's good about them,'' Rana said. ``Once
that bogey disappears, they have to rethink their strategy and find
a positive way to sell what they do.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Microsoft, the new software company could turn
competition to its advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Free of its filial ties to Windows, it could start scripting
programs for systems that were once Microsoft's nemeses _
specifically, the reborn Apple Computer Corp. Macintosh system and
the upstart Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would immediately begin writing for Linux and anything
else they could think of,'' said Roger Kay, an analyst with
International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ``Why shouldn't they
write Office for Linux? They write Word for the Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Allcorn, a member of the Central Texas Linux Users
Group, said even that strategy might not entice all Linux users to
abandon the up-and-coming system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Office 2000 available for Linux, but if it's
going to win with many fans it has to be all the programs and not
just Word,'' said Allcorn, a computer consultant. ``But there's a
whole other side of Linux users who are tired of Microsoft products
and won't touch anything with that name on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The split is expected to make pieces of much-guarded Microsoft
programming code more widely available to software developers,
which could make it simpler for people to create programs
compatible with Windows-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   That flurry of activity, plus severed filial ties with the
software-creation arm of Microsoft, should put healthy pressure on
the Windows company to make its operating system friendly to
developers, and more reliable for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say the Windows unit would be smart to dabble
in other operating systems _ specifically, by making its own
version of Linux, becoming less a Windoes-centric entity and more
of a general operating-systems company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at automobiles _ Ford did a heck of a job building a
better Jaguar than Jaguar itself could make,'' Enderle said. ``When
it comes to controlling the market, Microsoft could be closer to an
Intel. Handling another OS wouldn't be a bad thing if Microsoft
could do it differently and even better than anyone else has done
it yet.''

   MEXICO-VOTEBUY-0611 _ SAN PEDRO EL ALTO, Mexico _ Maria del
Carmen Peralta has little more than corn and beans to feed five
children. Her family has no bathroom and they sleep in a hut that's
a virtual ice box at night in this cold mountain region of Mexico
state. Peralta's life has been so harsh she wants to finally vote
for an opposition candidate in Mexico's July 2 presidential
election. But she's frightened that her vote might cost her the $45
a month supplement she receives from Progresa, a federal welfare
program here. Although it is illegal, Peralta's welfare coordinator
</P>
<P>
   confirms that she has been under pressure to instruct Progresa
recipients to vote for Mexico's ruling party on July 2 _ or suffer
the consequences. Other impoverished Mazahua Indians in this rugged
rural area have similar

   COKE _ BRUSSELS _ Last year's disaster with contamination in
Belgium has prompted Coca-Cola to completely change the way it does
business in Europe. The company has decentralized power from
Atlanta, placing much more control in the hands of its new European
divisions, which were aligned to reflect more ``natural markets.''
The company's European managers want to bring in Europeans to run
the business and become more sensitive to the continent's cultures.
For example, the company has abandoned hopes of trying to persuade
the French to abandon wine in favor of Coke and is instead trying
to find a way to ensure that its products have a place in French
consuming culture. Also, things seem to be normal in Belgium.

Mitrovica. Evidence shows that the KLA _ the armed separatist group
many give at least partial credit for causing the Serb crackdown _

   JOURNAL-CUBA-0615 _ HAVANA, Cuba _ Jesus Perez toiled for
decades on a collective farm in Cuba's tobacco fields, frustrated
that the once-fertile plot he tended near Pinar del Rio west of
Havana produced such meager crops. Then came the early 1990s and
Cuba's ``Special Period'' _ the economic crisis brought on by the
end of Soviet subsidies. Desperate to raise hard currency,
government officials saw world-famous Cuban tobacco as a valuable
resource. Hoping to spur production, they turned over some fields
tended by collective workers to individuals like Perez. In eight
years, Perez has boosted his field's production from about seven
100-pound bales of tobacco a year to 35 to 40 bales annually. Along
the way, he's also boosted his own earnings from 1,000 pesos per
year to 7,000 per year. He also has great pride in his leaves,
which are used to make some of Cuba's finest and most expensive
cigars. (Williams).

 &HT;    PENTAGON CONTRACTORS MAKE REPEAT APPEARANCES ON FRAUD LIST
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top Pentagon contractors, including Lockheed Martin
Corp., Raytheon Co. and Rockwell International Corp., paid fines
totalling $434 for defective pricing, inflated costs, kickbacks and
defective products, according to a list released by Congress on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The procurement fraud list, put together by the U.S. General
Accounting Office (GAO), covers January 1995 through September 1999
and includes several companies which also appeared on a comparable
GAO list for the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there is a continuing pattern of fraud and
abuse at some of our nation's largest military contractors,'' said
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who had asked the GAO, the investigative
arm of Congress, to make the new report.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin noted that none of the companies on the list had been
debarred from future federal contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has cracked down on individual criminals who commit
multiple crimes,'' he said. ``It's time to consider a 'three
strikes and you're out' law for repeat criminal Pentagon
contractors as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO list included eight companies that have pled guilty and
paid fines totaling $66 million in criminal fraud in procurement.
In 95 civil cases, companies have paid $369 million. Those numbers
are considerably lower than during the previous five years, when
defense spending was increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Glen Flood said that he had no information
about the contracting fraud list. However, he said that debarring
contractors in such cases ``is not an automatic thing.'' Banning a
company from doing government work generally requires the Justice
Department to take legal action, Flood said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the criminal cases, the largest involved Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems, a division of Lockheed Martin, the Bethesda,
Md., based defense giant. The company pled guilty in 1995 to making
payments to a member of the Egyptian Parliament and paid $24.8
million in fines and restitution. Some individuals involved were
debarred from government contracting for three years, but the
company was not.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed, which has a major aerospace plant in Marietta, Ga.,
and is the chief contractor for the new F-22 aircraft, also paid
more than $8 million to settle civil cases involving allegations of
defective pricing, labor overcharges and contractor kickbacks. And
Martin Marietta, which has now merged with Lockheed, paid more than
$3 million in awards to settle procurement fraud and defective
pricing cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed spokesman Jim Fetig on Wednesday said that in response
to past ``business concerns,'' the company has since instituted
``an award-winning business ethics programs that is one of the very
best in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate waste fraud and abuse, and we act promptly
when it's discovered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the GAO list:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hughes Aircraft Company, which merged with Raytheon in 1997,
paid $6.66 million in civil settlements in various cases involving
accusations of altered tests, failure to do tests on fighter
aircraft, missiles and tanks as well as charges of substandard
parts for torpedoes. Hughes was named in procurement fraud cases in
the 1988-95 list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rockwell International, based in Seal Beach, Calif., paid
nearly $24 million in 1995 to settle allegations that it hid
reductions in B1-B bomber costs. The company also paid $5.5 million
in criminal fines in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   _ Philips Components and Philips Electronics, divisions of the
Dutch company Royal Philips Electronics, paid the government $55.6
million in 1996 after charges that employees had falsified test
records in weapons testing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pratt &AMP; Whitney, the aircraft division of United Technologies
Corp., which has a factory in Jupiter, Fla., agreed to pay $14.8
million in 1997 after allegations that employees had funneled $10
million in U.S. aid to retired Israeli military officers. The
company denied having knowledge of the scheme.

 &HT;    Microsoft shareholders will likely reap rewards of company's
splitBy Amy Schatz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If previous breakups are any guide, a split of
Microsoft Corp. would likely be a boon to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been few breakups of a company the size of
Microsoft, federally-enforced divorces generally yield impressive
returns to stockholders, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Most point to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s split into the current company and
the seven regional telephone companies in 1984 and the breakup of
Standard Oil into 33 companies in 1911. Both splits yielded
impressive returns to investors _ something that IBM Corp. was
unable to deliver after it successfully appealed its antitrust
breakup in 1982.
</P>

   ``The split-up of AT&AMP;T clearly led to innovation _ new pricing
plans, wireless technology. The old AT&AMP;T had horrendous rates that
had no connection with the actual costs of calls,'' said Sandeep
Dahiya, an assistant professor at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T shareholder in 1984 who held on to his shares (of AT&AMP;T
and each of the seven regional Baby Bells) would have seen the
value of his holdings increase more than 1,000 percent by the end
of 1999, according to Dahiya's research. That works out as a
compounded annual return of 16.4 percent. ``If all you did was hold
onto your shares you would have beaten the S&AMP;P 500 handily,''
Dahiya said.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, IBM has returned an average of about 11 percent
since 1984, the year it successfully won its antitrust battle.
During that time period, the S&AMP;P 500 returned average gains of
about 14.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people would argue that IBM shareholders would have
done better if the company had broken up,'' said Michael Murphy, an
analyst with the California Technology Stock Letter, an industry
newsletter. ``Historically, breakups have always been good news.
IBM went into a decline for about 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The distinction is an important one to most investors _ even
those who don't know that they're invested in the company.
Microsoft is one of the most widely-held stocks in the country and
a favorite of pension funds and institutional investors. For
example, Microsoft makes up the largest equity position in the
Teacher Retirement System. The $86 billion fund currently holds
about 16 million shares of Microsoft with a market value of about
$1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the country's largest mutual funds _ Fidelity's Magellan
fund and Vanguard's Index 500 _ both have more than 4 percent of
their assets tied up in Microsoft stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an investor, (the breakup) is probably going to be a
non-event,'' said Louis Kokernak, senior equities strategist at
Martin Capital Advisors, a portfolio manager and investment
advisory firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has had plenty of time to prepare for this. If I'm
a shareholder of Microsoft, I'd hold if not accumulate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue for shareholders is not what will happen if the
company is ultimately broken up, but how the stock will perform
during the long appeals process. ``Markets don't like uncertainly.
You'll probably see Microsoft take some whacks from time to time,''
said Kokernak.

 &HT;    Microsoft shareholders will likely reap rewards of company's
splitBy Amy Schatz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ If previous breakups are any guide, a split of
Microsoft Corp. would likely be a boon to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been few breakups of a company the size of
Microsoft, federally-enforced divorces generally yield impressive
returns to stockholders, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Most point to AT&AMP;T Corp.'s split into the current company and
the seven regional telephone companies in 1984 and the breakup of
Standard Oil into 33 companies in 1911. Both splits yielded
impressive returns to investors _ something that IBM Corp. was
unable to deliver after it successfully appealed its antitrust
breakup in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``The split-up of AT&AMP;T clearly led to innovation _ new pricing

 &HT;    Computer manufacturers and consumers to benefit from Microsoft
ruling
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The biggest winners in a Microsoft Corp. breakup may
be the computer makers and customers who have been dependent on the
software giant that dominates about 90 percent of the world's
desktops PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers such as Dell Computer Corp. should get more
leverage in dealing with Microsoft, and customers could have
greater choice in selecting individual products for the computers
they buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you were really tied down because Microsoft made you
buy their applications,'' said Amir Ahari, an industry analyst at
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ``You'll see tools that are leaner and
a bit more bug-free because they don't have the Windows (operating
system) to hide behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition will be more pervasive,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decision Wednesday to
break the company in two, the case, of course, isn't over.
Microsoft plans to appeal, which would delay Jackson's ruling even
if it's upheld.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the PC industry say that much of the impact of
Wednesday's ruling has already been felt. Since the antitrust case
began two years ago, computer makers have managed to weaken
Microsoft's near stranglehold on the PC industry. Manufacturers
such as Dell and Compaq Computer Corp., the two biggest PC makers
in the world, are still reliant on Windows. But already they've
started to embrace the Linux operating system. Dell officials
regularly note in conference calls with analysts the growing
popularity of Linux among Internet companies who buy its servers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Linux is alive at all is a product of this
(case),'' said Roger Kay, an analyst with International Data Corp.,
a research firm based in Framingham, Mass. ``(Microsoft has) been
able to totally stifle other competitors in the past that were a
threat to their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers politely sidestep the issue of whether they've got
more bargaining power. Compaq _ which emerged as one of the most
staunch, full-throated defenders of Microsoft by the end of the
case _ argues the breakup will be bad for the computer business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said Compaq spokesman Alan
Hodel. ``(But) we would continue to partner with the companies that
would result and do what we have to do. Obviously, it's easier to
deal with one company than with multiple companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Dell officials said that company will deal with Microsoft in
whatever forms the company takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has got lot of products people want,'' said Dell
spokesman T.R. Reid. ``Whether it comes from one company, two
companies or three companies, that's less significant. Provided
customers still want those products, we will provide those products
to them, regardless of the source.''
</P>
<P>
   For computer makers, the relationship with Microsoft has been an
uneasy one. But because Windows emerged several years ago as the
top choice by customers, they've been linked by necessity to the
products coming out of Microsoft's Redmond, Wash. headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship has been strained in recent recent years as
computer prices have dropped about 25 percent a year, Microsoft's
software prices have remained fairly constant.
</P>
<P>
   But a major reason for the emergence of Linux, aside from being
cheap or even free, is that it's a lean system that's easily
customized. Windows is viewed by many as increasingly bulky and
rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linux is good for Microsoft in that a post-split company would
be a lot more focused and dedicated to being more innovative and
responsive to market instead of being Big Brother,'' Ahari said.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt, however, that Microsoft will remain the
industry's 800-pound gorilla for the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be sort of the beginning of the sunset years for the
Windows monopoly, but it's only the beginning,'' Kay said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In corporate (accounts), they've got five years before they
can totally disentangle from Windows, given replacement cycles.''

UNDATED:a lot more.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A bad girl meets a bad end, but not before the reader gets a
lot of voyeuristic pleasure out of the journey,'' wrote voluptuous
``Star-Telegram'' food maven Beverly Bundy of ``Forever Amber,''
the novel by Kathleen Winsor. ``I read it in college, and I still
thought it was dirty.''
</P>
<P>
   From a blond bombshell business writer came ``Flame and the
Flower,'' by Kathleen Woodiwiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read it when I was 13, the perfect age for trashy romance
novels,'' she offered. ``I'd have to refresh my memory, but I
believe if followed the classic romance outline: ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that the synopsis made me blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best soft-core porn I've ever encountered,'' dark, dashing
classical music critic Wayne Lee Gay raved about ``Valley of the
Dolls'' by Jacqueline Susann.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't beat the descriptions,'' another business vixen
wrote of ``Scruples'' by Judith Krantz.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after an hour or so of the deluge, I had to put a stop
to it. In a bit of a panic, I composed a second message, zapped
into computers across the editorial department.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK folks. Let's all calm down and get our little collective
minds out of the gutter,'' I scolded, before going on to clarify
just what I meant by trashy novel. ``Not that the gratuitous sex
that appeals only to the prurient in us isn't included here, but
not exclusively. ... So calm down, for crying out loud. Cyberspace
was literally searing with all your responses, all those e-mails
about this book or that book which taught you about the birds and
the bees in junior high, or, in Beverly Bundy's case, college.
Reconsider. Ponder.''
</P>
<P>
   Most staffers only scoffed. All my clarification served to
accomplish was to reveal myself as a prude who would have been
right at home in the age of Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``You set yourself up, big guy,'' Texas travel writer and
worldly sophisticate June Naylor Rodriguez responded to my second
message. ``In the age of Jerry Springer, trash means one thing to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A villainous Northeast Star-Telegram reporter was less
charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You spent too much time in the frozen North,'' he sneered.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, my second message was not completely fruitless. Mickey
Spillane and Agatha Christie finally surfaced in the responses. As
did John Grisham and Scott Turow, Michael Crichton and Stephen
Coonts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can participate under the new rules,'' Arlington
editor Matthew Brady wrote, reassuringly. ``My favorite pulp
fiction writer is Dick Francis, the British ex-jockey who writes
mystery stories that revolve around the world of racing. Great
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but what do you expect from a goody-two-shoes who used to
cover religion? And this relatively tasteful response
notwithstanding, I am not consoled. I still feel virtually alone in
my definition of trash. Trashy novels, it seems, have gone the way
of ... well, trash. Somewhere, Travis McGee, my knight-errant hero,
takes a sip of gin, sits on his houseboat, watching the brilliant
orange sun disappear on the horizon, and sadly shakes his head.

ONE MAN'S TRASH IS ANOTHER MAN'S ...WELL, YOU KNOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First let us ponder the meaning of the term ``trashy novel.'' I
have recently come to discover that my definition of trash and that
of most of the rest of the English-speaking world are hopelessly at
odds.
</P>
<P>
   First, mine.
</P>
<P>
   To me, labeling a novel trash is not a pejorative thing.
``Trash'' is merely a book that falls short, sometimes just short,
of literature. In my simple mind, a book is either one thing or the
other. Literature typically calls our attention to the human
condition. Trash allows us to escape it. Literature typically
requires a quiet room and concentration. Trash can be consumed
while simultaneously watching ``The Practice.'' Great literature
inspires deep thought and profound emotions. Trash, generally
speaking, does not.
</P>
<P>
   My trash is populated by private detectives, spies, cops, a
sultry blonde here and there, romantic subplots, moderate body
counts and generous sprinklings of sex, although graphic
descriptions of the same are not necessary or even preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Examples: My favorite trash of all time is the Travis McGee
series by author John B. MacDonald. McGee is a lifelong cynic and
loping hunk of a private detective, who reluctantly leaves his
Florida houseboat to confront various bad guys in yarns with
color-themed titles, (''Bright Orange for the Shroud, The Empty
Copper Sea, Free Fall in Crimson.'') The adventures are punctuated
by McGee's pithy observations on contemporary life, and by his love
interests. He sips Boodles gin after a hard day. He refuses to grow
up, to conform. I still remember the sad day 13 years ago when I
picked up the newspaper to learn that MacDonald had died, taking
Travis to the grave with him.
</P>
<P>
   Today I'm still in mourning, and determined to seek out McGee
titles I haven't read. But one must move on. So I also currently
await the latest from espionage legend John LeCarre, though his
elegant way with the language, penetrating insights into the darker
side of humanity and his character development probably qualify his
books as literature. But that's another argument.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, I have recently discovered the 87th Precinct novels
of Ed McBain, mesmerizing stories that flirt with the status of
literature, too, but are too entertaining to quite get there.
Daniel Silva's three recent novels (''The Unlikely Spy; The Mark of
the Assassin; The Marching Season'') more safely fit into the
category of trash. They are slick, well-written thrillers full of
international intrigue that is convincingly rendered. The latter
two Silva titles feature a studly hero, CIA agent Michael Osbourne,
a rather cynical fellow who only reluctantly takes on the bad guys.
McGee-esque, you might say.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe you get the idea. That's what trash means to me. I
thought the term conjured up pretty much the same image for most
people. Boy, was I wrong.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The voice of ``Texas Monthly'' senior editor Skip Hollandsworth
positively purred when he returned my call. A few minutes earlier,
I'd left a message on his voice-mail, inquiring about his favorite
trashy novel of all time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wedding scene of `The Godfather', Page 66,'' Hollandsworth
replied without even saying, ``Hi.''
</P>
<P>
   That page of Mario Puzo's Mafia tale was dog-eared by
Hollandsworth and his fellow junior high school boys in Wichita
Falls a few decades ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was passed around my homeroom and I read the sex scene at
the wedding. Somebody got married and the bride and Sonny had sex
up in a room,'' Hollandsworth said, his words quickening at the
memory. ``I can remember this feeling of blood coursing through my
veins, and I went, `This is the power of literature.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Actually, it was Pages 27 and 28. And it was the coupling of
the bridesmaid and Sonny Corleone, not Sonny and the bride. I found
the book and read the pages closely, just for accuracy's sake.)
</P>
<P>
   And so it went. That same day, my newsroom-wide e-mail similarly
soliciting nominations for great trash was greeted by that same
panting. Lots of panting. That afternoon, newspaper cyberspace
sizzled. Judging from the newsroom reaction, somewhere between
puberty and college, the average ``Star-Telegram'' staffer learned
of carnality from books their parents didn't know they were
reading. Naughty books. Not a spy or detective tale in the bunch.
``Bodice-ripping'' was the operative term. I grew up in a fairly
repressed slice of rural Minnesota. So thus, on that recent
afternoon, I was appalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohhh ... There's so many,'' gushed a sultry brunette from
online services. `` `Peyton Place' and `Return to Peyton Place' by
Grace Metalious. A New England town and its gossip. Better book
than movie. Or rather, the book got away with a lot more.'' MORE &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge issued a historic antitrust ruling
Wednesday that orders Microsoft Corp. to be split in two in order
to halt the company's unlawful behavior and restore competition in
the computer software industry.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ordered the part of
Microsoft that makes the Windows operating system to separate from
a new applications and Internet-based company. The two new firms
would have to compete on an arms-length basis for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also ordered broad restrictions on Microsoft's business
practices toward other firms in the computer industry, as well as
controls on many of Microsoft's internal activities.
</P>
<P>
   If sustained on appeal, the order would break up a giant
enterprise that in its 25-year lifetime has done much to define the
personal computer era.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dominates the worldwide market in operating systems
for small computers, earning annual revenues of more than $20
billion a year and holding a current market worth of some $371
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of one of the biggest battles in the annals of
antitrust law will be a series of appeals that could consume
several more years and will likely eventually be decided by the
U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials said they would seek a direct
expedited review by the high court under a rarely invoked 1970s law
that provides for short-circuiting the normal appeals process in
antitrust cases of vital national importance.
</P>
<P>
   All or part of Jackson's formula might be set aside pending the
outcome of the legal skirmishes, and the judicial order provides
that the breakup cannot occur until all appeals are exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, assuming it stands up to legal scrutiny, Jackson's
order is the most drastic antitrust action taken by the courts in
nearly 90 years. As one of the most successful engines of the
high-tech economy, Microsoft could find itself joining the ranks of
the former Standard Oil and American Tobacco trusts, which were
both broken up in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing why the world's biggest software firm needed to be
dismantled under the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act, Jackson wrote that
``Microsoft, as it is presently organized and led, is unwilling to
accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order
amending its conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge found Microsoft to be an ``untrustworthy'' defendant
whose ``purported compliance'' with an earlier 1995 court antitrust
injunction while it was being appealed was ``illusory.''
</P>
<P>
   In an 1,500-word memorandum that accompanied his sweeping order,
Jackson wrote: ``Microsoft has shown no disposition to voluntarily
alter its business protocol in any significant respect. Indeed, it
has announced its intention to appeal even the imposition of the
modest conduct remedies it has itself proposed as an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing 78 days of testimony from the bench and reviewing
scores of post-trial briefs, Jackson essentially upheld the
government's original contention that Microsoft had illegally
leveraged its Windows monopoly to try to crush its rivals and bully
its clients.
</P>
<P>
   His 5,800-word judicial order faithfully tracked a plan devised
by the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general after
intensive settlement talks had broken down.
</P>
<P>
   That April 27 filing triggered a series of back-and-forth briefs
from the company and the government. While serving to delay a
ruling that had been widely expected late last month, the exchanges
scarcely altered its final content.
</P>
<P>
   Said Attorney General Janet Reno: ``Today's ruling will have a
profound impact not only by promoting competition in the software
industry but also by reaffirming the importance of antitrust law
enforcement in the 21 century and the importance of competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing her words, Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein, who as
head of the Justice Department's antitrust division had brought the
landmark case in May 1998, said: ``The court's order is the right
remedy for Microsoft's serious and repeated violations of the
antitrust laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But across the continent, at Microsoft's Redmond, Wash.
headquarters, a defiant Bill Gates confidently predicted the
company he had co-founded would be vindicated on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe very strongly today is first day of the rest of this
case,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In a decisive preliminary ruling on April 3, Jackson sealed
Microsoft's fate in the trial court by finding company had flouted
the nation's antitrust laws in placing ``an oppressive thumb on the
scale of competitive fortune'' _ targeting rival firms that
threatened its powerful Windows software monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   In finding that Microsoft had used illegal means to dominate one
most dynamic sectors of the U.S. economy, the judge laid the
eventual groundwork for Wednesday's order to break up the world's
most valued software company.
</P>
<P>
   The remedial order and the earlier 43-page ruling flowed in turn
from Jackson's blistering ``findings of fact,'' issued last
November, in which he branded Microsoft as an abusive monopolist
that for years had run roughshod over competitors, strong-armed
clients, harmed consumers and throttled technological innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Even at this late stage of the judicial process, the litigants
could decide to try once more to settle the case, this time
probably through direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the case is still under appeal next year, a new
administration in place at the White House and the Justice
Department could also possibly move to reignite the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But barring any such an out-of-court settlement, or an unlikely
decision by a new administration to halt prosecution, the Supreme
Court will likely serve as the final arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup order, immediately available on the Internet, was
timed for release at 4:30 p.m. EDT, 30 minutes after the closing of
the major financial markets Prior to after-hours trading, Microsoft
stock had risen a modest 88 cents for the day, closing at $70.50 on
volume of 38,193,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company's uncertain future has dragged the company's stock
price down from a 52-week high of $119.94, reached in December
while failed settlement talks were showing some signs of progress.
</P>
<P>
   In his final memo, Jackson noted ruefully that ``the final
judgment proposed by plaintiffs is perhaps more radical than might
have resulted had mediation been successful and terminated in a
consent decree.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jackson has his way, so-called conduct-based remedies would
go into place well before the final structural breakup of the
25-year-old company comes to pass.
</P>
<P>
   They call upon Microsoft to stop pricing Windows in ways that
favor cooperative personal computer makers, to stop tying its
products to Windows in its sales contracts, to set aside all
exclusionary contracts and to stop driving sales up by raising the
price of older versions of Windows whenever a new version comes
out.
</P>
<P>
   Although what has now happened to Microsoft has been widely
compared with the breakup of AT&AMP;T in 1982, sharp differences can be
found between the two cases. AT&AMP;T was a regulated monopoly for
eight decades before it was broken up in a negotiated deal that
split off seven regional operating companies _ the so-called Baby
Bells _ while allowing the core firm to concentrate on
long-distance service and enter the computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, on the other hand, deals largely in intellectual
property _ the tens of millions of lines of computer code that go
into such products as the Windows operating system or the
applications suite known as Office.

   WASHINGTON _ If U.S. officials and major health organizations
have their way, french fries, pizza and colas will be banished from
school lunchrooms. Instead, students will be served more fruits,
vegetables, low-fat meats and low-sodium foods.
</P>
<P>
   With obesity rates of U.S. children at an all-time high, the
government and five health groups launched a program Wednesday to
stamp out most fast food, at least in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The groups and the Agriculture Department also urged an often a
slothful generation immobilized by the Internet, video games and
television to get more exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is imperative we do something to turn this situation around
for our children,'' said Shirley Watkins, under secretary of
agriculture for food and nutrition, at a news conference announcing
the food and exercise effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``School children are flunking healthy eating 101,'' said
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Javette Orgain, president of the National Medical
Association, which represents African-American physicians. ``There
is a national epidemic of childhood obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgain added that blacks have the highest obesity rates in the
country and that some inner city schools serve mainly
fast-food-type meals. In these schools, vegetables and fruits ``are
a rare sighting,'' Orgain said.
</P>
<P>
   The program to reverse the trend will start in many school
lunchrooms this summer. It seeks to promote healthy eating habits
ensuring that school lunchrooms serve meals that include selections
from several of the five major food groups _ fruits, vegetables,
milk products, proteins (such as meat, fish or beans) and the group
that includes bread, rice, pasta and cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The program will encourage students, parents and school
administrators to push for dietary changes in the lunchrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Bagley, president of the American Academy of
Physicians, said obesity in school-age children has stark
ramifications for the future because many obese children will
develop heart disease, diabetes and other life-threatening ailments
later in life.
</P>
<P>
   The health organizations joining the Agriculture Department in
the obesity effort are the American Academy of Physicians, the
American Dietetic Association, the National Medical Association,
the National Hispanic Medical Association and the American Academy
of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1970, about 6 percent of children aged 6 to 17 were
considered overweight. Now, nearly 15 percent of children 6 to 11
are overweight, and so are 12 percent of children 12 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 84 percent of high school students eat too much fat
and more than 91 percent eat too much saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only one in five high-school students eats the recommended
five daily servings of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ About half of students in grades K through 12 eat less than
one serving a day of fruit, and 29 percent eat less than one
serving a day of vegetables that are not fried.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Surgeon General's office, American
youngsters are increasingly sedentary. Nearly half of those aged 12
to 21 are not physically active on a regular basis. Only 19 percent
of high school students are physically active, and daily enrollment
in high school physical education classes has dropped from 42
percent in 1991 to 25 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is a severe problem in adults. The government estimates
that 300,000 deaths a year are directly attributable to poor diet
and physical inactivity.

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government was
thrown into tumult Wednesday when parliament, by a substantial
majority, approved a preliminary bill to disperse and head toward
new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the six parties in Barak's broad coalition voted
against him, including the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which has
been the prime minister's most temperamental ally and on Wednesday
ensured his defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The bill requires three more hearings to become law, and it
could end up being derailed by political maneuvering or the basic
desire of members of parliament to cling to their jobs and
perquisites. But Wednesday's vote, even if it does not provoke new
elections, could break up the governing coalition and create a
chaotic interlude at a diplomatically inopportune moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian final peace talks were supposed to
consume Barak's energies this summer. Instead, he may be forced to
devote considerable time to domestic negotiations _ ``What's next?
'' said his Cabinet secretary, Yitzhak Herzog. ``Poker.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak kept silent immediately after the vote, which was 61-48
with 11 of the 120 members absent. But Wednesday evening, he
addressed the nation with a completely unruffled manner. Saying
that the Cabinet would meet on Sunday and figure out how to
proceed, his advised all Israelis to relax, enjoy the holiday of
Shavuout, which begins Thursday evening, and trust him to restore
calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dust will settle,'' he said confidently. ``There aren't
going to be any elections.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, busloads of settlers were gathering outside his
residence to shout: ``Barak, go home! You have no mandate!''
Carrying babies and banners, they looked exultant, and dozens of
yeshiva students performed a joyful line dance.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon, Nahum Barnea, the dean of Israeli newspaper
columnists, shook his head as he surveyed the frenzied politicking
in the bustling halls of the flat-roofed parliament building. ``We
are on the threshold of a new era, and from here it looks like it
will be a mess,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A former general who was elected by an overwhelming majority in
May of last year, Barak went to great effort to cobble together a
broad coalition of left and right, religious and secular parties in
what he portrayed as an effort to heal the diverse rifts in Israeli
society. He also believed that he needed a broad government to back
his peacemaking plans.
</P>
<P>
   But from the time Barak took office in July, the coalition was
fractious.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday three of the six parties in the government
voted against him: the National Religious Party, which was on its
way to quitting anyway; the Russian immigrant party, Yisrael
B'Aliyah, led by the interior minister, Natan Sharansky; and Shas,
the ultra-Orthodox movement that is the third-largest political
party in Israel, after the Liberal/One Israel and the Likud
parties.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   All three parties voting against Barak served in the right-wing
Cabinet of the former prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. A former
chief of staff of Netanyahu's, Avigdor Lieberman, who heads a
second Russian immigrant party, introduced the bill. Shas members
encouraged him to do so, and when the vote passed, they surrounded
Lieberman for an extended group hug.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, several feet away, Ophir Pines-Paz, the
chairman of Barak's faction, sat alone, looking shocked and
crestfallen.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, which with 17 members of parliament represents Jews of
North African and Middle Eastern origin, has been the balkiest
party in the coalition, fighting for money and respect from the
first day. The other two parties more specifically opposed Barak's
peace moves, and long felt out of place in a center-left
government, frequently siding with the right-wing opposition that
was weakened without them.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his party would do, Sharansky, who has complained
bitterly about Barak's failure to consult his Cabinet ministers,
said: ``It takes two to get a divorce. But definitely this virtual
coalition can't continue.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces several options in the immediate future, as this
bill wends its way through parliament.
</P>
<P>
   He could negotiate with Sharansky and with Shas to try to save
his original coalition. That seemed unlikely because Barak said
Wednesday night that, ``Those ministers who voted today for early
elections fired themselves.'' But leaving the door open, he also
suggested that ``a coalition of similar composition to the current
one'' could work if it acted more cohesively.
</P>
<P>
   Barak could also bypass parliament and ask outgoing Israeli
President Ezer Weizman to give him permission to resign. Also an
unlikely scenario, that would force new elections in 90 days from
the time the request was granted. That would be much quicker than
if the elections came about as a result of Wednesday's bill, and it
would allow Barak to seize the momentum and profit from his surge
in popularity after the Israeli troop withdrawal from Lebanon last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the most likely option, he could reshape the coalition as
a narrow, minority government that depends on Arab parties for
majority votes on peacemaking issues. To do that, Barak would
likely enlist a six-member secularist party, called Shinui, a
two-member workers right's party, and a two-member, left-wing
Russian party. That would give him a 52-member government, with 10
votes from the Arab parties as a cushion.
</P>
<P>
   It would also give him a political framework similar to that of
his mentor, the late Yitzhak Rabin. Barak had aspired not to copy
Rabin's governmental model because he felt it exacerbated the
left-right, secular-religious divide in Israeli society. And it
engendered a strong opposition to peace efforts, which could be
recreated now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Further, it would allow the right wing to bait him as it did
Rabin about relying on the Arab parties because he couldn't get a
Jewish majority.
</P>
<P>
   Several ministers of the government wrung their hands Wednesday
and claimed that the politicians who voted to shake things up were
tone-deaf to the public mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote has nothing to do with what people want,'' said Haim
Ramon, a minister charged with Jerusalem affairs. ``Your desire,''
he told the lawmakers, ``is disconnected from reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Melchior, a dovish rabbi in Barak's Cabinet, said the
vote revealed the ``sectorialism'' of parliament and predicted that
it would infuriate the public. ``What? They want a period of
uncertainty?'' he said. ``No one will want this. Everyone outside
this building will hate us.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said they feared that the country's diplomatic efforts
would suffer most. ``This is not just a government crisis,'' said
Naomi Chazan, a leftist lawmaker. ``It's the future of the peace
process, and everyone who voted for this is exercising maximum
irresponsibility.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the right-wing Likud Party did not waste time in
proclaiming Barak's days to be numbered. ``I'm running around
trying to form a new coalition right now,'' said Silvan Shalom, a
young lawmaker who aspires to take over the Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Shalom acknowledged that the peace effort, which is not his
priority, might be hurt. `Obviously the other side will understand
that they are negotiating with a lame duck, and they won't want to
make decisions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Ramallah, the West Bank, Saeb Erekat, a senior
Palestinian negotiator, said the vote was ``an internal Israeli
matter'' but one that made the Palestinians nervous. ``I hope this
situation will not be used as an excuse to introduce more
settlements or more obstacles to peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the Israeli government will not use what is happening
as a pretext not to implement the third phase of redeployment or to
release more prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shas party, whose power base is built on a social service
network that includes a large religious school system, has been
battling for money to cover its schools' debts. Shas' leader, Eli
Yishai, has butted heads with the leftist education minister, Yossi
Sarid, on funding, educational reform and power issues. And Shas'
spiritual leader, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, is under police investigation
for inciting violence against Sarid in his sermons.
</P>
<P>
   Shas' vote Wednesday was the culmination of its threats against
the government, which followed Barak's suspension of negotiations
over the problems of its school system earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided on Monday morning to vote in favor of Avigdor
Lieberman's bill,'' said Yitzhak Suderi, the spokesman for Shas.
``When we gave him our word, he decided to introduce his bill. We
warned the prime minister a few weeks ago that Lieberman was
preparing the bill and that we might support it if we were to
continue to be persecuted by Meretz,'' which is Sarid's party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come for the prime minister to make a decision,''
Suderi continued. ``Does he want a narrow coalition that will
endure only two or three weeks, or does he want to try to maintain
his broad coalition. He can either show leadership, as we know he
is capable of, given the experience with the withdrawal from
Lebanon, or he can do Yossi Sarid's bidding.''
</P>
<P>
   The liberal, secular members of the Israeli public who voted
Barak into office are hoping that he will finally turn his back on
Shas. Several ministers said they imagined he would.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ramon, long a political ally of Shas, sounded fed up
Wednesday. ``One thing's for sure,'' he said. ``The mess is over.
And the next coalition will be organized so that whoever votes
against us is out the same day.''

 &HT;    PENTAGON CONTRACTORS MAKE REPEAT APPEARANCES ON FRAUD LIST
 &HT;    Eds: Restores dropped ``million'' in lede and omits words
``defective pricing.''
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top Pentagon contractors, including Lockheed Martin
Corp., Raytheon Co. and Rockwell International Corp., paid fines
totaling $434 million for inflated costs, kickbacks and defective
products, according to a list released by Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The procurement fraud list, put together by the U.S. General
Accounting Office (GAO), covers January 1995 through September 1999
and includes several companies which also appeared on a comparable
GAO list for the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there is a continuing pattern of fraud and
abuse at some of our nation's largest military contractors,'' said
Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who had asked the GAO, the investigative
arm of Congress, to make the new report.
</P>
<P>
   Harkin noted that none of the companies on the list had been
debarred from future federal contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has cracked down on individual criminals who commit
multiple crimes,'' he said. ``It's time to consider a 'three
strikes and you're out' law for repeat criminal Pentagon
contractors as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO list included eight companies that have pled guilty and
paid fines totaling $66 million in criminal fraud in procurement.
In 95 civil cases, companies have paid $369 million. Those numbers
are considerably lower than during the previous five years, when
defense spending was increasing.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Glen Flood said that he had no information
about the contracting fraud list. However, he said that debarring
contractors in such cases ``is not an automatic thing.'' Banning a
company from doing government work generally requires the Justice
Department to take legal action, Flood said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the criminal cases, the largest involved Lockheed
Aeronautical Systems, a division of Lockheed Martin, the Bethesda,
Md., based defense giant. The company pled guilty in 1995 to making
payments to a member of the Egyptian Parliament and paid $24.8
million in fines and restitution. Some individuals involved were
debarred from government contracting for three years, but the
company was not.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed, which has a major aerospace plant in Marietta, Ga.,
and is the chief contractor for the new F-22 aircraft, also paid
more than $8 million to settle civil cases involving allegations of
defective pricing, labor overcharges and contractor kickbacks. And
Martin Marietta, which has now merged with Lockheed, paid more than
$3 million in awards to settle procurement fraud and defective
pricing cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed spokesman Jim Fetig on Wednesday said that in response
to past ``business concerns,'' the company has since instituted
``an award-winning business ethics programs that is one of the very
best in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate waste fraud and abuse, and we act promptly
when it's discovered,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others on the GAO list:
</P>
<P>
   _ Hughes Aircraft Company, which merged with Raytheon in 1997,
paid $6.66 million in civil settlements in various cases involving
accusations of altered tests, failure to do tests on fighter
aircraft, missiles and tanks as well as charges of substandard
parts for torpedoes. Hughes was named in procurement fraud cases in
the 1988-95 list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rockwell International, based in Seal Beach, Calif., paid
nearly $24 million in 1995 to settle allegations that it hid
reductions in B1-B bomber costs. The company also paid $5.5 million
in criminal fines in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   _ Philips Components and Philips Electronics, divisions of the
Dutch company Royal Philips Electronics, paid the government $55.6
million in 1996 after charges that employees had falsified test
records in weapons testing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pratt &AMP; Whitney, the aircraft division of United Technologies
Corp., which has a factory in Jupiter, Fla., agreed to pay $14.8
million in 1997 after allegations that employees had funneled $10
million in U.S. aid to retired Israeli military officers. The
company denied having knowledge of the scheme.

TELEFONICA CHAIRMAN TRIES TO REVIVE MERGER TALKS WITH KPN,
EXECUTIVES SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs lede to include time element.) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Juan Villalonga, the chairman of Telefonica, the
Spanish telecommunications company, has been trying to rally
support among board members to revive merger talks with the Dutch
telephone operator Royal KPN, executives close to Telefonica said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga was embarrassed last month when his board succumbed
to political pressure from the Spanish government and Spanish banks
and rejected a $58 billion merger with KPN that Villalonga had
sought. Opponents argued against the deal in part because the Dutch
government would be the biggest shareholder in a merged company.
</P>
<P>
   The failed merger was viewed by telecommunications industry
analysts as a major setback for Telefonica, once a state-owned
monopoly. With KPN, Villalonga had hoped to create a pan-European
network of fixed-line, data and wireless services with the size to
compete against the likes of Vodafone Airtouch PLC and France
Telecom, which recently agreed to buy Orange PLC of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   According to executives close to Telefonica, Villalonga has been
making private overtures to several of the nine board members who
voted against the merger, asking them to reconsider. The executives
cautioned that Villalonga was far from winning the support he
needed to restart talks with KPN, and might decide to abandon the
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of Telefonica's 20 board members officially voted for the
deal, nowhere near the unanimous approval regarded as necessary for
such an important change in the company. Some opponents had
privately voted a day earlier in favor of the merger, the
executives said. Villalonga hopes to persuade them to create enough
support to at least return to negotiations with KPN.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, KPN remains somewhat interested in combining with
Telefonica, but only if Telefonica's board fully supports the deal,
executives close to KPN said.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger talks fell apart, KPN's chairman, Paul Smits,
accused the Spanish government and the banks of interfering. ``We
have no interest in an internal political process,'' he said.
``It's not about a merger of emotions, it's about a merger of
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   KPN believed that without the complete support of both
management boards, no deal was possible, Smits said. ``You have to
have a merger with passion con amor and with total commitment for
it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits apparently remains interested in a merger with Telefonica,
perhaps even more so now because of its relationship with Lycos,
the Internet company based in the United States, the executives
said. They stopped short of saying he would necessarily endorse
resuming negotiations with Telefonica, however, because of the
messy ending to their last merger attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Terra Networks, the Internet unit of
Telefonica, acquired Lycos for $12.5 billion. If KPN and Telefonica
merged, the combined group would be one of the largest Internet
companies in Europe with a strong foothold in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   KPN and Qwest, which is based in Denver, are working together in
Europe to create a high-speed network. KPN's mobile arm, KPN
Mobile, also recently entered into an alliance with the Japanese
mobile communications giant NTT DoCoMo, an added attraction for
Villalonga.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Telefonica declined to comment on whether
Villalonga was working to restart talks with KPN. A spokesman for
KPN could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Telefonica stressed that it was too early to
tell whether the company's board was committed enough to reaching a
deal with KPN to justify new talks. One executive said he expected
that a decision on whether Telefonica would try to restart talks
would be made within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts questioned whether Villalonga could revive enough
interest among the board members to try to negotiate a deal with
KPN and whether a deal could in fact be consummated. Nonetheless,
analysts said the deal would be beneficial to both companies,
pointing out that shares of both fell significantly after the
original talks collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not be a marriage made in heaven,'' said John Tysoe, a
telecommunications analyst at West LB Panmure in London. ``But some
marriages of convenience end up working out well.''

TRIBESMAN RELATES EXPERIENCES AS SLAVE IN SUDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A full house, matrons all in white, a pulsing, powerful
gospel choir _ all were usual for Communion Sunday services at
Southern Baptist Church. But the very tall, very thin, very black
man standing before Pastor Gerald Bell at the altar was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless God's name for the days this man did not eat,'' Bell
cried, locking eyes with the visitor. ``Bless God's name for the
days he slept with the pigs, the days he slopped the camels, the
day he saw sisters shot. I don't know what good will come out of
this, but we believe!''
</P>
<P>
   Francis Piol Bol Bok, 21, Dinka tribesman, fugitive slave,
Christian, stood stock still, eyes riveted on the minister,
thoughts wandering across the decade that ended with his escape
from bondage in Sudan four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bok was in this church Sunday morning, is in Washington
Thursday, and will be at Faneuil Hall Friday evening to bear
witness to unimaginable cruelty and suffering. His is a featured
story in a two-week national campaign against slavery in Sudan that
culminates Friday with rallies and vigils in 25 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Telling old people and young about slavery today, and making the
link with slavery yesterday, are key ingredients in an effort to
give the problems of Africa more prominence in US foreign policy,
where it has become common wisdom that African nations get little
attention because they do not make anything the US needs, they do
not pose a threat, and they are not a high priority among African
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope that by presenting real people like Bok to the
public, support can be rallied against some of the most grotesque
and preventable sources of African suffering _ such as slavery in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need everyone to come out of their seats and press close!''
Bell said. ``Touch him. Form a hedge around him. Lift up this
brother! Support him! Give him strength!''
</P>
<P>
   The congregation moved forward as a single body, encompassing
the thin man, reaching out and laying on their hands until only
Bok's head and round-cut Afro poked above the massed humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people you need to hear this,'' Bell called out to the
congregants, almost all of them African American. ``It was once
this way with us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen,'' scattered voices responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were slaves and no one wanted to believe us,'' he called;
``Yes Lord!'' the response gained strength.
</P>
<P>
   Bok was 7 years old, a farm boy living in the southwest Sudanese
town of Gorian, on the day he walked to the regional market in
Nyamlall to sell his family's eggs and beans.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the area was surrounded by Sudanese Muslim militiamen.
Hardly anyone in the vast market escaped.
</P>
<P>
   Adults and adolescent boys were slain on the spot. Children who
were not killed were tied on donkeys for their journey into
bondage; those too small to straddle an animal were tied into
baskets bound to the beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Bok cannot forget the sight of a 12 year old who had just seen
her parents killed. ``She would not stop crying,'' he said. ``They
took her out of the basket and shot her, and then her sister, who
was about 10, would not stop crying, and they took her out of the
basket and cut off her hand with the sword.''
</P>
<P>
   The children were taken to a slave market in Kirio, where
hundreds of captives were bound and sold; Bok was given to a
brother of the militia leader, and his indoctrination began.
</P>
<P>
   ``That man took me to his home and told all his family to take
sticks, and beat me, and call me `slave, slave,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of abuse and malnourishment, during which he
was compelled to sleep outdoors with his master's animals, Bok made
his first escape attempt _ a mission impossible in the militarized
and ethnically divided Sudan, where a young boy with no sure sense
of geography and the tribal scars of the Dinka on his forehead was
easily identifiable as a runaway slave. He was caught quickly,
returned to his master, and beaten severely.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately, he tried again. In consequence, he suffered
tortures from which he still bears scars on his ankles, chest, and
hands _ scars he incongruously, unselfconsciously, displayed during
a breakfast interview at a deli, where he also saw his first
waffle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me if I tried to escape again they would kill me,''
he said, ``so I stayed'' for a while. ``But I knew I would have to
escape again, because when you get to be 16 or 17, they think
you're some kind of threat to them, and they kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   On market day soon after he turned 17, Bok dressed like an Arab
and escaped. He sought help from police, ``but they are Arab too
and they didn't want slave to go out _ so they slave me too.''
After two months, he escaped at a market in a larger town, where a
trucker gave him a ride out of the region.
</P>
<P>
   He reached Khartoum, but then was arrested, beaten, and tortured
by government security men who thought he had been telling
foreigners there was slavery in Sudan _ a fact the government still
denies. Released after seven months, he escaped to Egypt. He took
his story to United Nations officials there, and in September 1999
was granted refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Where you want to go?' and I said, `I don't care,
I want to be free,' '' Bok said. In August, he flew from Cairo to
New York to Chicago _ to Fargo, N.D., where he was the only
Sudanese. One New Year's Day he moved to Ames, Iowa, where there
was a family of southern Sudanese, and in May he came to Boston to
become a staff member of the Boston-based American Anti-Slavery
Movement.
</P>
<P>
   Such rapid and extreme changes would befuddle many people, and
Bok cannot imagine how it will all turn out. For now, ``there are
many, many things I'd like to do,'' he said. ``First I want to go
to school. Second, I want to find my family.''

SOFTWARE EXECUTIVES CALL FOR BETTER ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If copyright laws are not more broadly and
aggressively enforced on the Internet, software developers will be
forced to resort to cumbersome technological protections that
consumers will not like, an industry leader warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to have a piece of music that will only play on
one Walkman,'' John E. Warnock, the chairman and chief executive of
Adobe Systems, said during a panel discussion on Capitol Hill
involving 10 key software executives. ``You're going to have a
piece of software that will only work on one machine. It will
provide enormous inconvenience.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry officials were in Washington as part of an annual
lobbying trip organized by the Business Software Alliance. They
said they were not asking for new copyright laws, just better
prosecution of the fast-growing number of digital piracy cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more cases brought to the court system,'' said Carol
Bartz, chairwoman and chief executive of Autodesk Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Warnock also urged the government to educate young people who
think that piracy and breaking into computers are no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like government to set an example, to send a message
that this is breaking the law and the law will be enforced,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey released by the alliance in conjunction with the
visit, software executives estimated that by 2005, 66 percent of
software will be distributed over the Internet, compared with 12
percent today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The increase in Internet distribution and the growing number
of users raises the possibility of even greater losses due to
piracy in the coming years,'' said the survey, which cited an
estimate that 36 percent of all software in use last year was
pirated.
</P>
<P>
   Bartz urged Congress to encourage more copyright enforcement
efforts by federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting with administration officials and
congressional leaders over the last two days, the executives sent
letters to the major presidential candidates asking for their
dedication to three top policy goals outlined in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to broader copyright enforcement, the executives are
urging continued adoption of free-trade policies. The House
recently voted to establish free trade with China and a vote is
pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The executives are also pushing for more visas for skilled
foreign workers, saying that without more visas, 9 percent of
America's high-skilled, high-wage jobs will go unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``How you respond to these issues will have a vital impact on
the next phase of the Internet economy, with tremendous
consequences for American jobs, standard of living and
competitiveness,'' the executives wrote in the letters to the
candidates. ``We ask for your full support and your commitment to
make these an integral part of your policy agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Other software executives in Washington on Wednesday were Andrew
S. Grove of Intel, Eric E. Schmidt of Novell and Stephen M. Bennett
of Intuit. Bill Gates, the chairman of Microsoft, was in town on
Tuesday for meetings and a congressional hearing, but returned to
Seattle on Tuesday night.

   The New York Times plans four pages of stories and graphics on
the judge's ruling in the Microsoft antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST (Washington) _ Ledeall: A federal judge
ordered the breakup of the Microsoft Corp. on Wedsnesay, saying the
severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft ``has proved
untrustworthy in the past'' and did not appear to be taking
seriously his previous rulings against the company. ``There is
credible evidence in the record to suggest that Microsoft,
convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as it has in
the past and may yet do to other markets what it has already done''
in the markets discussed during the long antitrust trial, Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson said in his ruling. The judge accepted the
government's remedy proposal in its entirety, without alteration,
utterly rejecting Microsoft's repeated assertions that the breakup
plan was ``extreme,'' ``unwarranted'' and ``bad for consumers, the
high tech industry and our economy.'' By Joel Brinkley.

</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-ASSESS (Undated) _ With his final order Wednesday in
the Microsoft antitrust case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said
``yes'' to the government one more time. He has agreed with the
government, almost without qualification, on the facts of the case,
on the law and now on the harsh remedy of splitting the company in
two. In Jackson's court, the result has been not just a defeat for
Microsoft but a rout, not a closely fought legal contest but a
judicial ratification of the government's case. Yet the
two-year-old case is far from over. And with a year or two of
appeals ahead, the chances of Microsoft ever being broken up are
uncertain. Microsoft will try to reverse every element in Jackson's
ruling that the big software maker is a monopoly that has
repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws, stifling
competition and innovation. A news analysis by Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   MICROSOFT-LAW (Washington) _ ``Possession of unchallenged
economic power deadens initiative, discourages thrift and depresses
energy.'' ``Immunity from competition is a narcotic, and rivalry a
stimulant, to industrial progress.'' Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
in June, 2000 ordering the breakup of Microsoft? No, Judge Learned
Hand declaring in 1945 that the Aluminum Company of America had
illegally monopolized the market for a type of aluminum ingot. A
lot has changed since 1945, the exact midpoint between the passage
of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 and the Microsoft ruling on
Wednesday. An economy based on heavy industry and capital
investment has transformed itself into one based more and more on
human capital and information technology. Nonetheless, as
Wednesday's ruling demonstrates dramatically, the old factories may
be obsolete, but the legal principles that led to the breakup of
the Standard Oil trust in 1911 and the American Telephone &AMP;
Telegraph Co. in 1984 are not. By Linda Greenhouse.

remedy proposal: The centerpiece of the government's cure for the

was found to have embraced is to chop the company in two. One new
company would make the Windows operating system, the other would
make the applications that are run by the operating system, as well

WITH THE NOMINEES CHOSEN, THE REAL RACES BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With Montana Gov. Marc Racicot barred by law from seeking a
third consecutive term, his lieutenant governor, Judy Martz, and
state Auditor Mark O'Keefe had little trouble winning their
gubernatorial primaries on Tuesday to face each other in the
November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Martz, a Republican who has served with Racicot since 1996, had
57 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Rob Natelson, a law
professor who fared better this time than four years ago, when he
won only 24 percent in a primary challenge to Racicot. In the
Democratic primary, O'Keefe won 48 percent of the vote to defeat
two other high-ranking state officials, Attorney General Joe
Mazurek, with 36 percent, and Secretary of State Mike Cooney, with
16 percent. The voting reflected totals from all but two of
Montana's 867 voting precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Montana was also one of several states that held congressional
primaries on Tuesday. In winning the Democratic U.S. Senate
primary, Brian Schweitzer, a farmer who made the high cost of
prescription drugs a campaign focus, easily defeated John Driscoll,
a former state public service commissioner who entered the campaign
late. Schweitzer, who won 66 percent of the vote to 34 percent for
Driscoll, will face the two-term Republican incumbent, Sen. Conrad
Burns, who had no primary opponent.
</P>
<P>
   While their approaches are certain to be different, Martz and
O'Keefe both said they would make statewide economic development a
high priority. Montana currently ranks lowest among the states in
average wages, 47th in per capita income and, as O'Keefe contended,
first in the number of families in which the chief wage earner
holds at least two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe said those rankings reflect how poorly the Racicot
administration had performed, but Martz said the situation was far
worse when Racicot took office in 1993, when the state was $200
million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We re-did workmen's compensation, we reformed welfare, and
after the last legislative session, we enacted $116 million in tax
cuts,'' she said in an interview Wednesday, boasting of
administration successes.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not obscure the obvious, O'Keefe said, adding,
``We're having our first debate on Friday. One of things I'm sure
we'll talk about is the lieutenant governor's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Democrats held primaries in all three
congressional districts and one produced a close finish. Seeking to
oppose Rep. Joe Skeen, a 10-term Republican from the 2nd District,
state Treasurer Michael Montoya narrowly defeated Mike Runnels, a
district attorney, despite a recent investigation by New Mexico
State Police into accusations that Montoya's brother, Orlando
Montoya, diverted money from his construction business into the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Montoya won 52 percent of the vote to 48 percent for
Runnels, a margin that Montoya said might have been helped by a
sympathetic backlash against the police investigation, which, so
far, has produced no charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1st District primary, former U.S. Attorney John J. Kelly
won 43 percent of the vote in a three-way race to face Rep. Heather
A. Wilson, a first-term Republican who is viewed by Democrats as
one of the most vulnerable members of the House majority. Kelly
defeated Sam Bregman, a former Albuquerque city councilman, who won
33 percent of the vote, and John V. Wertheim, the party's nominee
four years ago, who had 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Skeen and Wilson ran unopposed, but not so New Mexico's
other incumbent, Rep. Mark Udall, a freshman Democrat who soundly
defeated Francesca Lobato, a tax lawyer from Santa Fe, with 83
percent of the balloting. Udall will face Lisa Lutz, a state
lawmaker, who ran unopposed to win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican U.S. Senate primary, Bill Redmond, a former
congressman, breezed in a three-way race, with 60 percent of the
vote, to oppose Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat seeking his fourth term.
Two state lawmakers trailed, Steve Pearce with 22 percent and
William F. Davis, 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, Curt Hohn, general manager of the state's Water
Development Association, beat two other Democrats to oppose Rep.
John Thune, a two-term Republican who was expected to win in
November no matter who prevailed among the Democrats. With the
turnout extremely light, Hohn won 56 percent of the vote to 36
percent for Steve Sandven, a lawyer, and 7 percent for Raymond
Osloond, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Each party had two primaries in Iowa. In the 1st District,
Democrats elected Bob Simpson over Gregory Guy, by a margin of
almost 2-to-1, although Simpson is given only a slim chance against
Rep. Jim Leach, the 12-term Republican incumbent. In the 3rd, Jay
Marcus narrowly defeated Phil Ferren to oppose Iowa's only
Democratic House member, Leonard Boswell, who is seeking a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties held primaries in the 5th District. Mike Palecek
defeated Conrad Lawlor for the Democratic nomination, and Rep. Tom
Latham, who is seeking a fourth term, easily turned back Thomas
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the lone Alabama contest, Rep. Earl Hilliard, a four-term
Democrat from a solidly Democratic district, the 7th, won 58
percent of the vote to defeat two challengers, Arthur Davis and
Wayne Sowell. Ed Martin won the 7th District Republican nomination,
defeating Milton Bethune in a primary than drew less than a tenth
of the voters who cast ballots for Democrats.

HUMAN RIGHTS GROUP ACCUSES NATO OF WAR CRIMES IN YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: SUBS 5th graf to correct reference to war crimes tribunal;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ In an extensive report that has
infuriated NATO leaders, Amnesty International said Wednesday that
NATO violated international law in its bombing war over Yugoslavia
by hitting targets where civilians were sure to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the London-based human-rights group said that
NATO's bombing of the Belgrade headquarters of Radio Television
Serbia, on April 23, 1999, ``was a deliberate attack on a civilian
object and as such constitutes a war crime.'' Sixteen people died
in the pre-dawn attack, nearly all of them technicians, security
staff and make-up artists. NATO has defended the bombing as an
attack on the ``propaganda machine'' of the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   International law forbids direct attacks on civilians and
civilian targets and requires all feasible precautions to prevent
civilian deaths. In some cases, Amnesty said, NATO failed to take
sufficient precautions to minimize civilian casualties. The number
of civilian deaths from NATO air strikes ``could have been
significantly reduced if NATO forces had fully adhered to the laws
of war during Operation Allied Force,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty also condemned a NATO attack on a bridge at Varvarin on
May 30, 1999, in which at least 11 civilians died. ``NATO forces
failed to suspend their attack after it was evident that they had
struck civilians,'' the report said, and it criticized NATO for
ordering its pilots to fly so high that they could not take proper
precautions against bombing civilians. In particular, the report
criticized the bombing of civilian convoys of Albanian refugees
near Djakovica on April 14 and Korisa on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released less than a week after Carla Del Ponte,
the chief prosecutor for the war crimes tribunal for the former
Yugoslavia in The Hague, told the U.N. Security Council that her
investigation found no basis for charging NATO or its leaders with
war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Del Ponte said that although ``some mistakes were made by
NATO,'' she was ``very satisfied that there was no deliberate
targeting of civilians or unlawful military targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, some tribunal officials said privately that they hoped
their report would cause NATO countries to review their rules of
engagement in order to lessen the chances of civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials quickly rejected the Amnesty findings. NATO
Secretary-General George Robertson called the allegations
``baseless and ill-founded.'' He said, ``NATO scrupulously adhered
to international law, including the law of war, throughout the
conflict and made every effort to minimize civilian casualties.''
NATO's mistakes, he said, were few and should be weighed ``against
the atrocities that NATO's action stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   The report by Amnesty does not try to weigh the violations
committed by Serbian officials and forces; rather it tries to hold
the members of NATO up to the highest standards of international
law and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty was scathing about the bombing of the television
station, which went off the air only briefly. ``NATO deliberately
attacked a civilian object, killing 16 civilians, for the purpose
of disrupting Serb television broadcasts in the middle of the night
for approximately three hours.''
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty report is similar in its findings to an even more
detailed report issued in February by Human Rights Watch. Of the
approximately 500 Yugoslav civilians killed in Serbia and Kosovo by
NATO bombs, half died unnecessarily because of NATO violations of
humanitarian law and practice, said Kenneth Roth, executive
director of Human Rights Watch, in a telephone interview from New
York.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Roth criticized NATO in four areas: the use of cluster bombs,
``inherently indiscriminate weapons,'' near civilian areas; the
deliberate bombing of targets with little or no military
significance, including the television station, Belgrade's heating
plant, bridges, some factories and other infrastructure; the
bombing of targets, like the Varvarin bridge, during the daytime,
when civilians would be nearby at a market; and the failure to take
sufficient precautions to identify mobile targets before bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson's spokesman, Jamie Shea, said that Del Ponte's
``opinion carries more weight'' than Amnesty's. But Roth said that
it is very difficult to make a criminal case against a wartime
general or leader. ``The fact that the tribunal has decided not to
indict anyone is no reason to pop champagne at the Pentagon,'' he
said. ``There were some serious violations of humanitarian law that
must be acknowledged and corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the British Parliament's Foreign Affairs
Committee said that while the NATO war against Yugoslavia was
morally just, it was illegal, because NATO had not secured
authorization from the U.N. Security Council. ``We conclude that
NATO's military action, if of dubious legality in the current state
of international law, was justified on moral grounds,'' the
cross-party committee said in a report. Noting that nothing in
NATO's charter allows it to conduct a war on even humanitarian
grounds without U.N. authorization, the committee called for a
revision of the NATO treaty.

COMPUTERS QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How do I install new fonts on my computer?
</P>
<P>
   A. Adding type fonts to a PC or Macintosh can be very simple,
depending on the type of font you want to load. Two common font
formats are TrueType and Adobe's Type 1 Font, and you should know
which kind of font you are installing. You can usually find that
information when you purchase and download the font from the Web or
in the documentation from the vendor who sent your fonts on a CD or
floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   For Windows 98 systems, one way to load TrueType fonts is to go
to the Start menu, then to Settings and Control Panel. Double-click
on Fonts and pick Install New Font from the File menu. A box will
pop up and ask you where the new fonts are, so navigate to the hard
drive folder where you have copied the new fonts. Once you have
located the fonts, click on them to add them to your system. (Hold
down the Control key to select more than one font at a time.) If
you can't see any fonts visible in the folder, go back to the Fonts
control panel. Under File, select Fonts to add a check mark, then
go back to Install New Font in the menu.
</P>
<P>
   You can also add most TrueType fonts by dragging them to the
Fonts folder in your Windows folder.
</P>
<P>
   Adobe Type 1 fonts are a little trickier to deal with. Microsoft
advises using a font-utility program called Adobe Type Manager to
install the Type 1 fonts. There are versions of Adobe Type Manager
Deluxe for both Windows and Macintosh, and more information is
available at www.adobe.com/products &QC; /atm/main.html. The program is
sometimes included with your font purchase and sometimes comes
bundled with other graphics-related software.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Macintosh, one way to add fonts is to close all
open programs, then drag the new font files into the Fonts folder
in your Mac's System Folder. It is not always necessary to restart
the Mac after you make adjustments or add things to the System
Folder, but it is a good idea. A TrueType font will generally have
only one file to drag. Each Type 1 font usually has two files that
need to be dragged to the System Folder: one for the screen version
and one for the printer.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to install a font in both TrueType and Type 1 formats can
cause problems. A font utility program like Adobe Type Manager
simplifies font installations and helps you avoid other
font-related problems. Font manager programs will let you group
fonts into sets that you might want to keep at hand for one project
or another and can handle both TrueType and Type 1 fonts. Another
program, Suitcase (www.extensis.com/suitcase), will also help you
manage your fonts. Suitcase is currently available for only the
Macintosh, but a Windows version is being developed.
</P>
<P>
   When installing fonts on either platform, be sure not to change
the name of the font file. Having a large number of fonts installed
can also slow your computer when it starts up because it has to
load all the font files as it boots. Microsoft says Windows 95 and
98 will let you have about 1,000 TrueType fonts installed, but you
may want to limit them to what you really need.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it possible to make a copy of my address book that I use
with the Microsoft Outlook e-mail program and save it on a floppy
disk?
</P>
<P>
   A. Go to the Start menu to Find, then select Files or Folders.
When you see the Named box come up, type ``.wab'' and direct the
Look In option to search the drive where Outlook is installed. (It
will probably be your C: drive.) Click Find Now, and the address
book file, usually called Default, will pop up; right-click on it
and select Copy from the pop-up menu.
</P>
<P>
   Insert a formatted floppy disk into your computer and
double-click on the My Computer icon on your desktop. Double-click
on the ``3{ Floppy (A:)'' icon. In the the window that pops up for
the floppy disk's contents, right-click and select Paste to copy
the address book file to the floppy disk.

 &HT;    Homebuilder hit with suit
 &HT;    By Yolanda Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the country's largest homebuilders and its
financing arm are being accused of illegally tacking on attorneys
fees to home mortgages that have gone into default in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit against Jim Walter Homes and Mid-State Homes was
filed by two Athens residents who discovered the fees had been
added to their mortgage principals when they received printouts of
their payments during bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the plaintiffs, Joann Davis and Tommy C. Roach, will
try to convince a judge that the companies have charged similar
fees to other unsuspecting consumers and that the suit should be
given class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed May 26 in the Superior Court of Cobb County,
where the company has its registered agent.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company, Walter Industries, received a copy of the
lawsuit this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe our practices are in full compliance with Georgia
law,'' said David Townsend, a spokesman for Walter Industries,
which is based in Tampa. ``We'll contest the lawsuit accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael O. Crain, the lead plaintiffs' lawyer, estimated that
between 1,000 and 5,000 consumers in Georgia could be in similar
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   According to its Web site, _ www.jimwalterhomes.com _ Jim Walter
Homes has built 330,000 single-family houses since its inception.
</P>
<P>
   It has offices in 22 states, mostly in the South. Mid-State
Homes holds 63,000 mortgages in its market.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lee Morgan, co-counsel for the plaintiffs, Davis
and Roach were never informed in writing that their mortgages had
gone into default and that they could pay the past due amounts
within 10 days without incurring attorneys fees. Georgia requires
the notification.
</P>
<P>
   Then the company added the fees, which totaled $475 for Davis
and $730 for Roach, to the principal balance without telling them,
also in violation of the law, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly mortgage payments were never increased, so the
plaintiffs did not suspect that they were paying a higher
principal, Crain said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Roach went into Chapter 13 bankruptcy _ a repayment
plan in which a debtor makes payments to a trustee, who in turn
pays off the debt. That's when they discovered the fees, Crain
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Industries is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under
the stock symbol WLT. The company was founded in 1946, by Jim
Walter, who created a niche in the affordable housing market. It
does not build homes on speculation, it constructs them on
already-owned lots.
</P>
<P>
   According to its web site (jimwalterhomes.com), Jim Walter Homes
has built 330,000 single-family houses since its inception. It has
offices in 22 states, mostly in the South. Mid-State Homes holds
63,000 mortgages in its market.

SPIDERCAM COMING TO THE WORLD WIDE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHEL MARRIOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before television became a friendly flicker in American
households and laptop computers started popping up in trendy coffee
bars, there were comic books. Crammed with colorful graphics and
plain-talking super heroes speaking in bursts of text, comic books
looked like Web sites in search of a Web.
</P>
<P>
   Now executives and artists at Marvel Comics are turning to
digital technology to give birth to an entirely new kind of comic
book to be launched on the Internet this summer _ free.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jemas, president of publishing, new media and consumer
products at Marvel, calls the new approach ``SpiderCam'' because it
stars Marvel's most popular character, Spider-Man, and is produced
with cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Everything except Spider-Man himself, is being shot in New York
with high-resolution digital cameras using models, actors and
landmark locations that even the occasional tourist would easily
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   Little, if anything, will be drawn by hand. Details and visual
effects, like the suggestion of motion, are more likely to be
accomplished with computers using Photoshop software, say artists
working on the SpiderCam episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting as much as we can in camera,'' said Henry
Tenney, director of the first SpiderCam episode called ``Pretty
Ugly.'' He said artists using Photoshop will give the comic a
consistent look.
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man, the arachid-powered super hero, will also be
computer-generated and inserted into the photo-realistic action
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``Because no human can do what your imagination wants
Spider-Man to be,'' Jemas said. When these still scenes download
and appear on computer screens, he said, they will _ using Flash
technology _ splash, slide and glide into view, quickly assembling
in varying shapes for dramatic effect into something resembling a
traditional comic book page.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our readers want to see the cutting edge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By early next year, Jemas said, the scenes will be accompanied
by voice-over narration in a style much like a recorded book. When
the first SpiderCams appear online at www.Marvel.com the only
sounds will be sound effects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other comic books online, often referred to as
cybercomics, to recapture young, male reader who may have migrated
to electronic entertainments like video games, many of which
feature comic book characters or their computer-animated
knock-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Jemas said he hoped that the new form will induce writers and
artists to invest their talents in the medium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission here is to invite the best and the brightest from
other media to come into the comic book world,'' he said. Jemas
said he would like to say to screenwriters unable to get their
projects on movie screens, ``Here's a budget and go shoot your
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   But producing a photo comic book is not as simple as it may
sound, said Philip Goetz, vice president of new media programming
for Marvel.
</P>
<P>
   Like an action film, each SpiderCam script is worked out on a
story board with scene-by-scene sketches. Actors and models are
cast and put in costumes. Location shooting, usually with a crew of
no more than a few people, takes about 10 days, Goetz said.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is shot with two Sony high-resolution digital, still
cameras, one automatic and the other manually operated. Hundreds of
pictures are taken, he said, but only about 150 will make it to the
finished episode.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest difficulties, Goetz said, is shooting still
scenes that give the reader a sense of action. In a traditional
comic book, action is often suggested by drawing characters frozen
in motion, or placing the reader at distorting vantage points, like
beneath a falling bad guy or in the direct path of a spray of
gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   When similar techniques are used with flesh and blood models and
actors, the effect can be stilted, said Goetz and Tenney.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you shoot the actors in motion with a still camera you
get a lot of half-closed eyes and blurred limbs,'' Tenney said.
``What we do is try to set them up and make it as kinetic as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The last thing he wants to see, Tenney said, is ``a lot of
people standing around.''

 &HT;    Ga. lawmaker tries to stop forcing kids to be soldiers
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Earlier this year, Isha Sillah woke to the sound of
gunfire and soldiers ransacking her family's home in Freetown,
Sierra Leone. They raped her and then tried to force the
17-year-old to join their rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Sillah knew what that meant. The rebel leaders would carve the
initials RUF on her chest to brand her as a member of the
Revolutionary United Front. She would be ordered to kill, maim and
terrorize like the other children she had seen with the soldiers.
They might even make her one of their sex slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Sillah was able to escape through a refugee program. She
eventually made her way to the office of Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.) in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing her story and the stories of other refugees from
war- torn countries, Lewis and a bipartisan group of lawmakers
decided to take action. On Wednesday, they called on President
Clinton to sign a United Nations protocol banning children younger
than 18 in combat. Now, voluntary recruits are allowed at age 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are morally bound to use our strength to protect those who
are weak, exposed and vulnerable,'' Lewis said. ``We have a special
and moral obligation to the children on this little planet.''
</P>
<P>
   These children are being asked to ``kill at one moment and used
as cannon fodder the next,'' he said. And after fighting in wars,
these children are left to cope with the trauma of war with little
or no psychological help.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are children who should be packing the front rows of
elementary schools, instead of filling the front lines of the
battlefield,'' Lewis said. ``We have to find a way to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 300,000 children fighting in conflicts
throughout the world, according to several watchdog organizations
that monitor the use of children as soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these children are abducted from their homes or schools
and coerced to fight for a cause they know little or nothing about,
said Jo Becker, advocacy director of the children's rights
divisions of the Human Rights Watch in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The use of child soldiers is not just an overseas problem, but a
problem for U.S. soldiers on peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time U.S. soldiers join a peacekeeping mission abroad in
a place like Kosovo or Sierra Leone, chances are they might find
themselves face to face with a 13-year-old or a 14-year-old holding
an AK-47,'' Becker said. ``These children often don't know what
they're fighting for.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sierra Leone, there are more than 6,000 children as young as
7 fighting in the war, according to Self-Help Initiative in the
Commonwealth, a grass-roots organization based in Maryland that is
working for peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The little children, they make them to be like rebels, get
them drugs, even young women like me, get them drugged to join
them,'' Sillah said.
</P>
<P>
   As she described how the soldiers burst into her family's home,
Sillah's eyes started to water. They killed her brother and her
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get inside my house . . . to kill,'' she said. ``They
came into people's houses killing people, they killed babies . . .
(cut)women's breasts, all kinds of things, they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations General Assembly adopted the protocol May 25.
For the new protocol to become international law, 10 countries must
sign and ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising the minimum age of soldiers, the treaty
would require governments to rehabilitate children who have been
traumatized by war.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, Reps. Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) and John Porter (R-Ill.) plan
to introduce a resolution on the House floor requesting Clinton to
sign the treaty. Sen. Paul Wellstone (D-Minn.) plans to attach a
similar resolution to the Defense Authorization Act this week. If
Clinton signs the treaty, the motion will return to the Senate for
ratification.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a humanitarian crisis that must be addressed now,''
Wellstone said. ``The trauma and abuse that child soldiers face
crushes their potential to be productive, self-sufficient
citizens.''

 &HT;    WILL MICROSOFT RULING HURT OR HELP CONSUMERS? EXPERTS DISAGREE
 &HT;    With MICROSOFT. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge's decision to split Microsoft Corp.
into two parts left industry experts divided as well, with some
insisting that consumers will see lower software prices, and others
predicting fewer innovations and higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think prices will come down over time because Microsoft
will face more competition,'' said a jubilant Mark Cooper, director
of research for the Consumer Federation of America, a non-profit
group.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was guilty of ``plain old dirty business practices''
that will stop now, resulting in more and cheaper choices for
consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillard Sterling, an antitrust lawyer with a Chicago firm
that specializes in information technology cases, said U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling Wednesday would not
help consumers because Microsoft did nothing to harm them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts and law simply do not support such an extreme
judicial remedy,'' Sterling said. ``There is no evidence that a
breakup will lead to lower prices or more products.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve DelBianco, a spokesman for the Association for Competitive
Technology, a software trade group that includes Microsoft, said
the judge's ruling would actually hurt consumers. Computer shoppers
will see ``increased complexity, less innovation and higher
prices'' when software developers no longer can count on having
Microsoft's standardized operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions were divided, too, over what kind of changes might be
coming for Microsoft workers in light of the decision to break
their company into an operating systems business and an
applications business.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Bick, a Seattle resident and former Microsoft employee who
wrote the book ``All I Really Need to Know in Business I Learned at
Microsoft,'' said most employees are still assuming that the
breakup decision will be overturned by the U.S. Court of Appeals or
the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are saying, 'This is as bad as it's going to get,' ``
she said. ``They've known this ruling was coming, so now they feel,
'let's move to the next part of it' in the appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than desert the company during this unsettled period,
Bick predicted Microsoft workers would remain loyal to Chairman
Bill Gates. ``I don't think anyone is going to leave now,'' she
said. ``This is just another step in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, immediately after the ruling, Gates issued a statement
announcing his company's intention to appeal, and declaring that
Wednesday's ruling was merely ``the beginning of a new chapter in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   But while many Microsoft workers may like Gates's tough
attitude, at least one company analyst was dismayed. Carl D. Howe,
a Microsoft expert with Forrester Research in Boston, said it was
``time to ditch the appeal'' and start dividing the company.
</P>
<P>
   Howe said Gates is frittering away time and resources on
fighting the government, rather than helping workers, investors,
customers and consumers move on. When adversity comes to a
business, ``leaders stand up and get over it'' rather than wallow
in self-pity, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the case drags out much longer, management's attention will
continue to be distracted, allowing other companies to get ahead of
Microsoft, he said. With a long appeal, ``even if you win, you
lose,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sterling said the judge's decision was so inappropriate that
Gates has a good chance of winning on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is making a reasonable judgement that this court
decision is vulnerable,'' he said. ``It's a sound strategy to fight
on.''

A NATION IN LOVE WITH GADGETS AND PRIVACY FALLS FOR CELL PHONE
E-MAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Suddenly, droves of women on this city's crowded subways
are gazing intently into tiny cell phone screens, checking their
messages and then laboriously tapping out replies.
</P>
<P>
   Just as abruptly, office workers are fumbling with the tiny
gadgets to confirm evening dates the moment they step out of
company headquarters, their faces glued to the monitors almost as
if they were navigational aids.
</P>
<P>
   Even giggly teen-age couples meeting in cafes often seem to
reserve their dreamiest gazes not for their dates, but for the
e-mail messages constantly popping up on the flip-top phones by
which many measure their popularity nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   As if all at once, e-mail has arrived in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   If any further proof were needed, the official statistics are
in: 10 million e-mail-capable telephones are now in use throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Japan had been one of the slowest developed countries to take to
e-mail, thanks in part to the paucity of home computers. But by
next year, according to some industry estimates, Internet usage in
Japan will be the highest in the world, largely as a result of the
explosive spread of cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Given the frenzied way that correspondence by cellular phone is
taking the country by storm, it is only natural to wonder what in
the world people are saying to each other with such urgency?
</P>
<P>
   Try, ``What are you eating for lunch?'' or ``Where are you
now?'' said 16-year-old Satoko Ishihara, reading two of the latest
messages from her little phone as she took a break from her
part-time job. Then, after typing in the message ``I drank too much
last night,'' came this flash, ``My friend just got her hair dyed
red, but doesn't like it, so she's decided to cut it off.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On the evidence, the strained eyes and linguistic gymnastics
required to enter substantial amounts of text into this country's
ultra-compact phones are sacrifices made for little more than the
smallest of small talk. But people are chattering in stupendous,
fortune-generating volumes nonetheless, and pulling it off,
characteristically for the Japanese, in highly innovative ways all
the while.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With the cellular phone, the Japanese have married the
ever-faster world of the Internet with the seemingly ever-smaller
world of Japanese gadgetry, and the repercussions for life here,
for the Japanese language and for the future of technology are
still being tallied.
</P>
<P>
   It has long been noted here that space is the biggest handicap
to the widespread use of personal computers. Many Japanese homes
are so small that the living room doubles as the dining room,
before finally becoming the bedroom, once the dishes are cleared.
</P>
<P>
   But with the cell phone, known here as the keitai, the Japanese
have enjoyed a pocket-sized privacy _ a portable realm where
children and lovers are able to lead discreet lives, away from the
prying ears of parents and others.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of rudimentary Internet service on
millions of cell phones here last year, this private realm has just
been dramatically expanded; people's telephones now double as
portable offices. And making this work has required another feat of
miniaturization _ with the country's written language.
</P>
<P>
   Four different writing systems are in constant, simultaneous use
in Japan, making it one of the world's most semiotically challenged
societies. Japanese have long enjoyed abbreviation, but to be
practical, writing on a typical 15-button keyboard calls for
hyper-concision.
</P>
<P>
   The typical New Year's greeting here, ``akemashite omedeto
gozaimasu,'' for example, was rendered this year as simply ``ake
ome'' on millions of mobile phones. Still, even this kind of
pruning is not enough, given the multiple strokes needed to produce
the right Chinese character, from a choice of about 2,000 commonly
used ones, for a given word.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, cellular phone makers like DoCoMo, the industry
leader here, and others have added a whole new set of symbols to
the linguistic stew: 200 or so pictographs depicting simple objects
like golf clubs, karaoke boxes, movie projectors, food and faces
reflecting various emotional states, all of which are now used in
combination with ordinary writing to form words. Think of the happy
face run wild.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thus, ``Please call me'' is written as a symbol for telephone,
followed by kure, a shortened version of a request word. ``Would
you like to go out for a drink tonight?'' has been radically
shortened by the picture of an overflowing mug, followed by the
verb ending used in invitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get used to the symbols it is very convenient and
very quick,'' said Maiko Yagi, an 18-year-old high-school student
who sat with two friends in a cafe, corresponding with another
friend by phone about an all-night party that weekend. ``My keitai
is always with me, and with e-mail I am never out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the short time that cell phone e-mail has been in use, there
are signs that these kinds of linguistic sleights of hand are
spreading into general usage. Young women seem to be the lead
innovators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something becomes part of everyday life, there will be an
influence on writing,'' said Hiroyuki Sasahara, a researcher at the
National Language Research Institute in Tokyo. ``People have
actually begun to use these symbols in their handwritten letters.''
</P>

   Mika Okabe, 19, had no time for linguistic arguments. Indeed,
given the 100 e-mails she said she taps out each day on the two
mobile phones she carries everywhere, she would seem to have little
time to spare for anything else. She is so adept at writing with
her phones that she does so without looking.
</P>
<P>
   Her telephones have become the center of her life, a virtual
place where she hangs out, meets new people, arranges blind dates
and gets news from others in bite-sized doses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep our chats short because the screen is limited to 200
characters,'' she said. ``It is cheaper than calling someone on the
phone, and moreover, it is fun. For my generation, that has made it
pretty much universal.''

<P>
   You thrive on salads, but hate washing lettuces. Don't we all.
</P>
<P>
   Like many cooks these days, you probably rely on bags of
prewashed greens showing up in ever-new and increasing combinations
in market produce sections. Designed for the convenience of busy
people pressed for time in the kitchen, they lend themselves to a
wealth of beautiful, great-tasting salads.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of glorious green and red blends in 4- to
7-ounce bags to choose from _ some with fancy names like Bordeaux
salad or Siena salad _ from various manufacturers under product
brands like Ready Pac, Earthbound Farms, Fresh Express, Dole,
Trader Joe's and more.
</P>
<P>
   While most packages specify ``no preservatives,'' some even tout
the lettuces are organically grown. Even though the packages
indicate the greens have been prewashed, some consumers might be
more comfortable rinsing them with cold water prior to using.
</P>
<P>
   When buying, regardless of the expiration date on the package,
be sure to check that the lettuce hasn't turned brown.
</P>
<P>
   With convenience all the rage, it's not surprising 63 percent of
consumers have bougit packaged salads or kits in the last six
months (according to data from the Produce Marketing Association).
Or that the prepackaged salad category increased 15 percent from
1998 to 1999 and is still on the rise, notes Bill Zinke, vice
president of marketing at Ready Pac Produce, Irwindale, producer of
more than 15 different bagged greens. To spruce up the greens and
get some new takes on the salad theme, we asked five Los
Angeles-area chefs for inspiration (we took three of them bags of
lettuce to transform on the spot). They came up with a wealth of
possibilities. One chef even transformed the greens into a warm,
wilted green salad in a skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Bardavid, chef-owner of the Secret Garden in Moorpark,
opted to use a mesclun blend to make a shrimp nicoise salad and a
bibb lettuce mixture for a vegetarian salad.
</P>
<P>
   The nicoise is fresh and colorful and easy to turn out if you
have cooked red potatoes, cooked eggs and blanched haricot verts
handy. (If not and you're in a hurry, microwave whole potatoes
until fork tender and blanch the haricots verts, covered with
plastic wrap, in a cup or bowl in a little water, until
crisp-tender; chill both before using in the salad.)
</P>
<P>
   To assemble the salad, simply alternate tomato wedges, cooked
egg wedges and cooked red potato wedges in a ring around the
outside edge of a dinner-size plate. Then toss the prewashed
mesclun blend of greens with a lemon vinaigrette (made by combining
lemon juice, Dijon mustard, champagne or white wine vinegar, olive
oil and chopped fresh tarragon) and arrange in the center of the
plate. Top with the haricot verts and cooked shrimp (either cook it
yourself or purchase already cooked), which each have been
separately tossed with more of the lemon vinaigrette. Add an
anchovy and sprinkle the edges of the plate with cracked pepper and
chopped fresh parsley for appealing presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Next up, Bardavid turned out a vegetable salad _ reminiscent of
a chopped salad _ in no time flat. ``You can serve this as an
appetizer or main-dish salad.'' Figure one bag will make about five
to six appetizer or three main-dish salads.
</P>
<P>
   Toss together bibb or butter lettuce, which in this instance was
chopped up a bit for easier eating, chopped hearts of palm, chopped
cooked asparagus, chopped tomatoes, chopped drained artichokes
packed in oil and chopped cooked haricot verts with a balsamic
vinegar dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Make the dressing by whisking together, as Bardavid dnes, a
little olive oil, Dijon mustard, salt, pepper, chopped shallots and
balsamic vinegar. If time is short, use your favorite store-bought
balsamic dressing doctored up with a little Dijon mustard, he
advises.
</P>
<P>
   Then pile the vegetable mixture atop a large plate ringed with
half tomato slices and cucumber slices _ and garnish with bright
green blanched asparagus spears. Voila _ a picture-perfect salad
that has a flowerlike look.
</P>
<P>
   You can mix and match the vegetables in the salad to suit
personal taste. And toss on some grilled turkey or chicken pieces
(or pick up cooked chicken from the market and cut up) or cooked
shrimp or tuna, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Biondi, executive chef at Piero, The Next Generation
restaurant (her father has owned it for 38 years) in Burbank and a
graduate of the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco, came
up with two dynamite main-dish creations _ a Mediterranean Chicken
Salad and a Grilled Salmon and Mango Salad. Both are great for
warm-weather eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I use the bagged greens at home, I wash them (especially
spinach) again and spin them dry because I have found them not
always completely clean. The bagged mixtures or blends are a good
way to get a variety of lettuces and greens without buying all the
different ones and combining them yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Be aware that once the package is opened, the lettuces begin to
deteriorate, so plan to use any remaining lettuce within two days.
</P>
<P>
   For the Mediterranean salad, Biondi mixes packaged Bordeaux
salad (a red leafy blend) with julienned strips of oil-packed
sun-dried tomatoes, a pinch of salt and pesto vinaigrette. Although
she makes her own vinaigrette, consumers can shortcut time in the
kitchen by purchasing prepared pesto and thinning it out by
whisking it with a little lemon juice and olive oil until it has
the consistency of dressing. Place seasoned, grilled chicken breast
slices atop the greens and sprinkle with toasted pine nuts. Garnish
with a few crisp-tender asparagus spears. Another time, she
suggests the addition of some crumbled feta cheese.
</P>
<P>
   You can even forget the chicken and add crumbled feta, pitted
Greek olives, capers and a basil vinaigrette dressing along with
the sun-dried tomatoes and lettuces.
</P>
<P>
   Biondi favors using vinaigrettes and lighter dressings with the
bagged lettuces because they are so delicate. Creamy dressings tend
to weigh down the greens _ unless you are using romaine, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon and mango devotees will be enchanted with Biondi's
delicious combination, a take-off of a salad on the restaurant's
menu, but prepared with baby spinach instead of the spring mix used
this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Place a trio of mango slices in a few different places around
the edges of a dinner plate. Then toss the spring greens with a
sweet basil vinaigrette (a mixture of garlic, extra virgin olive
oil, fresh chopped basil, lemon juice, sugar or a sugar syrup, and
salt and pepper) and place in the center of the plate. Add a
5-ounce piece of grilled salmon (brush with an herb and garlic oil,
and sprinkle with salt and pepper prior to cooking) to each
individual salad. Then drizzle the fish and fruit with a mixture of
balsamic vinegar cooked slowly with a little sugar until it turns
into a syrup (cool to room temperature before using).
</P>
<P>
   Although he doesn't use packaged greens at the restaurant as
they are too expensive, Thomas Munoz, chef-owner of Joe Joe's
Restaurant in Sherman Oaks, admits he buys the convenient packaged
garden mix (iceberg lettuce and carrots) to use at home to create
the salad that brings back childhood memories _ with ranch dressing
and tomatoes. ``I'm just the average joe joe when I cook at home.
If I'm entertaining, I toss the packaged baby greens with my own
balsamic vinaigrette and cherry tomatoes.'' He also likes to mix
baby romaine with roasted beets, pear slices, toasted hazelnuts and
lemon vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   But he pulled a couple of more sophisticated ideas out of his
hat to add some sparkle to the home cook's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   First was an awesome warm wilted creation that tastes better
than it looks. For each salad, saute two pieces of smoked bacon,
chopped, in a large skillet and drain off half of the fat. Then add
some chopped shallots, one or two ounces of goat cheese in clumps,
about four tablespoons sherry wine vinegar and half a package of
baby romaine salad (which contains both red and green lettuces)
along with some chopped Belgian endive. Toss over medium heat just
until the lettuce is coated and wilted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to cook the lettuce _ you just want to wilt
it,'' cautions Munoz. Quickly turn out onto a dinner-size plate
lined with a few whole pieces of Belgian endive and serve
immediately. Smaller portions work well as an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   For something even more novel and unusual, Munoz created a
Mexican- inspired crab-stuffed chile creation. A mixture of crab,
cut-up butter lettuce, lobster mayonnaise (mix prepared or homemade
mayo with lobster base) was spooned into a roasted and peeled
pasilla chile.
</P>
<P>
   Roast the chile over an open flame until charred and then place
in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for five minutes before
removing the skin, advises Munoz. Serve the chile on a dinner-size
plate atop a pile of black beans zipped up with chopped onions,
garlic and jalapenos, and surround with a bright red homemade salsa
made with chopped fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro and jalapenos.
Drizzle the works with more lobster mayonnaise and add an avocado
fan for the finishing touch.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Francois Meteigner, chef-owner of La Cachette, Century
City, favors tossing baby spinach with a hard-cooked egg dressing
that goes together in minutes. After hard-cooking some eggs, make
the dressing by mixing the yolks with mustard, lemon juice, sherry
wine vinegar, olive oil and chopped fresh garlic. Top the dressed
greens with cooked bacon bits and the chopped cooked egg whites.
</P>
<P>
   Another of his easy favorites is mesclun greens tossed with a
raspberry vinegar dressing with a little regular whole grain
mustard mixed in. Also fashionable on his home table is an eggless
Caesar salad with a balsamic vinaigrette. For his dressing, he
combines Dijon mustard with balsamic vinegar, lots of chopped
garlic and olive oil and then tosses it with romaine lettuce. The
toppers are freshly grated Parmesan cheese and anchovies.
</P>
<P>
   When Olivier Bouillot, chef at Paul's Cafe in Tarzana, uses the
bagged greens occasionally at home, he tosses a mesclun mixture
with cooked raviolis. Take some already-cooked seafood, mushroom or
cheese raviolis, and fry them in some oil until crisp and golden,
he suggests. Cut in half and then toss with the greens, a little
lemon juice, some extra virgin olive oil, diced shallots and
chopped fresh garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Another salad rendition Bouillot likes combines grilled and
sliced portabello mushrooms, walnuts, sliced apples or pears and
baby spinach with a balsamic vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's time to jazz up your menus with one of the
above-mentioned creations _ or one of your own. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If U.S. officials and major health organizations
have their way, french fries, pizza and colas will be banished from
school lunchrooms. Instead, students will be served more fruits,
vegetables, low-fat meats and low-sodium foods.
</P>
<P>
   With obesity rates of U.S. children at an all-time high, the
government and five health groups launched a program Wednesday to
stamp out most fast food, at least in schools.
</P>
<P>
   The groups and the Agriculture Department also urged an often a
slothful generation immobilized by the Internet, video games and
television to get more exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is imperative we do something to turn this situation around
for our children,'' said Shirley Watkins, under secretary of
agriculture for food and nutrition, at a news conference announcing
the food and exercise effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``School children are flunking healthy eating 101,'' said Dr.
Javette Orgain, president of the National Medical Association,
which represents African-American physicians. ``There is a national
epidemic of childhood obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgain added that blacks have the highest obesity rates in the
country and that some inner city schools serve mainly
fast-food-type meals. In these schools, vegetables and fruits ``are
a rare sighting,'' Orgain said.
</P>
<P>
   The program to reverse the trend will start in many school
lunchrooms this summer. It seeks to promote healthy eating habits
by ensuring that school lunchrooms serve meals that include
selections from several of the five major food groups _ fruits,
vegetables, milk products, proteins (such as meat, fish or beans)
and the group that includes bread, rice, pasta and cereal.
</P>
<P>
   The program will encourage students, parents and school
administrators to push for dietary changes in the lunchrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Bagley, president of the American Academy of
Physicians, said obesity in school-age children has stark
ramifications for the future because many obese children will
develop heart disease, diabetes and other life-threatening ailments
later in life.
</P>
<P>
   The health organizations joining the Agriculture Department in
the obesity effort are the American Academy of Physicians, the
American Dietetic Association, the National Medical Association,
the National Hispanic Medical Association and the American Academy
of Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
   According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta:
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1970, about 6 percent of children aged 6 to 17 were
considered overweight. Now, nearly 15 percent of children 6 to 11
are overweight, and so are 12 percent of children 12 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 84 percent of high school students eat too much fat
and more than 91 percent eat too much saturated fat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only one in five high-school students eats the recommended
five daily servings of fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   _ About half of students in grades K through 12 eat less than
one serving a day of fruit, and 29 percent eat less than one
serving a day of vegetables that are not fried.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Surgeon General's office, American
youngsters are increasingly sedentary. Nearly half of those aged 12
to 21 are not physically active on a regular basis. Only 19 percent
of high school students are physically active, and daily enrollment
in high school physical education classes has dropped from 42
percent in 1991 to 25 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity is a severe problem in adults. The government estimates
that 300,000 deaths a year are directly attributable to poor diet
and physical inactivity.

 &HT;    `Visionary' optimistic for AIDS war in Africa
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates is mounting a
major effort to combat the seemingly inexorable spread of AIDS in
Africa with the help and advice of one of the world's foremost
experts on public health _ Dr. William Foege, a longtime Atlanta
resident.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has committed $70
million to fight AIDS in Africa, but that is just the beginning,
Foege said in an interview this week. The figure could grow within
the next few weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the new figure will not reflect the foundation's full
commitment, Foege said. Some of the new grants may be for
preliminary studies, awarded with the presumption that greater sums
will follow once the planning has been done.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of aids in Africa has been, by any measure, a
catastrophe. Of the 33.6 million people around the world living
with HIV or AIDS, 23.3 million of them _ almost 70 percent of the
total _ live in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of the residents of Zimbabwe are
HIV-positive. In Mozambique, AIDS is expected by the year 2030 to
kill half of all those who are now 15 years old. In some countries,
HIV patients occupy up to 80 percent of the hospital beds in urban
areas, crowding out patients suffering from other diseases and
using up scarce health care resources.
</P>
<P>
   The disease has decimated the productive sector of the
population on a continent that can ill-afford any drag on economic
development. And it has left between 9 million and 12 million
African children orphaned.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Foege, who played an important role in the global
eradication of smallpox, is optimistic. One source of his optimism
is the experience in Uganda, a small East African country that has
managed over the last several years to reduce the incidence of HIV
infection in virtually all population groups, from military
recruits to secondary school students to expectant mothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is light at the end of the tunnel,'' Foege said. ``The
continent does not necessarily have to wait for a vaccine before it
can do something. And I think this example has to give great hope
to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Foege, 64, (whose name is pronounced FAY-gy) has long experience
in public health issues. After working to eradicate smallpox, he
served from 1977 to 1984 as director of the Centers for Disease
Control. In 1984, he helped form the Task Force for Child Survival,
a group that worked _ with the World Health Organization, UNICEF,
the World Bank, the United Nations Development Program and the
Rockefeller Foundation _ to immunize children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he became executive director of the Carter Center.
Since 1997, he has taught international health at the Rollins
School of Public Health at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   And last fall, Foege was named the Gates Foundation's senior
global health adviser. He still works half-time at the Rollins
School, while spending the rest of his time advising the
Seattle-based foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which was started by the
Microsoft founder and his wife, has assets of approximately $21.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Curran, dean of the Rollins School _ and also a former
acting director of the CDC's Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention and a
former assistant U.S. surgeon general _ said the Gates Foundation
could hardly have done better than Foege.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill has been, in my view, perhaps, if not the most
influential, certainly one of the most influential figures in
international public health of the last half-century.'' Curran
said. ``I think it's a credit to them that they looked around and
found him and convinced him to work on this.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by Dr. John Hardman, who succeeded Foege as
executive director of the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill is such a visionary,'' Hardman said, ``and I think that
he brings that vision to the Gates foundation.'' By focusing on the
goals, Hardman said, Foege convinces diverse groups to drop their
separate agendas and work together.
</P>
<P>
   Foege said the foundation's effort to fight AIDS in Africa
probably will have six components:
</P>
<P>
   An effort to use the facilities and resources already in Africa
to provide comprehensive treatment. That would include _ ``in a
single package,'' Foege said _ testing, counseling, prevention,
treatment of secondary infections, treatment of sexually
transmitted diseases, treatment of tuberculosis, the interruption
of transmission between mother and child, and the use of anti-viral
medications.
</P>
<P>
   An effort to determine how to replicate the experience of Uganda
in reducing the rate of HIV infection. Uganda, Foege said, had the
fortunate combination of a head of state, President Yoweri
Museveni, who took a
</P>
<P>
   Yoweri Museveni, who took a direct interest in fighting AIDS,
and many governmental and non-governmental organizations that stood
ready to help. The CDC is already working on a project to replicate
the Ugandan experience in 14 other African countries. The Gates
Foundation is examining the possibility of working with the CDC in
those countries, and of working with other organizations _ such as
UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS organization _ in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   A concentration on prevention, perhaps learning from the example
of Senegal, which Foege said is often used as an example of ``a
country that has made the right moves to keep transmission rates
low.''
</P>
<P>
   An effort to reduce transmission from mothers to children during
childbirth, perhaps through the administration of inexpensive drugs
at the end of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   A look at what tools could be given to women to help them reduce
their risk of contracting HIV. This would include, Foege said, the
use of ``microbicidal agents.''
</P>
<P>
   A program to help the continent's AIDS orphans, whose number
Foege put at 12 million.
</P>
<P>
   So far, initial funding has been approved for two of those six
components _ the comprehensive treatment program and the effort to
reduce transmission of AIDS from mothers to their children. But
other grant requests may be approved soon, Foege said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the successful campaign to eradicate smallpox,
Foege has been involved in efforts to eradicate polio and Guinea
worm. He realizes that combating the spread of AIDS in Africa is a
daunting task. Turning the corner was not easy in Uganda, and it
will be difficult, too, in the rest of Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about concentrated, labor-intensive work,'' he
said. But the work can be accomplished, he said. The goal is not
beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``UNAIDS has estimated it might take as much as $3 billion a
year for the rest of Africa,'' he said. ``And while that sounds
like an impossible figure, I keep reminding people that that's what
we spend on health in this country every day. So you have to have
that perspective.''

COMMENTARY: TOO MUCH IN TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Greta Garbo, playing the depressed ballerina
Grusinskaya in the 1932 movie ``Grand Hotel,'' discovered a jewel
thief in her room and delivered what became her signature line: ``I
vant to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm with Garbo. What with cell phones and palm pilots and
satellite-controlled pagers and messagers, the world is too much
with us. In our lust to be in constant hand-held communication, we
fritter away our long-held value of personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, if you are lost on a rainy night, a car phone is a
blessing. If you are trying to file copy from remote Chechnya, a
link in hand via satellite offers an escape hatch for truth. And if
you are stuck in traffic and late for a family party or a crucial
meeting, the wireless gizmos enable you to signal, as did General
Sherman atop Kenesaw Mountain: ``Hold the fort! I am coming!''
</P>
<P>
   But use in emergencies does not account for the cellumania that
has fastened itself to our ears and belts. Something more troubling
is at its root. Too many of us are gripped by the fear of being
alone. If we are not in demand round the clock, goes this worry, we
don't count.
</P>
<P>
   That mass separation anxiety is driven by a curious culture that
demands we all form a circle and hold hands. If you are out of
pocket, you are considered to be somewhat out to lunch. If you are
off the scope, society thinks you must be off your rocker.
Detachment is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   The individual's normal desire to stay in touch has, with a
shove from technology, led to society's relentless pressure never
to be out of touch. As a result, the world is too much with us; we
lay waste our power to be by ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Is the tintinnabulation of bells at restaurants and in theaters
suddenly turning me into some kind of hermit? No; three decades ago
I rejected the earliest electronic pager. At a Moscow summit
meeting, President Nixon's aides were issued this invention by
which the chief executive could reach his entire staff at all times
and in all places.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, demanded to know why I was
the only one to refuse to wear the new pager. I replied that I did
not want to feel like a dog on a leash. He shook his head, but made
a beckoning motion with his fingers, as if to say: Couldn't I come
up with a better reason than privacy?
</P>
<P>
   So I lied. The sound and vibration of the pager on my belt, I
offered, would give me an urgent desire to urinate. He nodded and
took back the pager: ``You have a medical excuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that wirelessness is next to godliness, what excuses can we
come up with to slip today's electronic leashes?
</P>
<P>
   Forget courtesy, civility, concern for others around you; those
old-fashioned reasons are blown away by the new info-age necessity
for constant contact. See that couple in a restaurant, each talking
on a cell phone to someone else? For us to insist they talk only to
each other would take the steam out of their self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, consider the cell phone's destruction of the wall
between work and leisure. Used to be, when you went to work, you
worked; when you commuted, you thought about working or planned
about playing; and when you got home, you could forget work and
make whoopee.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even when you are cultivating your garden, you are on call
and on edge; and when you are whispering into your hand at work,
your boss wonders if you may be playing. As differentiation frays,
stress builds; life becomes a blur, and where there is no real
recreation, there is little creation.
</P>
<P>
   When a friend is late for an appointment, what do cellumaniacs
do? They call to see what's the delay, or scroll furiously through
their palm organizers to fill the unforgiving minutes. Not me; I
stare at the wall, see beautiful shapes in memory, have a
conversation with myself, maybe dream up a column. Ten unexpected
minutes for contemplation is not an insult; it can be a gift.
</P>
<P>
   When Garbo said, ``I vant to be alone,'' the jewel thief, played
by John Barrymore, replied, ``Let me stay just for a little
while.'' Garbo murmured, ``Just for a minute, then,'' and was
seduced.
</P>
<P>
   Savor occasional solitude. Don't give in to cellumania. Not for
a minute.

FAST-TRACK COULD SPEED APPEALS PROCESS FOR MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The appeals process for the Microsoft case could be wrapped up
by Christmas or drag on until the summer of 2002 _ depending
entirely on whether the Supreme Court agrees to hear the case on a
fast-track basis, legal specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the US Justice Department indicated Wednesday that
they will seek to put the case directly before the Supreme Court,
invoking a fast-track statute first passed by Congress in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   The nine Supreme Court justices will then entertain arguments
from both sides as to why they should hear the case without it
first going to the US Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia. The justices could agree to hear the case because it is
of such enormous public importance, or they could insist that it
get more thorough lower-court review first.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Supreme Court takes the case they would hear it in the
fall, and they could resolve this by Christmas,'' said Lawrence
Lessig professor at Harvard University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   If the case gets kicked back to the appeals court, Lessig said,
a ruling wouldn't be likely there until early 2001. That would mean
it would be fall of 2001 before the case went back before the
Supreme Court, and the summer of 2002 before a Supreme Court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of whether to hear the case now, ``the court is
going to be pulled in two directions,'' said Larry Kramer,
professor at New York University Law School. ``The economy turns on
this case in some ways. You have the 800-pound gorilla in the
emerging industry where most of America's economic growth lies.
There is pressure to eliminate the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, the issues are complicated, and the Supreme
Court always likes to have as many lower court opinions as they
can. They are usually not in a hurry,'' Kramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers have complained that the rapid pace of
industry change and increased competition in the marketplace have
rendered the government's case irrelevant. But now that US District
Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson has issued his ruling, the company's
new strategy is likely to call for more deliberation and no quick
action.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Microsoft would vastly prefer that the D.C.
appeals court hear the case before it goes to the Supreme Court,
legal experts say. Company lawyers would hope that appellate judges
would overturn Jackson's ruling, giving the case a different spin
by the time it arrived back at the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers will probably argue that the lower court
should get a shot at the case before the Supreme Court justices
take on such hugely complicated issues, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Microsoft violated antitrust standards in
linking its Windows operating system and other software such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   There is no precedent to help predict the fate of the Microsoft
case at this stage in the process. The breakup of Standard Oil
occurred before the Supreme Court had the option to decline to hear
such cases. The AT&AMP;T breakup case did bypass the appellate court
and go directly to the Supreme Court, but only technical issues
were in dispute at that point.
</P>
<P>
   The juncture that the Microsoft case has reached ``is very
rare,'' said Thane D. Scott, head of the antitrust group at the
Boston law firm of Palmer &AMP; Dodge. ``You really can't read the tea
leaves from the AT&AMP;T case.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time major issues involving antitrust law have
been sent via the expediting law to the Supreme Court, since the
justices got the option in the early '70s to decline to hear
fast-tracked cases, Scott said. The court sought that option in an
effort to clear its docket.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of legal arguments in the case will center on
these issues of process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arguments for hearing the case right away are: The case is
going to end up there anyway, it's of significant public importance
and it's time-sensitive,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arguments against accepting are that the Supreme Court is
the last stop, and it's very important that a correct result be
achieved. The best way for that to happen is to let the D.C.
circuit court process the facts and the legal issues, and give the
Supreme Court something sophisticated to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft itself will also be torn, some experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a purely legal question, delay is a good thing for
Microsoft,'' said Scott. ``From the perspective of their
shareholders and employees, delay may not be a good thing,'' and it
may be more important just to get the matter resolved, he said.

BIG-CITY SCHOOL SYSTEMS FIND INNOVATIVE LEADERS WHO ARE NOT
EDUCATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By TAMAR LEWIN   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Alan D. Bersin, superintendent of the San Diego
schools, is talking tough with 35 student teachers: ``Our reading
levels, by and large, are abysmal,'' he tells them. The dropout
rate is huge, he says, and he has laid off 600 paraprofessionals
because ``they have added virtually nothing to student
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Bersin is arguing the case for his sweeping campaign to reshape
the schools, with prescribed blocks of time for teaching literacy,
and constant teacher training in the methods to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone likes Bersin's approach, and his reform plan
squeaked through the school board on a 3-2 vote in March.
</P>
<P>
   But almost no one notices anymore that he is not an educator.
Bersin is the former U.S. attorney for southern California, one of
the first of a new breed of high-profile outsiders taking over
big-city school districts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Los Angeles board of education named Roy Romer,
the former Colorado governor, as its new superintendent. In May,
Harold O. Levy, a corporate lawyer, was chosen to lead the New York
City school system, the nation's largest. They are the first
non-educators ever chosen for those jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Other urban districts, too, have turned to law, business,
government and the military for new leadership and an outside
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   For many of these newcomers _ often the children of immigrants
who view their families' success as a direct result of public
schooling _ education is the era's biggest challenge and leading a
school system is today's Everest of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public education is what distinguishes this country, both
vertically, in history, and horizontally, from other societies
around the world,'' said Bersin. ``For the first time, there is a
real belief in this country that every child has the right to a
quality education. This is the most important challenge San Diego
faces. It gives reality to what is otherwise the empty myth that in
this country, you can do anything you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy, in an effort to recruit teachers to the cause, has said
recently, ``Urban education is the equivalent of the Peace Corps of
the '60s or the civil rights movement of the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle has had two nontraditional superintendents in a row, one
from the military, one from the private sector. Houston's
superintendent is a former school board member; Chicago's a former
city budget director; Kansas City's a former top federal aviation
official.
</P>
<P>
   `` ``These are all very smart, very talented individuals who
have a clear idea of where they're going, and how to get there,''
said Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of Great
City Schools. ``What's not clear yet is whether they can produce
the same academic gains as a skilled educator.''
</P>
<P>
   But what has driven the trend toward nontraditional
superintendents is precisely the sense that educators have failed
the schools _ and that outsiders may have an edge in effecting
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``School districts need to change how they conduct themselves if
we are to improve student achievement, and that kind of change does
not usually come from those inside the system,'' said Bersin, 52, a
product of the New York City public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Bersin was San Diego's chief federal law enforcement officer two
years ago, when he was named superintendent of the 145,000-student
San Diego district, the nation's eighth-largest urban school
district. Now he is steeped in the language of education, talking
passionately about creating a community of learners, or about
children who score in the bottom quartile on the SAT 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take long to understand the issues, to see the
extraordinary talent of many of the people inside the system, and
the ways the system has functioned as an obstacle to their
growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1990s, it was almost unthinkable to choose a big-city
superintendent from outside education. Traditionally, they were
former teachers who became principals and then superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nontraditional superintendents split the
responsibilities of leading their districts, handling school board
meetings, bond issues, union matters and politics themselves, but
leaving issues of pedagogy to a deputy with educational
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, Bersin turned to Anthony Alvarado, a former New
York City educator best known for his success in raising student
achievement and creating innovative schools in two Manhattan
districts.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Alvarado's long history in New York included a difficult
chapter: in 1984, his year as chancellor ended with his resignation
amid charges of personal financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, he is the chancellor of instruction, and head of
the district's new Institute for Learning _ and, he said, delighted
to be able to focus on raising the quality of instruction. Alvarado
is not revered in San Diego as he was in New York. He knows that
many there see him as a brash outsider imposing heavy-handed
changes on a system he does not know. But, he argues, his changes
grow out of solid research, not personal whim.

ELI LILLY SUED BY FAMILY OF PROZAC USER WHO KILLED WIFE, HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opening a new front in the battle over Prozac and suicide, the
family of a man who killed his wife then himself while taking the
drug are accusing Eli Lilly and Co. of fraud for allegedly
concealing damaging details about its blockbuster antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal lawsuit filed in Hawaii, the family of William
Forsyth claims that Lilly ``committed a fraud on the court'' by
failing to tell the family's lawyers about a patent that claims a
new version of the drug eliminates side effects of the existing
Prozac, including violent and suicidal thoughts among a small
percentage of users.
</P>
<P>
   Despite consistently denying any link between Prozac and
suicide, Lilly has purchased an exclusive license to market the new
drug from a Massachusetts company that owns the patent.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Lilly actively concealed the potentially explosive
patent language during a trial last year over Prozac's alleged role
in the couple's deaths. The trial ended with a verdict in Lilly's
favor; the family has appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilly wanted a verdict that it could herald in the marketplace
as being the definitive vindication of their claims, and they were
willing to get it by withholding important information from the
judge and jury,'' said Houston lawyer Andy Vickery, who represents
the dead couple's adult children.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery said he decided to file the lawsuit after reading a May
7 report in The Boston Globe in which the patent language for the
new drug was publicly disclosed for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lilly declined comment on the suit Wednesday,
saying the company had not seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the lawsuit seems certain to fuel a
revival of a longstanding dispute over the Indianapolis drug
company's efforts to blunt criticism of the popular antidepressant,
a green-and-white capsule that has earned the company billions of
dollars and become a totem of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the new patent can be compared to the tobacco papers.
It's a pharmaceutical company document that acknowledges this
dangerous side effect which has been downplayed by Eli Lilly and
other pharmaceutical companies for a decade,'' said Dr. Joseph
Glenmullen, a Cambridge, Mass. psychiatrist whose new book,
``Prozac Backlash,'' has helped to trigger the renewed controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly has built its defense of Prozac on a 1991 finding by the
US Food and Drug Administration that there is no credible evidence
linking Prozac to suicide. Glenmullen and others have challenged
that finding, alleging it was based on flawed clinical testing and
marred by conflicts of interest among several members of the FDA's
panel of outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   Though sales have slipped somewhat in recent years as other
antidepressants entered the market, more than 35 million people
worldwide have taken Prozac. Lilly derived more than 25 percent of
its $10 billion in revenues last year from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in Honolulu,
also focuses attention on the new drug, which Lilly hopes will
extend its antidepressant franchise after the last Prozac patents
expire in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The key patent for the new drug was obtained in 1998 by two
officials at Sepracor Inc., a Marlborough, Mass. drug company,
along with Dr. Martin H. Teicher, an associate professor of
psychiatry at Harvard University who works at McLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The patent brought Teicher full circle in the Prozac debate: He
had ignited the decade-long controversy over suicidality with a
1990 paper about sudden, self-destructive tendencies among patients
who had recently begun taking Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   The patent describes an antidepressant derived from Prozac that,
the inventors claim, is formulated in such a way as to decrease the
current drug's adverse effects, ranging from headaches and
nervousness to ``intense violent suicidal thoughts and
self-mutiliation.'' That claim is based on Teicher's paper.
</P>
<P>
   Although that patent language directly contradicts Lilly's
longtime position on Prozac, the Indianapolis-based drug company
clearly saw great value in the drug described in the patent.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Lilly paid Sepracor $20 million for exclusive
rights to the patent, a portion of which went to Teicher and
McLean. Lilly also promised the inventors $70 million in milestone
payments depending on the new drug's progress through ongoing
clinical trials, and a percentage of sales if the drug is
ultimately approved and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after that deal was struck, in March 1999, a
federal jury in Honolulu began hearing a civil lawsuit Vickery
filed on behalf of the two adult children of the late William and
June Forsyth.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy couple, married for 37 years, the Forsyths had been
going through a rough patch in their marriage in late 1992 and
early 1993. William Forsyth, 63, began suffering panic attacks, and
in February 1993 his doctor prescribed Prozac. After feeling
wonderful the first day, Forsyth underwent a change for the worse
and admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital. After a week, while
continuing to take Prozac, he checked himself out.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, 1993, 11 days after he began taking Prozac, Forsyth
fatally stabbed his wife multiple times with a serrated kitchen
knife then impaled himself on the blade. Their children blamed the
drug for what they said were their father's completely
uncharacteristic acts.
</P>
<P>
   Of some 200 lawsuits filed against Lilly claiming the use of
Prozac led to suicide or violence, the Forsyth case was only the
second to yield a verdict. Lilly settled many of the others, and
the only other one to reach a jury, in 1994, was widely reported to
have been a victory for the company. In fact, it was settled in a
secret agreement between Lilly and the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly obtained its long-sought courtroom victory in the Forsyth
case when the jury said the drug could not be held responsible for
the murder-suicide. In the suit filed Wednesday, however, the
Forsyths' children claim the victory for Lilly was tainted by the
failure to disclose its link to the new Prozac patent and should be
set aside for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of Lilly's defense was its claim that if Forsyth
suffered from the severe form of agitation his children claim led
to the deaths, he would have experienced inner and outer
restlessness. No one at the psychiatric hospital noticed
restlessness in Forsyth before his release, and Lilly's lawyers and
expert witnesses used that to refute his children's case.
</P>
<P>
   In the patent, however, the side-effect is described purely as
inner restlessless, a condition known as akathisia. Vickery said
that difference is crucial because, if the patent had been
disclosed at the trial, it would have been a powerful answer to
Lilly's argument that outer restlessness _ characterized by
relentless fidgeting _ was required as evidence of the side-effect.
It also might have challenged Lilly's overall claims about suicide,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a top Lilly scientist, Dr. Gary Tollefson,
testified during the trial that it was his opinion ``that there is
absolutely no medically sound evidence of an association between
any antidepressant medicine, including Prozac, and the induction of
suicidal ideation (thoughts) or violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The new patent language, and Lilly's purchase of exclusive
rights to the invention, might have convinced the jury otherwise,
Vickery said.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery is basing the suit partly on a 1995 ruling by the US
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which includes Hawaii. That
case, Pumphrey v. K.W. Thompson Tool Co. of New Hampshire, involved
the death of a man who dropped a handgun manufactured by Thompson.
The gun fired, sending a bullet through his heart.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that Thompson committed a fraud upon the court
by failing to disclose that it had produced a video that showed the
same type of gun fired accidentally when dropped. The court said
the existence of the video should have been revealed by a Thompson
lawyer who knew about it and attended the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery contends that Lilly acted similarly to Thompson because
a patent lawyer for the drugmaker attended the Forsyth trial but
never disclosed the language on suicide in the patent that Lilly
licensed from Sepracor.

 SAN DIEGO: personal whim.

<P>
   ``We have lots of evidence about what helps kids learn,'' he
said. ``We know literacy and math are the gatekeeper skills that
give kids access to academic success for the rest of their lives.
We know summer school helps reduce the learning loss that occurs
when poor kids are out of school for a long time. It's not Tony
Alvarado doing summer school, it's what works.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a surgeon, visiting hospitals in different cities,
there's a stunning similarity in the tools, the length of the
incision, the mortality rate. When we started, the elementary
programs here had 200 reading programs, sometimes four or five
different programs in the same school. And what all these programs
generated was only 41 percent of the kids reading at or above grade
level.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The commitment to systemic change is profound, according to
Kimiko Fukuda, a 33-year veteran of the San Diego system who is the
only one of the old assistant superintendents to remain as an
``instructional leader'' in the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd read Alvarado's work, and I understood the problem of
every teacher being in private practice, almost an independent
contractor,'' she said. ``But when I tried to change things as an
assistant superintendent, it didn't have much impact, because it
was voluntary, and the union didn't like it. You really can't make
this kind of change unless it's from the top, and it covers
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, each principal is required to spend two hours a day in
classrooms helping teachers improve their work. Peer coaches in the
schools help with teaching methods, too, and principals attend
weekly training sessions on literacy techniques such as `guided
reading'' and ``shared reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Some principals love it.
</P>
<P>
   At Central Elementary School, a year-round school with 1,200
mostly Hispanic children crammed into a facility built for 800,
Elaine Arm, the principal, sings the praises of Bersin's
educational overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``'I've been reborn,'' she says. ``I feel powerful. I'm not just
an administrator now; I'm an instructional leader; I'm in
classrooms every day and I love it. There is real focus. We know
what we are supposed to do, and why. It's an enormous change, all
because of this superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   If something as abstract as school reform can be made visible,
Bersin's version is on view on the hallway bulletin boards, where
sweetly childish writings _ ``I like when the frog got the peach
down.'' _ are posted beneath the state learning standard that
prompted the assignment. ``3.1 We are learning to distinguish real
stories from make-believe,'' or ``2.6 We are learning to write a
response to literature.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is visible as the fourth graders write book essays
following a ``rubric'' that tell them the first paragraph should
contain the title, author and theme, the second should compare the
main characters and the third should compare the problems they
faced and the solutions they reached.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this approach is not universally accepted. Many San
Diego educators say the reforms impinge on their spontaneity and
overemphasize literacy, neglecting social studies and science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teacher I work with is mostly hoping this will pass,''
said one of the student teachers Bersin was addressing. ``Her
attitude is `I've been teaching for 10 years, and what the heck is
guided reading?' She doesn't think the principal who's supposed to
be leading it understands all this new stuff any better than she
does.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The student teachers seem energized by Bersin's approach, but
wary, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's change, and it makes people nervous,'' said Les
Henderson, who expects teacher certification next month. `We're
talking about institutionalizing education, standardizing things,
and I'm on the fence about it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Two years into Bersin's reign, some local educators question how
long he can talk about the district's poor performance without
being held responsible for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes three to five years to bring real change,'' said
Bruce S. Cooper, a professor of educational administration at
Fordham University. ``The problem is that large districts are so
unmanageable and unstable that the average superintendent only
lasts two and a half years.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can stay the course, it may be Bersin, a Brooklyn
native with an easy charm, a sharp mind, and a golden resume: Phi
Beta Kappa at Harvard, All Ivy and All-East Football Teams, and
Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, where he overlapped a year with Bill
Clinton, and then, like the president, moved on to Yale Law School.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation he headed west, first as special counsel to the
Los Angeles Police Commission, then handling commercial litigation
at Munger, Tolles &AMP; Olson. He moved to San Diego for a sabbatical
teaching law school in 1992, shortly after the birth of his second
daughter, now a second grader in the district. Bersin's oldest
daughter is at Harvard, and his youngest is in kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows you what a Republican town San Diego is that three
weeks after I got here, I was the head of Clinton for President.''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, President Clinton appointed him U.S. attorney, and
starting in 1995, he also served as Attorney General Janet Reno's
border czar. Faced with the intractable problems of the border _
drug trafficking and illegal immigration _ he gained attention by
reframing the issues in terms of public safety, making it possible
to work with Mexico toward some common goals.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Bersin keeps a politician's schedule: he goes from the student
teachers' visit to throwing the first ball at the Padres game, from
a visit to Central Elementary to teaching an eighth grade history
class at Correia Middle School, and on to a staff meeting on
portfolio assessment at Curie Elementary.
</P>
<P>
   He talks with every teacher, every administrator, asking lots of
questions, listening hard and saying how much he values their
ideas. He stops to ask a custodian how things are going. ``We've
made everyone in the system, the bus drivers, everyone, understand
that their job is to support learning in the classroom,'' Bersin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bersin has prodigious energy, and seems to take real pleasure in
all the public contact. But he is not, he says, headed for
political office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd wanted elective office, I'd have stayed in the U.S.
attorney's office, putting bad guys in jail, which plays to the
public,'' he said. ``I'm in a position to choose what I do and
where I can make a difference. And this is the most important
challenge.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Possession of unchallenged economic power deadens
initiative, discourages thrift and depresses energy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Immunity from competition is a narcotic, and rivalry a
stimulant, to industrial progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson in June 2000 ordering the breakup
of Microsoft? No, Judge Learned Hand declaring in 1945 that the
Aluminum Company of America had illegally monopolized the market
for a type of aluminum ingot.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has changed since 1945, the exact midpoint between the
passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 and the Microsoft
ruling Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   An economy based on heavy industry and capital investment has
transformed itself into one based more and more on human capital
and information technology where ``it's pretty hard to figure out
what the markets are and what really competes with what,'' as
Thomas E. Kauper, a former government antitrust chief who now
teaches antitrust law at the University of Michigan, noted
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as Wednesday's ruling demonstrates dramatically,
the old factories may be obsolete, but the legal principles that
led to the breakup of the Standard Oil trust in 1911 and the
American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. in 1984 are not.
</P>
<P>
   Perceptions and priorities have changed, naturally enough. When
oil and tobacco trusts loomed over the economic landscape, the
perceived enemy was price fixing, while in the government's theory
of the Microsoft case, adopted by Jackson, the enemy is the ability
of a predatory monopolist to strangle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   But from a broader perspective, these are simply different ways
to measure a monopolist's threat to consumer welfare, the
protection of which was the ultimate goal of antitrust enforcement
in the old economy and remains so in the new. There is no reason
why the old rules should not apply in the software-driven new
economy, Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general for
antitrust, has insisted throughout the case.
</P>
<P>
   Simply attaining monopoly status in a given market, by being
quicker out of the starting gate, or more creative or diligent than
the competition, does not itself violate antitrust law. As Hand
said in the Alcoa case 55 years ago, ``The successful competitor,
having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when he
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, portraying itself as a victim of antitrust policy run
amok, has long argued that the government was turning on it in
exactly that way. Jackson disagreed. Microsoft's offense, he held,
lay not in the fact that its Windows operating system runs 90
percent of the world's personal computers, but in the methods the
company used to maintain and try to extend its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Jackson found that Microsoft mounted a campaign of dirty
tricks, and the dirty tricks are old tricks,'' said Robert E.
Litan, director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution,
who served in the Justice Department's antitrust division earlier
in the Clinton Administration. In an interview, he continued:
``John D. Rockefeller used them all: exclusive contracting,
throwing your weight around, scaring off the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust cases have two dimensions: liability and, if liability
is found, a remedy. While on the liability side, there is a
straight line leading from the earliest antitrust cases to
Wednesday's ruling, Jackson's approved remedy _ breaking Microsoft
in two _ arguably moves the case toward uncharted territory.
</P>
<P>
   Monopolies have been broken up before, of course, either by
court order, as in the old Standard Oil case, or by negotiated
settlement, as in the AT&AMP;T case. But the earlier breakups or
divestitures were along fairly obvious lines.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's own corporate structure reflected the division between
long distance service, which it kept in the breakup, and local
telephone service, which was spun off. Microsoft's chairman, Bill
Gates, repeated Wednesday, as he has in the past, that there was no
precedent for breaking up a ``unitary'' company such as his.
``We're unique,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To assess the wisdom of the remedy in the Microsoft case, which
the government sought and which Microsoft strenuously resisted,
requires a set of subtle judgments and just plain guesses about the
environment for Internet-based information and a technology market
that even during the two years of the Microsoft trial has evolved
with surprising speed away from the desktop and toward wireless,
hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   It also involves, to a degree that no other antitrust case has,
questions about maintaining the country's leadership in the global
economy. Of all the earlier antitrust cases, only the AT&AMP;T case
came close to having such global implications. ``If we had left
AT&AMP;T where it was, we'd have a stodgy, non-dynamic
telecommunications world today, and we'd never even know what we
were missing,'' said Harvey J. Goldschmid, an antitrust professor
at Columbia Law School, in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 20 years further into the information revolution, the
global implications of gambling wrong on the Microsoft remedy are
even greater, given the dominance that Microsoft's success has
meant for the United States. While the government's economic
experts have dismissed the warnings of Gates that efficiency and
synergy will be lost by cleaving the Windows operating system from
the software applications, the fact is that nobody knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Charles D. Weller, an antitrust specialist at the Cleveland law
firm of Baker &AMP; Hostetler, commented Wednesday that under the
Supreme Court's current skeptical view of expert testimony _ a view
the justices have applied in negligence cases but not yet directly
to antitrust cases _ the economists who testified on both sides
should have been disqualified.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking up Microsoft ``is not like breaking up two factories,''
Goldschmid said. ``A breakup may well be the appropriate remedy,''
he added, ``but the tough part is that there is a heavy investment
in human capital, and breaking up Microsoft means changing things
for a lot of people.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was Thursday at rush hour on the street in front
of Grand Central Terminal, and it was a cell phone circus.
</P>
<P>
   Some of it was predictable. People walking with phones to their
cheeks, others leaning against buildings, plugging their ears
against the sounds of trucks, buses and sirens, shouting above the
din.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing unusual, except for one young man, carrying his portable
CD player, no cell phone in sight, who seemed to be having an
animated conversation with himself. It was another common city
sight, except that his words were completely comprehensible, as if
he were talking to a real person, not some imaginary adversary. In
fact, he was discussing the virtues of ESPN Zone.
</P>
<P>
   Meet a new breed of cell phone user: a small but growing number
of mobile talkers who have decided to put down their phones and
plug in to accessories that enable them to go hands free. Tiny ear
pieces and microphones are now spotted dangling next to cheeks.
Many drivers are adopting slightly bulkier headsets or using a
barely visible microphone and speaker mounted in the car.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, people in large cities, in particular, will soon
face another round of weird social behavior stemming from cell
phone use. Just a few years ago, handheld cell phones elicited
stares and whispers, especially in public areas like airports and
coffee shops.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just as we have grown accustomed to the sight of people
standing on street corners screaming into pieces of plastic and as
we struggle to develop cell phone etiquette, wearable phones have
arrived to complicate matters. ``Cell phones have started to become
socially accepted,'' said Phil Hester, chief technology officer at
IBM's personal systems group. ``These ear buds are pushing it to
the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man with the CD player was Davis Macias, a college
student, who had his phone attached to his belt, a microphone
clipped to his shirt and an earphone in his left ear. He was
talking to a friend on 67th street who was walking to work wearing
the same kind of contraption.
</P>
<P>
   So far, of course, most people do not wear their phones. The
proportion of Americans buying headsets is under 5 percent. But
that number has been rising for two years, according to recent
survey results from the International Data Corp. And if users in
countries with more cell phones can be a guide, the number of
people getting around with wearable phones will continue to go up.
</P>
<P>
   In London, ``you can walk around the city and see people using
them everywhere,'' said Jim Moore, a consultant for McKinsey &AMP; Co.
who recently lived in Europe and who would not even think about
using a handheld cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Moore adopted a headset to avoid the ache of holding up the
phone. Others, interviewed on the streets of Manhattan, said they
had heard that holding cell phones to the head causes brain tumors
(So far, the Food and Drug Administration has said that such risks
cannot be confirmed nor ruled out.) And most simply liked being
able to use both hands while chatting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just so convenient,'' said Wilson Ortega, who wore a
headset as he stood in line at a midtown Starbucks last week. When
a cell phone rang inside the pocket of his baggy jeans, he took a
peek at the phone, slid it back into his pocket and said a soft
hello into a microphone hanging by his face.
</P>
<P>
   How the new technology will fit into the current cell phone
confusion is not clear. People already complain about the rude
intrusions of ringing cell phones in movie theaters and the
annoyance of hearing one side of someone's extended phone
conversation while sitting on the bus heading home. And that is
when they are prepared by the sight of the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Social scientists say much of the consternation is caused by the
blurring of the lines between public and private spaces _ lines
that will become even fuzzier as phones are not only taken
everywhere, but are also worn everywhere, for easy access at any
time. The Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association says
that more than 92 million people now have mobile phone service in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of work and home is already largely gone,'' said
Philip E. Agre, a professor of information studies at the
University of California at Los Angeles. The same principle, Agre
said in an interview via his cell phone (though not a wearable
one), can be extended to spaces like cars and sidewalks. As he
stood in a Los Angeles taco bar, he managed to order a burrito and
talk on the phone at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling self-conscious about those blurring lines, people using
cell phones are trying to find ways to achieve privacy in public,
often while still holding conversations a decibel above the norm. A
woman on 6th Avenue and 43rd Street last Thursday, for example,
held a phone to her face using one hand and held a crumpled tissue
in the other. She had turned her tear-stained face to the wall of
the building. Nearby, a man stepped into an alley just before
screaming obscenities into his cell phone, words that could still
be heard with remarkable clarity many steps away.
</P>
<P>
   Wearers of headsets and ear pieces may need to create social
cues of a different sort. They need signals that let others know
when they are talking to people who are nowhere to be seen and when
they have come down to earth to interact with the people around
them.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Barnwell, who works at the Starbucks at 44th Street and
Lexington Avenue, said she was once trying to make sense of a
customer's confusing order when he stopped in midsentence and said,
``Hold on, I'm in Starbucks.'' Then he made a comprehensible
request for a drink and shifted back into his former conversation,
without any external sign that he was on the phone.

 &HT;    Political storms haunt South Pacific
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The tropical nations of Fiji and the Solomon Islands
evoke images of of warm nights, swaying palms and sandy beaches
bordered by Pacific waters.
</P>
<P>
   The official Fiji Web site boasts about an ``ideal South Sea
tropical climate'' and calls the country ``a perfect holiday
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   The official Web site of the Solomon Islands touts the country's
``pristine sandy beaches, butterflies as big as birds, rare
orchids,'' not to mention ``some of the friendliest people in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But the political waters in these two South Pacific nations have
been anything but pacific lately.
</P>
<P>
   In Fiji, rebels have been holding the prime minister and about
three dozen other people hostage for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   And in the Solomon Islands on Tuesday, some of the friendliest
people in the world strafed a plane carrying two British mediators
who were fleeing the country, as fighting between rival groups
intensified and truckloads of armed teenagers cruised streets. On a
positive note, rebels released that country's prime minister
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries, both of which lie northeast of Australia, are
tiny. Their combined population is about 1.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   But they are home nonetheless to ethnically diverse populations
_ and those ethnic differences have led to the current unrest.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Fiji, which is 2,250 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia, erupted May 19. A bankrupt, part-Fijian businessman
named George Speight, proclaiming that he was acting in the name of
all indigenous Fijians, stormed the parliamentary compound in Suva
with a small group of armed followers and took three dozen people
captive, including Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, the first
ethnic Indian to hold that post in Fiji's history.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic Indians make up about 44 percent of the country's
population. Speight and his followers want them banned from holding
office.
</P>
<P>
   Since the crisis began, the military, led by army Commodore
Frank Bainimarama, has taken power, revoked the constitution and
tried to negotiate with Speight. But the hostages are still being
held.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Speight warned the military to expect serious
reprisals if soldiers shoot at his gunmen. His threat came after a
burst of automatic gunfire around Fiji's parliament complex, where
the hostages are being held.
</P>
<P>
   But the unrest posed few problems for a mission group of about a
dozen people from the Campus View Church of Christ in Athens, Ga.,
said Owen Tingle, 21, a rising senior at the University of Georgia
who made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Some buidings in Suva had been burned in riots, some shops were
boarded up and a curfew prevented the group from conducting evening
Bible study sessions, Tingle said. But the group, which spent two
weeks in Fiji and returned May 31, never felt in danger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people down there seemed real cheerful and happy,'' he
said. ``Their main thing down there is tourism, and they were real
worried about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Solomon Islands, 1,600 miles northeast of Sydney, the
tension is between natives of different islands.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis eased Wednesday as rebels from Malaita island
released Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu from house arrest and
dropped demands that he resign, but violence on Guadalcanal grew.
</P>
<P>
   The indigenous Istabu have been fighting to force the Malaitans
off Guadalcanal, the largest of the Solomon Islands, and the place
where U.S. Marines in 1942-43 began the long fight back against
Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known which group _ the rebel Malaita Eagle Force or
the Istabu Freedom Movement _ fired on the plane carrying British
politicians Glenys Kinnock and John Corrie, members of the European
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Kinnock, the wife of European Union official Neil Kinnock, said
the situation ``became completely lawless'' after Monday's coup
attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police just seemed to concede to the gunmen of the Malaita
Eagle Force under Andrew Nori. There were armed men roaming around
with home-made weapons, and the streets were blocked and the
airport closed,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels fought around the capital Wednesday, and stranded
foreigners reported seeing truckloads of armed teenagers cruising
Honiara's streets.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Malaitan spokesman, Nori, said his forces
fired from a stolen police gunboat on a rival rebel group on a
beach, killing 100. Nori said his comrades on the ground watched
from about 60 feet away.
</P>
<P>
   While the coup, in which the Malaita Eagle Force seized the
prime minister, took place Monday, the two groups have been
fighting over Guadalcanal for months.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people have been killed or left missing in recent
fighting, and 20,000 have been forced to flee their homes.

 NEW YORK: the phone.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I think people may have a strong reaction to people wearing
these things all over the place,'' said Susan Squires, an
anthropologist who is studying variations in cell-phone behavior
for GVO, a product-research company in Palo Alto, Calif. Society
will have to learn that wearers of ear pieces are not people who,
as Squires delicately put it, ``are having auditory
hallucinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Ear bud and microphone users sometimes try to signal to others
that they are on the phone, putting the handset on a restaurant
table in full view, for example, or holding the microphone wire as
they walk, no longer, strictly speaking, hands-free. Jon Geist, a
guitar teacher who was recently spotted walking around wearing his
phone, said he thinks people are getting used to the sight of him
involved in conversation. ``I usually just smile as if to say, look
I'm not a lunatic, I'm on the telephone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other earbud users retain some of the unconscious,
privacy-seeking behavior that they learned from using a regular
cell phone: At Grand Central Terminal a few weeks ago, a management
consultant from Boulder, Colo., named Sandy Keziah had turned away
from the crowds to use his hands-free system. He leaned his
shoulder against a marble wall as he began to speak, his face so
close to the cool surface he could have kissed it.
</P>
<P>
   Wearable phones will also have to pass the trendiness test
before they gain popularity in the United States. Which is more of
a status symbol: wearing tiny ear buds and a gadget on your waist
or carrying a phone that all can see? In New York, among the
hundreds of stylish and toned 20-somethings who gathered at an
outdoor cafe in Union Square on a recent Thursday evening, not one
could be seen wearing a headset or ear piece. Almost all had a cell
phone in hand, thumb often poised to hit the Talk button to take a
call.
</P>
<P>
   Among younger crowds, however, Squires sees some hints that
hands-free cell phones may catch on. Her research among American
teen-agers has shown that many of them are not happy with the idea
of constantly carrying a cell phone, because it reminds them of
their lack of time spent talking face to face with Mom and Dad, who
are often on their phones while transporting their children. ``They
see the cell phone as business-oriented and cutting into their
ability to interact with their parents,'' Squires said. So if the
phone were ``disguised'' or designed as something to be worn, she
said, it might be more palatable to the future cell phone set.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, she said, if a day arrives when earphones for music
are meshed with ear buds for cell phones, teen-agers will probably
adopt them in droves. Since cell phones are already being sold with
Web access, and MP3 music files are shared on the Web, that
combination may not be far away.
</P>
<P>
   For Macias, the college student strolling around Grand Central
last week, it could not come soon enough. While the ear bud for his
cell phone was in his left ear, his right ear was occupied as well.
It held an earphone that connected him to the silver CD player in
his hands. ``I'm listening to Eminem's new album, but I can still
be on the phone,'' he said, grinning. Then he turned and headed up
Lexington Avenue, his head full of hip-hop rhymes, remote
conversations and maybe the faint rhythm of the city rumbling by.

THE SECRET LIFE OF THE HOME COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By J.D. BIERSDORFER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Idle hands may be the devil's workshop, but an idle computer has
the potential to seek out extraterrestrial life, crack encryption
codes and maybe make a little extra cash for its owner.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed computing, in which a large problem or daunting
amount of data is parceled out to many _ even millions _ of
computers to work on at once, is becoming a viable substitute for
the once-almighty supercomputer. Even the humblest home machine can
become a cog in a larger computational wheel, receiving data,
churning through it at its own speed and returning the results.
It's a digital-age illustration of the old adage about how to eat
an elephant: one bite at a time.
</P>
<P>
   By far the best-known distributed computing project is
SETI(at)Home, a screen saver program, designed for home computers,
that analyzes radio signals from the cosmos for patterns or other
signs of alien life. Other projects have found million-digit prime
numbers, deciphered secret codes and helped in the design of
storage containers for nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   Like many successful inventions originally created by scientists
to share information and promote the greater good (including the
World Wide Web), distributed computing is being examined for its
commercial potential: computer owners may be able to, in effect,
rent out unused processing time.
</P>
<P>
   SETI(at)Home (SETI stands for Search for Extraterrestrial
Intelligence) was developed at the University of California at
Berkeley. It went into full distribution about a year ago and
recently signed up its two millionth user. After a participant
downloads the free screen saver program, packets of data recorded
at a radio telescope in Puerto Rico are sent to the user's computer
via the Internet. The participant's computer analyzes a packet when
it is not handling other tasks, then sends the data back to the
SETI(at)Home server and receives another packet.
</P>
<P>
   Most of SETI(at)Home's users have probably never even noticed
the computing time that they have donated to the project because
the screen saver program makes great use of each computer's idle
time. The program can be set to do its analyses when the computer
has been idle for a while (for example, when the user takes a
break). But it can also be set to function in the much smaller
intervals of idle time that occur even when a machine appears to be
in constant use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say you're typing a story _ each time you hit a key,
your computer works for about a hundredth of a second,'' said Dr.
David Anderson, a computer scientist who has done extensive
research in distributed computing and is also the project director
of SETI(at)Home. ``And then it sits there for another second,
waiting for you to hit the next key. So even while you think you
are using your computer, about 99.99 percent of its time it's not
actually doing anything useful.'' That is, unless it happens to be
doing a little distributed work on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Not all supersize projects are suitable for the distributed
approach, and large computing chores like weather simulation do not
work well because quick calculations are needed. One project in
which a cluster proved effective was the RC5-56 Secret Key
Challenge, in which thousands of volunteers donated computer time
to crack a 56-bit encryption code. The project was one of a number
run by Distributed.net, a nonprofit organization that has signed up
about 60,000 participants to participate in a variety of
code-cracking contests.
</P>
<P>
   All told, SETI(at)Home's users are currently averaging about 12
teraflops, or 12 trillion calculations per second, over the course
of a day, said Dan Werthimer, an astronomer at Berkeley and the
chief scientist for the project. ``It's the largest computation
that's ever been done _ on this planet, anyway,'' Werthimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Werthimer calculated that home users had donated 283,000 years
of computing time to the project so far. ``They're donating time,
about 1,000 years every day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Supercomputers are usually used for large computing problems,
like nuclear weapons research and weather forecasting, that require
a staggering number of calculations, but they are ``super'' in both
processing power and price tag. Computers capable of such power can
cost millions of dollars, a price that is beyond the reach of many
institutions. And a supercomputer, like any computer, can quickly
become obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   SETI researchers ran into the obsolescence problem before
turning to distributed computing. They started out building
specialized supercomputers to handle the data from the radio
telescopes. Because of the rapid advance of technology, though, a
SETI-specific supercomputer has a short life span. ``After five
years, your machine is kind of a dinosaur,'' Werthimer explained,
``and it's time to build something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Distributed computing has been around for several decades, but
it has been greatly aided by two developments: the increasing speed
of personal computers and the advent of the Internet, which
provides an easy and almost instantaneous means of exchanging data
between machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed of the common PC has increased to such a dramatic
rate,'' Anderson said, ``that the high-end PC today is as fast as
one of these Cray supercomputers was about 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The real rise of distributed computing can be traced to 1994,
when Donald Becker and Dr. Thomas Sterling, working for the Center
of Excellence in Space Data and Information Sciences at the Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland, created a cluster computer from 16
processors networked together and dubbed it Beowulf.
</P>
<P>
   Becker recalled that the name had been chosen by Sterling for a
number of reasons, including a line loosely translated from
``Beowulf,'' the epic Anglo-Saxon poem, that described the heroic
Beowulf as having the strength of many.
</P>
<P>
   The Beowulf Project proved that an incredibly powerful computer
could be created by harnessing together many smaller computers like
Pentium II's running open-source software like Linux. The idea took
off, and clusters began to spring up at academic institutions and
NASA research centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are thousands _ there might be as many as 10,000
clusters out there,'' Becker said. The Beowulf Project Web site
contains a wealth of information about the project, along with the
recipe for making a Beowulf cluster and links to mailing lists and
other Beowulf-related forums.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said he expected that Beowulf cluster computers would
take over many of the complicated problems that used to be handled
only by supercomputers, but not all of them. ``There are certainly
jobs where only the largest machines are appropriate to use, so
there's still a very solid role for traditional supercomputers,''
he said. ``But for most other applications, a cluster like this is
much more cost-effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Most distributed computing systems designed for public
participation are on the philanthropic side, but some sites want to
bring money into the picture. ``Isn't it time your computer started
paying for itself?'' asks the home page of the ProcessTree Network,
an enterprise that would like to pay users money in exchange for
their computers' idle time. The ProcessTree Network and
DCypher.Net, another distributed computing venture, have recently
been merged into a company called Distributed Science.
</P>
<P>
   Although the service hasn't opened yet, its operations are
expected to be somewhat like SETI(at)Home's. After a participant
installs the ProcessTree program to a home computer, that user will
connect to the Internet to download a work unit, or batch of data,
from one of the company's servers. Once the work unit is on the
home computer, the ProcessTree software will munch and crunch the
information during the PC's idle time. Then it will send data back
to the ProcessTree server and collect a new unit.
</P>
<P>
   In return for those spare processor cycles, the company will
mail the user a check or credit the user's online account with
small payments that can be spent online like electronic cash.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Armin Lenz, a software developer at Distributed Science, said
that more than 25,000 people had signed up to work on the venture.
He predicted that distributed computing would become an industry
unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be huge,'' Lenz said in an e-mail
message. ``Think in terms of going from `railroads' of
supercomputing to the `individual mass traffic' of distributed
processing. There are thousands of projects that cannot be tackled
because of a lack of computing power that is at the same time
sitting idle on everyone's desk.'' Although ProcessTree members
will not know exactly what their computers are working on, their
computers might be used for things like video animation, analyses
of scientific and corporate research data, weather models and
cryptography.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson is less sure about whether such payments will be
worthwhile for home computer users. ``The value of the CPU time is
probably small enough that it wouldn't amount to a significant
quantity of money for most people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ProcessTree venture will be ready to begin as soon as its
founders are satisfied with the home-user software, and Lenz said
the company was negotiating with several well-known companies that
might need its heavy-duty data analyses. ``For DCypher.Net, we have
more projects waiting in line than we have people to power them,''
he said. ``There's certainly the need for massive amounts of
distributed computing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether for pay or play, distributed computing can be found in
computer labs or family dens. And in the case of SETI(at)Home,
which registers the users of its program and tracks the work done
by each participating computer, it might just mean that a volunteer
somewhere will be the lucky one to have the computer that first
detects signals from extraterrestrial beings.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some sites to check if you want to find out about
distributed computing, or even do some yourself.

ADVERTISING: WHAT MICROSOFT CAN DO TO GET THE PUBLIC ON ITS SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST)   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Microsoft Corp. assesses the implications of the breakup
ordered Wednesday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, the advice from
professional communicators on how the company ought to handle the
consequences is being offered almost as quickly as the ``I Love
You'' computer worm infested e-mail in-boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft ``should turn it into a political issue and go right
over the heads of the politicians and appeal to their bosses: the
taxpayers, the voters,'' said Richard Laermer, chief executive at
RLM Public Relations in New York, which represents several
technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it could be the `Isn't that what America is all about?'
angle, free enterprise, the melting pot, opportunity,'' he added,
``and it becomes emotional. Pull the heartstrings, and keep
positioning Microsoft as the underdog against the mean guys.
Everyone roots for the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   But could Microsoft be successfully spun as an underdog?
</P>
<P>
   ``In an environment where everyone is so cynical about
Microsoft,'' the public perceives the company's leaders ``as
insincere, even though I don't believe they are,'' said Trish
Adams, account director at Wieden &AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore. She
worked on the Microsoft account when Wieden &AMP; Kennedy was a
principal Microsoft agency.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than use Microsoft's top managers to respond to the
ruling, Adams said, ``I'd be much more likely to put more `real
people' on the air: the people who are the workhorses, the people
who really believe in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having worked with them, I know those people still see
themselves as working for a small, scrappy company,'' she added,
``and believe what they do is best for consumers. The other
approach would do more damage than good.''
</P>
<P>
   Some executives, however, said they thought no amount of spin
control could overcome Microsoft's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say it's a bit late,'' said Chris Wall, executive
creative director on the IBM account at the New York office of
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, part of the WPP Group. ``You can't undo
years of neglect with a couple of ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives ``have tried in fits and starts to humanize
their image,'' Wall said _ referring to steps like having Bill
Gates, the company's chairman, appear on television programs and in
commercials _ ``but they have not been terribly evangelical'' in
disseminating their point of view, and ``a `take no prisoners'
attitude is coming back to bite them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall, who was creative director on the Microsoft account at
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, said he admired the company because when ``it got
powerful, it didn't get fat but kept focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Microsoft has not made a compelling public case for what
is the truth,'' he asserted, ``that it works in an industry fueled
by change and innovation and in a way it is under threat now more
than ever, from Unix and Linux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple Computer has shown that you can be very focused on
margins and at the same time project a benevolent image,'' Wall
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Microsoft should talk to Steve Jobs,'' he added,
referring to the Apple co-founder and chief executive. That would
not be too difficult to arrange; Microsoft owns a small stake in
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happens, Bill Gates should become a student of
Richard Nixon,'' said Ed Gyurko, president at Smart P.R. in New
York, an agency specializing in technology clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nixon was pilloried,'' Gyurko said, recalling the resignation
in the face of impeachment over Watergate, ``but then he redeemed
himself and carved out a new role as a pundit and statesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates ``could become a guru for business,'' Gyurko suggested,
``taking what he does best and reversing the bad karma.''
</P>
<P>
   What might Microsoft actually do in the wake of the antitrust
ruling? Its current agency, McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L, which replaced
Wieden &AMP; Kennedy on the account, is mum for now.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart Alter, a spokesman in New York for McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L,
declined to comment on what plans were being formulated. The agency
is part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of the
McCann-Erickson World Group; McCann-Erickson is owned by the
Interpublic Group of Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The trade publication Advertising Age reported this week that
Microsoft executives were considering ``at least half a dozen
advertising possibilities to react immediately'' to the ruling. The
options include television commercials, according to the report,
that would feature Microsoft senior managers or customers offering
testimonials.

 &HT;    After dramatic layoffs, Coke is making hires
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After months of letting thousands of employees go,
Coca-Cola is hiring again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a moratorium on hiring through the realignment process,
which concluded at the end of April,'' Coca-Cola spokesman Ben
Deutsch said Wednesday. ``We've begun some hiring, primarily
filling positions held by people who voluntarily left the company
or retired, as well as new positions created as a result of our
reorganization.''
</P>
<P>
   Deutsch would not comment on the number of positions that are
being filled, but it is believed to be in the hundreds. He also
would not comment on the types of positions.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford Bernstein analyst Bill Pecoriello said the company is
likely to be beefing up its hiring of employees who will be fueling
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is picking up the pace of innovation and Internet
marketing,'' Pecoriello said. ``They're probably bringing in some
new, young talent with new, young thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello also expects Coca-Cola to hire employees to work on
boosting sales of the company's noncarbonated beverages _ including
water, teas, juice drinks and sports drinks _ in the wake of the
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 26, the company announced a major reorganization to
result in the loss of 6,000 jobs around the world, including 2,500
in Atlanta. Then in April, it reduced the worldwide number to
5,200.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts have been accomplished through layoffs, attrition,
early retirements and outsourcing of work to other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Former human resources manager Larry Jones said he believes the
company is trying to fill ``several hundred vacancies'' right now.
Jones, who was laid off in February, and about a dozen other people
protested Wednesday outside Coke's headquarters in support of a
boycott aimed at pressuring the company into settling a racial
discrimination lawsuit.

APTITUDE SEEN AS SMART PICK AT BELMONT STAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No Fusaichi Pegasus. No Red Bullet. Where's the
glamor in Saturday's 132d running of the Belmont Stakes? Well, take
a look at Aptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus may have been knocked out with an
injured hoof and Preakness winner Red Bullet may have been held out
by cautious connections, but Aptitude, established Wednesday as the
8-5 morning-line favorite, is very talented and should make it a
Belmont worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude, a son of 1992 Belmont winner and Horse of the Year
A.P. Indy, is royally bred for the 1 1/2-mile Test of the Champion.
In addition to his sire's accomplishments, his dam, Dokki, who is
by Northern Dancer, is related to both Coastal, who won the '79
Belmont, and Slew O'Gold, who ran second to Caveat in '83.
</P>
<P>
   Having captured only a maiden race, it may seem surprising that
Aptitude is so highly regarded. However, he stamped himself as
legitimate when he ran a strong second in the Kentucky Derby under
Alex Solis in only the sixth start of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Frankel, who trains Aptitude for Juddmonte Farms, then
held the dark bay out of the Preakness. He believes he'll turn a
tiger loose Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missing the Preakness gives him a big edge,'' said Frankel.
``My horse needed the break. He ran really hard in the Derby. I
knew before the race that if he didn't win the Derby, we'd wait for
the Belmont. All along, if you look at his pedigree, I thought my
best chance was to win the Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude, who is 1-3-1 in six races, made his first two starts
on the turf as a 2-year-old because he didn't train well. Aptitude
went well over the lawn, but did not win, running sixth (beaten by
just 2 lengths) and second. On Jan. 1, he started on the dirt, came
from seventh to tally, and was on his way. Prior to the Derby,
Frankel shipped him to Aqueduct, where he finished second in the
Gotham, behind Red Bullet, and third in the Wood Memorial, behind
Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was slow coming around,'' said Frankel. ``I didn't know he
was a Triple Crown horse untill we raced him on the dirt and he
began to improve. He never seems to get tired at the end. He's
always trying right to the finish. We stayed out of the Preakness
because we didn't want to train him back in two weeks with nothing
to gain. Why bury the horse to win two out of three? Now, if you
could win all three, that would be a different thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My horse is not a big, strong horse. He's a good doer, but I
didn't want to jeopardize his chance in the Belmont by running in
the Preakness. I'm sure there'll be an honest pace up front, but my
horse is not a plodder. He's got a quick turn of foot. If it's a
slow pace, he'll drop back. Otherwise, he'll be right up there.
We'll just let him run his race.''
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude worked 6 furlongs Sunday in 1:15 1/5 at Hollywood Park
with Solis aboard. Frankel reported he finished strong after a
leisurely start. The horse was shipped to Belmont Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, he'll win the Belmont,'' said Frankel. ``Then we'll
give him some time off and look toward the Haskell (Aug. 6 at
Monmouth) and the Travers (Aug. 26 at Saratoga). Then comes the
Breeders' Cup (at Churchill Downs Nov. 4).''
</P>
<P>
   Those are ambitious plans for a horse who has won just one race.
But don't be surprised if Aptitude fits the bill.

A CANDLE OF HEROISM IN FRANCE'S DARK NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ With France gradually and painfully reassessing its
record during Germany's wartime occupation, Resistance myths have
given way to deep discomfiture over the collaborationist Vichy
regime's role in sending 76,000 Jews to Nazi death camps. And yet
the very process of investigating a dark past has uncovered points
of light, stories that are not only morally uplifting but also help
to explain why at least 250,000 Jews survived World War II in
France.
</P>
<P>
   One such point of light was a chateau in the village of
Chabannes in the Creuse region of central France, where from 1939
to 1943 some 400 Jewish children found a safe haven. Their
protectors were local teachers and villagers as well as Communist
and Jewish activists, all working under the leadership of a portly
former journalist, Felix Chevrier, who in his own way believed he
was defending French honor.
</P>
<P>
   The moving story of this unlikely community has now been rescued
in a documentary, ``The Children of Chabannes,'' which is to open
on Friday at the Quad Cinema in Greenwich Village and will be shown
several times this month on the HBO Signature channel, beginning on
Sunday night at 7:30. As with many other newly revealed instances
of French valor in face of Nazi terror, it is principally those
saved who are doing the remembering. Chevrier himself died an
unsung hero in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Gossels, a New Yorker who produced, directed and edited
this film with Dean Wetherall, did not have to look far for the
story: her father, Peter, and her uncle, Werner, both born in
Berlin and sent to the presumed safety of France in July 1939, were
children of Chabannes until 1941, when, at ages 11 and 8 they were
sent by Quakers to the United States. Their mother died at
Auschwitz. ``My father does not consider himself a survivor because
he was not in a camp, but he survived the war thanks to the
French,'' Gossels said in a telephone interview from New York. ``It
is not something he talked about a lot. It was not part of our
daily existence. Yet in a sense the story gave a certain purpose to
my life. In the 1980s I even met two sisters, Reine and Renee
Paillassou, who had taught at Chabannes, and I thought they'd make
a wonderful film.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a planned reunion at Chabannes in May 1996, however, that
served as the catalyst for this documentary. ``The idea of honoring
these people who risked their lives for the children was central to
the project,'' Gossels said. ``I also thought that the occasion
would probably not happen again. At first I found people reticent
to speak. It was traumatic for many to go back into their memories.
But we came in with love and trust, and this opened things up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a story built around two points of view, two sets of
memories: those of the children, now in their 60s and 70s, people
like Gossels as well as Ruth Keller, Norbert Bikales and Jerry
Gerard, who also ended up in the United States; and those of
surviving protectors, now in their 80s and even 90s, among them the
Paillassou sisters, Georges Loinger (who later helped more than
1,000 Jewish children escape into Switzerland) and Rachel
Pludermacher, herself Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us never saw our parents again, and these educators
were our parents and they guided us to a better life,'' Bikales
said of his Chabannes companions, many of whom came from Poland and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the need to avoid too many talking heads, Gossels
said, she filmed the farms and hamlets around Chabannes as a way of
conveying the region's quiet isolation before the hunt for Jews
stepped up in the area in 1942. But her greatest stroke of fortune
was to discover a 170-page journal of essays, reflections,
photographs and drawings prepared by staff and children at the
chateau in 1942. It was among papers donated by Chevrier to the
Center for Contemporary Jewish Documentation in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The journal, which provided additional illustration for the
film, also had the effect of jogging memories. For instance,
Gossels was able to persuade the Paillassou sisters to read aloud
before a camera reflections they had written more than a
half-century earlier. Frederic Pottecher, a former journalist, read
from Chevrier's letters.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the children _ many already orphans in 1942 and
1943, though perhaps not yet aware of their parents' deaths _
remembered Chevrier as a jovial fatherly figure who ran something
resembling a summer camp. (Many photographs show happy children.)
Those who worked with him, however, spoke more of his courage and
determination to shield his wards.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrier's motivation seemed to be political. ``He wanted to
remain a true French republican,'' recalled Pottecher, who knew
Chevrier well, ``and republican meant a little bit on the left but
not too much. Not socialist, but a little. But in reality he was
very socialist. But you couldn't say that because it was political,
so he was republican. It was very French. It was in the great
French tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end Chevrier could not save all his children from
deportation. In August 1942, 12 children and 2 teachers were taken
away on a bus by French police. Chevrier eventually managed to
obtain the freedom of six children and two teachers, but six people
from the chateau were deported and, of these, only two, Wolfie
Blumenreich and Gerard, managed to survive slave labor in a
succession of camps.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment things grew steadily more difficult at
Chabannes. After Germany took over the so-called unoccupied zone
run by Vichy in November 1942, Chevrier began dispersing the
children, smuggling some into Spain and Switzerland and placing
others in homes. A few teen-agers joined the Resistance. Finally,
after a French gendarme tipped him off that the remaining children
were about to be seized, they were taken from the chateau and never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the children who had taken Chevrier for granted have
now come to understand everything he did for them,'' Gossels said.
``Chevrier is also to be honored as a righteous Gentile at the Yad
Vashem memorial in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   But France, too, has taken note. The primary school in Chabannes
now carries Chevrier's name and, after the prefet, or governor, of
the Creuse region saw the film, he nominated the Paillassou sisters
for the Legion of Honor. The ceremony is to take place in
September.

 &HT;    Cox to test TV e-mail, Net service in San Diego
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Cox Communications is making Southern
California its national testing ground for offering new toys to TV
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The company says in the fall it will begin a six-month trial
allowing 2,000 of its San Diego cable TV customers to get e-mail
and surf the Web on their TV sets.
</P>
<P>
   Cox officials say they expect to spread the service to other
markets next year. The company serves 6 million households
nationwide, mostly with cable TV service, though in several markets
it also offers phone service and Internet connections to computers.
</P>
<P>
   Internet TV isn't the only push Cox is making in San Diego. The
company is starting there for the national launch of its service
allowing residential TV viewers to rent and watch videos without
having to drive to their local Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   The service, called video-on-demand, will be rolled out to 2,000
cable customers in August. Cox will expand the offering to other
parts of San Diego and other markets next year, company spokeswoman
Amy Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Cable and telephone companies are scrambling to expand beyond
their traditional turfs, adding expensive upgrades to their systems
with the hope it will allow them to sell more services and make
more money.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, Charter Communications and Comcast Corp. _ all companies
with large cable holdings _ have or are planning to offer
interactive TV. Business Week magazine reported that America Online
is launching its own Internet TV service this month, using digital
set-top boxes that can work with TVs regardless of whether the
signal comes by cable, satellite or regular broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, dominant cable provider MediaOne plans to offer
video-on-demand later this year but has no plans for Internet TV.
</P>
<P>
   Charges for Cox's Internet TV service haven't been finalized,
but Cohn said it will be less than Cox's average $29.95 monthly
charge for regular Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Cox Communications is controlled by Cox Enterprises, which is
the owner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) - ``Fetch!'' Sheriff Joe Arpaio said,
earlier this week, and we did. We obey Arpaio's command to sit at
press conferences. We beg for quotes. Roll over. And, when the
sheriff finally rears back and tosses a craggy rod of information
out into the desert, we hurl ourselves after it, the whole pack of
us, gnawing on the stick and howling loud enough for everyone in
the whole nation to hear. By E.J. MONTINI. Story will move in the

AS TURKISH-GREEK RELATIONS WARM, THOUGHTS TURN TO   AEGEAN
DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ For decades the Aegean Sea has been not just
a vacation spot but also a zone of military confrontation. Now
Turkey is debating a step that could considerably reduce tension
there.
</P>
<P>
   A retired admiral who is an adviser to Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit has recommended that Turkey disband its 100,000-man Aegean
army. The army is deployed along the Aegean coast and confronts
Greek units based on islands that lie in some cases only a few
miles offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit has not commented on the four-page ``action plan''
presented by the adviser, Adm. Guven Erkaya. The general staff said
the question of dissolving the Aegean force was not on their
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the plan was written by such a high-ranking
figure, and that its contents were so prominently reported in the
Turkish press, has opened a national debate over this question for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The debate comes after nearly a year of steadily improving
relations between Greece and Turkey. Having now resolved many of
their minor disputes, they must now decide whether to move ahead to
the two big ones: Cyprus and the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
   With Cyprus perhaps the more complex problem, Turkish leaders
are apparently reflecting on how they can make progress in the
Aegean. There Greece and Turkey are locked in a tangle of
sovereignty disputes over sea lanes, air rights and barren islets.
A confrontation over one islet led the two countries to the brink
of war in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the course of the European Union accession process Turkey
must solve its problems with Greece by 2004,'' Erkaya wrote,
referring to the application for membership in the union. ``By
doing away with the Aegean army, Turkey can take the first step
and, in return, put the Aegean airspace and Aegean islands disputes
on the negotiating table.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aegean army was deployed in 1975 amid the tension that
followed the landing of Turkish troops on Cyprus. Its first two
commanders became Turkish presidents, the second, Gen. Kenan Evren,
after leading a military coup in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Some want the force to remain in place. Defense Minister
Sabahattin Cakmakoglu, a member of the far-right Nationalist Action
Party, said it was ``too early to consider suggestions that the
Aegean army be disbanded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot decide there is no longer a threat simply by looking
at some short-term solutions or signs of friendship,'' Cakmakoglu
told a television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several months, private groups of Greeks and Turks
have been meeting to discuss the problems that separate their
countries. Erkaya has been in several of those meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``As both parties get to know each other and believe in each
other's sincerity, an atmosphere of confidence is born,'' wrote
Mehmet Ali Birand, a newspaper and television commentator who has
also taken part. ``That someone such as Erkaya, whose life has been
dominated by Turkish-Greek and Aegean problems, who has been
burdened with great responsibilities and known for being a
conservative with rigid attitudes, has made such a proposal has
impressed a lot of people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Both Greece and Turkey are members of NATO, and for years their
rivalry was one of the alliance's gravest internal weaknesses. But
they began to cooperate after earthquakes in both countries last
year, which led to outpourings of compassion and mutual support.
Relations between them are now warmer than at any time since before
the 1974 landing in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   This week, for the first time in more than a generation, Turkish
soldiers took part in maneuvers on Greek soil. More than 150
Turkish commandos staged a mock landing on a Greek beach, and 10
Turkish warplanes flew over Greek territory.

&HT;     BUSH SAYS HE HAS NARROWED LIST FOR RUNNING MATE  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Republican George W. Bush said Wednesday he is
narrowing his list of prospective vice presidential running mates
on the GOP ticket, with an eye on candidates who would be loyal and
capable of serving as president.
</P>
<P>
   The presumptive Republican presidential nominee told editors and
executives of the Hearst Newspapers that he expects to reach a
decision in coming weeks but will most likely delay his
announcement until closer to the Republican convention in
Philadelphia that begins on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   Bush interrupted his 75-minute interview with the Hearst editors
in a reception room at the governor's mansion to take a telephone
call from Dick Cheney, the former defense secretary and one-time
White House chief of staff, who is screening prospective running
mates for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who said he speaks with Cheney roughly every four days,
said the call focused on ``a particular person that he has talked
to that has indicated an interest that they would like to be
considered.'' Bush declined to name the prospective running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind yet,'' the two-term Texas governor
said. ``The list is a little fluid these days. ... It just means
people are being added and sometimes dropping off at their own
whim, their own desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush reiterated that both Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and retired
Gen. Colin Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, have insisted repeatedly that they not be considered as
possible running mates. ``Those are two good men who unfortunately
aren't on the list of the vice presidential selection process,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said it would be up to Cheney to vet the candidates to make
sure that there were no embarrassing or politically damaging
episodes in their background. Bush said he would meet with the
candidates privately without an unseemly ``parade of stars'' in
which prospective candidates would traipse to Austin for personal
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was looking for ``somebody I can trust,
obviously,'' as well as someone who would be capable of serving as
president, if circumstances required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in a vice president with whom I can seek
counsel and know that the counsel I seek won't be on the front page
of the Hearst newspapers the next day,'' Bush said. ``There's a
certain sense of loyalty that's necessary to make an administration
work. There are a lot of political factors that go into it. But the
two biggest factors are who can be president and will the person be
loyal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, in response to a question, said that he had narrowed his
list of prospects ``some _ a little bit.'' He did not elaborate.
``Not everybody wants to be considered for vice president. It may
come as a complete shock to you but it's very simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had a short list, Bush replied: ``It's getting
shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   Various political figures have been mentioned as possible
running mates, including Govs. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania; Christine
Todd Whitman of New Jersey; George Pataki of New York; Rep. John
Kasich, R-Ohio; Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., and Sen. Fred Thompson,
R-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said initially he had more than a dozen candidates on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   The governor touched upon a variety of issues during the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Republican National Committee will hit the
nation's airwaves in coming weeks with campaign ads financed with
so-called soft money to respond to the Democrats' $25 million blitz
in 15 states scheduled to begin Thursday. Bush said he expected the
first ad to focus on his plans to bolster the finances of the
Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Al Gore would love me to be the (campaign finance)
reformer in the middle of the campaign and give him an advantage''
by not responding to the Democrats' ad blitz, Bush said, adding:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be outspent.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he couldn't say whether Gore was a ``good man'' or not
because he doesn't know him well enough to form an opinion. In the
heat of the Republican primary campaign earlier this year, Bush
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., his main opponent, was ``a good
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that if elected president he will not breach
hydro-electrical power dams in the Northwest to spare salmon.
``This administration wants to breach those dams to save salmon,''
Bush said. ``I don't want to breach the dams and if I'm president
the dams won't be breached.''
</P>
<P>
   He underscored his continued support for the death penalty
despite granting a 30-day stay of execution last week for a
condemned murderer so that DNA evidence can be reviewed. Bush said
the final decision on whether the execution takes place will be up
to the state's board of pardons and parole that he has named. ``I
support the death penalty because I believe it prevents people from
killing people. I know that's open for contention and argument.''
Bush said, however, that he has asked state officials to look into
revising Texas laws if necessary to make sure that the state uses
DNA evidence to determine guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state probably needs to change some laws to that effect
and I'm having people look at it to make sure that (DNA) is used,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, who has presided over the executions of 131
condemned prisoners since taking office in 1995, said he believes
that ``everybody put to death has been guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush declined comment on the federal judge's decision Wednesday
in Washington, D.C., to break up Microsoft to end monopolistic
practices prosecuted by the Justice Department. Bush said that he
favors ``innovation as opposed to litigation'' but he declined
substantive comment. ``On this issue or any other issue (people)
should not hope that a Bush administration is going to behave one
way or another,'' he said. ``I hear all the time, `We'll just hold
out and wait for the Bush administration to come. People need to
make their decisions based upon right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush announced that he plans no foreign travel before the
November election. Karl Rove, Bush's political strategist, said
that it would take too many days off the campaign trail for Bush to
prepare for and carry out a hopscotch foray to foreign capitals.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following
entertainment/arts articles this week for release Sunday, June 11,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BECKETT-FILM (Dublin) _ An Irish theater director, Michael
Colgan, has set out to have all 19 of Samuel Beckett's stage plays
filmed. One of the first, ``Not I,'' was screened last month in
Cannes with Julienne Moore performing the 13-minute ``speaking
mouth.'' Among the other completed films is ``Catastrophe,'' in
which David Mamet directs Harold Pinter, Rebecca Pidgeon and John
Gielgud in his last performance before his death last month. With
actors accepting nominal fees, the Beckett Film Project will be
completed for about $6 million. By Alan Riding.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-PROUST (Paris) _ Directors making a film of Marcel Proust's
3,000-page ``Remembrance of Things Past'' have to contend with the
long sentences, the long time spans and the long periods of
contemplation. Leslie Cahli interviews Raul Ruiz, the Chilean
director, to find out he made ``Time Regained,'' one of the
volumes, into a marketable two-hour film. It opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   MACLEAN-JESUSSON-FILM (New York) _ ``Jesus' Son'' has proven to
be a god-send to director Alison Maclean. The film about alienation
and heroin use in the American heartland in the '70s has her behind
the camera for the first time in eight years, it has transcended
its $2.5 million budget and won excellent reviews. Lions Gate will
open the film on Friday. By Howard Feinstein.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   MONTY-MUSICAL (San Diego) _ The setting of the new musical ``The
Full Monty'' is no longer Sheffield, England, but Buffalo, N.Y. Yet
with the exception of a few new characters, songs and dances, the
theater version of the 1997 film adheres to the funny path of those
desperate men who find friendship and strength by taking off their
clothes to earn money. ``The Full Monty'' is one of several
musicals percolating in California in theaters from Los Angeles to
San Diego. Bernard Weinraub visits several of the new shows.
</P>
<P>
   ANTAEUS-MILLER-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ Formed in 1991 as a
research and study group for classically trained actors who had
strayed from the stage into film and television, Antaeus falls
somewhere in between the prosperous regional theaters and the
struggling theatrical groups. Though Antaeus has mounted only a few
plays, it has a loyal following, which explains why its production
of Arthur Miller's ``The Man Who Had no Luck at All,'' has been
extended twice. The nearly forgotten play flopped on Broadway in
1944, but here it earned the kind of reviews most Los Angeles
theaters only dream about. By David Mermelstein. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ECKERT-WHALES-THEATER (New York) _ ``And God Created Great
Whales,'' which makes its premiere Sunday night at Dance Theater
Workshop's Bessie Schonberg Theater, is loosely based on ``Moby
Dick.'' How loosely? It stars Rinde Eckert as Nathan, a piano tuner
suffering from a degenerative disease and struggling to complete an
opera based on ``Moby-Dick'' before his memory fails. For Nathan,
the white whale is represented at various times by the piano, by
the blank page and by memory itself. In the 80-minute music-theater
piece, Eckert sings, speaks and plays the piano and ukulele before
his mind goes down and he disappears into his opera never to be
seen again. By Don Shewey.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-RUMBA (Havana) _ Jon Pareles attended Cubadisco, the Cuban
equivalent of the Grammy awards, and found it devoted to the rumba.
Not the south-of-the-border pop ``rhumba'' of Fred Astaire, or the
brassy big-band rumba of Tito Puente. It was the Cuban rumba that
has been traced back to Africa. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-ROREM (New York) _ For two decades Ned Rorem, the
composer, grimly asserted that the art song was languishing,
especially the American art song. But last month, Rorem admitted
that he had been wrong. While he was predicting the art song's
demise, he said, a generation of song composers emerged right under
his nose. Anthony Tommasini interviews some of the best practioners
of this form.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-ARTISTS (Santiago de Cuba, Cuba) _ In spite of severe
shortages of basic materials like paint, brushes, canvas and paper,
Cuban artists are producing work. Annette Grant profiles five
artists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   POLYNESIAN-ART (New York) _ Curators, collectors and dealers of
tribal art converged last month on Sotheby's in New York to view,
gossip about and bid small fortunes for two 19th-century Polynesian
rarities: a feather cape and a curious Austral Islands necklace of
whalebone, ivory and human hair. Their obscure histories, traced
last to the little known Niagara Falls Museum, and freshly restored
condition made them hot topics. The objects brought record prices
for Polynesian art: $335,750 for the cape and $313,750 for the
necklace. By Rita Reif.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CUBA-ARTISTS-FUND (Havana) _ On Tuesday, the Cuban Artists Fund
will hold its second benefit, ``New York for Cuban Artists,'' in
New York. The fund supports Cuban artists in all mediums, but this
article concentrates on a dance triumph. This October, at the
International Havana Festival of Ballet, the hottest ticket will
most likely be ``Ballo Della Regina,'' which George Balanchine made
for the ballerina Merrill Ashley. In March, Ashley traveled to Cuba
to teach ``Ballo'' to the Ballet Nacional de Cuba, in the fund's
first major collaboration with a Cuban arts organization.
</P>
<P>
   HALPERIN-DANCE (San Francisco) _ For an artist so influential,
Anna Halprin &UR; 10 &LR;  is barely known outside her worlds, of dance and
ritual healing. Yet those who do know her are drawn to her, as
proven by the large audience at her ``80th Year Retrospective''
last weekend. By John Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-MOVIES (Paris) _ European television networks are the major
players in financing feature films for theatrical release.
According to a study by the European Audiovisual Observatory in
France, television investment accounts for between 30 and 74
percent of the financing for the production of feature films in
Europe, depending upon the country. Much of that revenue is
generated by public funds derived from taxes on television
companies and by pre-sale agreements. By Kristin Hohenadel.

   The Travel Section for Sunday, June 11, chronicles traveling
Spain in Low Gear.

<P>
   (Moved in the ``t'' category.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-ASTURIAS-SPAIN (Undated) _ Suddenly the major highway
ended and that was the signal that the pace changed in Asturias, a
green and damp area where there were no great resorts, no
architectural works by Gaudi, no wineries or great restaurants or
well-known museums, writes Amanda Hesser. A 10-minute drive north
and the land dropped off into the ocean. A 10-minute drive south
and the Picos de Europa, a mountain range, explodes from the earth
like an iceberg on a calm sea. We could swim or go hiking or just
take long drives down the narrow passages carved through the
mountains. We did all three.
</P>
<P>
   .................... TRAVEL-CUBA (Undated) _ In Cuba, Kirk
Kraeutler observes firsthand ``artful adaption'' to ``tourist
apartheid,'' a term that describes places for foreign tourists with
dollars, and places for Cubans and pesos. Off the beaten path,
where he often found more potholes than pavement, he observes the
myriad ways Cubans survive in their hybrid economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PRACTICAL-TRAVELER (New York) _ Betsy Wade offers a guide to
some bus and boat tours of Manhattan. These include: Harlem
Spirituals, which visits the gospel music scene in Harlem; the
Semicircle Tour, a shorter version of the around-Manhattan tour on
the Circle Line; the Queens Jazz Trail; the Hasidic Discovery Tour
in Brooklyn; and a literary tour of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-PETS-AIRLINES (Undated) _ Several major airlines
announced rules last month restricting pets traveling as
passengers' checked luggage in the baggage compartments of planes,
at least during the summer. Industry sources say that airlines will
soon require that pets going by air be handled by commercial
shippers, a move that could increase the cost substantially. Betsy
Wade reports on this trend and the services that ship animals in
climate-controlled comfort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-HOTEL-SHOPPING (Undated) _ For years, hotels have sold
small items like bathrobes and towels to guests who wanted to take
home more than memories. Such sales were largely defensive to
discourage theft, but increasingly it's a matter of marketing.
Bedside price list's include robes, towels, alarm clocks,
wastebaskets and even the bed. By Terry Trucco.
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Two sleek hotels for New Orleans; a
bus link to Yosemite; a Web site on airport conditions and the
reinvention of the summer house in England.  &QL;

<P>
   Microsoft is more than a company that dominates a rapidly
growing industry. To investors it has been a stock whose owners
believed in it with almost religious conviction. Its declines were
usually mild and always brief.
</P>
<P>
   But that faith has been shaken in the last couple of months, and
now investors face the question of how well Microsoft can perform
after its conduct has been ruled to be illegal and a breakup of the
company ordered.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as investors awaited Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's
decision, Microsoft's stock rose 87.5 cents, to $70.25. In
after-hours trading, as the actual court document was digested, the
shares traded as high as $73, ending at $71.875.
</P>
<P>
   That gain, which may reflect some hope that the judge's strident
tone would make a reversal more likely, still left the stock far
below its peak of $119.9375 in December. Microsoft lost almost half
its value as it sank to $60.375 late last month. ``Investors think
the ruling will be materially changed'' on appeal, commented
Richard G. Sherlund, a Goldman, Sachs analyst.
</P>
<P>
   If the breakup begins to appear likely, investor opinions of the
future of the two Microsoft companies _ known informally as Opsco,
for operating system company, and Appsco, for the company that is
to produce applications ranging from Microsoft Word to Internet
Explorer _ will come to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   There is some worry that even though the operating company would
retain an effective monopoly it would be so hamstrung by government
oversight that its profit margins would inevitably erode. And there
is concern that the applications company would be a less formidable
competitor when deprived of its close relationship with the company
that designs the operating system and thereby sets the rules for
competition for other software companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over the longer term, the real issue may be whether investors
lose their faith in Microsoft as a money machine whose rapid growth
will end up justifying the purchase of its stock at any price. For
years, Wall Street analysts routinely ignored cautions from
Microsoft's management about the company's valuation, and were
vindicated as the price continued to rise.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the 1990s, as Microsoft's profits and share price
grew rapidly, one measure of investor confidence did not soar. The
price-earnings ratio stayed in the 20s and 30s. Those were
good-sized numbers, reflecting anticipations of substantial growth,
but they were modest compared with what was to come. The
price-earnings ratio topped 40 in 1996, and by the end of last year
it was up to 78. That figure may be overstated a bit, given that
Microsoft's accounting is extremely conservative, but even after
discounting for that, the price clearly assumed many years of rapid
profit growth.
</P>
<P>
   Such growth is not easy for any company to produce, but it is
even harder for one already as large as Microsoft. That the company
could sell at such a high valuation in part reflected a general
expansion of multiples in the bull market, but it also reflected
investors' convictions that Microsoft had become a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's aura of invincibility held even after the Justice
Department set its sights on the company. Microsoft stock fell
almost 4 percent on the day Justice filed suit against the company
in 1998, but within two months it had not only recovered that loss
but was up 30 percent more.
</P>
<P>
   As the trial progressed, there was plenty of bad news for
Microsoft. But the stock price seldom fell for more than a few
days, and at the peak in December it was four times as high as it
had been in late 1997, shortly after Jackson ruled against
Microsoft in an earlier antitrust case _ a ruling that was
overturned on appeal. Even now, the stock is 58 percent above where
it was when the latest suit was filed in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The fall of Microsoft's stock price began in late March, just as
many Internet stocks were beginning to crumble. It is impossible to
calculate how much of the Microsoft plunge since then has
represented specific fears about the ruling, and how much has been
a reassessment of the extraordinary growth that the market had
previously seemed to accept for virtually all technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's stock price of $70.50 before the ruling was
released, Microsoft was trading at 42 times the profits it reported
over the last 12 months. That was a higher multiple than it enjoyed
through the first half of the 1990s, hardly a time of investor
pessimism regarding the company.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, in other words, still expects great things
from Microsoft, even if the expectations are not as high as they
were late last year. There is room for severe disappointment if
Microsoft loses on appeal _ or if it simply cannot keep growing at
the extraordinary high rates of the past.

DO OR DIE FOR STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ It's simple, really.
</P>
<P>
   For both the New Jersey Devils and Dallas Stars, Thursday's Game
5 comes down to a basic, albeit cliched, premise. If the Devils
win, they capture the Stanley Cup for the second time in six years,
while the defending champion Stars have no choice but victory.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, and not just because of the obvious, the
Devils have the advantage across the board. Goaltender Martin
Brodeur has been far superior to erratic Stars netminder Ed
Belfour. The Devils' unsung heroes (read: rookies Brian Rafalski
and John Madden) have come through. The Stars' have not. The
Devils' best players all year have been their best players in this
series. The Stars' have not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the difference is that we've gotten impatient and
frustrated in our inability to score,'' said Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock. ``(The Mike Modano-Jere Lehtinen-Brett Hull line) has so
much responsibility on their shoulders because we haven't had that
undercurrent of scoring. When it doesn't come early, do you get
impatient and stretch your offense? In other words, try to find
holes that aren't there or do you stay with it? I've seen in the
last two games where they've stretched it out too early to create
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull is the playoff scoring leader with 23 points in 21 games
and also is tops in goals with 11, but Hitchcock said his sniper
doesn't have to score for the Stars to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need from Brett and some other guys is to stay on the
page for 60 minutes,'' he said, ``not try and hit the home run. Be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils said they learned a lesson from their last series _
when they were down, 3-1, to the Flyers before rallying to win the
Eastern Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Flyers) thought they had things wrapped up and thought
they were in the driver's seat,'' said Devils forward Claude
Lemieux, who is playing in the finals for the fifth time and
gunning for his fourth Cup. ``We surprised them with one game and
then two. The next thing you know, it's Game 7. I think we've
taught ourselves a good lesson, not to go into (tonight) thinking
these guys are going to quit. They will probably be playing their
hardest and best game. I feel if we match that, then we will come
out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made about the Devils' tremendous corps of
rookies, led by Calder Trophy candidate Scott Gomez. Would they be
able to handle the pressure? Would they be able to mentally make it
through the grind of the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   For Gomez, the test is channeling his excitement at the prospect
of winning a Cup in his first season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason Arnott and I room together, so we've talked about it,''
said Gomez, who admitted he's had trouble sleeping. ``It's easy to
say just let it go but . . . you're constantly thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Madden was asked how tough it is to stay focused at a time
like this, he said, ``Virtually impossible, to be honest with you.
You think about it and obviously you get questions. What will you
do with the Cup? It's impossible not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the veterans come in. They've been here before and
are not shy about imparting their wisdom on the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a game that is just so different from playing real
hockey because there is so much at stake,'' said Brodeur, who
backboned the Cup-winning Devils in 1995. ``It's big, big, what we
are going through right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is likely only to get bigger.

ELI LILLY SUED BY FAMILY OF PROZAC USER WHO KILLED WIFE, HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Opening a new front in the battle over Prozac and suicide, the
family of a man who killed his wife then himself while taking the
drug are accusing Eli Lilly and Co. of fraud for allegedly
concealing damaging details about its blockbuster antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal lawsuit filed in Hawaii, the family of William
Forsyth claims that Lilly ``committed a fraud on the court'' by
failing to tell the family's lawyers about a patent that claims a
new version of the drug eliminates side effects of the existing
Prozac, including violent and suicidal thoughts among a small
percentage of users.
</P>
<P>
   Despite consistently denying any link between Prozac and
suicide, Lilly has purchased an exclusive license to market the new
drug from a Massachusetts company that owns the patent.
</P>
<P>
   The suit says Lilly actively concealed the potentially explosive
patent language during a trial last year over Prozac's alleged role
in the couple's deaths. The trial ended with a verdict in Lilly's
favor; the family has appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lilly wanted a verdict that it could herald in the marketplace
as being the definitive vindication of their claims, and they were
willing to get it by withholding important information from the
judge and jury,'' said Houston lawyer Andy Vickery, who represents
the dead couple's adult children.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery said he decided to file the lawsuit after reading a May
7 report in The Boston Globe in which the patent language for the
new drug was publicly disclosed for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lilly declined comment on the suit Wednesday,
saying the company had not seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, the lawsuit seems certain to fuel a
revival of a longstanding dispute over the Indianapolis drug
company's efforts to blunt criticism of the popular antidepressant,
a green-and-white capsule that has earned the company billions of
dollars and become a totem of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the new patent can be compared to the tobacco papers.
It's a pharmaceutical company document that acknowledges this
dangerous side effect which has been downplayed by Eli Lilly and
other pharmaceutical companies for a decade,'' said Dr. Joseph
Glenmullen, a Cambridge, Mass. psychiatrist whose new book,
``Prozac Backlash,'' has helped to trigger the renewed controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly has built its defense of Prozac on a 1991 finding by the
US Food and Drug Administration that there is no credible evidence
linking Prozac to suicide. Glenmullen and others have challenged
that finding, alleging it was based on flawed clinical testing and
marred by conflicts of interest among several members of the FDA's
panel of outside experts.
</P>
<P>
   Though sales have slipped somewhat in recent years as other
antidepressants entered the market, more than 35 million people
worldwide have taken Prozac. Lilly derived more than 25 percent of
its $10 billion in revenues last year from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in Honolulu,
also focuses attention on the new drug, which Lilly hopes will
extend its antidepressant franchise after the last Prozac patents
expire in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   The key patent for the new drug was obtained in 1998 by two
officials at Sepracor Inc., a Marlborough, Mass. drug company,
along with Dr. Martin H. Teicher, an associate professor of
psychiatry at Harvard University who works at McLean Hospital in
Belmont, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The patent brought Teicher full circle in the Prozac debate: He
had ignited the decade-long controversy over suicidality with a
1990 paper about sudden, self-destructive tendencies among patients
who had recently begun taking Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   The patent describes an antidepressant derived from Prozac that,
the inventors claim, is formulated in such a way as to decrease the
current drug's adverse effects, ranging from headaches and
nervousness to ``intense violent suicidal thoughts and
self-mutiliation.'' That claim is based on Teicher's paper.
</P>
<P>
   Although that patent language directly contradicts Lilly's
longtime position on Prozac, the Indianapolis-based drug company
clearly saw great value in the drug described in the patent.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, Lilly paid Sepracor $20 million for exclusive
rights to the patent, a portion of which went to Teicher and
McLean. Lilly also promised the inventors $70 million in milestone
payments depending on the new drug's progress through ongoing
clinical trials, and a percentage of sales if the drug is
ultimately approved and sold.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after that deal was struck, in March 1999, a
federal jury in Honolulu began hearing a civil lawsuit Vickery
filed on behalf of the two adult children of the late William and
June Forsyth.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy couple, married for 37 years, the Forsyths had been
going through a rough patch in their marriage in late 1992 and
early 1993. William Forsyth, 63, began suffering panic attacks, and
in February 1993 his doctor prescribed Prozac. After feeling
wonderful the first day, Forsyth underwent a change for the worse
and admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital. After a week, while
continuing to take Prozac, he checked himself out.
</P>
<P>
   On March 3, 1993, 11 days after he began taking Prozac, Forsyth
fatally stabbed his wife multiple times with a serrated kitchen
knife then impaled himself on the blade. Their children blamed the
drug for what they said were their father's completely
uncharacteristic acts.
</P>
<P>
   Of some 200 lawsuits filed against Lilly claiming the use of
Prozac led to suicide or violence, the Forsyth case was only the
second to yield a verdict. Lilly settled many of the others, and
the only other one to reach a jury, in 1994, was widely reported to
have been a victory for the company. In fact, it was settled in a
secret agreement between Lilly and the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lilly obtained its long-sought courtroom victory in the Forsyth
case when the jury said the drug could not be held responsible for
the murder-suicide. In the suit filed Wednesday, however, the
Forsyths' children claim the victory for Lilly was tainted by the
failure to disclose its link to the new Prozac patent and should be
set aside for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of Lilly's defense was its claim that if Forsyth
suffered from the severe form of agitation his children claim led
to the deaths, he would have experienced inner and outer
restlessness. No one at the psychiatric hospital noticed
restlessness in Forsyth before his release, and Lilly's lawyers and
expert witnesses used that to refute his children's case.
</P>
<P>
   In the patent, however, the side-effect is described purely as
inner restlessless, a condition known as akathisia. Vickery said
that difference is crucial because, if the patent had been
disclosed at the trial, it would have been a powerful answer to
Lilly's argument that outer restlessness _ characterized by
relentless fidgeting _ was required as evidence of the side-effect.
It also might have challenged Lilly's overall claims about suicide,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a top Lilly scientist, Dr. Gary Tollefson,
testified during the trial that it was his opinion ``that there is
absolutely no medically sound evidence of an association between
any antidepressant medicine, including Prozac, and the induction of
suicidal ideation (thoughts) or violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The new patent language, and Lilly's purchase of exclusive
rights to the invention, might have convinced the jury otherwise,
Vickery said.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery is basing the suit partly on a 1995 ruling by the US
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which includes Hawaii. That
case, Pumphrey v. K.W. Thompson Tool Co. of New Hampshire, involved
the death of a man who dropped a handgun manufactured by Thompson.
The gun fired, sending a bullet through his heart.
</P>
<P>
   The court found that Thompson committed a fraud upon the court
by failing to disclose that it had produced a video that showed the
same type of gun fired accidentally when dropped. The court said
the existence of the video should have been revealed by a Thompson
lawyer who knew about it and attended the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Vickery contends that Lilly acted similarly to Thompson because
a patent lawyer for the drugmaker attended the Forsyth trial but
never disclosed the language on suicide in the patent that Lilly
licensed from Sepracor.

<P>
   With Montana Gov. Marc Racicot barred by law from seeking a
third consecutive term, his lieutenant governor, Judy Martz, and
state Auditor Mark O'Keefe had little trouble winning their
gubernatorial primaries on Tuesday to face each other in the
November general election.
</P>
<P>
   Martz, a Republican who has served with Racicot since 1996, had
57 percent of the vote to 43 percent for Rob Natelson, a law
professor who fared better this time than four years ago, when he
won only 24 percent in a primary challenge to Racicot. In the
Democratic primary, O'Keefe won 48 percent of the vote to defeat
two other high-ranking state officials, Attorney General Joe
Mazurek, with 36 percent, and Secretary of State Mike Cooney, with
16 percent. The voting reflected totals from all but two of
Montana's 867 voting precincts.
</P>
<P>
   Montana was also one of several states that held congressional
primaries on Tuesday. In winning the Democratic U.S. Senate
primary, Brian Schweitzer, a farmer who made the high cost of
prescription drugs a campaign focus, easily defeated John Driscoll,
a former state public service commissioner who entered the campaign
late. Schweitzer, who won 66 percent of the vote to 34 percent for
Driscoll, will face the two-term Republican incumbent, Sen. Conrad
Burns, who had no primary opponent.
</P>
<P>
   While their approaches are certain to be different, Martz and
O'Keefe both said they would make statewide economic development a
high priority. Montana currently ranks lowest among the states in
average wages, 47th in per capita income and, as O'Keefe contended,
first in the number of families in which the chief wage earner
holds at least two jobs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe said those rankings reflect how poorly the Racicot
administration had performed, but Martz said the situation was far
worse when Racicot took office in 1993, when the state was $200
million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We re-did workmen's compensation, we reformed welfare, and
after the last legislative session, we enacted $116 million in tax
cuts,'' she said in an interview Wednesday, boasting of
administration successes.
</P>
<P>
   But they do not obscure the obvious, O'Keefe said, adding,
``We're having our first debate on Friday. One of things I'm sure
we'll talk about is the lieutenant governor's administration.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Democrats held primaries in all three
congressional districts and one produced a close finish. Seeking to
oppose Rep. Joe Skeen, a 10-term Republican from the 2nd District,
state Treasurer Michael Montoya narrowly defeated Mike Runnels, a
district attorney, despite a recent investigation by New Mexico
State Police into accusations that Montoya's brother, Orlando
Montoya, diverted money from his construction business into the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Montoya won 52 percent of the vote to 48 percent for
Runnels, a margin that Montoya said might have been helped by a
sympathetic backlash against the police investigation, which, so
far, has produced no charges.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1st District primary, former U.S. Attorney John J. Kelly
won 43 percent of the vote in a three-way race to face Rep. Heather
A. Wilson, a first-term Republican who is viewed by Democrats as
one of the most vulnerable members of the House majority. Kelly
defeated Sam Bregman, a former Albuquerque city councilman, who won
33 percent of the vote, and John V. Wertheim, the party's nominee
four years ago, who had 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Skeen and Wilson ran unopposed, but not so New Mexico's
other incumbent, Rep. Thomas Udall, a freshman Democrat who soundly
defeated Francesca Lobato, a tax lawyer from Santa Fe, with 83
percent of the balloting. Udall will face Lisa Lutz, a state
lawmaker, who ran unopposed to win the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican U.S. Senate primary, Bill Redmond, a former
congressman, breezed in a three-way race, with 60 percent of the
vote, to oppose Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat seeking his fourth term.
Two state lawmakers trailed, Steve Pearce with 22 percent and
William F. Davis, 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In South Dakota, Curt Hohn, general manager of the state's Water
Development Association, beat two other Democrats to oppose Rep.
John Thune, a two-term Republican who was expected to win in
November no matter who prevailed among the Democrats. With the
turnout extremely light, Hohn won 56 percent of the vote to 36
percent for Steve Sandven, a lawyer, and 7 percent for Raymond
Osloond, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Each party had two primaries in Iowa. In the 1st District,
Democrats elected Bob Simpson over Gregory Guy, by a margin of
almost 2-to-1, although Simpson is given only a slim chance against
Rep. Jim Leach, the 12-term Republican incumbent. In the 3rd, Jay
Marcus narrowly defeated Phil Ferren to oppose Iowa's only
Democratic House member, Leonard Boswell, who is seeking a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties held primaries in the 5th District. Mike Palecek
defeated Conrad Lawlor for the Democratic nomination, and Rep. Tom
Latham, who is seeking a fourth term, easily turned back Thomas
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the lone Alabama contest, Rep. Earl Hilliard, a four-term
Democrat from a solidly Democratic district, the 7th, won 58
percent of the vote to defeat two challengers, Arthur Davis and
Wayne Sowell. Ed Martin won the 7th District Republican nomination,
defeating Milton Bethune in a primary than drew less than a tenth
of the voters who cast ballots for Democrats.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: What's the status of El Toro Marine Corps Aviation Station in
California, where I served in 1947? Is it true, as I've heard, that
it has closed?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. It was one of several Navy and Marine air facilities in
California, Virginia and Florida shut down as part of a
restructuring due to federal budget cuts. The Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission announced the closure in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a move has been under way to concert El Toro into
a civilian airport. But that has generated considerable opposition
because Orange County already has a civilian airport (John Wayne).
</P>
<P>
   In late March, attorneys for Orange County said they would ask a
Los Angeles County Superior Court judge to freeze voter-approved
limits on spending for the proposed El Toro airport until the
validity of a March 7 county ballot measure was decided.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Charlton Heston ever serve in the military?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Current Biography Yearbook (1986) reports that after
Heston had completed two years at Northwestern University, he left
school to enlist in the 11th Army Air Forces. He spent most of his
three-year tour stationed in Alaska's Aleutian Islands. The
yearbook says he was a radio gunner on B-52s, but that doesn't seem
possible since B-52s didn't go into production until 1954. The
movie star and president of the National Rifle Association was
discharged in early 1947.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An item about unassisted triple plays mentioned that of the
11 in Major League history, two were carried out by a first
baseman. Can you explain the circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both of those unassisted triple plays were similar. The first
occurred on Sept. 14, 1923, in a game between the Boston Red Sox
and Cleveland Indians, when Red Sox first baseman George Burns
caught a line drive hit by first baseman Frank Brower. Burns tagged
out Rube Lutzke and ran to second base for the third out before
Riggs Stephenson could get back.
</P>
<P>
   The second was on May 31, 1927, in a game between the Detroit
Tigers and Cleveland Indians, when Tigers first baseman Johnny Neun
nabbed right fielder Homer Summa's line drive and tagged Charlie
Jamieson off first. Then, ignoring his shortstop's shouts to throw
the ball, he dashed toward second base and tagged the bag before
Glenn Myatt could get back. Neun's play happened in the ninth
inning to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   As dramatic as that game-ender was, a more-famous unassisted
triple play occurred during a World Series. In the fifth game of
the 1920 Series, Cleveland Indians second baseman Bill Wambsganss
caught a line drive hit by the Brooklyn Dodgers' Clarence Mitchell,
touched second to retire Pete Kilduff, then tagged Otto Miller
running from first base.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was told that Nelson Mandela gave the commencement address
at Blair Academy in New Jersey. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although Mandela was invited to speak, he didn't do so, said
Chandler Hardwick, Blair's headmaster. Mandela's grandson, Zinhle
Dlamini, received his diploma at Blair on May 27, so it would have
been appropriate for Mandela to deliver the commencement address,
Hardwick explained. A death in the family, however, prevented the
visit of both Mandela and Zinhle Dlamini's grandmother, Winnie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The newspaper printed an excerpt of the poem ``For the
Fallen,'' inscribed on the Vietnam War Monument at the Atlanta
History Center. I've also seen it at Virginia Military Institute.
Can you print the full text?
</P>
<P>
   A: Laurence Binyon's ``For the Fallen'' (Sept. 21, 1914):
</P>
<P>
   With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children,/ England
mourns for her dead across the sea./ Flesh of her flesh they were,
spirit of her spirit,/ Fallen in the cause of the free.
</P>
<P>
   Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royal/ Sings sorrow up
into immortal spheres./ There is a music in the midst of
desolation/ And a glory that shines upon our tears.
</P>
<P>
   They went with songs to the battle, they were young,/ Straight
of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow./ They were staunch to the
end against odds uncountered:/ They fell with their faces to the
foe.
</P>
<P>
   They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old:/ Age
shall not weary them, nor the years condemn./ At the going down of
the sun and in the morning/ We will remember them.
</P>
<P>
   They mingle not with their laughing comrades again;/ They sit no
more at familiar tables at home;/ They have no lot in our labour of
the day-time;/ They sleep beyond England's foam.
</P>
<P>
   But where our desires are and our hopes profound,/ Felt as a
well-spring that is hidden from sight,/ To the innermost heart of
their own land they are known/ As the stars are known to the Night;
</P>
<P>
   As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,/ Moving in
marches upon the heavenly plain;/ As the stars are starry in the
time of our darkness,/ To the end, to the end they remain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: On my newest maps of Canada, I see an area labeled Nunavut.
Is this a new province?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. It's a new territory, split off from Northwest
Territories as of April 1, 1999. The name means ``our land'' in
Inuktitut, the language of Inuit. The designated capital is
Iqaluit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About 10 years ago, a cable channel called The Tuxxedo
Network was shut down after a district attorney in Mississippi
filed criminal charges against the owners for transmitting X-rated
movies into the state by satellite. Whatever happened with that
case?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was Alabama, not Mississippi. The company, Home Dish Only
Satellite Network, operated American Exxxstasy Channel and Tuxxedo
Channel. The New York company pleaded guilty in 1990 to obscenity
charges in Alabama state court, becoming the nation's first
satellite TV company to be indicted outside its home state for
beaming adult films into another state. The indictment stemmed from
an obscenity law enacted in Alabama in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Home Dish was fined $5,000 and paid $75,000 each to two
children's homes as part of the penalty. The company went out of
business after satellite owners refused to transmit its movies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a new American flag. How do I dispose of the old one,
which is too faded to give to anyone?
</P>
<P>
   A: When a flag is no longer fit for display, it should be
destroyed in some dignified way, preferably by burning.
</P>
<P>
   Call an American Legion or VFW post (locations and phone numbers
are listed in the telephone directory) to see if it will accept
donated flags for disposal. Also, many Boy Scout and Girl Scout
troops will accept them for flag-retirement ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If burning is the preferred disposal method for American
flags that have passed their useful life, how would the proposed
constitutional amendment against flag burning affect this practice?
</P>
<P>
   A: The proposed amendment would make it a federal crime to
desecrate the American flag. Disposing of an old, worn-out flag in
a respectful ceremony conducted by veterans' organizations or a
Scout troop wouldn't be considered desecration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The Navy's next class of aircraft carriers is designated
CVNX. What can you tell us about these carriers, and CVNX 1 in
particular?
</P>
<P>
   A: CVN is the Navy's designation for a nuclear-powered,
multipurpose aircraft carrier. The X refers to the next generation
carrier fleet. Adm. Jay Johnson, chief of naval operations, put it
this way: ``CVNX will form the core of the Navy that will prevail
today, tomorrow, and for decades to come _ anytime, anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy says the large-deck nuclear-powered ships will evolve
``at an evolutionary pace'' beginning with CVN 77, which will
replace USS Kitty Hawk in 2008. Construction on that vessel will
begin in 2001. Construction is scheduled to begin in 2006 on CVNX
1, which will replace USS Enterprise in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Navy, the nuclear propulsion plants on the new
class of carriers will provide ``immediate and future warfighting
enhancements and life cycle cost reductions.'' Subsequent carriers
will feature such new technologies as an electromagnetic aircraft
launching system. They will have ``stealthier features'' than
current carriers, but won't have a completely stealth design.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    FILE 1 of 2
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: The obituary for 93-year-old John Coolidge, son of President
Calvin Coolidge, didn't mention Coolidge's other son, who died
after playing tennis at the White House in the 1920s. Could you
refresh my memory?
</P>
<P>
   A: Calvin Coolidge Jr., who was born in 1908 _ two years after
John Coolidge _ died in 1924. He had developed a blister from
playing tennis and developed a staphylococcus infection which
proved to be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked Americans mourned his death, and even the famously
taciturn president broke down. As John Coolidge told Life magazine
in 1992: ``Though father was tenderhearted, he rarely showed his
feelings. But when they were taking my brother's casket from the
White House after the services, my father broke down and wept
momentarily. Calvin was my father's favorite. It hurt him terribly.
It hurt us all.''
</P>
<P>
   President Coolidge and his wife, Grace, had no other children.
John Coolidge died May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A report about the National Spelling Bee stated that the top
three finishers were home schooled. How many other contestants were
home schooled? Are similar statistics available for contestants in
the National Geographic Bee?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of the spellers participating in the Scripps Howard National
Spelling Bee in Washington, D.C., May 31-June 1, 27 were home
schooled, including the winner, George Thampy of Maryland Heights,
Mo. The remainder: public schools, 178; private, 24; parochial, 19.
</P>
<P>
   Of the contestants in the National Geographic Bee finals May
23-24, also in Washington, six were home schooled. The remainder:
public schools, 36; private, 5; parochial, 6.
</P>
<P>
   The spelling bee winner, 13-year-old Thampy, came in second at
the National Geographic Bee, by the way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What happens to donations made to political candidates when,
for whatever reason, they end up not running for office?
Specifically, what will happen to the donations New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani received before he withdrew from his Senate
campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton?
</P>
<P>
   A: Presidential and congressional candidates can return the
money to contributors, save it for a future campaign of their own,
donate it to another political party organization, or conceivably
donate it to a charity. Before 1993 it would have been possible for
them to convert the money for their own personal use, but the law
was changed that year, said Pete Sepp of the National Taxpayers
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who raised $20 million for the race, spent $13.8
million before he bowed out. Of the remainder, he has said he will
return $2.8 million to the donors and ask them to send their money
to Rep. Rick Lazio, who jumped into the race in his place. Election
laws require that Giuliani give donors back the money they
earmarked for the general election rather than the primary; that's
$2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Q: An article about technology mentioned something called
``carbon nanotubes.'' What are they?
</P>
<P>
   A: They're man-made carbon tubes 10,000 times thinner than a
human hair. It's part of what scientists and researchers call
``nanotechnology,'' a broad term given to the ability to control
atoms.
</P>
<P>
   Nanotechnology scientists work on the incredibly small
``nanometer'' scale. The prefix ``nano'' refers to one billionth of
one meter; one nanometer is the length of about five carbon atoms
strung together.
</P>
<P>
   Information on Georgia Tech's nanotube research can be found
online at www.gatech.edu. Click on the search button and type in
the word nanotube to access the information.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I can remember as a child using the phrase ``oly, oly, oxen
free,'' but I can't remember what game it went with. Can you tell
me the origin and what it meant?
</P>
<P>
   A: The chant was common in hide-and-seek to call in any players
who were holdouts at the end of the game. The Morris Dictionary of
Word and Phrase Origins speculates that it might have been a
childish corruption of ``all in free.''
</P>
<P>
   The book ``The Lore and Language of Children'' reports that
``ollyoxalls'' and ``olly-olly-ee'' were common ``truce terms''
among children in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're going to Cuba, and understand that U.S. credit cards
and travelers' checks cannot be used there. Is it possible for a
U.S. citizen to get a credit card in Canada for use in Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   A: You're correct in saying that credit cards and travelers'
checks from U.S. banks aren't accepted as payment in Cuba. The
accepted mode of payment is U.S. dollars. In fact you must travel
with cash, according to Cubatravel, a Tijuana, Mexico, company that
arranges tourist visits in Cuba. Cuban pesos are necessary only in
rural areas rarely traveled by tourists, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   One possible option is travelers' checks from foreign banks,
such as Thomas Cook or Barclays, which may be used to pay for some
services. But Cubatravel says you can save yourself some worry by
prepaying for such expenses as hotel accommodations, rental cars
and airport-hotel transfers.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. citizen cannot get a credit card issued by a Canadian
financial institution, said Laurel DeWolf of the Canadian Consulate
in Atlanta. In order to qualify for a Canadian credit card, an
applicant must have a social insurance number _ the equivalent in
Canada to a U.S. Social Security number _ and must have established
a residence in Canada for at least one year. Without meeting both
conditions, an application for a credit card would be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   As you're aware, the U.S. government restricts the spending of
money in Cuba. Americans traveling there without a Treasury
Department license must enter via a third country, such as Canada,
Mexico and the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When and where in Vietnam did Al Gore serve? Was he in fact
an Army journalist? Why was he there only five months, when most
Vietnam tours were one year?
</P>
<P>
   A: Gore was an Army journalist, Military Occupation Specialty
71Q20, with the rank of Specialist 5, the equivalent of a buck
sergeant. He was assigned to the 20th Engineering Brigade,
headquartered at the Bien Hoa military base about 40 miles north of
Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived there Dec. 26, 1970, and stayed five months. He had
received orders for Vietnam five months before he was actually
shipped out. While Gore himself offers no explanation for the
delay, there has been considerable speculation that it was the work
of the Nixon White House.
</P>
<P>
   According to this speculation, Nixon's political strategists
worried that if anything happened to Gore, there could be a
sympathy vote for his father, Sen. Albert Gore Sr. (D-Tenn.). The
elder Gore was in a heated re-election campaign that fall with Rep.
Bill Brock (R-Tenn.), who was using the senator's opposition to the
Vietnam War as a campaign issue. Gore Jr. was shipped off to
Vietnam after the election, which Brock won.
</P>
<P>
   Two books _ ``Inventing Al Gore,'' by Bill Turque; and ``Gore: A
Political Life,'' by Bob Zelnick _ mention this subject in more
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was growing up, the Pledge of Allegiance didn't
include the words ``under God.'' When was that added, and was it
done by Congress?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Under God'' was added by an act of Congress in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article mentioned that part of the skull of Adolf
Hitler was put on public display in Moscow. I had read previously
that none of Hitler's remains were ever found. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not entirely clear, but the story goes that after Hitler
shot himself in his Berlin bunker on April 30, 1945, his body was
taken outside by his staff, doused with gasoline, and set ablaze,
along with the remains of Eva Braun. When Soviet troops captured
the bunker afterward, they seized the remains.
</P>
<P>
   What happened after that is shrouded in mystery and speculation.
Secret communications between Soviet counterintelligence units in
Germany and the government in Moscow told of repeated burials and
exhumations of the remains, and of their final destruction by fire
in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   According to Soviet officials, however, a piece of Hitler's
skull and jaw weren't destroyed. What they claim is a fragment of
his skull _ a four-inch section with a hole where a bullet
reportedly exited through the left temple _ went on display at
Russia's Federal Archives Service in April. Photos of the jaw also
went on display, but the jaw itself, with the dental work that
presumably allowed the Soviets to identify Hitler's body, is still
in secret archives.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia announced in 1993 that it had the skull fragment,
some Western experts were skeptical. But Sergio Mironenko, head of
Russia's state archives, insisted it's authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I saw where a water sports amusement park had built a
``zero-depth'' pool for toddlers. If a pool has some water, how can
it be ``zero'' depth?
</P>
<P>
   A: The pool can be a place for toddlers to get wet, but without
a measureable water depth. ``Zero depth'' pools have fountains,
squirt guns and other features, but for safety reasons no standing
water for the tots to ingest.

 &HT;    Mountain reunion recalls fierce feud
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than a century after ending their bloody feud in
remote Appalachia, the Hatfields and McCoys are gathering this
weekend vowing to fight myths, not each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no feuding anymore,'' Waycross, Ga., minister Bo
McCoy said Wednesday from Pikeville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Georgia descendant of family patriarch Randolph
McCoy of Kentucky is helping organize the three-day reunion of as
many as 2,000 members from both families.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Friday, the reunion will culminate a year of planning
by Bo McCoy and his cousin, Ron McCoy, a music engineer in Durham,
N.C. They credit the Web page they created in 1998 for attracting
the interest of kinfolk who plan to attend from as far away as
South Korea and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a glorified reunion, a remembrance festival,'' Bo McCoy
said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1892, 12 years of feuding along the Tug Fork had claimed 12
lives. Six were Hatfields, six were McCoys.
</P>
<P>
   From the isolated river valley separating Kentucky and West
Virginia rose one of America's most enduring, and unflattering,
portrayals of Southerners as barefoot hillbillies shooting at each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The first dispute was over whether a Hatfield or a McCoy owned a
particular hog. But historians say their shooting war evolved into
a clash over ownership of timber, a battle foreshadowing the deadly
coal mine wars in one of America's most impoverished regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part of our heritage to let people know we were not as
notorious, as bad as some people think,'' said Cecil Hatfield, 63,
a retired school teacher in Williamson, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked me today,'' Hatfield said, ``who won the feud.
Nobody, I told them. It's just an unfortunate thing that happened,
something that my father and others from his generation did not
talk much about.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid this weekend's Hatfield vs. McCoy softball game and tug of
war, bluegrass and gospel music and appearances by Kentucky and
West Virginia, the families will share stories passed down for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering in Pikeville and Matewan, W. Va., they also hope
lectures will help correct the historical record and set to mood
for a collaboration among relatives to preserve historical sites,
such as cemeteries and spots where killing occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives gathered Wednesday in Blackberry Creek, Ky., for the
dedication of one of the bloodiest sites with a new marker.
</P>
<P>
   At this spot in August 1882, three McCoy boys stabbed Ellison
Hatfield with knives and shot him in the back. Hatfield's relatives
chased down the three McCoys and held them captive for three days,
until Hatfield died.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's kin then tied the three McCoys to a paw paw tree
and shot them, execution-style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very peaceful little spot down there by the river,''
Ron McCoy said Wednesday, ``especially for a place of such
violence.''

SHARES RALLY ON HOPE THAT FED WILL HOLD STEADY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paced by technology issues, stock prices resumed
their climb Wednesday as the belief spread that the Federal Reserve
could soon stop raising interest rates to keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   After a lackluster start, the Nasdaq composite index pushed
solidly higher and finished just shy of its best level, with an
advance of 82.89 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,839.26.
</P>
<P>
   Optimistic comments about IBM by a Goldman, Sachs analyst helped
send the company's shares up 8|, to 121, and rippled throughout the
market, accounting for about 60 percent of the Dow Jones industrial
average's rise of 77.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,812.86.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action left the Nasdaq with a smaller decline so far
this year than the Dow _ 5.65 percent compared with 5.95 percent _
despite suffering a 34 percent skid between March 10 and April 14.
</P>
<P>
   And the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index nosed back into
positive territory for the year. It climbed 13.52 points, or 0.9
percent, to 1,471.36 Wednesday. The index is now ahead for the year
by 0.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically in a bullish trend because there's much less
fear that they'll increase rates past June,'' said Mayer Offman,
chief trading strategist at the Carlin Equities Group, referring to
Federal Reserve policy-makers whose next scheduled meeting is June
27 and 28. He also called it a very good sign that recent sinking
spells had attracted bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   As trading began, Alfred E. Goldman, chief strategist at A.G.
Edwards in St. Louis, made a sweepingly upbeat declaration. ``We
are ringing the bell to announce that the three-month `bearable'
correction is over and a summer rally has begun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman cited slackening economic growth and the market's
reaction to this news last week when the Nasdaq surged a record 19
percent. He also predicted the Fed would forgo a June rate
increase.
</P>
<P>
   With 38.2 million shares changing hands, Microsoft was the most
heavily traded stock Wednesday as the market awaited the decision
by U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ordered
the company to be broken in two. The shares moved as low as 67[,
but were up ~, to 70{ at 4 p.m., and they climbed to 71} in
after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday's gains were highly concentrated in technology,
with declining shares slightly outnumbering advancing ones, 244 to
238, in the S&AMP;P and by 16 to 14 in the blue-chip Dow industrials.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest Nasdaq technology winners Wednesday were
Qualcomm, up 5 13/16, to 74 11/16; Veritas Software up 9|, to 134{;
Yahoo up 9 7/16, to 144{; i2 Technologies up 11\, to 138\; and
MicroStrategy up 9|, to 37|. Immunex, which won approval for
expanded use of an arthritis drug, jumped 4 13/64, to 36 5/16.
Applied Micro Circuits skidded 9 15/16, to 96~, after warning of
lower sales to its biggest customer.

IT'S OFFICIAL: JUDGE SAYS MICROSOFT MUST BECOME TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge has ordered Microsoft Corp. split in half as
punishment for stifling competition in the computer software
industry, in a ruling that seethed with exasperation at the
``untrustworthy'' and defiant leadership of Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   US District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling
Wednesday would impose the first corporate antitrust breakup since
telephone monopoly AT&AMP;T was forced to spin off the seven Baby Bells
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft vowed to seek a months- or years-long appeal, and a
stay of the judge's order, to keep the company intact. But top
Justice Department antitrust prosecutor Joel I. Klein said the
government will seek to have the case leapfrog an intermediate
appeals court and be heard directly by the US Supreme Court to
speed a resolution of the 2 1/2-year-old case.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson essentially accepted outright the demands by federal
antitrust prosecutors and 17 state attorneys general that Microsoft
be divided into two companies.
</P>
<P>
   One would sell basic operating systems for computers. The second
would sell word-processing, electronic mail and Web-surfing
programs that ride on those systems, and control Microsoft's
Hotmail e-mail service and MSN Web portal, with restrictions aimed
at preventing the two units from colluding.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier rulings, Jackson found that Microsoft has used its
domination of the operating system market _ its Windows software
runs an estimated 90 percent of the world's personal computers _ to
preserve that monopoly and try to kill off emerging software
rivals, including Web browser maker Netscape Communications, now
part of America OnLine.
</P>
<P>
   In just three terse and often angry-sounding pages, Jackson said
it has become clear that Microsoft under Gates' leadership refuses
to accept the authority of the century-old federal antitrust laws
that were used to break up AT&AMP;T and the Standard Oil trust and
thwart monopolization efforts by US Steel and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   ``A structural remedy has become imperative: Microsoft as it is
presently organized and led is unwilling to accept the notion that
it broke the law or accede to an order amending its conduct,''
Jackson wrote. He added that ``Microsoft has proved untrustworthy
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the certainty of lengthy appeals, likely to the
Supreme Court, Jackson said effectively: Let's get on with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft officials have recently been quoted publicly to the
effect that the company has `done nothing wrong' and that it will
be vindicated on appeal,'' Jackson wrote. ``The Court is well aware
that there is a substantial body of public opinion, some of it
rational, that holds to a similar view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to put that assertion to the test,'' Jackson
declared.
</P>
<P>
   In a late-afternoon press conference at Microsoft's Redmond,
Wash., headquarters, Gates refused to back down from his repeated
assertions that Microsoft has done nothing wrong and will prevail
over Jackson in higher courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe very strongly that today is the first day of the
rest of this case,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling says to creators of intellectual property that the
government can take away your property if it proves to be too
popular,'' Gates added. He vowed to press ahead with efforts to
develop new software, including systems that respond to spoken
commands and those hand-written on an electronic tablet.
</P>
<P>
   Gates also complained that Jackson was ordering a radical
bifurcation of the company ``without a single day of testimony'' on
how to proceed. ``There has never been anything like this in
judicial history,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson said Microsoft's ``profession of surprise'' at the
order ``is not credible.'' The judge contended that ``yet another
round of discovery, to be followed by a second trial'' on how to
atone for Microsoft's violations of law gives no assurance of
reaching ``an optimum remedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's order gives Microsoft four months to devise a plan for
breaking up the company, as sought by federal prosecutors, with the
breakup itself phased in to enable the parties to return to court
several times to fix problems that emerge.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged the split-up ``is perhaps more radical than
might have resulted had mediation been successful,'' but said it
will ``take force in stages, so that the effects can be guaged
while the appeal progresses'' and amended if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's top lawyer, William Neukom, said the company
will within days seek a stay of Jackson's order. ``We're in the
middle innings of the judicial proceedings,'' Neukom said. ``I
anticipate that the appellate phase of this will go on for a number
of months, if not a year or possibly longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers have speculated Microsoft is eager to drag out
the case, in the hope that Texas Gov. George W. Bush _ who seems
inclined to avoid a breakup _ is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, every month Microsoft avoids a breakup is another
month it can plow its $600 million monthly profits and $20
billion-plus cash hoard into new ventures, such as wireless Net
access products and services, that could help it to survive losing
its Windows operating system monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said, ``I am pleased that the court
has ordered a strong, effective remedy to address the serious
antitrust violations that Microsoft has committed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's ruling will have a profound impact, not only by
promoting competition in the software industry, but also by
reaffirming the importance of antitrust law enforcement in the 21st
Century and the importance of competition,'' Reno added.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said, ``Microsoft itself is responsible for where things
stand today... Decisions made at the highest level of the company
reflect defiance of, not respect for, the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Microsoft leaders decried the ruling, however, Wall
Street seemed unfazed. Microsoft shares rose 87.5 cents to $70.50 a
share during the regular Nasdaq trading session, later rising to
$72 in after-hours trading following a brief trading halt in the
minutes after Jackson's ruling came out.
</P>
<P>
   If the appeals go straight to the Supreme Court, it appears
unlikely the justices will take them up before their next session
begins in October, leaving Microsoft and much of the US technology
industry in limbo all summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court could well send the case back down to the
Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has
been a far friendlier venue for Microsoft in the past than
Jackson's court.
</P>
<P>
   However, in one part of his ruling, Jackson ordered several
steps that, unless frozen by a stay, could have more immediate
impacts on the sale and development of computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Within 90 days, Jackson ruled, Microsoft must stop controlling
which program icons are displayed on a computer screen when a user
buys a computer loaded by a manufacturer with Microsoft software.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment makers such as Compaq and Dell would be able to
arrange the desktop as they want, even if the machine ran on
Windows software _ removing a major hurdle for Microsoft rivals
trying to make their products more easily available to users.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson would also force Microsoft to reveal some now-secret
aspects of the so-called application programming interfaces in
Windows to make it easier for non-Microsoft programmers to write
products like document and business-manageemnt software that would
run on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   And the order requires Microsoft to charge the 20 biggest
computer makers the same price for Windows, except for volume
discounts, to curb its leverage over computer makers to promote
Microsoft products. Jackson also forbade Microsoft from raising
prices of older versions of software once a new version is
launched.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is to a large extent in limbo,'' said David Smith, a
software analyst at the Gartner Group. ``Their products are well
established in the market and I don't think customers will abandon
them, but the new initiatives that are dependent on innovation will
suffer from the uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, to prevent Microsoft from snarling an ultimate breakup,
Jackson ordered the company to preserve its current structure and
continue to maintain all its current offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The new ``Baby Bills,'' as some industry analysts have dubbed
them, would be organized as follows:
</P>
<P>
   --An operating systems business producing all Windows operating
systems. Those include Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, the Pocket PC
system for mobile devices, and soon-to-be-released systems
including Windows Millennium Edition and a product called Whistler
that combines consumer and business uses.
</P>
<P>
   --An applications business that essentially collects everything
else: all applications such as Office, Exchange, Internet Explorer
and the Outlook Express e-mail system, the Media Player for
listening to music over the Web, videoconferencing systems, the
MSNBC television network, the MSN Web portal, Slate magazine, the
Hotmail free e-mail service, and the Expedia Net travel service.
</P>
<P>
   Under Jackson's ruling, Gates, the Microsoft chairman and chief
software architect, and chief executive officer Steve Ballmer would
be made to choose one company to join and own stock in.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department sued Microsoft in October 1997, saying it
had violated a 1995 settlement by forcing computer makers to
install its Internet Explorer Web browser if they wanted to use
Windows 95. Nineteen states later joined the case, 17 of which
urged a Microsoft breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-six sometimes grueling days of testimony, in which Gates
was repeatedly found professing ignorance about e-mails he had sent
urging executives to crush rivals, ended last June.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Jackson issued harsh ``findings of fact''
portraying Microsoft as a monopolistic bully. These findings, which
preceded a lengthy but failed effort to negotiate a settlement,
largely anticipated Jackson's later rulings finding the company
guilty of antitrust violations and ordering a corporate breakup.

WHAT TOOK SO LONG TO THANK WWII VETERANS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   By any measure but his own, perhaps, Ralph Spina was a war hero.
</P>
<P>
   As a combat medic with the 101st Airborne Division _ which
fought its way across France, Holland and Germany in World War II _
Spina went onto the front lines, unarmed, to tend the wounded. He
was wounded on the battlefield, a fact he downplays when he comes
to my office to talk about the grand opening Tuesday of the
long-awaited National D-Day Museum in New Orleans, which he is
attending, one of the 10,000 veterans expected for four days of
celebration and recognition.
</P>
<P>
   I had wanted to hear, from a decorated veteran, how it feels to
have the nation finally recognize his generation's heroics; to hear
the unvarnished story of the war's worst battles from someone who
lived them. But Spina would rather talk about his buddies from
South Philly who served with him than about his work ferrying the
wounded from the beaches of Normandy after D-Day. He'd rather tell
a funny story about the Christmas Eve when he and some fellow
soldiers tried to cook a stolen chicken in a German helmet than
relive the 26 grueling days his company spent in the thick of
fighting at the Battle of the Bulge.
</P>
<P>
   And then, as he's heading down the hall after the brief
interview, he tosses a comment over his shoulder, just to make sure
I got the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, sweetheart, don't get too mushy with this thing,'' he
says. ``OK? Don't make it sound like I think I'm some kind of
hero.''
</P>
<P>
   The war, I think, was fought by millions of men like Ralph
Spina, who went most of a lifetime hardly mentioning the horrors
they saw and the bravery they demonstrated. No wonder it's taken 56
years to finally get around to honoring them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the 56th anniversary of the Allied invasion of
Normandy, a high-tech, multimedia National D-Day Museum was
christened in New Orleans with a splashy ceremony moderated by Tom
Brokaw. Luminaries such as Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, as well
as at least 10,000 World War II vets, were in attendance. The
museum traces not just the battles at Normandy but the events
leading up to and following them; next year, it will open a gallery
devoted to the D-Day battles in the Pacific, such as Guadalcanal.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years in the making, the museum was founded by noted
historian Stephen Ambrose, who has collected thousands of oral
histories from veterans for books such as ``D-Day,'' one of
Spielberg's inspirations in making ``Saving Private Ryan.'' Ambrose
originally wanted just to create a home for the many artifacts he'd
been given by veterans; he also wanted to honor New Orleans
boatmaker Andrew Higgins, whose factory made the thousands of
Higgins landing vessels used in D-Day and nearly every other
amphibious assault during the war.
</P>
<P>
   But the project kept growing. Now it will mix genuine artifacts
_ a British Spitfire military plane, a reconstructed Higgins boat,
helmets, tattered Bibles and penknives _ with oral histories, short
films and re-created scenes, such as the war room where Gen. Dwight
Eisenhower and other top strategists made the decision to proceed
with the D-Day landing, and a panorama showing the vast scope of
the beach assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is the first in a troika of elaborate, high-profile
tributes to the World War II era scheduled to open in the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
   On or around Veteran's Day this fall, ground will be broken on
the National WWII Memorial in Washington, D.C., a $100 million
monument to everyone who contributed to the war effort. And on June
4, 2001, the 57th anniversary of D-Day, the National D-Day Memorial
will be unveiled in Bedford, Va. Bedford lost 21 of its sons at
Normandy, the largest per-capita loss of any city in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing seems cruel. The remaining World War II veterans
are mostly in their mid-70s or older. An estimated 1,000 die every
day. Why didn't we do something earlier, when more of the honorees
would have been around to hear the thanks personally?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question that veterans ask themselves. Douglas Owens, a
Fort Worth veteran who was one of the first soldiers ashore at
Normandy, appreciates the attention, but is a bit puzzled by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't understand is, what's the deal now? I've done
forgot about it,'' says Owens, who doesn't plan to attend the
museum opening and has only vague interest in seeing it. ``For 40
years, nobody paid any attention .... Why is everybody interested
in it now?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a melange of factors, the simplest being the vast
scope of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are museums that honor Americans at air bases in
England, at Normandy, but nothing in the USA, partly because the
war wasn't fought here in the sense of battles taking place here,
and partly because everyone was involved,'' says Ambrose, the
historian.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were either in the armed forces or working in defense
plants or growing food. And how on earth do you build a monument to
everybody?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By any measure, World War II was the most massive war effort in
U.S. history, taking a huge toll between 1941 and 1945. More than
16 million served in the armed forces; 400,000 died. Virtually
everyone else in the nation contributed to the effort, by working
in one of the defense factories, by serving in the civilian support
workforce, by growing victory gardens or collecting scrap rubber,
or by simply doing without. MORE &QL;

THE LEMMINGS ARE BACK, AND FALLING FAST 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER OLAFSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   They have bushy green hair, a wardrobe borrowed from Alvin the
Chipmunk, no will (except to walk) and no instinct whatsoever for
self-preservation. When they reach a ledge, they fall. When the
fall is long and ends on a hard surface, they splat.
</P>
<P>
   The lemmings, who strolled onto the computer game scene in 1991,
have returned in their first new game in almost four years.
Lemmings Revolution, which blends conventional lemming-saving with
a modest taste of 3-D, serves as a reminder of both the pleasures
of a proven concept and the lost art of playing the good Samaritan.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny, suicidal creatures that populate this puzzle game
remain as cute as the proverbial button, and none the wiser for the
passage of time. Real-world lemmings were once said to drown
themselves during mass migrations, although now we know that they
don't really seek death _ their straight-ahead style of migration
sometimes gets them into trouble when what's ahead is a big lake or
an ocean. Their virtual cousins apparently have not heard about the
latest research and still trek inexorably, in single file, from the
entry trapdoor to their doom.
</P>
<P>
   The lemmings drown in water, cook in lava, dissolve in acid.
They are dismantled by traps or sent flying by equally tiny weasels
(the reason the lemmings are in this fix to begin with) equipped
with tiny red boxing gloves. Each still meets its demise by
squeaking, ``Oh, no!'' It sounds as if it had accidentally left its
ATM card at home.
</P>
<P>
   In each of 100 levels, you must intercede to rescue a
predetermined number of lemmings by shepherding them to hot-air
balloons before a clock runs out. They are nothing if not
adaptable. You click on icons at the side of the screen and then on
the relevant lemming to imbue it with one or more skills. Many of
the 16 included in the game (no more than 8 of them in a given
level) will be familiar from Lemmings games past.
</P>
<P>
   A ``blocker'' obstructs the path of its fellow lemmings and
sends them walking back in the opposite direction. When falling, a
``floater'' will pop open a tiny umbrella to slow its descent. A
``builder'' assembles a wooden staircase of finite length. A
``basher'' claws its way horizontally through the appropriate
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   New additions to the Lemmings canon include trampoline and
antigravity skills, which can turn a level's treacherous platforms
and pitfalls upside down. Complicating the picture are lemming
species that are impervious to certain hazards. In the course of
solving a level, you may have to attend to the needs of more than
one breed and find yourself struggling to adopt different
strategies for their different paths.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution's tone is very like the tone of early Lemmings games.
There is something delightful about watching a critter no bigger
than a hangnail scale a wall or build a bridge, plank by plank.
(It's a bit like watching an ant farm.) Moreover, the levels
preserve their airy atmosphere right up to the moment when they
turn wicked.
</P>
<P>
   These cleverly constructed challenges range from simple
explorations of a given skill to exercises in careful placement or
timing to seemingly impossible challenges that require the player
to look ahead and see beyond the obvious uses of skills. For
instance, a ``builder'' lemming's staircase isn't always a path to
higher ground. Built in the right place, it might break a lemming's
fall.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect the appeal is also related to the player's point of
view, a retreat from the unconventional perspectives of 3D
Lemmings, from 1995, and Lemmings Paintball, from 1996. In
Revolution, each level is wrapped around the exterior of a giant
spindle, which you can rotate at will with the mouse. (Hence the
title.) That gives the game the trappings of modernity without its
burdens. It is 3-D that feels almost like 2-D, and that, as a
result, comes across like the games of the early and mid-'90s:
Lemmings, Lemmings 2: Tribes and the Lemmings Chronicles.
</P>
<P>
   The resemblance is not simply physical. Revolution's creator _
Psygnosis, of Leeds, England, which published earlier Lemmings
games _ has tapped into the same wellspring of good feeling that
comes from being the savior of small, helpless creatures. In many
current games, clearing a path means killing anything that moves.
Here, it means removing anything that kills, and Revolution
distinguishes itself with this essential generosity of spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The four-year hiatus may have been a good thing. When the
Lemmings line was in its heyday, it generated a cottage industry of
similar games: Humans, Diggers, Troddlers. Little creatures seemed
to be in jeopardy everywhere. These days, with Revolution standing
more or less alone, it's easy to develop a renewed appreciation for
its sweet style.
</P>
<P>
   Booting up the game was rather like stepping into a time
machine. It took me back to a simpler era, when such innocent
pursuits constituted a larger share of the game market, when we
were outside games more than we were in them and when most games
fit on a single disk. It's a small world after all.
</P>
<P>
   Revolution feels economical, even though the typical
installation will take up roughly 450 megabytes on your hard disk
and the minimum requirement of a 266-megahertz Pentium II is
relatively hefty for a game. It loads speedily and can be learned
easily and played quickly (though mastery is another matter). Even
at its most challenging, it is comparatively weightless.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, death remains part of the bargain here (albeit cute,
squeaky death). But it is bloodless and, at worst, an act of
omission on the player's part. The only lemmings you are likely to
have to kill outright _ using the ``nuke'' command, which
obliterates all lemmings remaining in a level _ are the
``blockers'' you have left behind because they remain fixed in
place even after they have run out of lemmings to redirect. Think
of it as a lesson not so much in death as in altruism.

UNDATED: they went through. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I did what I was supposed to,'' Douglas Owens says. ``I didn't
do anything more than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of those boys was brave, but they were all just
doing their job,'' Ralph Spina says. ``You know where the heroes
are? They're in the cemetery.''
</P>
<P>
   Every time I hear a veteran say something like that, I think of
my father, who served in England during the war. How many times, I
think, have I heard him say the same thing?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dad was a child of the Depression, born in 1917 and leaving
school at 16 to go to work. When the war broke out, he was 24; he
volunteered within months, ending up in England, supervising
maintenance crews that worked on bombers. Everybody he knew was
involved, somehow, in the war; to him, it was the biggest event of
his lifetime _ and nothing out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   I am a child of the baby boom, born in 1962 and supported by my
parents through college. My peers were too young to serve in
Vietnam; I knew only a few people who served in the military. War
to me meant John Wayne movies and old men wearing military gimme
caps at the American Legion hall.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't talk about it much as I grew up. He didn't volunteer
anything beyond the occasional story about the terrible food or the
kinds of planes he used to work on. I was too self-absorbed to ask
him many questions, and when I did, he didn't really answer them. I
But five years ago, we went together to a reunion of his bomber
group at the base weher they'd been stationed in Seething, England.
He wasn't sure he wanted to go at first; he had always said he
didn't care if he ever saw Europe again. Once we got there, he
seemed to enjoy driving through the countryside and walking through
the towns he'd visited, drinking a pint at a pub he remembered. He
even told a few war stories _ about the bombers carrying his
friends who disappeared, about clustering in bunkers during the
rare nighttime airstrike, about working on planes more than 24
hours straight during the D-Day invasion, everyone knowing what was
at stake.
</P>
<P>
   What I remember most, though, was his genuine surprise when
hundreds of English citizens attended the reunion, many of them
stopping to personally thank the veterans. Many of his buddies wore
the same look of puzzled, embarrassed appreciation. I honestly
don't think they had ever really realized just what they had
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   I was so proud of Dad that day _ not just for his unselfish,
uncomplaining service, but because he was so unaware that he'd made
a sacrifice. And now, the more I hear about World War II in the
news, the more grateful I feel not just to him, but to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have a feeling I'm not the only child or grandchild who feels
that way. A rising tide of gratitude and patriotism has helped make
the books and movies about World War II more popular, which in turn
has helped raise the profile of the various memorial projects. We
baby boomers may have been selfish _ we honored our own generation
with the Vietnam memorial first _ but now, we want to rectify our
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw, born in 1940, began developing an obsession with the war
in 1984, when he covered the 40th anniversary of D-Day in Normandy.
Over the following years, he found himself bringing up the topic
with friends and dining companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time, they would all become very quiet. They would stop
and realize how much different our lives were from those of our
parents, in terms of material wealth, opportunity, security,'' he
says. ``The current generation goes white-water rafting on the
weekend, and if somebody goes overboard, they think, oh, what an
adventure. Then they realize that when their father was 19, he was
landing in Iwo Jima or fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, or
their mother was going to work in a factory not knowing where her
husband or boyfriend or brother was. ... It just kind of all came
into focus at a time when we have no other distractions, no Vietnam
War, no civil rights movement, no social upheaval.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, all this recognition might never have happened if
celebrities hadn't gotten involved.
</P>
<P>
   Take the national memorial soon to be constructed in Washington,
D.C. The quest for a memorial was first brought up in Congress in
1987, sparked by a WWII veteran who asked his congresswoman why
there was nothing commemorating the vets. In '93, the project was
finally signed into law, and two years later, President Clinton
dedicated a site on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The project got its first big boost in 1997, when former Sen.
Bob Dole, a wounded and decorated World War II vet, signed on as
national chairman. But fund-raising was still difficult. In 1998,
the toll-free contribution line received just 5,000 calls, memorial
spokeswoman Betsy Glick says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, after ``Saving Private Ryan'' won five Oscars and Hanks
did a series of public-service announcements for the memorial, the
line received 230,000 calls, she says.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the National D-Day Memorial Foundation was established
in Virginia in 1989, but it languished in obscurity until the 50th
anniversary ceremonies in Normandy in 1994, says foundation
President Richard Burrow. It, too, has been adopted by influential
patrons. Cartoonist Charles Schulz served as national chairman for
several years, until his death from cancer. And Spielberg recently
donated the money to build a theater in the memorial's education
center.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg, known not only for ``Saving Private Ryan'' but for
the Holocaust drama ``Schindler's List,'' has also supported the
National D-Day Museum in New Orleans, partly because of his
friendship with museum founder Ambrose, and partly because of his
movies. But his involvement is apparently more than just the
typical Hollywood publicity machine _ and it is a microcosm of how
the nation has finally reached the point of saying thank you.
</P>
<P>
   The theater that Spielberg is paying for at the Virginia
memorial will be named not for Steven Spielberg but for his father,
Arnold, who was a radio operator on a bomber during World War II.

   When the war ended and the soldiers came home, America showed
its gratitude with things like the GI Bill, through which millions
of ex-soldiers went to college and received job training. As for
more-lasting tributes, they mostly consisted of things such as
little memorials at the county courthouse, or small sections in
other military museums. Meanwhile, we dedicated the Vietnam
Veterans Memorial in 1982 and the Korean War Veterans Memorial in
1995. For the men and women of World War II, there was nothing
comparable.
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, other historians and veterans all concede that the
reasons for that omission are complicated, bound up in everything
from the psyche of a generation brought up stoically during the
Great Depression and the nation's ill-fated involvement in Vietnam
to nostalgia and a later generation's search for heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The commemorative efforts follow, not coincidentally, a raft of
news media attention, starting with coverage of the 50th
anniversary of D-Day in 1994. After that, books such as Ambrose's
``D-Day'' and Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation,'' the personal
stories of mostly nonfamous survivors of World War II, hit the
bestseller lists. And most famously, there was ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' the '98 Spielberg/Hanks film that graphically depicted the
battles of Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the spate of recognition follows the natural cycle of
things: Anniversaries provide a natural looking-back point; Ambrose
points out that Civil War veterans received a similar outpouring of
gratitude 50 years later. And part of the reason is that the nation
is ready to hear these stories.
</P>
<P>
   The '50s were too early; veterans were busy building careers,
raising families. And the '60s and '70s, when many veterans were in
their prime, were too late; by then, the nation had become involved
in the divisive Vietnam conflict, which soured many on the idea of
honoring anything to do with war.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the '80s and '90s, and growing national
disenchantment with corporate greed, political infighting and
senseless violent crimes, that the World War II era would be looked
at with admiration, with respect, as a time when America was
unquestionably in the right.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the century, when we looked back, it was hard to
in any way diminish the importance of World War II,'' says Brokaw,
the NBC news anchor whose bestselling 1998 book, ``The Greatest
Generation,'' has been credited with fueling the new respect for
the era.
</P>
<P>
   ``You stop and think about what the world would be like if we
had not prevailed, and it's a pretty unsettling thought. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, that unsavory business with (Monica) Lewinsky and
(Ken) Starr and the president left everybody with a great craving
to hear about something uplifting and heroic and good.''
</P>
<P>
   World War II stories fit the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're honoring in the D-Day Museum, and all these other
memorials, and in `Saving Private Ryan,' is a whole generation, and
a world view. We're honoring a time when life seemed simple and
people seemed nobler and we knew the difference between right and
wrong,'' says Steve Gillon, a history professor at the University
of Oklahoma who hosts a weekly talk show on the History Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a D-Day today, every person who came within 100
yards of the beach would have a press agent and would be out
selling their story to Fox News. These men, they just came home and
went back to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that's exactly why the stories were slow to be told.
Toughened by the Depression, raised to accept their lot
uncomplainingly and to support their country unquestioningly, those
who lived through the war didn't think it was their place to talk
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only struck me in the last year or two, but they're almost
embarrassed when they're treated like heroes,'' says Nick Mueller,
a history professor at the University of New Orleans who was
drinking sherry with Ambrose in his back yard when Ambrose first
mentioned the idea of a museum. He is now the chairman of the
museum's board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're pleased in a way, but deep down, they feel
that the real heroes were the guys who didn't make it. ... I think
they feel that to allow themselves to be treated as heroes demeans
the sacrifice of the friends who they lost, who didn't come home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ambrose, who has interviewed thousands of veterans while
researching such popular books as ``Band of Brothers'' and
``D-Day,'' concurs. Almost to a man, World War II veterans insist
that they didn't do anything special, that everybody sacrificed.
And most of them didn't really care to relive what they went
through. MORE &QL;

TACKLING A ROCKY ROLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By REED JOHNSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are certain types of women that Anne Archer finds very
attractive. Artsy. Opinionated. A little wild, perhaps. Definitely
eccentric.
</P>
<P>
   Women a lot like Rockie Rogers, the impulsive, mentally unstable
character Archer plays in Robert Glaudini's drama ``The Poison
Tree,'' which opens a six-week run tonight at the Mark Taper Forum.
</P>
<P>
   In her younger and more vulnerable days, in the 1970s, Rockie
was the toast of the La Jolla intelligentsia. Sexy and
cosmopolitan, she hobnobbed with renowned, worldly figures like the
philosopher Herbert Marcuse. Once, Rockie was asked to pose by the
German surrealist painter Max Ernst _ or so she says, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But after 15 years of a financially secure, emotionally humdrum
marriage to a conservative Superior Court judge, the twice-divorced
Rockie is feeling stifled and confused. She's also grieving the
recent loss of her beloved son due to a drug overdose.
</P>
<P>
   With a personality as bumpy as her name, Rockie is a woman on
the verge.
</P>
<P>
   ``She lives in the past, when her life was more on the edge,
even though it was probably hell,'' Archer says during a recent
pre-rehearsal break.
</P>
<P>
   ``She misses living that dream, that crazy, wild dream, where
she was the center of things and was sexy and beautiful, and
everybody was interested in her.''
</P>
<P>
   As Glaudini's play quickly establishes, life can be harsh to
women like Rockie who've outlived their glamorous years and are
losing their grip on reality.
</P>
<P>
   But characters like Rockie also make life rewarding for female
actors of a certain age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting because, well, you know what roles are like for
women in film,'' says Archer, who's probably best-known for blowing
a hole through a knife-wielding Glenn Close in Adrian Lyne's
``Fatal Attraction'' (1987).
</P>
<P>
   ``There just aren't great roles for women, especially if you're
not in your 20s,'' continues Archer, whose aversion to revealing
her own age in print would be hard to overstate. (For the record,
she could pass for a dozen years younger than her recorded age.)
``So this (role), it's a gift, really, it's a beautiful gift to be
able to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Taper audiences conditioned by Archer's Hollywood image may be
in for a surprise this summer. As Beth Gallagher in ``Fatal
Attraction'' and Dr. Cathy Ryan opposite Harrison Ford in ``Patriot
Games'' and ``Clear and Present Danger,'' she comes across as a
wholesome, warmly sensual presence, an intelligent, middle-class
woman who probably went to good schools and drinks chardonnay at
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Rockie, spiky and paranoid, exists at a very different point on
the post-'70s, post-feminist spectrum. Adding to her life's other
complications, her husband (played by Bob Gunton) is presiding over
a harrowing court case involving a young woman who apparently has
castrated three male surfers. And Rockie is struggling with her own
strange attraction to a young poet (Christian Camargo) bearing an
eerie resemblance to her dead son.
</P>
<P>
   Playwright Glaudini says he had admired Archer's film work for
some time, but also suspected there were hidden depths to her
previous screen characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the kick I get is that, `Well, maybe some of those
women that she played had another whole big story, you know what I
mean?''' Glaudini says. ``And maybe Rockie can express part of
that, that never makes it into the films where the man's the hero
and the lead, and she's the support. So I just was gambling that
underneath the lid of that is a lot of stuff waiting to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer says she's never had to work so hard at a role, or
explore so much psychological backstory, as she has had to do with
Rockie. Beth Gallagher, comparatively, was a piece of cake,
although ``if I was playing Glenn's role, I would've needed the
backstory for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of her more emotionally complicated film roles haven't been
seen by that many people, Archer says, mentioning one upcoming part
as an alcoholic whose daughters were sexually abused by her former
husband.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's last stage appearance was about eight years ago. She
has appeared at the prestigious Williamstown Theatre Festival in
``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'' and co-starred in both the
off-Broadway and Los Angeles productions of ``A Coupla' White
Chicks Sitting Around Talking.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the extremity of their situations, several characters in
``The Poison Tree'' strike personal chords with Archer, who was
born and raised in Los Angeles and is the daughter of screen actors
John Archer and Marjorie Lord. She is married to producer-director
Terry Jastrow and has two sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the characters in the play I've had actually in my life,''
she says, ``so there's a lot of rich stuff that I can feed on.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rockie, it's her taste for great art and interesting
people, her appetite for life rather than her taste for
self-destruction, that makes her a woman after Archer's own heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one of the richest parts of the play for me: that
you'll die if you don't have art in your life. You'll die. I feel
that way. That's one of the reasons I did this play: To have a
chance to do this keeps me alive.''

WHEN MOHAMMED CAN'T GET TO THE MUSEUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALICE KEIM   
 &HT;     
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was lucky enough to grow up in New York City, just a few
blocks from Museum Mile. My art history classes included weekly
visits to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; I learned about dinosaurs
at the American Museum of Natural History. But, while nothing can
replace the experience of seeing a masterpiece up close, the Web
means that museum education is no longer geographically restricted.
Some of the world's most remarkable institutions have Web sites
specifically designed for children and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Art Safari (http://artsafari.moma.org/), a site by the Museum of
Modern Art in New York is by far the most impressive art education
site for children that I have seen. (For adults, the MOMA site also
has online projects and collaborations with various artists, and
helpful commentary and information on the museum's exhibitions and
collections.)
</P>
<P>
   The online activities provide a virtual experience similar to
what a child might have at a weekend museum workshop. Students
focus on a selected sculpture or painting from the museum's
collection as they answer a series of questions about each piece.
The activity encourages close observation and active imagination.
At the end of the sequence of questions, children are asked to
create their own masterpiece using the online art tools.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Picasso's ``She-Goat'' and answered five on-screen
questions about the sculpture. Afterward, my answers appeared on
screen in story form. The site also suggested ways to create my own
sculpture using everyday found objects as Picasso did, or using the
site's online art program. Using the online tools, I struggled to
manipulate the pictures of a bowling pin, baseball, a spoon,
eyeglasses, a hammer and a bowl to form the shape of a cat. The
recommended non-virtual, live project might have been more fun. I
also did the exercises for works by Frida Kahlo, Henri Rousseau,
and Diego Rivera. Each has its own online questions and art tools,
all of which were easier to use than the Picasso project.
</P>
<P>
   On the home page of the Natural History Museum in London
(www.nhm.ac.uk), I clicked on Interactive and brought up a page
with links to eight different interactive activities. I visited
AntCast and after patiently waiting for the live video stream
watched two ants slowly make their way around what looked like a
piece of wood. I was not all that interested in watching an English
ant go about its daily routine, but my third graders who study ants
would have been delighted.
</P>
<P>
   The Earthlab Datasite, which contains information on fossils,
rocks and minerals in the United Kingdom, is an extensive and a
wonderful resource for a middle school or high school science
student.
</P>
<P>
   Science Casebook has sections on meteorites and speculates on
the possibility of a real Jurassic Park. There is also a
fascinating account of the Beast of Bodmin Moor, a legendary
catlike animal in Cornwall, England.
</P>
<P>
   Dinosaur-crazed students will find the Dinosaur Data Files and
the Quest II to be the gems of this extensive site. Educators
should find the Dinosaur Data files, fact sheets on 28 different
types of dinosaurs, extremely useful. Each file contains the name,
proper pronunciation, origin, size, feeding preferences and other
facts about each dinosaur. While the information is designed for
the classroom, many of the suggested activities could be used at
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the Quest II section students can become museum scientists.
Online tools and data allow students to examine and draw
conclusions about a dozen objects. For example, I investigated the
physical and historical traits of a butterfly using a virtual
magnifying glass and scale. (When finished I could have submitted
my notes to be posted on the Web.) After completing my research I
clicked on the book icon to learn the full details of my specimen.
The language and tools are appropriate for children as young as 8.
Quest is available in five languages.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Franklin Institute Science Museum
(http://www.fi.edu/), has a fantastic exploration of the human
heart, including a tour of valves and arteries using actual
photographs and some medical terms that may require a dictionary.
Younger users can skip some of the denser biology sections and use
the table of contents to go directly to an area of interest. The
site also has excellent pages on weather, earth forces like
volcanoes and earthquakes, a program about early aviation and a
large area on Benjamin Franklin. Some sections are a bit text heavy
for a child to use independently but are worth a visit.

tours for children or adults.

MATCHBOX TARGETS NEW FANS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year around this time, the Orlando, Fla., pop-rock outfit
Matchbox Twenty was in danger of slipping into the ``Where Are They
Now?'' file.
</P>
<P>
   The quintet's 1996 mega-selling debut, ``Yourself or Someone
Like You,'' had dropped off the charts and hit singles including
``Push'' and ``3am'' were turning into golden oldies.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Carlos Santana's sensual salsa-tinged single, ``Smooth,''
featuring Matchbox Twenty's Rob Thomas on vocals, stormed the
charts, transforming Thomas into an instant superstar. Suddenly,
everyone remembered his band, which was in the studio taking its
time with the next album, the recently released ``Mad Season.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday at the intimate Wilshire-Ebell Theatre, the restorative
powers of ``Smooth'' could be felt. Clumps of females stood at
their seats dancing and singing along with every song as the
triple-Grammy-winning Thomas and company gave fans a taste of the
new album, which entered the charts last week at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Matchbox's strength is in radio ballads, sweetly tuneful
classic-rock sing-alongs like the current Top 20 hit ``Bent'' or
the title track of the new disc, universal numbers that benefit
from whisper-to-a-scream dynamics and chiming hooks delivered by
dual guitarists Kyle Cook and Adam Gaynor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most affecting moments came with turbulent songs
like ``Angry'' and ``You Won't Be Mine,'' both off ``Mad Season.''
Readings of earlier hits, including ``Real World,'' ``Push'' and
``3am,'' drew fans to their feet while the sound of female voices
sometimes threatened to drown out the singer on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is a refreshing figure, a seemingly regular guy with a
convincing vocal delivery who did something few rock stars do on
stage anymore _ he talked to the audience, asking if they were
having a good time, thanking them for their reaction and offering
comments on the venue, which hadn't hosted a rock concert in nearly
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sanctioned _ and kosher,'' Thomas said gleefully.
</P>
<P>
   And then some. The recently married Thomas' every dramatic
inflection met with screams from the packed audience.
</P>
<P>
   In concert, Matchbox Twenty, augmented Tuesday by a keyboardist
and horn section on some numbers, concentrates on tight,
well-played music, which sometimes recalls Hootie &AMP; the Blowfish
with its melodic, radio-ready appeal. The smoldering Thomas and his
musicians were mostly static, and the singer rarely strayed from
the microphone center-stage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the music's occasional lack of personality, the band
clearly gave it all they had. The only question is whether Matchbox
Twenty can keep coming up with hits.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Memo to all you Ranger fans and all the
others, judging by the Neilsen ratings, who are pretending that the
Devils don't exist: admit that this is the hockey team you wish was
yours.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers were only one victory away from winning the
Stanley Cup in 1994, you acted as if they had invented ice, that
the National Hockey League had never existed until Mark Messier put
on a Ranger sweater. But if the Devils dethrone the Dallas Stars in
Thursday night's fifth game of the Stanley Cup finals, they will
have won the cup twice in the last six seasons.
</P>
<P>
   When the Rangers won the cup in 1994, they had won it twice in
55 seasons. At that rate, it will be 2048 before the Rangers win it
again. All you Ranger fans should live so long.
</P>
<P>
   But your attitude toward the Devils is typical. When the
Islanders won four consecutive Stanley Cup championships from 1980
to 1983, all you Ranger fans pretended that the Islanders didn't
exist.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the Islanders do hardly exist, even with new owners,
but stop pretending that the Devils don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   If the Devils win the cup again, they will have already
accomplished what the Knicks have done in more than half a century
and what the Mets have done in nearly 40 years: win two
championships. They will have as many Stanley Cup titles as the
Giants have Super Bowl trophies, and one more championship than the
Jets have had in 40 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   You and too many others don't seem to realize that the Devils
should be easy to appreciate because they possess what so few
franchises in any of the four major sports possess anymore _
throwback class and charm.
</P>
<P>
   The owner, John McMullen, is not a corporate honcho fronting for
the stockholders. He put up his own money to purchase the Colorado
Rockies nearly two decades ago and move the franchise to where he
lives, New Jersey. And he seldom blows up or sputters.
</P>
<P>
   The 82-year-old McMullen has said he now has remorse over having
sold the club to the YankeeNets organization for delivery in July,
but if the Devils win the cup, his name will be engraved on it
again, not the name of George Steinbrenner or Lewis Katz.
</P>
<P>
   McMullen has been a rarity, a club owner his players not only
respect but also cherish. Lou Lamoriello is a rarity, too, a
general manager the players respect and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the players both cherish and fear the coach even
though Larry Robinson's defining moment occurred when he yelled
loudly at them after they fell behind the Philadelphia Flyers, 3-1,
in the Eastern Conference finals. Even before they rallied with
three straight victories, the players agreed that they deserved to
be chewed out.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, hockey players are like that. As a group, they are
the most honest and the most humble of professional athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's the calmly conscientious Canadian culture that
surrounded the upbringing of many NHL players, but the
multimillion-dollar contracts haven't spoiled them. Or changed
them. With too many players in too many other sports, more money
often means more nonsense. But as a group, hockey players are
pretty solid citizens.
</P>
<P>
   If Scott Stevens and Martin Brodeur, the rocks upon which the
Devils have been built, were on the Rangers, there would be statues
of both outside Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   If Ken Daneyko, the bearded and burly defenseman who has played
in every playoff game in Devils' history, were on the Rangers, he
would be a folk hero in the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patrik Elias-Jason Arnott-Petr Sykora line was on the
Rangers, it would already be compared to the Rod Gilbert-Jean
Ratelle-Vic Hadfield line of three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   What the Rangers need is what the Devils have: the warriors
Bobby Holik, Randy McKay, Claude Lemieux, Scott Neidermayer and Jay
Pandolfo; the Russian artistes Sergei Brylin, Alexander Mogilny,
Vladimir Malakhov and Sergei Nemchinov (the only ex-Ranger); and
the mature rookies: John Madden, Scott Gomez, Brian Rafalski and
Colin White.
</P>
<P>
   Put them all together and the Devils are within a winning goal
of another Stanley Cup celebration.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Devils skate around the ice with the Stanley Cup
Thursday night (or Saturday night or Monday night), all you Ranger
fans should break down and applaud. You can just say the Devils
made you do it.

   Movie promoters, especially in the
fun-at-the-cost-of-any-brain-cells summer season, like to tell you
that their picture is ``a ride.'' It's their favorite description,
one they hope will attract thrill-seekers of all ages and cognitive
limitations. After all, who doesn't like a roller coaster,
especially one with minimal chance of causing nausea or damaged
vertebrae?
</P>
<P>
   While anything heralded as such a ride is rarely a cause for
critical celebration, there are, obviously, certain movies that
should be nothing but.
</P>
<P>
   Movies like ``Gone in 60 Seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   So how come this potential Lamborghini of ride movies stalls at
every turn?
</P>
<P>
   Astonishingly, the, um, brain trust behind this slick, expensive
remake of H.B. Halicki's down-and-dirty, 1974 redneck romp decided
that stealing cool cars and spectacularly wrecking them wasn't what
this movie should really be about. They figured it should be about
the characters and relationships of guys who steal cars. Bad idea
going in, even worse in execution when you consider that characters
and relationships are pretty much the last options anyone goes to
movies produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and scripted by Scott
Rosenberg (``Armageddon,'' ``Con Air'') for.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, motives and connections here are dramatically
rudimentary at best. But we're still forced to spend extensive time
idling over the drivel before the movie finally gets down to its
big, 50-car heist climax _ which, by the stretch, powers too little
excitement, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Cage is legendary auto thief Memphis Raines, now happily
retired from the mean streets of Long Beach and running a kiddie
go-kart track. But Raines' dopey little brother, Kip (Giovanni
Ribisi), wants to follow in his notorious sibling's tire tracks.
Kip's Porsche theft for a ruthless English crime boss (Christopher
Eccleston) brings down the heat (Delroy Lindo is quite good as an
ever-frustrated, tough-but-decent detective). The upshot: either
Memphis comes out of retirement and delivers 50 luxury models in
one night, or the bad Brit sends Kip to the steel compactor.
</P>
<P>
   There's a good deal of time spent convincing the equally
straight members of Memphis' old gang to re-up for the cause.
Grandfatherly mentor Otto (Robert Duvall) is happy with his legit
customizing business. Mem's ex-squeeze Sway (Angelina Jolie, given
little more to do than strut around in waistlength platinum
dreadlocks) has a two-track career _ mechanic and dive bartender _
she does not wish to jeopardize. The Sphinx (English soccer star
Vinnie Jones, who made a great screen debut in last year's ``Lock,
Stock and Two Smoking Barrels''), still doesn't speak.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't take long for these old pros and several more to
team up with Kip's younger, rasher crew. There are half a dozen of
these kids, too, which should give you some indication of just how
superficially they're all defined. There simply is not enough time
to give so many characters their due, even in a film that's so
inexplicably more talk than action.
</P>
<P>
   The director is Dominic Sena. He made his name doing music
videos in the early '90s, has made his living with award-winning
commercials since, and directed one interesting, noirish road
thriller with Brad Pitt and David Duchovny, ``Kalifornia,'' some
years ago. Sena knows how to make well-painted rolled steel look
its best (not hard), throws in some clever if not breathtaking
stunt driving (required some wit) and stages the big chase decently
enough (but where's William Friedkin the few times these days when
you actually need him?).
</P>
<P>
   Mainly, though, Sena lets his actors walk around too much. What
about the title ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' was so hard to understand? &QL;

ALABAMA JUDGE WHO CHAMPIONS TEN COMMANDMENTS WINS GOP PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN SACK   
 2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  ATLANTA _ Despite being vastly outspent, Judge Roy S. Moore, the
Alabama jurist made famous for his defense of the Ten Commandments,
won a convincing victory in Tuesday's Republican primary for chief
justice of the Alabama Supreme Court.
  ``Of course we give our first recognition to God,'' Moore said in
an interview Wednesday. ``He has providence over us and his will is
something that can't be thwarted.''
  Moore, who sits on the Etowah County Circuit Court in Gadsden,
Ala., ran against three Republican opponents, all well-respected
judges. One, Associate Justice Harold See of the state Supreme
Court, was the consensus favorite of Alabama's business leaders and
raised more than $1.1 million for the race, four times as much as
Moore did.
  Yet Moore won 55 percent of the vote, surprising many political
analysts by easily avoiding a runoff. See finished second, with 30
percent, followed by Judge Pam Baschab of the state Court of
Criminal Appeals, with 8 percent, and Judge Wayne Thorn of the
Jefferson County Circuit Court in Birmingham, Ala., with 7 percent.
  Moore, 53, will now face Judge Sharon Yates, a Democrat who sits
on the state Court of Civil Appeals, in the general election in
November. Yates had no opposition in her party's primary.
  Polls taken only days before Tuesday's primary suggested that
Moore and See were in a tight race and would probably find
themselves in a runoff. But with little interest by voters in other
races on the ballot, including two meaningless presidential
primaries, turnout was low across the state. The poor turnout
apparently benefited Moore, whose Christian conservative supporters
showed their commitment by getting to the polls.
  It was the second significant victory for the religious right in
Alabama in less than a year. In October, Christian conservatives
mobilized to defeat a referendum that would have permitted a state
lottery in Alabama.
  Moore received national attention three years ago when he defied
another judge's order that he remove a handmade wooden tablet of
the Ten Commandments that he had hung behind his bench. He also
continued to invite Alabama pastors to begin court sessions with a
prayer, again despite a judge's order to stop. The rulings came in
response to a lawsuit against Moore filed by the American Civil
Liberties Union.
  Ever since then, Moore has been an icon of the Christian
conservative movement, praised at rallies across Alabama and
invited to speak around the country. He makes it clear in his talks
that he believes that God's law, as revealed in the Bible, is the
source of man's law and that Christian principles form the
foundation of American government and jurisprudence. He said
Wednesday that if he wins he will take his Ten Commandments plaque
with him to the Supreme Court, though he does not know whether he
will hang it in his chambers or behind the court's bench.
  Moore's victory places Alabama's traditionally Republican business
leaders in a bind. They are likely to find Yates difficult to
embrace, but may also fear that Alabama will again be portrayed as
a backwater should Moore become the chief justice. In the 1998
gubernatorial election, many business leaders opposed the incumbent
Republican, Fob James Jr., because he had emphasized conservative
stands on social issues, particularly school prayer, to the
detriment of the state's industrial recruitment efforts. James won
the primary but lost the general election.
  Bill O'Connor, president of the Business Council of Alabama, said
his members would have to re-evaluate the race in light of See's
defeat. ``Our concern is simply that we help to elect judges who
follow the law and don't make the law from the bench,'' he said.
  Wayne Flynt, a historian at Auburn University in Auburn, Ala.,
predicted that the general election would be a tight race, and that
the primary showed that Yates would have to be tread carefully in
challenging Moore. ``She can't make fun of him,'' he said. ``She
has to talk about her respect for the Ten Commandments and how she
can understand why people might want to have them on courtroom
walls, but that there are other issues. If she makes him a martyr,
he'll win by a landslide.''

   JamCam 3.0 and Jam-It For Pictures and Sound
</P>
<P>
   As every parent finds out, children will abandon even the most
elaborate and expensive toys to play with one of the following: an
old camera, a tape recorder and the box the elaborate and expensive
toy came in.
</P>
<P>
   KB Gear Interactive has heeded the tastes of children with this
year's crop of Jam products. JamCam 3.0 is the new version of the
company's down-market digital camera. The original JamCam, released
in 1998, was a popular alternative for people who did not want to
spend a lot of money. It also appealed to those users (children and
artists) who did not mind its low-tech feel and uneven results.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution on the new $99 JamCam 3.0 is the same as previous
models, 640-by-480 pixels, but the company says software
enhancements have helped picture quality. The new version also has
a built-in flash, a self-timer and a slot for up to 64 megabytes of
expandable memory.
</P>
<P>
   What the JamCam is to pictures, the Jam-It, billed as an
inexpensive ``digital sound studio,'' is to sound. The Jam-It ($49)
can record up to four minutes of sounds or voices. Once the Jam-It
is attached to a PC through the microphone jack, the sounds can be
downloaded in Jam-It software, manipulated and converted into sound
files that can be sent as attachments to e-mail messages,
incorporated into digital images, speeded up, slowed down or
synchronized with one of 15 preloaded rhythm tracks. KB Gear has
also introduced a new MP3 player that is called the JamP3 and sells
for less than $100. It has 16 megabytes of onboard memory but an
expandable memory slot that can hold a 64MB card. Like the new
JamCam, the Jam-It comes in metallic blue or silver. All three will
be available in August.
</P>
<P>
   HOLD THE PHONE _ A new survey suggests that e-mail users tend to
make fewer long-distance phone calls, but that doesn't mean that
they are ready to abandon the telephone altogether. The study,
published in the journal Communication Research, found that almost
half of the 309 Columbus, Ohio, residents surveyed had used
long-distance less after they began using personal e-mail, although
they were not asked how much less. But the respondents still rated
the telephone very high for socializing and as a way to express
emotion, while e-mail was favored when there was a scheduling
conflict or when a phone call would otherwise have to be made to a
different time zone.
</P>
<P>
   A Gallery of Glimpses Of the Martian Surface
</P>
<P>
   Mars spacecraft have gotten a lot of bad press in the last year
or so, but the Mars Global Surveyor has been a good Boy Scout since
it was launched in 1996 (and like a good Boy Scout, it even helped
in the search for one of the spacecraft that was lost).
</P>
<P>
   Part of Global Surveyor's job is to obtain images of the Martian
surface using a special camera operated by Malin Space Science
Systems under contract to NASA. A gallery of images _ more than
27,000 of them _ is available at the contractor's site,
www.msss.com/moc(underscore)gallery/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   The images include high-resolution shots of specific surface
elements, regional views of larger-scale features and wide-angle
strips covering thousands of miles that show weather patterns.
</P>
<P>
   The high-resolution images tend to be the most interesting, and
potentially the most useful to Internet millionaires planning their
next real estate purchase _ a ranchette, perhaps, in the foothills
of Olympus Mons.
</P>
<P>
   Human Touch Still Important in College Search, Poll Finds
</P>
<P>
   Most college-bound students have access to the Internet and use
it voraciously to help them decide what schools to apply to, but
they still consider human contact most important in the process,
according to a survey that will be released next week.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by Art &AMP; Science Group polled 500 high school seniors
who intended to apply to four-year colleges and found that 94
percent of the students had Web access, a leap from 30 percent
among students polled four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also showed that the use of computers and the Web for
the college application process did not differ greatly between
white students and minority students, although the study did not
differentiate between blacks, Asian-Americans or other ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single respondent said he did not have access to a
computer anytime he wanted one, whether at home or school, said
Richard A. Hesel, publisher of Art &AMP; Science, which is sponsored by
Embark.com, an online applications company. When students were
asked how they gathered information, 48 percent said from guidance
counselors and 37 percent said from Web sites, while others
mentioned friends, books or parents. When asked what was most
influential in deciding where to enroll, campus visits was first,
followed by parents and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Find Old Books on the Web, Then Prepare to Pay the Price
</P>
<P>
   The Web has made it easier to track down used books, but not
without a price, according to a study by two Ohio University
professors.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 189 booksellers who listed their products with the
Advanced Book Exchange found that 34 percent charged higher prices
to customers arriving on the Web instead of through the front door.
``Everyone assumes when you go online, the prices will be
cheaper,'' said one of the researchers, Phyllis Bernt, a professor
of communication systems management. ``But by having access to a
world of buyers, the used-book seller is in a much better pricing
position for items that are unique.'' She did the study with her
husband, Joseph, an associate professor of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary according to the type of book, the study found.
Low-end books, like recent mass market romance paperbacks, are all
but unavailable on the Web because postage costs generally exceed
their value, Phyllis Bernt said. The prices of books that are
desirable but commonly available have either remained stable or
fallen because of Web sales, the Bernts found. But there has been a
big impact on books that are hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   A small minority of respondents, 1.7 percent, said they believed
that the Web had raised prices for used books by as much as 200
percent. ``I suspect it will become increasingly difficult to find
books at what we now regard as reasonable prices,'' Joseph Bernt
said. &QL;

WHAT IS `PIMPS' SELLING?
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything you didn't want to know about the world's oldest
management position is on display in the regrettable documentary
``American Pimp.''
</P>
<P>
   The talented twin filmmakers Allen and Albert Hughes (``Menace
II Society,'' ``Dead Presidents'') spent two years gathering
bad-looking video interviews with masters of that mysterious trade.
They clearly wanted to examine the myth of the black urban pimp on
its practitioners' own terms, evidently hoping that the resulting
work would expose the racist and class hypocrisy that's
automatically levelled against what are, after all, some of the
most aggressive capitalists the American system has produced.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hughes' brothers made the fatal mistake of giving these
yahoos way too much rope. Amusing and charismatic as many of them
are (no doubt crucial job skills), the pimps, to a man, ooze such
virulent, unadulterated contempt for the women they exploit that
any arguments for their behavior are buried in raging slime.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not offended by the fact that these guys sell sex for
a living, you are because they're so selfish and disdainful of
everybody who's not like them. And that's a lot of people.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Hugheses somehow admire their subjects or not is
open to question. Obviously, they've tried to make a serious
inquiry here, though they do have fun with juxtaposing real
players' insights against the romanticized macks '70s
blaxploitation films lionized.
</P>
<P>
   But by not really presenting counter-opinions in the movie _ a
couple of working girls discuss their managers in broad terms, and
the rapper Too Short, well, rhapsodizes about the life he makes his
living memorializing in song _ the Hugheses appear to endorse their
loquacious entrepreneurs' self-serving views.
</P>
<P>
   Disheartening as the overall atmosphere of ``American Pimp'' may
be, it also, quite expectedly, offers much to laugh at _ if you can
stay in the mood to do so. Vulgarity in Cadillacs and eyewear has
never been presented in so concentrated a form. One retired
businessman takes us to his proud mother's apartment, where photos
of himself with such diverse luminaries as Marion Barry, Al Green
and Donald Trump are displayed. They hold conventions and give one
another trophies. And there's a lot of tasteful jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   Every one of these guys, who go by names such as Rosebudd, Charm
and Payroll, has at least one interesting anecdote to share. We
also learn that pimps have their sensitive sides, since most of
them agree that they feel bad whenever a girl of theirs gets
murdered. Sterling insights are of the `That Hugh Hefner? He's just
a pimp, too' variety.
</P>
<P>
   Funny stuff. Except for all the barely contained, unexamined
hatred, that is. &QL;

THEY FLY THROUGH THE AIR IN 3-D

<TEXT>
<P>
   The world of Cirque du Soleil is so immense that it takes a 3-D
IMAX movie to capture the magic at its best.
</P>
<P>
   The French-Canadian art circus made up of dozens of companies
performing in shows around the world has yet to find its place
within the celluloid realm. Performance recordings pale in
comparison to the live experience, and the troupe's one narrative
foray, last year's ``Alegria,'' proved that style can't always
overcome a shortage of substance.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the three-dimensional, larger-than-life IMAX film
format solves the feeling of disconnection while a simple
morality-based story line _ stay in touch with the child within, a
common Cirque theme _ told with pantomime and narration (by the
great Ian McKellen) prevents the possibility of flimsy
characterization spoiling the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a terrific introduction for anyone unfamiliar with
Cirque, and a delightful adventure for its die-hard fans. Made up
of recognizable pieces from almost every Cirque period, ``Journey''
begins in an undersea world of colorful swimmers performing in
perfect harmony and then travels to multiple landscapes signifying
the various stages of life.
</P>
<P>
   Bungee jumpers bounce in a lush forest, a dancer spins a giant
metallic cube atop a rocky desert plain and nimble acrobats perform
seemingly impossible airborne routines over the marble floor of an
ornate hall.
</P>
<P>
   The film strikes a nice balance with its 3-D, avoiding the usual
in-your-face gimmicks while still offering dazzling visuals. But
it's the patented Cirque blend of beautiful costumes, amazing
artistry and acrobatic prowess, all to the dreamy, addictive
melodies of composer Benoit Jutras, that elevates ``Journey'' into
a dizzying, often emotional experience.
</P>

BIG BOARD IN TALKS ON GLOBAL EQUITY LINKS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Stock Exchange is discussing the
creation of a single global equity market with a half-dozen other
major exchanges from Tokyo to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed round-the-clock global market would electronically
connect the trading systems of the individual markets, the Big
Board said in a statement Wednesday. Although the details of how
the new market would work have not been decided, it has the
potential to provide investors worldwide with one-stop access to
exchanges that list companies with a total market capitalization of
$20 trillion _ 60 percent of the total value of stock markets
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   About half of that valuation is on the New York exchange. In
addition to the Tokyo and Toronto exchanges, the potential partners
mentioned in the release Wednesday are exchanges in Hong Kong,
Brazil, Australia and Mexico plus Euronext, the combination of the
Paris, Amsterdam and Brussels markets.
</P>
<P>
   But the announcement appears to leave the Big Board still
trailing the Nasdaq stock market, its fierce competitor, in the
race to set up a true worldwide equity market. The winner will have
a giant advantage in listing new companies, offering them the
chance to reach investors worldwide through a single market and to
gain access to the deepest possible pool of capital.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers, the parent of
Nasdaq, has already announced joint ventures to build markets
bearing the Nasdaq name in Japan and Europe. Nasdaq Japan will
begin trading later this month in a handful of stocks and expects
to grow by a dozen stocks or more each month, a Nasdaq official
said. With that, the Nasdaq will leap forward in its plans to offer
a single, worldwide exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Wednesday's Big Board announcement amounts to
little more than an agreement to discuss ways that the different
national exchanges might link up. The Big Board appeared to rule
out a merger of the exchanges in its announcement, which explained
the idea of a global equity market, or GEM. ``Investors will be
able to access GEM through their domestic stock exchanges, which
will keep the exchanges' brand and individual standing while
creating a single global pool of liquidity,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Because Big Board officials confirmed over the last several
months that they had been in discussions with several of the
exchanges mentioned in the announcement Wednesday, the timing of
the announcement puzzled some competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's talk at this point,'' said the Nasdaq official, who
insisted on anonymity. ``Well, we talked for a while, but now we're
actually building, and they're under pressure to respond.''
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel Sullivan, chairman of the Toronto Stock Exchange,
said the announcement was significant. ``By making an announcement,
it shows that the participating exchanges are committed to this,''
he said. ``It puts the pressure on the exchanges to be serious,
because no one wants to walk away and say we failed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board said it would make no further announcements unless
a preliminary agreement was reached.

IT'S NOT `CUCKOO'

By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are two obvious reasons to watch ``Girl, Interrupted'' _
Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder. While Jolie had the splashier role
in this story based on writer Susanna Kaysen's account of her
two-year stay at a mental hospital in the late 1960s, Ryder's
performance as Susanna simmers.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to dismiss this film _ as some have _ as just a
variation on ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' but ``Girl,''
which is new to video, isn't about who's really insane _ the
inmates or the keepers or the whole system. What seems to be
overlooked in the rush to make ``Cuckoo's Nest'' comparisons is
that the film is called ``Girl, Interrupted.'' It is not so much a
condemnation of our mental institutions (actually, the hospital
staff in the film is portrayed as being fairly sensitive) as it is
about the confining social and psychological states that have been
placed on women for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Susanna isn't crazy. She's an upper-middle-class white girl from
New England who just graduated from high school and doesn't know
what she wants to do with her life.
</P>
<P>
   One night, Susanna consumes a bottle of aspirin and a bottle of
vodka. ``My hands have no bones,'' she observes. Her family panics
and sends her to a psychiatrist who diagnoses her as having a
borderline personality disorder. They then convince her to commit
herself to Claymoore, an upscale psychiatric institution.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to forget that well into the 1900s there were some
states in which a wife could be institutionalized simply on her
husband's say-so. Even in 1967, when this film begins, women's
liberation was just beginning to take hold in many parts of
America. Would Susanna's parents have been so quick to stick her in
an institution had she been a boy?
</P>
<P>
   The girls that Susanna encounters at Claymoore are, as expected,
worse off. There's Polly (Elisabeth Moss), who's been scarred by
self-inflicted burns; Daisy (Brittany Murphy), with a weird eating
disorder; Georgina (Clea Duvall), a pathological liar who adores Oz
books; and Lisa (Jolie), an engaging sociopath whose cool exterior
masks her traumas.
</P>
<P>
   There's a scene where the girls break into a doctor's office
late at night and read their psychological profiles, which doesn't
tell them anything they don't already know. And once we get to know
the girls and their situations, the film doesn't really show us
anything we haven't guessed.
</P>
<P>
   We know that Susanna _ with the help of a nurse played by Whoopi
Goldberg (``You are a lazy, self-indulgent little girl who is
driving yourself crazy'') _ will make it out, but the story is
ultimately more melodramatic than insightful. It's not that
director James Mangold has made a bad film. He has made a decent
one and should be commended for avoiding too much sentimentality,
but in the end it was perhaps too polite.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Ryder's performance as Susanna is first-rate as
she moves from her confused state to one of self-awareness, and
that is what will keep you watching.
</P>
<P>
   Ryder also starred in the 1994 film ``Little Women,'' which was
recently released as a special-edition DVD. Louisa May Alcott's
19th-century novel, as told by director Gillian Armstrong and
writer Robin Swicord, also looks at the plight of women. It's the
story of the four March sisters, who, along with their mother
(Susan Sarandon), must cope with the absence of their father, who
is off fighting in the Civil war. Ryder plays Jo, the literary
sister, with the most outspoken views. Armstrong (``My Brilliant
Career,'' ``Oscar and Lucinda'') has found a way to make the story
relevant for today while keeping all of its charms. Once again,
Ryder is luminous. It is Jo, with her strengths and doubts, who is
at the heart of this excellent film. &QL; 
--- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, Interrupted'' (Sony) is priced for rental at $106.99 on
VHS. The DVD is $24.95 and includes commentary by director Mangold,
a making-of documentary and deleted scenes with Mangold's
commentary. The ``Little Women _ Collector's Edition'' (Sony) DVD
is $27.95 and includes commentary by director Armstrong, Ryder and
producer Denise DiNovi, a making-of documentary and deleted scenes
with Armstrong's commentary. &QL;

<P>
   ``They are trying to steal our land.'' Such is the accusation
made by a gang of usurpers against Fiji's Indian community in
general and the deposed Indian-led government, whose ministers it
now holds hostage, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   By one of the bitter ironies of the age of migration, the
insistence of the gang's leader, the failed businessman George
Speight, on the basic cultural importance of land is very easy for
people of Indian origin to grasp. However, he gives the land what
might be called racial characteristics, plainly assuming that it
is, in its very nature, ethnically Fijian _ and so tips over into
bigotry and folly.
</P>
<P>
   Land, home, belonging: to Indians these words have always felt
more than ordinarily potent. India is a continent of deeply rooted
peoples. Indians don't just own the ground beneath their feet; it
owns them, too. An orthodox Hindu tradition goes so far as to warn
that anyone who crosses the ``black water'' _ the ocean _ instantly
loses caste. The so-called Indian diaspora, which has taken Indian
communities and their descendants from their overpopulous country
across the world in every direction and as far as, well, Fiji, is
therefore the most improbable of phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the journeying of Indians all over the planet is one of the
great sagas of our time, an epic replete with misadventures. Idi
Amin's vicious expulsion of the Ugandan Asians, the tensions
between the black and Indian populations of Trinidad and South
Africa, ``Paki-bashing'' in Britain, the tough treatment of Indian
workers in Gulf states, and now Fiji: it's tempting to conclude
that the world has it in for these hard-working migrants and
descendants of migrants, that their single-minded dedication to
bettering their families' lot somehow comes across as
reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, many Indians speak almost shamefacedly of
their lack of racially motivated trouble; not being the target of
American racism, they have been until recently almost invisible as
a community.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been triumphs, too. With each generation, Indians
and the descendants of Indians have become more fully a part of
Britain without losing their distinctive identity; while in
America, the enormous success in Silicon Valley of Indian whiz kids
has got people's attention and earned their admiration.
</P>
<P>
   In Fiji itself, the century-old Indian presence has been a
success story. Indians have built the sugar industry that is the
country's main resource; and, as the ethnic Fijian opposition to
the Speight coup demonstrates, relations between the communities
are by no means as bad as the rebels make out. In the Fijian
Parliament, the government of Mahendra Chaudhry was supported by 58
out of 71 members; 12 out of 18 members of the sacked cabinet were
ethnic Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Even among Speight's hostages, 14 of the 31 prisoners are ethnic
Fijians. Thus the Chaudhry government was in no sense a sectarian
government of Indians lording it over Fijians. It was a genuine
cultural mixture. Since its deposition, however, the Speight
rebels, abetted by the craven Great Council of Chiefs and by the
martial law regime of Commodore Bainimarama, have dragged Fiji back
toward its racially intolerant past.
</P>
<P>
   Under all this nonsense, the fundamentals of the land question
have been thoroughly obscured. The truth is that after 100 years,
Fiji's Indians have every right to think of themselves as being,
and to be treated as being, fully as Fijian as ethnic Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing Indians from owning land was and is a great
injustice: though most of the land on the main island of Viti Levu
is controlled by Indians, they hold it on 99-year leases, many of
which are coming up for renewal, with Fijians retaining ownership.
The Speight idea of taking over the sugar farms as the leases
expire compounds the injustice.
</P>
<P>
   British Indians have fought to be recognized as British;
Uganda's Indians were grievously wronged when Idi Amin threw them
out as foreigners. Migrant peoples do not remain visitors forever.
In the end, their new land owns them as once their old land did,
and they have a right to own it in their turn.
</P>
<P>
   We don't want Fijians fighting Fijians _ our common enemy is the
Indians, Speight says, but the unintended consequence of his stand
is that his brand of ethnic cleansing is leading Fijians and
Indians in western Fiji, the most prosperous part of the country,
with most of the sugar cane operations, some gold mines and the
best tourist resorts, to make common cause against him. Secession
is being seriously discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The choice facing Fiji's remarkably inept political class may
therefore soon become a stark one: abandon the fundamentally racist
notion that your land is ethnically tied to one racial group, or
lose the best of that land to those who find your bigotry, and your
weakness, impossible to bear. &QL;

MONEY WELL SPENT

<P>
   In politics, as in life, money talks, and that makes Jon Corzine
positively eloquent. To acquire New Jersey's Democratic nomination
for the Senate, the former Wall Street whiz spent a record $32
million, give or take, but who's counting?
</P>
<P>
   Many have lamented this spending; a seat in Congress, they say,
should not be bought. But was Corzine wrong to spend his millions?
No, and here's why.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's be honest about what kind of candidate he
represents: the vanity candidate, a man or woman for whom prominent
political office is the next world to conquer. Such candidates
require two ingredients: a belief in their ability to tackle any
challenge, a quality that is never in short supply, and cash. Table
stakes in a big state are already $25 million; by next election
cycle this might well double.
</P>
<P>
   If you are not willing to spend that money, you are wasting not
only your time, but your supporters' time. There have been wealthy
candidates who romantically believed that good ideas, good
intentions and good will would elect them. But a
multimillion-dollar ad campaign does the job a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   I've worked for wealthy candidates like Bernadette Castro, who
was the Republican nominee for Senate in New York in 1994. If she
had spent her own money freely, as she had originally suggested,
then she could have actually posed a challenge to Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who was a three-term incumbent in an anti-incumbent kind
of year. As it was, Castro spent meagerly and won 42 percent of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Having the nerve to spend a personal fortune is not unfair to
other candidates. Yes, Jon Corzine is a political neophyte, while
his opponent, Jim Florio, was a former governor. But Corzine was
right when he pointed out that Florio, in public life for 20 years,
had cumulatively spent the equivalent of $35 million in boosting
his image, and that had helped him as a Senate candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Florio, who was 30 points ahead of Corzine a few months ago, was
the one who started the race with the advantage of name
recognition. Florio's problem was not that New Jerseyans did not
know him, but that they knew him too well. Corzine spent his money,
letting voters know they had a choice. What's wrong with that?
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's wealth probably did drive other possible primary
opponents out. But that's a function of today's Darwinian politics.
Never before has celebrity mattered more than issues and party
loyalty. (See Hillary Rodham Clinton, New York.)
</P>
<P>
   An unknown without money has a real uphill, indeed nearly
implausible, battle in both raising funds and gaining name
recognition. An unknown with money can buy a certain celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, money is no guarantee that you'll win anything. In
1994, Michael Huffington, a Republican, spent $28 million to try to
win a California Senate seat, only to lose to Dianne Feinstein. In
1998, Al Checchi spent $38 million in a race for the Democratic
nomination for governor of California and lost to a career
politician, Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   And for every candidate who has lost a seat and a small fortune,
there are examples of candidates who spent a lot of money and went
on to serve honorably. In 1982, Frank Lautenberg, a wealthy
businessman with no political experience, spent millions of dollars
of his own money to win the New Jersey Senate seat Corzine is now
seeking. Although his politics are not my cup of tea, he has served
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   As people pay more attention to the general election, we don't
know how Corzine will do. But one thing is for sure: He must
continue to spend his own money, despite his statements that he
would spend less.
</P>
<P>
   So long as he is prepared to spend, Jon Corzine has a chance at
a Senate seat. And at this point, he has a duty to his party to
spend the money.
</P>
<P>

   OTTAWA _ With the success of CBS' new series, ``Survivor,'' we
can expect the other networks to play catch-up with copycat
versions like these:
</P>
<P>
   BIG APPLE SURVIVOR (Fox)
</P>
<P>
   Two eight-member teams of Midwestern tourists are dropped off in
Bensonhurst with nothing but the clothes on their backs. Over the
next 39 days, relying on their wits, they compete to see which
player will be first to reach Midtown and claim the million-dollar
prize. Every three nights, the teams are pitted in competitions
like ticket scalping and taxi hailing in hopes of winning precious
prizes like subway tokens. The losing team must vote to remove a
member, who is left in the new Times Square to wander alone.
</P>
<P>
   SILICON VALLEY SURVIVOR (ABC)
</P>
<P>
   Ten technophobes, deposited in Silicon Valley, use their
rudimentary skills to see who will be first to contact family and
be taken home. Watch as they tackle coinless pay phones, cashless
supermarkets and Palm Pilot banking. Each week, the survivors are
given a new device, like an e-mail pager or Global Positioning
System receiver, with just an instruction manual to guide them.
</P>
<P>
   WHITE HOUSE SURVIVOR (NBC)
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen males and one female are split into teams, the Democrats
and the Republicans. Using only their natural gifts to raise soft
money, each team slowly narrows itself down to one presidential
candidate. The two finalists compete in a late fall 900-number
telephone contest for a four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   E.U. SURVIVOR (CNN)
</P>
<P>
   Each week, representatives of the 15 states of the European
Union compete to see which will emerge as the economic ruler of
Europe. Contestants can artificially inflate or deflate their
currencies to undermine the euro. Smaller countries can band
together to reinstate tariff barriers. The show will end when
Germany wins.
</P>
<P>
   SOLAR SYSTEM SURVIVOR (PBS)
</P>
<P>
   Nine planets, nine orbits. Watch as each planet tries to avoid
the effects of climatic change, deteriorating orbits and random
asteroids. See who survives into the next millennium and who ends
up as a sunspot.

   In London, British Airways PLC, Europe's largest airline, and
the Netherlands-based carrier, KLM Royal Dutch NV, acknowledged
they had entered into merger negotiations. Across the Atlantic, AMR
Corp., the parent of American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines held
preliminary merger discussions earlier this week, according to two
people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between AMR and Delta followed an overture by AMR to
Northwest Airlines. Those discussions in turn were sparked by the
acquisition of US Airways by UAL Corp., the parent of United
Airlines, for $4.3 billion, a deal that would create by far the
world's largest airline. That poses a direct threat to American and
Delta, the second and third-largest carriers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are increasingly keen to merge in order to expand their
networks and pare costs. UAL has said that buying US Airways, the
largest carrier on the East Cost, will fill a large hole in its
route network, making it more attractive to corporate customers and
to its airline partners in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent the shares of all four airlines in the latest
reported pairings up Wednesday. KLM shares surged 8.5 percent to
30.1 euros or $28.29, and have risen 45 percent since rumors that
it might be purchased began to swirl weeks ago. British Airways
shares rose 1.3 percent to 390 pence or about $5.85. Delta shares
rose 3.2 percent or $1.625 to $52.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange, and AMR shares rose 12.5 cents to $28.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reaction to the talks in the stock market, it is
notoriously difficult to combine airlines smoothly. British Airways
and KLM tried once before, in 1992, but the deal foundered over
price. Yet even if the two managements can agree on price and
management control, the powerful role played by labor unions often
make mergers more trouble than they are worth. In addition, there
is a real chance that regulators would block such large deals.
</P>
<P>
   Both British Airways and KLM dominate their respective home
markets and have little room to expand. They have also been hurt by
competition that has eroded their profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   A British Airways-KLM would create the world's fourth largest
airline with $19.5 billion in sales. It would have hubs outside of
London serving trans-Atlantic and long haul flights to Asia as well
as a hub outside Amsterdam that could serve connecting flights and
intra-Europe routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a necessity for consolidation to take place,'' said
Andrew Light, an aviation analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
London. He said a deal is especially important for KLM, which broke
off its alliance with Alitalia of Italy in April. ``It gives them a
lifeline,'' he said. ``They are desperately in a need of a
partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Both British Airways and KLM cautioned that the talks were ``at
a preliminary stage.'' Executives close to the negotiations who
spoke on condition of anonymity said that it would take
considerable time to negotiate any deal. The executives said price
has not been significantly discussed yet. But on the assumption
that a deal would be structured as a British Airways purchase of
KLM, analysts estimate KLM's price could exceed $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   KLM has a strong alliance with Northwest Airlines in which the
two carriers have merged their trans-Atlantic operations. British
Airways has an alliance with AMR. Those were among the reasons many
analysts believe an AMR merger with Northwest makes the most sense.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the initial talks between the two carriers
said Northwest sought a premium price, which gave AMR pause. The
talks between AMR and Delta, which took place in New York on Monday
and were reported by The Wall Street Journal, were also described
as very preliminary. Present at the meeting were Edward West and
Tom Horton, the chief financial officers of AMR and Delta, along
with lawyers and investment bankers from Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
representing Delta, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter representing
AMR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people walked away from it with the conclusion: Here
are some things we need to think about,'' said one person close to
the discussions. It was not clear when the two sides would meet
again.
</P>
<P>
   A merger would bring together Delta's strong European and East
Coast routes with American's dominance of Latin America and its
access to London's Heathrow airport. But the two carriers together
would control nearly 40 percent of the domestic market, and they
overlap heavily in the South and Soutwest. In addition, neither has
a strong network in Asia, which is a jewel in Northwest's crown.
</P>
<P>
   That is why most analysts believe AMR and Northwest make a
better fit, while Delta and Continental Airlines are considered
more suitable partners.
</P>
<P>
   But as all the recent activity proves, nothing is ruled out.
Some analysts and airline executives believe that the talks
involving AMR were publicized at such an early stage to try to
scuttle the UAL-US Airways deal by alarming antitrust regulators in
Washington. They may also have been intended to send a message to
Northwest that it may be passed over if it does not lower its
asking price.

RESERVED JOY IN SILICON VALLEY OVER THE DECISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ While few in Silicon Valley were disappointed
with Microsoft Corp.'s comeuppance Wednesday, no one was popping
champagne bottles to celebrate a post-Microsoft world either.
</P>
<P>
   That's because no one expects Microsoft to go away in the wake
of the federal court order to split the company in two, an order
that Microsoft will vigorously appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In the technology capital of Silicon Valley, the company's vast
influence on broad technology sectors makes for a complicated
relationship. Many companies here have business agreements with
Microsoft, but their executives privately grouse about the
company's heavy-handed approach.
</P>
<P>
   The quandary was best summed up by an executive at a large
company in the Valley who declined to be named: ``There are areas
where we compete with Microsoft, and there are areas where we
cooperate with them, so it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Intel Corp., the Santa Clara chipmaker seen as a close ally
of Microsoft, tried to project a neutral stance Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judgment issued could potentially represent structural
changes at Microsoft, and that in turn could result in a
significant change for the industry,'' said Chuck Mulloy, an Intel
spokesman. ``We're confident that if it does, the industry will
find a way to adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who don't have ties with Microsoft are conflicted
by the prospects of government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their business practice is clearly one of intimidation,
especially in light of how they treated smaller companies,'' said
Walter G. Kortschak, managing general partner of Summit Partners, a
venture capital firm in Palo Alto, Calif. ``On the other hand, I
just wish there could have been another remedy that would be less
intrusive. Having the government come in and altering the
structural landscape of the industry is a little scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Randy Komisar, an advisor to startups in the Valley and a
veteran entrepreneur, explains it this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``People in Silicon Valley think this is the last bastion of
libertarianism, where the myth of the cowboy in his Stetson hat
still exists. They're saying `We don't need no stinkin'
government.' At the same time, we know Microsoft has done bad
things. (Government prosecutor) Joe Klein got the right verdict.
The problem is coming up with the right remedy, and I'm not
convinced that breaking up the company will make much of a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Komisar had his own suggestion: ``Send Gates to live in St.
Helena, where they exiled Napoleon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideology aside, self-interest also factors into the Valley's
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people here think something needs to be done to curb
Microsoft's power over the computer industry,'' said Linley
Gwennap, analyst with the Linley Group in Mountain View, Calif.
``On the other hand, there are companies here with very large
market shares who are worried they might be next in line'' to bear
the antitrust scrutiny of the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Silicon Valley is ambiguous about the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good!'' said Pamela Samuelson, a professor at the University
of California at Berkeley law school. ``The pattern of
anti-competitive behavior at Microsoft is so much part of their
culture that I am convinced a structural remedy is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good when the bad guys get caught and justice
prevails, and that's what happened here,'' said Mitchell Kertzman,
chief executive of Liberate Technologies in San Carlos. ``It's not
going to make life easy for us to compete with them. We'll still
have to execute, as will they. But this will help level the playing
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Lockyear, attorney general of California, a state that is
party to the Department of Justice lawsuit against Microsoft,
Wednesday said the company's anti-government comments in response
to the breakup ruling were ``disingenous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that the Microsoft leadership still doesn't get it,''
Lockyear said in a press conference. ``You can't abuse that
monopoloy position by injuring consumers and competitors in the way
Microsoft did.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, most here in Silicon Valley expect
Microsoft to remain a force in the industry, for better or for
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the dust settles,'' said Scott Kriens, chief executive of
Juniper Networks, a Mountain View maker of Internet routers,
``Microsoft will still be a great company _ or companies.''

TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say this for ``Catfish in Black Bean Sauce'': In telling the
story of an African-American couple and their adopted Vietnamese
children, the movie puts the spotlight on two minority groups that
rarely get their due in movies. And writer-director-star Chi Muoi
Lo must believe that this could be his only chance to speak his
mind. He packs so much plot into this wildly uneven film that he
could well have made three movies for all storylines he has crammed
into this single entry.
</P>
<P>
   Would that he had told just one. ``Catfish'' is best when
concentrating on Harold and Dolores Williams (Paul Winfield and
Mary Alice, both excellent) and how their lives are affected when
their adopted children, Mai (Lauren Tom) and Dwayne
(writer-director Lo) are reunited with their birth mother, Thanh
(Kieu Chinh). But there are a lot of added (and unnecessary)
subplots mixed in with this cross-cultural stew, resulting in a
jumbled movie that sabotages its own good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Mai has always had issues with her adopted mother, Dolores, so
when Thanh re-enters her life, she's initially overjoyed. Dwayne,
however, is apathetic, having embraced the African-American ways of
his new parents, right down to his language, which is straight out
of Compton. The insecure Dwayne is engaged to a beautiful young
African American, Nina (Sanaa Lathan), but constantly undermines
their relationship because he feels she's going to dump him
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne's new mother, Thanh, isn't thrilled about her Vietnamese
son dating an African-American woman. Nor is she sure what to make
of Dwayne's roommate, Michael (Tyler Christopher), and his
relationship with a transvestite. Dwayne's uncertain about
Michael's relationship, too, as is the audience, since it seems to
belong in an entirely different movie.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the main problem with ``Catfish.'' Lo undercuts his
story at every turn with broad slapstick about transvestites,
talking cats and elderly men protesting ATM fees. The movie has its
share of warm, with funny and touching moments, but it's also
frequently screeching, ridiculous and heavy-handed. Lo isn't
exactly a master of subtlety, either, as an actor or a filmmaker.
His movie will certainly resonate at times with its cinematically
underrepresented audiences, but for others, ``Catfish'' will be a
less-than-satisfying offering. &QL; 
- The film: `` Catfish in Black Bean Sauce'' (PG-13; adult
situations, themes). &QL; 
- The stars: Paul Winfield, Mary Alice, Lauren Tom, Chi Muoi Lo. &QL;

THIS IS A CAR WRECK OF A MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Film critic Gene Siskel had a frequent complaint about remakes:
Why do filmmakers always redo good films, rather than bad or
mediocre ones? If action-movie producer Jerry Bruckheimer were the
type of guy who listened to critics, Siskel's lament could have
been the inspiration for ``Gone in 60 Seconds,'' a remake of an
obscure 1974 B-movie that has achieved cult status because it
smashes more than 90 cars and concludes with a 40-minute chase.
</P>
<P>
   These are elements that could send the mayhem-mad Bruckheimer _
the man responsible for ``Con Air'' and ``Armageddon'' _ into
ecstatic convulsions. You can almost imagine him saying, drool
barely in check, ``You mean there's a movie we could remake and
improve and still get to break stuff?'' And yes, it's true: The
original ``Gone,'' which looks like it was made for less money than
the change on Bruckheimer's dresser top, has a plot so
unintelligible that even Bruckheimer, along with his stable of
lowest-common-denominator screenwriters and excess-obsessed,
music-video-trained directors, couldn't help but do a better job.
</P>
<P>
   And they do, sorta. First of all, there's a plot _ kinda _ which
pretty much goes like this: Legendary car thief comes out of
retirement when his kid brother gets into trouble; legendary car
thief has to steal 50 boss cars in four days to save his kid
brother's life. For some reason, the bad guys let the kid brother
go, and nobody simply high-tails it out of town. But, of course, if
you're looking for logic in a Bruckheimer movie, you've come to the
wrong place.
</P>
<P>
   What you should be looking for is loud action and
testosterone-laced humor mixed with moments of sensitivity _ call
it the heavy-metal-concert school of filmmaking, as exemplified
this time by Dominic Sena, director of the much-reviled
``Kalifornia'' and about a million commercials and videos (OK, not
a million, but if they can get excessive, so can I). On a certain
level, Sena delivers, with editing so fast that it's a wonder the
title wasn't changed to ``Gone in 15 Seconds.'' But darn it, he's
too slow to, as they say, cut to the chase. Either he or writer
Scott Rosenberg actually thought some exposition was necessary, and
that keeps the movie in second gear for too long.
</P>
<P>
   Few things are more irritating than a dumb movie that isn't dumb
enough, and ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' isn't dumb enough. It would be
easiest to enjoy it if your brain power was gone in 60 seconds, but
unlike the original, it has some expensive actors in it, and it has
to do something with them. So it wastes time setting a plot into
motion as a mysterious person contacts Nicolas Cage, kinda like a
mysterious person contacted Tom Cruise in ``M:I-2.'' And Cage has
to round up a crew of specialists ... kinda like Tom Cruise did in
``M:I-2.'' Come to think of it, Cage spends a lot of time wearing
shades and has interesting hair, kinda like ... well, you get the
idea. Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people Cage rounds up are Angelina Jolie, who plays
the requisite ex who still carries a torch for the, um, hero, and
Robert Duvall, who plays the requisite older-but-wiser buddy (yes,
they have character names, but that hardly matters). The movie's
publicity material makes much of having three Academy Award winners
in its cast, but except for Cage _ who shifts from neutral
(sincerity) to overdrive (fast-talking con man) _ they have little
to do. Jolie, whose lines consist mainly of ``C'mon, c'mon!'' and
``Go, go, go!,'' is particularly wasted, although she gives her
character enough winks and lip-smacks to make her at least a little
intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth's'' Christopher Eccleston plays the suavely oily bad
guy, and Delroy Lindo and Timothy Olyphant play a pair of
persistent, bantering cops. Throw in the motley crew of supporting
actors in Cage's posse, and you have so many characters that
Rosenberg struggles to give them all something to say, and his
screenplay turns more into a series of car-theft sketches than a
script.
</P>
<P>
   The actors aren't the stars here, anyway. Nor are the beautiful,
expensive cars that make up the thieves' prey. No, it's the film
editors and sound-effects specialists who rev up the car chases and
put all the bangs and vrooms and screeches into the right places.
The movie pays tribute to the original with ``Eleanor,'' a 1967
Mustang GT that is a sort of Holy Grail for Cage's character (in
the original, ``Eleanor'' received top billing). Eleanor figures
into the climactic chase, and in a rare moment of restraint from
the Bruckheimer gang, it doesn't go on as long as the chase in the
original ``Gone.'' It does go on for a while, though, and it's
followed by an even more climactic fistfight. Kind of like in
``M:I-2.'' Um, which movie were they remaking?
</P>
<P>
   ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' is rated PG-13 for crashes, smashes,
bangs, clangs, screeches, rrrrrrs, strong language uttered by
humans, and nudity and sexual situations. &QL;

<P>
   NALGHAM, Afghanistan _ Most often, drought is a mere annoyance
to the Kuchis of the Registan Desert, for these nomads can find
water where others cannot. They herd their sheep and camels over
great distances, resettling in an oasis. Or they dig wells by hand,
divining an aquifer and burrowing into the hidden moistness as deep
as 50 yards down.
</P>
<P>
   But rainfall has been a rare visitor to Afghanistan for three
years running, and even the best of the desert dwellers have been
humbled. The Kuchis of the Registan have fled north only to find
that the snow-melt from the mountains has failed to refresh the
rivers below. Their customary refuges have become a broken thread
of narrow, vanishing ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20,000 of them can now be found in places like Nalgham in
the parched Arghandab Valley, a spot ordinarily lush with grapes,
apricots and pomegranates. They pitch their tents in depleted
pastures, where they watch the last of their livestock die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allah has taken away all my sheep, but this is not what
worries me,'' said Sado Khan, a tribal elder red-eyed with misery.
``We pray now he doesn't take our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Regions of India and Pakistan are also suffering from the
momentous drought, with millions of people facing severe water
shortages. But these nations _ poor as they are _ have functioning
governments and coordinated relief efforts. Most of Afghanistan is
ruled by the Taliban, a militia preoccupied with completing its
conquest of the country and enforcing a puritanical interpretation
of Islam. Only fragments of a government exist.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the nation's wheat crop lost, with shallow wells
going dry in the cities, with only bleached bones to show for
thousands of head of livestock, the Taliban have appealed to the
world for help. In turn, United Nations aid agencies have asked
donors for $67.8 million in emergency money, but money for
Afghanistan has been hard to muster in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is certainly not the flavor of the month,'' said
Erick de Mul, who coordinates humanitarian programs in Afghanistan
for the United Nations. ``The Taliban are not especially liked or
appreciated by the international community. And that's quite a
problem because Afghanistan has tough times ahead. Food is now an
issue. Water is scarcer and scarcer. There are alarming reports all
over, about rivers going down or drying up.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one years of unremitting war had already left this a
country of demolished cities, torn-up roads and hungry people. The
drought is a visitation of yet another plague, and the Taliban, in
their own fashion, have tried to deal with it. They have twice
declared a national holiday, beseeching the faithful to pray for
rain. Last year, rain came. But this year, three days of focused
worship extracted nothing from the grudging skies.
</P>
<P>
   Other means have also been tried. The militia sent trucks and
helicopters into the Registan, evacuating hundreds of families in
an expensive operation. But the Taliban have no food to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought us here, but what are we here for?'' Khan, a
hawk-nosed man in a white turban, asked despondently. ``Once, we
owned hundreds of animals, but now we have only this one sheep and
two goats.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the skinny survivors of what was once a herd. One
of the sheep had a purple cloth draped over its back, where much of
its wool had fallen out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our animals died of hunger, and now our way of life will die
too,'' Khan said. ``Either someone must help us or they should just
make a big fire and throw us in.''
</P>
<P>
   The temperature on this recent afternoon in the valley was 119,
a springtime omen of the scorching summer to come. Khan's clan _
perhaps 30 people in all _ had five tents spread out near a spent
river. Many of the men sat down together to speak of their
troubles. Their hearty camels, tied up nearby, brayed beneath the
punishing sun.
</P>
<P>
   A young woman in a colorful tunic entered slowly, someone
helping her walk. Her stomach was bloated, and she complained of
``a pain like no other pain.'' She held a 3-month-old child wrapped
in a blanket. His body was frighteningly shriveled, and the family
had seemed to accept the inevitability that both the woman and the
baby were soon to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no milk for my baby,'' the woman said. ``I have no
strength for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Jan, one of the younger men present, said he knew about
such hard dying. He had lost his infant son a few weeks back while
the family was yet in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no water,'' he said. ``The boy just shrank away.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the drought, such mortality had become one of the
saddest parts of Afghanistan's long run of tragedy. More than one
in four children die before age 5, according to United Nations
estimates. That mortality rate is the worst in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of rain has surely hastened death's pace. Relief
workers tell of recent deaths, but it is hard to say whether the
drought was the cause or merely a contributing affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Afghans went to war _ first against the Soviets and
then against each other _ it has been hard to estimate the nation's
population with so many fleeing, so many killed. Calculations vary
from 18 million to 24 million.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 10 percent of these people are the nomads known
countrywide as Kuchis. Of these wanderers, the Kuchis of the
Registan are among the most isolated. Some are even unaware that
the Taliban have taken command of 80 to 90 percent of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In most years, the arid summer would cause many of these nomads
to move to the fringes north of the desert, where water was
abundant and the pastures green. They would sell part of their
herds, careful to keep the best of the animals as breeding stock.
Other Kuchis would stay deeper in the desert, digging their wells
with camels hauling up the fill.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ayub once had 250 animals. He brought them to the
Arghandab Valley, but instead of a broad waterway, he found a river
of rocks. He now has 90 sheep left, their bones showing through
their thick puffs of hair. No one will buy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have left these animals to fate, and ourselves too,'' Ayub
said. ``If it rains, we will go back to the desert. If not, we will
just stay here and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   But no rain is expected until November, with the days ahead
likely to bring not only more heat but furnace-hot winds that
torment the afternoons with dust storms.

NALGHAM, Afghanistan: dust storms.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aid workers are hurriedly trying to survey the needs of the
Kuchis, a task made more difficult because the nomads live spread
out in small encampments. At the same time, plans must be made for
city-dwelling Afghans, whose shallow wells are rapidly going dry.
</P>
<P>
   In Kandahar, the southern city that is the Taliban's base, more
than 90 percent of the people are dependent on such wells, said
Leslie Oqvist, the local coordinator for the United Nations.
Frightened people are drilling deeper, but that is sapping the
aquifer. Nearby, farmers trying to save their orchards are using
water that will soon be needed for drinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get ahead of what's going to be a very
serious crisis,'' said M. Fayyaz Shah, who heads the World Food
Program's office in Kandahar. ``This country's rain-fed wheat crop
has been destroyed; so has more than half of the irrigated crop.''
</P>
<P>
   Shah, a Pakistani with a deep affection for the Afghan people,
dourly shook his head. ``I don't know if I should say this, but
this country is cursed, year after year, 20 years of war, one thing
after another.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, as aid workers from the United Nations are
feeding about one million Afghans each day, the member countries of
the same organization _ at Washington's urging _ have imposed
economic sanctions, banning all flights to and from the country and
freezing the government's assets that are held abroad. They demand
that the Taliban discontinue their hospitality to Osama bin Laden,
the Saudi exile accused of terrorism. Yet more sanctions are
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world's humanitarian assistance is tied to the whims and
grudges that certain governments have against us,'' said Mullah
Muhammad Hassan, the governor of Kandahar Province and one of the
Taliban's most influential figures.
</P>
<P>
   He is a stout man, once a storied battlefield commander. Like
many of the Taliban's leaders, he is missing a limb and ambles
about on his one good leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aid shouldn't be tied to politics,'' he said. ``Are you
willing to help the Afghan people pure and simple _ or only if they
satisfy your political objectives?''
</P>
<P>
   That complaint overlooks the humanitarian aid _ however
insufficient _ that is already coming to the country. The United
States is the largest donor.
</P>
<P>
   But many Afghans, whether in battle-scarred government buildings
or heavily mined farm lands _ believe America ought to be paying a
larger debt of gratitude. After all, Afghanistan's mujahedeen
rebels defeated the Soviets, helping to remove the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both fought for a common cause, so I don't understand how
the United States can turn its back on us,'' said Khaliq Dad, who
owns a small restaurant in Kandahar. ``Americans may not like how
we treat our women, but we are a conservative Muslim country.
Doesn't President Clinton believe in freedom of religion?''
</P>
<P>
   But those were the relatively sophisticated questions of an
educated man, someone boastful of his several visits to New York
years ago. Talk of geopolitics does not roll off the dry tongues of
the Kuchis.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Qudir sat with the few remnants of his flock of sheep
under the green canvas of his tent. A dust storm had begun to twist
its way through the openness. His children had wandered away, and
he had grown concerned. Finally, they came back, holding a small
basket of grass, a bounty accumulated after hours of collection.
</P>
<P>
   A little boy felt he needed to explain his chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must save the young sheep,'' he said.

<P>
   You know the state of father-son films has become pretty
desperate when a ludicrous serial killer drama like ``Frequency''
can bring tears to grown men's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the engaging documentary ``Pop &AMP; Me'' feels like a
breath a fresh air. The winner of the Audience Award at the 1999
Los Angeles Independent Film Festival, ``Pop &AMP; Me'' celebrates the
ties that bind fathers and sons together, and it manages to earn
its tears and smiles without resorting to any cheap gimmicks. It's
a beautiful film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop &AMP; Me'' was borne from mid-life crisis. Richard Roe, a
hard-charging former stockbroker, lost his job, his marriage and
his parents in the span of a couple of years. He hit on the idea of
a six-month trip around the world with his son, Chris, an aspiring
filmmaker who would capture their travels with his camera. Chris
had his reservations _ he liked the idea of spending time with his
father, but wondered whether the length of the trip and the fact
that Richard was funding it would cause friction between them.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out it did, which gives ``Pop &AMP; Me'' a ``Real World''
kind of intrigue that takes on a ``Survivor'' tone as the trip
wears on. Chris longs for his father's respect and wonders why
Richard listens to his other two sons (who are seen at different
points in the journey), but never seems to pay attention to him.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Pop &AMP; Me'' is much more than a family soap opera.
Throughout their travels, the Roes interview various father-and-son
duos, sometimes resulting in feelings being shared for the first
time. These aren't Oprah-style confessionals, though, just honest
emotions being expressed by men who aren't accustomed to such
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights: A South African father who gave up
drinking, winning his son's admiration in the process, and a
Vietnamese son who speaks of the value of having his frail,
78-year-old father live with him. The Roes also bump into Julian
Lennon, who candidly admits that he doesn't have much respect for
his famous father.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave more love to the world than he did to me,'' Lennon
says.
</P>
<P>
   The Roes never do achieve any kind of closure themselves, which
is perfect given that reality is rarely tied up into a neat
Hollywood kind of package. But they certainly valued the time they
spent together, and you will, too. And you needn't wait until
Father's Day to see it, either. &QL; 
--- &QL; 
- The film: ``Pop &AMP; Me'' (Film has not yet been rated). &QL; 
- Behind the scenes: Directed by Chris Roe. &QL; 
- Running time: One hour, 31 minutes. &QL;

ANALYSIS: MICROSOFT NOW PINS ITS HOPES ON APPEALS PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST; the text of the government's breakup
plan and other documents issued previously in the Microsoft case
may be found at The New York Times on the Web: www.nytimes.com) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his final order on Wednesday in the Microsoft antitrust
case, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said ``yes'' to the government
one more time. He has agreed with the government, almost without
qualification, on the facts of the case, on the law and now on the
harsh remedy of splitting the company in two.
</P>
<P>
   In Jackson's federal district court, the result has been not
just a defeat for Microsoft but a rout, not a closely fought legal
contest but a judicial ratification of the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the two-year-old case is far from over. And with a year or
two of appeals ahead, the chances of Microsoft ever being broken up
are uncertain. Microsoft will try to reverse every element in
Jackson's ruling that the big software maker is a monopoly that has
repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws, stifling
competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The odds against Microsoft winning outright on appeal are
extremely high, according to antitrust experts. But they say that
there are legally vulnerable points in the judge's ruling that, if
reversed on appeal, might well enable the company to avoid the
drastic sanction Jackson has now endorsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is going to try to whittle away at the judge's
ruling on appeal,'' said Andrew I. Gavil, professor at the Howard
University law school. ``And once you get an incremental erosion of
the case, you erode the power of the argument for a breakup as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   In his order on Wednesday, Jackson acknowledged that the federal
appeals court or the Supreme Court, or both, might disagree with
some of his work. Two weeks ago, he surprised both sides in the
case and most legal experts when he abruptly ended the court
proceedings without a further round of hearings on the government's
plan to split Microsoft in two and require a series of curbs on its
business conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In his order, Jackson explained that he had moved quickly
because, if his findings or legal conclusions are overruled on
appeal, a higher court might decide on its own remedies or send the
case back to his court. After noting that Microsoft contends it
will be ``vindicated on appeal,'' he wrote, ``The Court is well
aware that there is a substantial body of public opinion, some of
it rational, that holds to a similar view. It is time to put that
assertion to the test.''
</P>
<P>
   So Jackson chose this approach as a way to speed along a case of
national economic importance. The alternative, he decided, would be
to risk going through two time-consuming sets of hearings on
remedies _ one based on his legal ruling and one based on a case
perhaps scaled back on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some antitrust experts say that simply accepting the
remedies plan from the Justice Department and states suing
Microsoft could prove to be a mistake. ``If he's assuming that this
case is probably coming back to him anyway, I think that is a safe
assumption,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University law school. ``But the danger of his approach
is that it increases the chances it will come back to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's prime target on appeal, antitrust experts say, will
be the judge's ruling that the company illegally tied its Internet
browser to its monopoly product, the Windows operating system,
which handles the basic operations on 85 percent of all personal
computers.
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft, the tying charge is the heart of the case. If that
ruling is upheld on appeal, Microsoft believes it threatens its
corporate way of life _ its ability to add new software features to
its operating system, as it has repeatedly over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In several rounds of settlement talks with the government,
Microsoft was willing to change some of its practices, but it stood
firm on not letting there be any tampering with Windows or letting
personal computer makers pick and choose from an ala carte menu of
Windows features.
</P>
<P>
   To Microsoft, this stance is not arrogance or hubris _ or an
antitrust violation, for that matter _ but a stand of principle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case, in our view, is about whether we are free to
improve our products and whether we can protect the integrity of
our most important product, Windows,'' said William Neukom, senior
vice president and general counsel of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In its defense, Microsoft has argued that Web browsing software
should not be considered as a separate product but as a feature in
the ever-evolving Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The government alleged, and Jackson ruled, that Microsoft
illegally tied its Internet browser, a separate product, to Windows
to thwart competition and illegally protect its monopoly. To accept
Microsoft's argument, the government said, would be amount to
granting the dominant software maker an exemption from broad swaths
of the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   But antitrust experts note that product-tying charges are
tricky, especially when dealing with software, where the products
are rendered in the 1's and 0's of programming code and product
boundaries often blur. And a federal appeals court in June 1998
sided with Microsoft in a separate but related case. That court
said Microsoft had the right to fold a browser into its operating
system as long as it could make a ``plausible claim'' of consumer
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tying charge, Microsoft, antitrust experts
say, stands a good chance of getting a reversal on the court's
finding that Microsoft made an illegal offer to Netscape
Communications to divide the browser market between them. The
collusion offer, Jackson ruled, was made during a meeting between
executives of Microsoft and Netscape, the commercial pioneer in
Internet browsers, in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The legal hurdle in attempted collusion cases, antitrust experts
say, is fairly high. The key case, they say, was in 1984 involving
airline executives talking about jointly raising fares in a
conversation that was tape recorded. Whether the meeting notes,
e-mail and conflicting witness testimony about what occurred at the
Microsoft-Netscape meeting is evidence that reaches the standard of
``clearly unequivocal,'' established in the 1984 case, is open to
question, according to antitrust experts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also expected to argue on appeal that so much of
the rest of the case - mainly contracts and practices that the
court found to be a ``pattern of anticompetitive behavior'' - is
merely evidence of a company competing aggressively in a dynamic
industry, not of an economic outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this ruling is very vulnerable on appeal,'' said
Neukom. ``We're in the middle innings of a contest that won't be
over for another year or two. And the most critical innings are yet
to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet antitrust experts say that the steepest uphill climb for
Microsoft on appeal will be to overturn Jackson's determination
that the company engaged in an array of illegal acts to protect its
monopoly, wielding its market power like a club to bully industry
partners and rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole gestalt that is a real problem for Microsoft -
the court's finding that these are bad guys, who repeatedly acted
to stifle competition and not for any efficiency reasons,'' said
Richard Steuer, an antitrust specialist and a partner at Kaye
Scholer Fierman Hays &AMP; Handler in New York. ``That is a lot harder
for an appeals court to overturn.''

 &HT;    Escape plan gone awry halts plan for new life
 &HT;    By Jill Taylor and Pat Moore
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ All they had to do was get to Okeechobee's Budget
Inn. Waiting there were hair color, barbering tools, fresh clothes
and two train tickets from Jacksonville to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   They planned to start a new life together and blend into the Big
Apple, far from the double rows of razor wire encircling the Martin
Treatment Center.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven Whitsett and Clifford Burkhart, captured Tuesday
after a bold attempt to flee the center the day before in a tiny
helicopter, needed a lot of things to go right to see their scheme
materialize.
</P>
<P>
   Their luck ran out shortly after Burkhart, a novice helicopter
pilot, picked up his longtime friend in the fenced yard of the
center 10 miles north of Indiantown Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to fly a few miles to a remote area near some
railroad tracks where a Chevrolet van sat waiting. Then they would
speed west on a rural highway to spend the night in the Okeechobee
motel.
</P>
<P>
   But Burkhart and Whitsett, a sex offender detained at the center
under the Jimmy Ryce Act, barely made it outside the fence before
the helicopter crashed Monday, prompting a massive manhunt that
ended with their dramatic capture at gunpoint 25 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once (the helicopter) went down, their plan was kind of shot
and they had to improvise,'' said Florida Department of Law
Enforcement Agent Richard Piccininni.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsett, 28, was charged with escape and Burkhart, 23, was
charged with aiding an escape. Both were being held at the Martin
County jail without bail Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of their capture on the banks of the C-23 Canal east
of Interstate 95, both men carried loaded 9mm handguns and had
carried extra clips of ammunition _ although Whitsett lost his
spare magazine in the woods during the chase.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County sheriff's Lt. Ron Cucchiara jumped from a hovering
helicopter to confront the armed men as they waded in the canal
Tuesday afternoon. He fired two warning shots into the water about
a foot to the side of each man when they refused to get out of the
water and drop their guns.
</P>
<P>
   They finally obeyed Cucchiara's commands, and later told
Piccininni they never intended to shoot it out with deputies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they didn't want to hurt anybody,'' Piccininni said.
``(Burkhart) said the guns were for if they failed (in the escape)
they would shoot themselves. . . . But I don't know about that. You
don't need extra magazines (of ammunition) to shoot yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators initially wondered if the two had help in carrying
out the escape plan. They theorized Burkhart could not park the van
he rented by the side of the road in Martin and get back to his
home in Hollywood without help.
</P>
<P>
   But Burkhart told them he drove the van north, put a sign in the
window saying it was broken down and tried to get a taxi to take
him home. When no cab company would drive out to the remote spot to
pick him up, he called friends until he found one who would do him
the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they do not believe the friend knew anything
about the escape plot.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart, who works as a waiter and reportedly has a computer
business on the side, told investigators he maxed out his credit
cards to pay for the helicopter and van rentals, the train tickets
and the other escape preparations.
</P>
<P>
   He had the Okeechobee hotel key in his pocket and $10,098 in
cash, which he and Whitsett planned to use for starting their new
life.
</P>
<P>
   During their first court appearances Wednesday, Martin County
Judge David Harper did not set any bail and the two men made no
comments.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State Attorney Robert Belanger said he intends to
prosecute both men on enhanced first-degree felony charges,
punishable by up to 30 years in prison, because firearms were used
during the escape.
</P>
<P>
   The judge appointed the public defender's office to represent
Burkhart. Whitsett signed paperwork refusing a public defense
attorney ``at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Public Defender John Hetherington said he questions
whether the escape and aiding escape charges will withstand legal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to punish them as criminals under a civil
statute,'' Hetherington said, referring to the Jimmy Ryce Act,
which keeps sex offenders incarcerated in a treatment facility once
their prison sentences expire if experts determine they are likely
to commit additional crimes if released into society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be trying to say they are entitled to equal protection
as anyone else charged under civil laws such as Baker Act (for
psychological commitments) or Marchman Act (for substance abuse
commitments),'' Hetherington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone held under (those acts) who walks away from a
treatment center cannot be charged with escape,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hetherington said appeals courts will likely be sorting out the
issues in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all brand new,'' he said of the escape charges called for
in the Jimmy Ryce Act that was enacted in Jan. 1, 1999. ``Not to my
knowledge has this happened in any other state that has these
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Belanger said legislators who passed the law specifically stated
that anyone escaping from a Jimmy Ryce treatment center could be
prosecuted on a criminal escape charge.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Olds,the attorney representing Whitsett in his challenge
to the Jimmy Ryce commitment, called his client's escape a
``setback'' in his effort to get Whitsett freed.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsett completed 4 1/2 years of an eight-year prison sentence
in September stemming from a sexual assault on a 15-year-old boy at
a psychiatric treatment center in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislators intended this law to keep the `worst of the worst'
from society. . . . When we look at (Whitsett's) case, he never
harmed a soul and he did all his prison time.''
</P>
<P>
   Burkhart has no criminal history. He has been close to Whitsett
for about eight years, according to Whitsett's sister, Carenann,
32, who attended her brother's first court appearance.
</P>
<P>
   She lifted her sunglasses for a moment when her brother appeared
on the closed circuit television screen dressed in the orange
high-risk inmate jail uniform, and wondered aloud about the bandage
on his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Piccininni later said the injury was a minor scrape suffered in
the helicopter crash, and that other than being thirsty, tired and
hungry, the fugitives were in pretty good shape when caught.
</P>
<P>
   Carenann Whitsett said she has attended many of her brother's
court hearings and while she does not approve of his homosexuality,
she loves and supports him.
</P>
<P>
   She lashed out at some of the media coverage in which Burkhart's
mother seemed to blame the escape plan primarily on her brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother did not go out and get a helicopter. He did not go
out and get guns. He did not go out and get money. . . . They are
both responsible,'' she said.

NORMAN INCHES CLOSER TO FRENCH OPEN TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It was the final Wednesday at the French Open. Magnus
Norman and Marat Safin were on center court, playing a
high-velocity, high-reward game of ``Can you top this?'' in the
men's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   They scrapped and lunged and shouted into the sky at the tennis
fates. Safin, only 20, smashed rackets to the clay in frustration,
as the shots that had been working so well for the past six weeks
consistently misfired.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I was nervous,'' he said afterward. ``First time
in a quarterfinal, big chance to get in semis and unfortunately you
start to think about all these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman, as he closed out his impressive, grown-up 6-4, 6-3, 4-6,
7-5 victory, was certainly doing some thinking of his own as he
chased down Safin's increasingly desperate bolts, pumping his fists
when he succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous, just as nervous as he was,'' Norman said. ``But
I've come so far now with my tennis and played a lot of crucial
matches, so I'm getting experience now, and I know how to handle
situations like this a bit better than I might have.''
</P>
<P>
   It takes so much work to get to a Grand Slam quarterfinal. Day
after day of hitting forehands cross-court and serves to the corner
with no crowd to appreciate the incremental improvements; year
after year of minor tournaments, hard choices and budget hotels.
And even when you do make it, after all that, there is no guarantee
the public will appreciate you.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Norman. He has all the moves _ the big ground strokes,
the big serve, the proper footwork and the ability to push forward
to the net when the pressure is greatest to resolve the conflict
with a proper volley.
</P>
<P>
   He won five tournaments last year, reached his first Grand Slam
semifinal at the Australian Open last January and beat Gustavo
Kuerten to win the Italian Open last month to take the lead in the
yearlong points race. Now, he is in the semifinals at Roland
Garros, but neither his fellow Swedes nor the Parisians have taken
Norman to heart.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet at least. But it bears remembering that Mats Wilander,
Bjorn Borg and Stefan Edberg also had to build a following and a
name for themselves. Norman, a 24-year-old from Filipstad, might
not have the innate charisma of the Williams sisters or John
McEnroe or even Safin.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great guy to watch playing tennis,'' Norman said of
Safin. ``You never know what is going to happen. He can hit an ace
and the next time the racket is in two pieces. The tour needs a lot
of those players as well, not boring like me who doesn't show any
emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Norman, who is something of a hothead by Swedish standards,
is doing fine, as that wonderfully self-deprecating comment makes
clear. On Friday, he will get a chance to keep building against
Franco Squillari, an unseeded left-hander from Argentina with a
wicked inside-out forehand, who jerked Albert Costa from corner to
corner in the first quarterfinal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Squillari defeated Costa, 6-4, 6-4,2-6, 6-4, to become the first
Argentine in the semifinals at Roland Garros since Jose-Luis Clerc
and Guillermo Vilas advanced that far in 1982. Vilas belongs to the
same Buenos Aires club as Squillari, and both he and Clerc were in
the center-court stands to watch Squillari join their illustrious
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too young to watch Vilas when he was playing at the
top,'' said Squillari, who is 23. ''So I specifically watched
videos about his game, especially when he played Davis Cup in
Argentina. I also watched other left-handers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of his film favorites are Andres Gomez and Thomas Muster,
both of whom won this tournament in the 1990s. Costa, a Spaniard
who had beaten Squillari in their previous three matches, thinks
Squillari could be ready to make a highlight reel of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew his game really well, but he never played like that
before,'' Costa said. ``The style was the same, but the level was
very, very different. Sure, he can win the tournament. At this
stage anyone can win, and though the favorite is Norman, if he
plays like that, forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Squillari is one of two South Americans in the final four this
year. The other is Kuerten of Brazil, who will face Juan Carlos
Ferrero of Spain in the other semifinal Friday. &QL;

CUT TO THE CHASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   You've got the remake rights to a low-class, non-classic of the
'70s _ which, run through the calculus of modern Hollywood's summer
movie formula, equals a potential blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   But then some fool went and hired two Oscar-winning actors (and,
by the time of the remake's release, a third one) to star in what
was supposed to be a nice, brain-dead entertainment in which stolen
cars, driven irresponsibly, were supposed to be the whole show.
</P>
<P>
   How to work this? That was the dilemma that faced superproducer
Jerry Bruckheimer (``Armageddon,'' the upcoming ``Pearl Harbor'')
and director Dominic Sena when Disney handed them the assignment to
modify and turbocharge ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' for a generation of
moviegoers raised on adrenaline-fueled, technically perfect movie
mayhem. It turned out to be a very different project from junkyard
owner H.B. Halicki's self-starring, independently produced, 1974
original, which was basically a primer on auto theft climaxed by a
40-minute demolition derby of a chase.
</P>
<P>
   But Bruckheimer and his favorite screenwriter, Scott Rosenberg,
designed the remake for their ``Con Air'' star Nicolas Cage, who,
despite having re-invented himself as an action hero in the
mid-1990s, maintains the serious commitment to actual acting that
earned him an Oscar for ``Leaving Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall, an even more widely respected Oscar-winner who
occasionally does big bucks slumming in popcorn pictures like
Bruckheimer's ``Days of Thunder,'' was also a first choice.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was sizzling hot Angelina Jolie, who won a supporting
actress statuette in March. The ever-newsworthy, alarmingly
unpredictable young star made ``Gone'' before that happened, but
brought every bit of her serious actor's attitude to the project
(trust us; tattoos and white blonde dreadlocks were not what studio
suits wanted to see on what was basically a testosterone fantasy's
girlfriend role).
</P>
<P>
   Accommodations, obviously, needed to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a lot of story to [Halicki's] movie,'' says Sena,
an award-winning commercials and music video director who actually
worked a bit for the late, thrill-crazed Halicki when he first came
to Hollywood. ``If you look at it, they had 90 cars they could
afford to wreck, and the story of the movie ends when they wrecked
the 90th car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that's not going to fly today. What's the point of
having Nic Cage attached to the project if we're going to go with
wall-to-wall sheet metal? There needed to be a story, we wanted to
get a good cast, and the film wound up being about these two
brothers, coming back and doing the last thing you want to do
because you have to to save your brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The scenario that Rosenberg and some additional writers finally
hammered out had Cage as Memphis Raines, a retired Long Beach car-
boosting legend who must get back into the illegal game when his
little brother Kip (Valley-bred actor Giovanni Ribisi) blows a
major luxury vehicle delivery for a ruthless English gangster.
Memphis' impossible mission is to steal 50 costly models in one
night or lose his kin.
</P>
<P>
   Jolie and Duvall play ex-members of Memphis' gang, whom he must
press back into service for this night of all nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a car freak, and that did have a lot to do with my
decision to make the movie,'' admits Cage, who claims to have
recently pared his classics collection down to 10 (the favorite is
a '55 Jaguar D-Type). ``But, having said that, I still wanted to
know that there was something I could act. Knowing Jerry, I was
pretty confident that he would put a terrific cast together _ as he
has _ but I still wanted to know that there would be scenes where
there was some kind of dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   ``From those conversations, they built up the backstory of the
two brothers, and his needing to go back into a life of crime to,
ultimately, do good. That, to me, was interesting, because that's
not your standard, politically correct action hero. I thought the
idea of having people root for a car thief would be unique.''
</P>
<P>
   And easier said than done. Due to Cage's busy work schedule,
``Gone'' had to begin production last spring before a satisfactory
final script draft was completed. This led to almost daily
rewrites, which at times felt scarier than a 360 spinout at 130
mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be terrifying, and it can be exhilarating,'' admits
Cage, who cooked up some of his own Memphis dialogue. ``I mean, I'm
not joking; sometimes, I would have the writer and the director in
my trailer with me, going over script revisions five minutes before
I started shooting _ and I didn't know what I was going to say.
Sometimes, you felt like you were out there doing a tap dance,
trying to make it work. With that kind of high wire, you can either
find something really fresh and spontaneous that is compelling, or
you can fall on your face and look like a complete fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cast members rolled more casually with the hairpin
rewrites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'know, this script wasn't that thick to begin with,'' notes a
laughing Jolie, her jet black hair now shoulder-length and a dragon
tattoo bearing the name of her newlywed husband, Billy Bob
Thornton, on her upper left arm. ``We changed a line or two here
and there, but it's not like we were rewriting big monologues.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for all the talk about character and drama, ``Gone'' is
mainly a stripped-down drama about planning and executing the
ultimate rolling heist. For the picture, actors were taught
state-of-the-art car-stealing techniques, some by an expert Cage
and Bruckheimer had met at Folsom Prison while preparing ``Con
Air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dangerous for me to admit to, isn't it?'' Jolie chuckles.
``It's like, cars are missing, they'll go, 'Oh, her.' But yeah,
though I might want to check my notes, I think I could steal a car
now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 60 seconds I could teach you how to steal cars. Then we
could go out and be gone in, literally, 10 seconds,'' adds Ribisi,
who actually built a '69 Camaro with a 502 crate engine as part of
his research. ``Anybody can do it; it's actually quite simple. You
can get into cars with a screwdriver. Technology has probably made
it a little more difficult, but apparently there's not really a car
out there that can't be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little joke that I've been telling everybody, which
probably isn't funny anymore, is that the best sort of security
system to have on a car is just an insurance policy.''
</P>
<P>
   A nice message for a major motion picture to impart _ especially
one that often relied on the kindness of luxury car manufactures
and classics collectors for its key props.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each situation was different,'' Sena recalls. ``Porsche would
let us use their car in the opening scene only if we didn't show
them breaking in. I don't think we stole any BMWs either because
they gave them to us, but we crashed one. Other ones, we'd lease
from dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the collectors ... there was a scene where we were in a
Ferrari warehouse, where individual cars were worth millions of
dollars. I walked over to one and leaned over for an angle with my
viewfinder, and suddenly these guys were on me, going, `Sir, watch
it! If you scratch that paint job it's $27,500.00 to repaint.'''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, all that machinery looks great in the film. But
Sena is quick to caution those expecting sheer motorized fetishism
that they should expect more from his remake.
</P>
<P>
   Or less that's more, something like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rewatched the original, just to remind myself of what I'd
forgotten,'' Sena says. ``And you know what? A 40-minute car chase
is just too long. I was going out into the kitchen, getting some
chips. I'd come back and turn on the news, turn back to it and the
chase is still going on. It's pretty slow, y'know?
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't a whole bunch of car chases in this movie. One's
enough, and at 13 minutes, that's plenty, I think. The hope we had
was that you stay with the story long enough to get to the car
chase. It's not filled with action.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Jurors shown photos of victims
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Attendance at the murder trial dropped off Wednesday,
now that celebrity defendant-turned witness Ray Lewis has come and
gone from the Fulton County courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard used the day to bring the focus
back on the two men who were stabbed to death Jan. 31 on a Buckhead
street.
</P>
<P>
   Howard introduced slide after slide of grisly autopsy photos
displaying the knife wounds that killed Jacinth Baker, 21, and
Richard Lollar, 24. Howard wanted to show ``the wounds were
purposeful with intent to kill.''
</P>
<P>
   When some of the photos were displayed, sobbing relatives of the
deceased bolted out of the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   John Parker, a Fulton County medical examiner, testified Baker
suffered a severe incision where the knife was twisted when it hit
the liver. Lollar lived only 45 to 90 seconds more after a gaping
stab wound punctured his heart, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   But attorneys for the two remaining murder defendants, Reginald
Oakley, 31, of Baltimore and Joseph Sweeting, 34, of Miami, used
cross-examination to help defuse the state's witness, as they have
done repeatedly during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley's attorney, Bruce Harvey, got Parker to admit that the
type of knife recovered at the scene was most likely not involved
in killing Baker.
</P>
<P>
   A small folding knife, with no blood on it, was found at the
scene. Prosecutors are expected to contend Oakley killed Baker with
a knife identical to the one Sweeting bought the day before the
Super Bowl at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   But Parker said that was unlikely. ``In the examination of the
body, I saw nothing to say this knife caused it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey also pointed out that Baker had a .07 blood alcohol level
and was carrying a plastic bag with marijuana that included smaller
baggies of the drug apparently for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The state's last witness, who will conclude her testimony this
morning, documented with DNA analysis a trail of blood from the
crime scene to Ray Lewis' hotel room at the Georgian Terrace. Dawn
Pierce, a GBI forensics analyst, identified bloodstains belonging
to Baker inside Lewis' stretch limo, inside the Holiday Inn where
the limo stopped to change a tire flattened by gunfire and inside
Room 804 at the Georgian Terrace.
</P>
<P>
   One bloodstain taken from inside the limo was a mixture of the
blood of both Oakley and Baker, the analyst testified. The three
defendants' attorneys had presented a united front against
prosecutors until last weekend, when Lewis' team cut a deal for
their client to become a witness against his two friends.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey and Sweeting attorney Steve Sadow had a spat Wednesday in
the courtroom after Sadow asked several questions about bruises on
Baker's face. Harvey, angered that Sadow was reinforcing testimony
against Oakley, cut into Sadow's cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Sadow bent across the table to talk to Harvey, who said, ``Well,
don't get excited when I do it.''
</P>
<P>
   But during his cross-examination, Harvey never mentioned Lollar,
the man Sweeting allegedly killed.

AT&AMP;T, UNDER PRESSURE, AGREES TO PUT OFF RATE INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: 2nd Take is scheduled to move by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ AT&AMP;T gave into pressure from embarrassed federal
regulators and outraged consumer groups on Wednesday and said that
it would put off a planned rate increase that would have raised
telephone bills for tens of millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came after a flurry of calls between senior
AT&AMP;T executives and the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, William E. Kennard, who said that the nation's largest
long-distance company had broken a promise to reduce overall phone
charges under an agreement reached last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard and AT&AMP;T had promoted that agreement, under which the
FCC reduced the fees paid by long-distance carriers to local phone
companies, as a ``historic'' rate cut. But at the same time, AT&AMP;T
filed documents with the commission that said the company would
actually be raising most of the per-minute charges on the basic
accounts of millions of customers who make few calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``AT&AMP;T promised to pass on savings to all consumers,'' Kennard
said in a statement issued after his conversations with AT&AMP;T
executives, including its chairman, C. Michael Armstrong. ``Their
new rate plan does not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is in our order and I am going to enforce it,'' he said.
``AT&AMP;T promised to tell their consumers which plan would be most
cost effective for them. This was not done. I will also hold AT&AMP;T
to this commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Tristani, another FCC commissioner, issued a blistering
six-word statement. ``I was totally misled by AT&AMP;T,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Their statements were curious in light of comments on Tuesday
from other officials at the commission who said that they knew all
along that AT&AMP;T had intended to raise certain rates and that they
were not particularly troubled by it.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which handles 60 percent of the nation's residential
long-distance calls, said it had decided to defer the rate
increases in light of the FCC's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the reaction on the part of some, we want to go back and
make sure we're delivering the benefits we thought we were,'' said
James Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general counsel. ``We expect to move as
quickly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the FCC complaints to AT&AMP;T were prompted by a
report on Wednesday in The New York Times about the rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of an announcement last Wednesday by the FCC and
AT&AMP;T of an agreement that they said would cut phone costs for
millions of customers, the company filed documents wit the agency
describing plans for major rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   The new basic plan would have eliminated a $3 monthly minimum
for long-distance service but would have increased per-minute
charges every day except Sunday, the only day when rates would come
down. The biggest increase would have taken place on Saturday, when
rates would have jumped by 163 percent, from 11 cents a minute to
29 cents.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's announcement came after officials at the FCC threatened
on Wednesday to take steps to reject the rate hikes. Ordinarily,
the agency has limited authority to force telephone companies to
reduce their rates. But under the agreement announced last week
between the agency and most of the major phone companies, including
AT&AMP;T, the FCC may impose ``fines, forfeitures or the rejection of
any non-conforming rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither AT&AMP;T nor the FCC publicized the rate hikes last week
when they said that millions of telephone customers would see lower
bills as the company passed on savings from a government-ordered
reduction in the fees that long-distance companies pay to local
phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   In their announcement last week, the agency and AT&AMP;T also said
that subscribers to the basic service would benefit by the
elimination of a minimum monthly $3 fee. But the announcement never
mentioned that the flat per-minute rates would be increased Monday
through Saturday.

 LASER BUILT FOR ISRAEL SHOOTS DOWN MISSILE IN SUCCESSFUL TEST
</HEADLINE>
  By JAMES GLANZ   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An antimissile laser destroyed an armed Katyusha rocket in
flight during a test in New Mexico on Tuesday, the U.S. Army said
Wednesday. The development moves the laser a step closer to
possible deployment along Israel's border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Missile defenses based on lasers have been developed, tested and
debated for decades, but none have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
   Built by a California contractor, TRW, and the U.S. Army, the
powerful laser has been designed to defend against guerrilla rocket
attacks along Israel's northern border. The system, called the
tactical high-energy laser, is being built at a cost of about $200
million.
</P>
<P>
   At the army's White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, the laser
focused its light on the Katyusha's warhead, heating and destroying
it, about a month after a successful test against a stationary
target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test yesterday was the first attempt at achieving a
shoot-down of a rocket, and it was successful,'' said Thomas
Romesser, vice president and deputy general manager for laser
programs at TRW.
</P>
<P>
   Most missile defense systems under development have moved to a
``hit to kill'' technology, using rocket-propelled interceptors. In
the 1980s, laser-based defenses were criticized as technically
unworkable, but research continues on several antimissile lasers.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Israeli-American program to defend against
short-range missiles, there is an Air Force program in early tests
to shoot down missiles using a laser mounted on a jumbo jet, and
there is also an effort run by the Pentagon to shoot down
intercontinental ballistic missiles with lasers fired from space.
</P>
<P>
   All of those lasers are powered by chemical reactions that
generate intense light. Romesser said Tuesday's test demonstrated
that laser defenses could work. ``I think that there will be a lot
of enthusiasm to move forward with these types of weapons systems
because they really are effective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-American system consists of several modules the size
of tractor-trailers and containing radar, an optical telescope, the
laser and a command and communications center. All worked together
properly in the test, said Richard Bradshaw, director of the laser
program at the Army Space and Missile Defense Command. ``We turned
on the high-power beam and the very first time put power on the
target and it blew up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the command said that after new tests against
multiple incoming warheads, the system could be shipped to Israel
for further testing and possible deployment as early as September.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's northern border has been quiet, without rocket
launchings or guerrilla attacks, since Israel pulled out of a
military buffer zone in southern Lebanon two weeks ago.  &QL;

Our rating: 2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A century of harrowing Hungarian history is given soap opera
treatment in ``Sunshine.'' The nearly three-hour long,
sensationally superficial family saga was made in English by the
Academy Award-winning Hungarian director Istvan Szabo
(``Mephisto''), who co-wrote its unwieldy yet somehow also
claustrophobic script with the respected American playwright Israel
Horovitz. The film is not without merit, but watching it is a
chore.
</P>
<P>
   And that is a shame, since a morelucid, honestly felt epic on
this work's grand themes would have been fascinating. Pretty much
employing the whole 20th century as a canvas, Szabo addresses the
persistent nature of political oppression, the soul-risking
struggle to assimilate in an intransigently anti-Semitic society
and the heartbreaking tendency of sons to repeat their fathers'
worst mistakes. Rich material, to be sure, but not when presented
as a collection of position speeches, great events that are
referred to more often than shown and melodramatic sexual
encounters with the most inappropriate partners.
</P>
<P>
   What we're looking at is a Jewish family saga, beginning at the
point when great-great granddad Sonnenschein blew himself up along
with the shtetl still that brewed the herbal tonic which came to
bear the family name. Great grandpa Emmanuel headed to the capital
with the recipe, and by the time his own children were born, the
Taste of Sunshine bottling enterprise had become big in Budapest.
</P>
<P>
   By the turn of the century, Emmanuel's sons Ignatz (Ralph
Fiennes) and Gustave (James Frain) had grown into, respectively,
one of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's most promising jurists and a
doctor with anarchist leanings. And both young men had fallen in
love with their beautiful life-force of a cousin, Valerie (recent
Tony-winner Jennifer Ehle), whom they were raised with like a
sister.
</P>
<P>
   Ignatz changes his name to the more gentile-sounding Sors in
order to advance his career and, scandalously, marries Valerie.
Gustave gets miffed. In service to his beloved Emperor _ a pretty
liberal guy for a Hapsburg, after all _ Ignatz signs up for a
little war with Serbia. Four years later, everything's been shot to
hell.
</P>
<P>
   But, as we all know, it gets a lot worse. Succeeding generations
of Ralph Fienneses and an amazingly durable Valerie (played for the
next 50-some years by Ehle's real-life mother, Rosemary Harris),
suffer under succeeding socialist, military, fascist, Stalinist and
late Communist regimes, losing almost everyone and everything to
awful historical forces ... Yet, somehow, still managing to bed
everybody that they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   The tedious, poorly spoken film (sample dialogue: ``I want to
grow like a wildflower, where it belongs!'') has its best moments
when Ralph (Num)2, known as Adam, leads the Hungarian fencing team
to victory at the '36 Berlin Olympics (where he's actually
applauded by the Nazis whose Magyar partners will murder him in
less than a decade); and when Ralph (Num)3, this one called Ivan,
bonds with a cagey but doomed Communist functionary (William Hurt
in the film's best performance) over wreaking vengeance on war
criminals and, later, in appalled disbelief at the murderous
paranoia of their Moscow-puppeted associates.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting stuff, but not enough so to make this a rewarding
sit for any but the most devoted Ralph-watchers (and, needless to
say, if you're not a fan of the Englishman's twitchy mannerisms,
the sleding is even tougher). ``Sunshine'' feels like nothing so
much as a great opportunity missed, it's grand intentions
overshadowed by pedestrian execution. &QL;

   ATLANTA _ A federal judge's decision Wednesday to split
Microsoft into two parts is good news for Atlanta companies big and
small that compete with the world's largest software company.
</P>
<P>
   Giants like Scientific-Atlanta, as well as start-up companies
like Weema Technologies and SideTalk, believe they'll profit from
the split.
</P>
<P>
   But some local companies, especially those that partner with
Microsoft, may suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that Microsoft has already said it would appeal,
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that a two-way
split of the world's largest software firm is the best way to make
sure there is competition in the software market.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan, one company would be formed to oversee
the Windows operating system and the other would be responsible for
all other Microsoft software, such as its word processing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Two Atlanta companies _ publicly traded Scientific-Atlanta and
tiny start-up SideTalk _ hope the breakup delays Microsoft's
development of new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta produces three levels of software for cable
set-top boxes _ operating system, middleware (programs that serve
as the glue to connect two separate programs) and applications.
Microsoft is developing technology to compete in all three
categories, though it hasn't commercially released any products
yet. The technology allows for interactive television, such as
video-on-demand and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reasonable to predict that the breakup would be fairly
disruptive,'' said Steve Necessary, chief executive of PowerTV, a
subsidiary of Scientific-Atlanta that focuses on the set-top box
software. ``It is also reasonable to predict it would not
accelerate (development).''
</P>
<P>
   Because Microsoft would be split into an operating systems
company and an applications company, Young hopes its set-top box
division would also split along those lines. That way, Microsoft
would not be able to offer a comprehensive set-top box product the
way that Scientific Atlanta does.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great, inherent appeal in providing a single,
integrated solution,'' Necessary said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta's stock closed Wednesday at $65.50, up 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   SideTalk, which has technology that allows two or more people to
surf the Web together on a co-browser, hopes the breakup will
hinder Microsoft's development of a similar product. ``My guess is
that this would slow them down,'' said Chief Executive Officer
Andrew Dietz.
</P>
<P>
   Another company that hopes to benefit is Weema, a streaming
technology company that competes with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will affect us positively,'' said Marty Young, chief
executive officer. ``I think it will affect a lot of companies
positively.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the benefits go directly into Weema's cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   When Young started looking for venture capital funding last year
to get Weema off the ground, Microsoft hung over every negotiation
like a dark cloud. ``Microsoft has always been an issue,'' Young
said.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Taetle, a partner at Atlanta venture capital firm
Noro-Moseley Partners, told Young he was impressed with the
technology but concerned about a start-up's chances against a giant
like Microsoft. Though Weema managed to raise $2 million, the
Microsoft breakup likely will make it easier for Weema to get
another round of funding, according to both Young and Taetle.
</P>
<P>
   Weema built its streaming media technology _ used to display
real-time audio and video _ to run on Microsoft's Windows platform.
But Young contends that Microsoft strong-arms customers into buying
both the Windows operating systems and its applications, such as
streaming media.
</P>
<P>
   When and if Microsoft splits in two, ``at least other people can
write software on top of (Windows) without feeling threatened by
the vendor,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Atlanta companies that may benefit don't even realize it
yet, supporters of the breakup contend, saying existing companies
will expand and new companies will sprout due to the marketplace
changes.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is cheering. The breakup could hurt local
companies that partner with Microsoft, including consulting company
IntelliNet.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants at IntelliNet primarily use Microsoft products to
build solutions for clients. IntelliNet expects revenue between $16
million and $18 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Executive Frank Bell said the breakup of Microsoft could
hurt IntelliNet's bottom line. ``There will be more overhead in
maintaining relationships with two companies,'' he said. ``That
will mean higher prices for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell, who said the breakup doesn't make sense in the Internet
age, calls himself ``a believer in Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to executives who are happy and those who are angry,
there are plenty of Atlanta executives who say they just don't
care. Leaders at two companies that received strategic funding from
Microsoft _ Radiant Systems and Interland _ say they don't expect
to feel much impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our communication and interaction with Microsoft thus far has
been a continuous stream,'' said Ken Gavranovic, chief executive
officer at Web hosting company Interland, ``and we fully expect
that the ruling would not do anything to change this.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Heyman, president of Radiant Systems, said, ``In general,
we are not concerned that (a breakup) will have any material
negative effect on our relationship with Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Radiant Systems' stock closed at $17 Wednesday, up $1.25.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Morettini, a partner at Deloitte &AMP; Touche in Atlanta, said
he doubts Atlanta's technology community overall will feel much
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if Microsoft breaks up, they will still have tremendous
resources,'' he said. ``This is a non-event.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft
Corp. on Wednesday, saying the severe remedy was necessary because
Microsoft ``has proved untrustworthy in the past'' and did not
appear to accept his ruling that it had broadly violated the
nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that
Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as
it has in the past and may yet do to other markets what it has
already done'' to dominate operating systems and Internet software,
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said in his final
ruling in the long-running trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under his order, Microsoft would be broken into separate and
competing companies, one for its Windows operating system and one
for its other computer programs and Internet businesses. Microsoft
would also be forced to comply with a long list of restrictions on
its conduct that would last three years, if the breakup order
withstands appeal, and 10 years if it does not.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order stays the breakup plan, but not the other
measures, while an appeal proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The government charged, and the judge agreed, that Microsoft
used its monopoly in operating systems to put competitors at a
disadvantage and stifle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   And in surprisingly assertive language, Jackson accepted the
government's remedy proposal in its entirety, attaching it to his
ruling _ utterly rejecting Microsoft's repeated assertions that the
breakup plan was ``draconian,'' ``unwarranted'' and ``bad for
consumers, the high tech industry and our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it would take the case to the Court of Appeals,
filing the papers within a few days, while the government said it
would seek to bypass that court and ask immediate review by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, called the judge's ruling ``an
unwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the software
marketplace, a marketplace that has been an engine of economic
growth for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that someone would say that a breakup is a reasonable
thing comes as quite a surprise to us,'' Gates added. ``We have a
very strong case on appeal, and we look forward to resolving these
issues through the appeals process and putting this case behind us
once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates was in Washington on Tuesday, planning to meet with
lawmakers Wednesday. But anticipating the ruling, he canceled the
meetings and hurriedly flew back to Seattle overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, smiling broadly, said Wednesday
afternoon that the ruling ``will have a profound impact, not only
by promoting competition in the software industry, but also by
reaffirming the importance of antitrust law enforcement in the 21st
century.'' And Joel I. Klein, head of the department's antitrust
division, said, ``Microsoft itself is responsible for where things
stand today.''
</P>
<P>
   If the judge's order withstands appeal and Microsoft is
eventually broken up, it would join the ranks of only a handful of
major national monopolies that have been taken apart over the last
90 years as the result of antitrust violations, including Standard
Oil, American Tobacco and the Aluminum Co. of America.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, speaking on behalf of the 19
states that are partners with the Justice Department in the suit,
said the ruling ``sends a strong message that no company is above
the law.'' (Two of the 19 states, Illinois and Ohio, declined to
support the breakup plan.)
</P>
<P>
   While appealing the judge's verdict, Microsoft will also ask for
an immediate stay of all the remedy provisions. If the request is
rejected, Microsoft must begin complying with the restrictions on
its conduct by Sept. 7 and submit a detailed plan for dividing the
company in two by Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson's encouragement, the Justice Department announced
Wednesday evening that it would take the case directly to the
Supreme Court, under a 1974 revision to the federal antitrust laws
allowing fast-track consideration of significant antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft opposes the direct appeal to the Supreme Court,
preferring to take its case first to the Court of Appeals, which
ruled in its favor in a related lawsuit two years ago and reversed
a decision by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Supreme Court would even take the case is at best
uncertain. Microsoft argued Wednesday evening that the suit filed
by the states would not be eligible for expedited appeal because
the states have no similar law. In that case, the states' appeal
would be taken to the Court of Appeals. But state and federal
officials said the cases were joined for trial, and it would make
no sense to separate them for differing legal appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The officials acknowledged that the point of law was ambiguous.
But Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, said ``today's
victory vindicates and soundly validates our decisions as state law
enforcement officers to join this historic action.''
</P>
<P>
   If the conduct remedies were allowed to take effect, computer
manufacturers would be allowed to offer customized versions of
Windows on their computers in ways they never could before. And
future versions of Windows would be offered in a form that allows
buyers to accept certain new features Microsoft chooses to offer _
or to decide they do not want them and use a competing product.
</P>
<P>
   It was Microsoft's decision four years to tie a Web browser to
Windows that prompted the investigation and lawsuit that led to
Wednesday's breakup order.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some years from now, if the government's remedy plan works as
intended, consumers might also begin to see alternate operating
systems on sale that are competitive with Windows, as Apple
Computer's operating system is Wednesday. If that occurs, the broad
compatibility among personal computers that exists Wednesday may
begin to erode.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson issued his ruling at 4:30 Wednesday afternoon, just
after the markets had closed. His decision had been widely
expected, and investors appeared to have already taken the break up
plan into account. Microsoft stock was up 88 cents Wednesday, to
close at $70.50.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked at press conference Wednesday if he had any regrets, Gates
said: ``If I look back at anything, I think, perhaps I should have
taken the opportunity to go in person and talk about this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gates might be called as a witness was a continuing
question hanging over the antitrust trial. His halting, obdurate
performance during a videotaped deposition proved to be a powerful
tool for the government in court.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson accepted the remedy plan put together by the
federal and state governments, his endorsement was not unequivocal.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, he noted that the plan was the collective work of
senior state and federal officials ``in conjunction with multiple
consultants.'' And, ``it appears to the court to address the
principal objectives of relief in such cases, namely to terminate
the unlawful conduct, to prevent its repetition in the future and
to revive competition in the relevant markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, he added, even though several experts
have provided ``some insight as to how the provisions'' of the
remedy might work, ``for the most part they are merely the
predictions of purportedly knowledgeable people as to effects which
may or may not ensue if the proposed final judgment is entered. In
its experience, the court has found testimonial predictions of
future events generally less reliable even than testimony as to
historical fact.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft leveled serious criticism at the judge Wednesday
evening for his decision to hold no substantive hearings on the
government's remedy proposal, saying the company was surprised by
the scope of the plan and ill equipped to respond to it in the six
weeks since it was offered.
</P>
<P>
   But in his order Wednesday, Jackson retorted: ``Microsoft's
profession of surprise is not credible. From the inception of this
case Microsoft knew, from well-established Supreme Court precedents
dating from the beginning of the last century, that a mandated
divestiture was a possibility, if not a probability, in the event
of an adverse result at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government first made plain to Microsoft during
settlement negotiations a year ago that it planned to ask for a
so-called structural remedy. That was repeated during mediation
efforts by a federal judge early this year, though the government
ultimately offered terms short of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also explained why he moved through the remedy phase
so quickly, noting that he wanted to pass the case to a higher
court as soon as possible for validation, revision or rejection of
his decision, ``to abort any remedial measures before they become
irreversible as a practical matter.''
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, the judge said he could hold hearings later or
``modify the judgement as necessary in accordance with instructions
from an appellate court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson noted, with some apparent irritation, that after he
ruled April 3 that Microsoft was in wide violation of the nation's
antitrust laws, Microsoft's leaders continued to assert that ``the
company has done 'nothing wrong' and that it will be vindicated on
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is well aware,'' he added, ``that there is a
substantial body of public opinion, some of it rational, that holds
a similar view. If true then an appellate tribunal should be given
an opportunity to confirm it as promptly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's continued assertions of innocence were one reason
for his ruling, he said. Another, he added, was that ``Microsoft
has shown no disposition to voluntarily alter its business
protocols in any significant respect.''
</P>
<P>
   And a third reason, he explained, was that ``Microsoft has
proved untrustworthy in the past.'' As an example, he referred to
the precedent case he tried in the fall of 1997, when the Justice
Department charged Microsoft with illegally tying a Web browser to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction,
ordering Microsoft to separate the two products. That was the
ruling later overturned by the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Microsoft's purported compliance while it was on appeal,''
Jackson said Wednesday, ``was illusory and its explanation
disingenuous.''

BUSH CAMPAIGN IS PLANNING A LESS COMBATIVE, MORE POSITIVE
CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  By FRANK BRUNI and ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hoping to preserve and perpetuate an upbeat tone
that has served them well over the last several months, advisers to
Gov. George W. Bush say they are fashioning a party convention that
will emphasize policy over partisan vitriol and perhaps abandon the
frequent practice of devoting one night to an attack on the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   They say they want the second of the four nights, which has
often been reserved for such sniping, to adhere to a mostly
positive, sustained focus on exalting Gov. George W. Bush rather
than eviscerating Vice President Al Gore. They want every night to
underline a different set or area of Bush's substantive proposals.
</P>
<P>
   And, on a less atmospheric note, they want Gen. Colin Powell and
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., front and center, in prominent speaking
roles on different nights, so that each of them serves as a
separate lure for the fickle and finite attentions of the major
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of issues will be a primary focus at a retreat Bush
and his aides are taking starting Sunday at his parents' compound
in Kennebunkport, Maine, as the campaign increasingly turns its
attention to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   And what is most striking about their plans, at least as they
were described in interviews with several of Bush's advisers over
the last few days, is the campaign's stated desire to avoid harsh
attacks and to try to make the intrinsically partisan proceedings
seem less so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect it to be a somewhat different convention,'' Karen P.
Hughes, the Bush campaigns director of communications, said in an
interview here Tuesday. ``There will not be the traditional Tuesday
night attack at this convention. Each night will have a positive
discussion of Governor Bush's proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, tone is relative, and often in the ear of the
beholder, and Hughes and other advisers were careful to say that
the convention would still have a place for critical evaluations of
Gore's record and proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Another adviser said the convention shares the same goal that
the campaign has pursued ever since Bush effectively sealed the
Republican nomination in mid-March: namely, to convince voters that
the Texas governor is ``a different kind of Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   One clear way to do that is to change the tone, the adviser
said. Republicans toyed with that in 1996, scheduling the comments
of the party's most polarizing figure, then-House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, during the portion of the second night before prime-time
television coverage, and putting more women into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   But even during the peak of the second night, when Rep. Susan
Molinari of New York delivered the keynote address, there was ample
venom for President Clinton. Molinari characterized him as utterly
untrustworthy and Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas attacked
Clinton and his ``Social-Security-taxing, health-care-socializing,
drug-coddling, power-grabbing, business-busing'' administration.
She also bluntly ridiculed first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, an adviser to the Bush campaign who is helping to
organize the convention, said that this time around, ``We're going
to continue to emphasize what Governor Bush is for, and I don't
know that there's time left over for the kinds of bitter attacks
that we've seen from both parties' conventions in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are differences between the two candidates,''
Gillespie said, referring to Bush and Gore. ``And you can't
necessarily point out what they are without talking about the vice
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention, in other words, will walk a fine oratorical
line, several advisers said. It will take equal care, they said, in
the way it presents former President George Bush, whose position as
the last Republican to reside in the White House makes him a
compelling figure but whose presence could also remind voters of
the advantages that helped get his son to this point.
</P>
<P>
   One adviser said that the former president would probably be
introduced and included primarily in the context of other recent
Republican presidents, like Gerald Ford, who would also attend the
convention. Ronald Reagan, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease,
might be represented by video footage or by his wife, Nancy.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, one adviser said, the convention may include some
featured speakers who are not politicians but rather people who are
grappling, in their professional or personal lives, with the very
issues that Bush has discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign is making its plans for this year's event with
the belief that both parties' conventions may matter more than in
previous years, for the simple if seemingly unrelated fact that the
Summer Olympics will occur so much later than usual.
</P>
<P>
   In most recent presidential election cycles, the Olympics were
over by the time of the conventions, and both the Republicans and
Democrats could count on relatively sustained network television
coverage of their candidates in September, the month after the
conventions.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the case for this cycle. The Republican
convention, in Philadelphia, runs from July 31 to August 3. The
Democratic convention, in Los Angeles, is from August 14 to 17. The
Olympics, in Sydney, Australia, take up the last two weeks of
September.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the television networks may pay little heed to
politics for much of September, and the impressions that Bush and
Gore create at their respective conventions may linger longer,
unchallenged by new information, in voters' minds.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Various officials with the Bush campaign have been plotting
convention strategy for months, but Hughes said that the gathering
of senior advisers in Kennebunkport will be the first time the
campaign's senior decision makers have paid such close, vigorous
attention to the coming event. Bush will head to Kennebunkport late
Friday so that he can visit his parents and join his relatives in
celebrating the 75th birthday of his mother, former first lady
Barbara Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Those present at the gathering, in addition to Hughes and Bush,
will include Karl Rove, the campaign's chief strategist, Josh
Bolten, the campaign's policy director, and Michael Gerson, the
chief speechwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush will see the first full draft of a proposed convention
speech that Gerson has spent much of the last month preparing.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers said that they were trying to plan the
convention less as a four-day event than as a 12- or 16-day one,
with a preceding schedule of appearances and announcements for Bush
that would build to the actual proceedings in Philadelphia. They
said they had not yet decided when they will announce the
candidate's vice presidential selection, and that he was not close
to making that decision.
</P>
<P>
   One aide said that each night of the convention might come under
a different ``umbrella theme,'' like education or Social Security
or America's role and stature in the world, which would allow for a
summary of various proposals Bush has made.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Powell and McCain, Elizabeth Dole is being
considered for a prominent speaking role. But aides stressed that
changes to their current intentions could occur.

 &HT;    Delta, American exploring possibility of a deal
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Airline merger speculation is beginning to take on
Shakespearean overtones: Who's wooing whom, and why?
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and American Airlines have opened
exploratory discussions that include the idea of a marriage. But
it's unclear whether the talks, which came to light Wednesday, are
really aimed at a deal or intended more for dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions follow a May 23 announcement by United Airlines
that it will buy US Airways. That touched off a wave of speculation
that the industry is on the brink of a major consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of American and Delta, the No. 2 and No. 3
carriers behind United, would be a blockbuster. Yet the merger has
been considered unlikely because of the airlines' size and their
route overlap.
</P>
<P>
   Both Delta and American have connecting hubs in Dallas and a
major presence in the Northeast. Together they would control 35
percent of the U.S. market, swamping even the 27 percent share of a
combined United-US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between American and Delta _ and media leaks
describing them _ could be a maneuver to torpedo the United-US
Airways deal, which already faces tough antitrust scrutiny and
opposition by consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, American-Delta talks tell U.S. Justice Department
regulators that if they let the first deal fly, an even bigger
pairing could follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a transaction, and for that matter even the specter of
it, would add fuel to the regulatory concern,'' said PaineWebber
airline analyst Sam Buttrick, who at the same time termed a
Delta-American merger ``exceptionally unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   He wryly suggested that the move could backfire on American and
Delta because a merger between them ``could have the unintended
effect of making a United-US Airways deal look good by
comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   Another motive for American might be to pressure Northwest
Airlines, which it approached last week about a possible buyout. By
talking to Delta, American would be signaling Northwest it isn't
the only belle at the ball.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a third, less complex possibility: If the United-US
Airways deal is approved in some form, American and Delta would
want to have the most powerful countermove ready; it makes sense
for the two to at least talk.
</P>
<P>
   American and Delta executives, plus their bankers and lawyers,
met Monday in New York. American initiated the meeting, first
reported in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion was broad and theoretical. No prospective
pricetag or structure for a merger hit the table. It wasn't even
clear which airline would be the surviving entity. American is
larger in terms of annual revenue passenger miles but Delta's
current market capitalization of $6.23 billion is about $2 billion
higher than American's.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's top executive at the meeting was Chief Financial Officer
Ed West. Chairman and CEO Leo Mullin has been out of the country,
on vacation and business, since just before the United-US Airways
deal erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Delta spokesman John Kennedy wouldn't confirm the talks. ``This
is media frenzy, not company frenzy,'' he said. ``We're calm.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta, Atlanta's largest corporate employer, did issue an
internal statement for use by managers in answering workers'
questions. It concluded:
</P>
<P>
   ``The airline industry is very dynamic and is in a period of
real change now, and it is not clear what _ if anything _ may
happen in the future. However, it's important to remember that
Delta management is carefully monitoring the industry competitive
situation and that the company will take all appropriate actions to
protect the interests of Delta and its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline analysts continue to believe the most realistic
responses to the United-US Airways deal _ if it survives regulatory
and labor hurdles _ are an American buyout of No. 4 Northwest and a
Delta buyout of No. 5 Continental.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating that scenario is the fact that Northwest owns a
stake in Continental and could block any sale. But it would likely
divest the stake as part of a merger with American, leaving
Continental free to entertain a Delta offer.
</P>
<P>
   That would condense the top six airlines into three of roughly
equal market share. Advocates of that scenario say the airline
industry is fragmented compared to other industries and a
consolidation is overdue.
</P>
<P>
   But such deals could take years to complete and will face many
questions about the effect on service, fares and employees. Several
consumer groups already are aligning to oppose the United-US
Airways deal, and Congress plans hearings on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of public policy, we should say no mergers among
the big six airlines for any reason, under any circumstance,'' said
Ed Perkins, a passenger advocate and former editor of Consumer
Reports Travel Letter.
</P>
<P>
   United and US Airways crafted their deal to appease antitrust
regulators, most notably with a pledge to spin off the combined
carrier's operations at Washington's Reagan National Airport into a
new minority-owned carrier called DC Air.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many doubt that will suffice. The Justice Department,
analysts note, already is trying to reverse Northwest's partial
ownership of Continental, suggesting regulators would have to have
a major change of heart to approve a merger between any two Big Six
carriers.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand United can argue its buyout of US Airways
differs from other prospective deals because it would salvage an
ailing company of questionable long-term viability, while the other
Big Six players are comparatively healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's interest in Continental was firmly established in 1998
when it tried unsuccessfully to buy the Houston-based carrier for
about $3.1 billion. Delta and Continental have mostly complementary
routes and are lightly unionized compared to other big airlines,
making a merger easier in some respects.
</P>
<P>
   Another Delta option would be a run at Northwest, or even United
itself. But those deals would be more expensive and the carriers
are heavily unionized.

MICROSOFT LOOKS AHEAD TO THE APPEALS PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ From the perspective of the Microsoft Corp.,
the nation's largest software company, its legal battle with the
federal government is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief software architect,
said Wednesday that he was looking forward to the next round of the
epic antitrust trial that will soon move to a higher court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reminded of the old saying that today is the first day of
the rest of your life,'' Gates said during a press conference here
on his company's sprawling campus. ``I believe very strongly that
today is the first day of the rest of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates appeared calm Wednesday, briefly stumbling over his words
at the outset of his prepared remarks but then warming to his theme
that during the appeals process Microsoft would continue to do what
he believed the company does best: design software.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated his belief that Microsoft had done nothing wrong.
And when asked during the press conference if he felt he might have
done anything differently, he responded that his only regret was in
not articulating Microsoft's story earlier and more clearly to the
American public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft and the whole story of the PC was missed here,'' he
said. ``I should have taken the opportunity to go and talk about
this industry and what it has meant in terms of empowering
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates argued that the company's principal contribution was in
transforming what was once a low volume and high cost computer
industry into a fast-paced, mass market business, in which
Microsoft's Windows operating system allowed consumers to
continually receive the benefits of new features that enhance the
power of desktop computing.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in front of seven of his top executives _ including
Robert Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer; William
Neukom, its chief lawyer; Jeff Raikes, a veteran marketing
executive; and Mich Matthews, the current marketing chief _ Gates
said that his most important challenge Wednesday is to pursue new
technologies like speech recognition and computing on tablets.
</P>
<P>
   He also sought to define the substance of the antitrust case
narrowly, saying that at its heart the case was about nothing more
than whether his company had the right to add Internet browsing
capabilities to its operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core of the case is whether it was appropriate for
Microsoft to put Internet support into Windows,'' Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's press conference, Gates answered questions for
several minutes before turning the meeting over to his legal
counsel, Neukom, who proceeded to give a preview of the company's
strategy on appeal, which he said would be filed in a matter of
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both the substance of the case and the lack of any
process during the remedy phases make a compelling case for our
appeal,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom, who led the company's defense before Jackson during the
long antitrust trial, also pointedly attacked the many state
attorneys general _ without mentioning them by name _ for foiling
the company's attempts to reach a negotiated settlement with the
Justice Department during a mediation attempt by federal appeals
court Justice Richard Posner several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all of the parties were willing to engage in a serious
good faith effort towards a mediation,'' Neukom said.
</P>
<P>
   The feelings Gates expressed Wednesday about how his company has
been treated unfairly by government prosecutors were echoed widely
among Microsoft's 34,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   On the Redmond campus, there has been a palpable sense in recent
months of the closing of ranks, according to a number of Microsoft
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The view here, almost universally held, is that Microsoft, while
seen by many outsiders as a huge and highly successful predator, is
actually the victim of a small Silicon Valley cabal. This group of
industry chieftains were fairly vanquished on the market
battlefield, Microsoft employees often say, but decided to carry on
their war in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there is a sense in Redmond that the situation has
become exacerbated by what many here view as the media circus that
now surrounds the antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become the designated whipping boy for corporate
misbehavior,'' said one of the company's top executives. ``It
leaves other companies free to merge and engage in all kinds of
behaviors without being noticed.''
</P>
<P>
   Other employees said that there were no surprises for them in
Wednesday's ruling, even as they insisted that Jackson's decision
to endorse the government's proposed breakup was clearly
wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the media coverage of this, I'm not surprised,''
said George Bullock, a programmer who works for the company's MSDN
group that creates tools for software developers. ``But I
whole-heartedly disagree with the government's case.''
</P>
<P>
   But while there was widespread disappointment over the outcome
so far in the case, many employees took issue with Microsoft's
contention in its last court filing in the case on Tuesday that a
break-up could lead to mass defections among the company's highly
technical workforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe in Microsoft, and I still like what I do
here,'' said Franc Camara, a program manager in the company's
Windows Division. ``As long as I'm doing something interesting, I
don't care if it is broken into two, or three, or four companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates clearly remains a revered figure in the Seattle area. The
case has been closely watched by many of the region's residents.
</P>
<P>
   At the Seattle airport Wednesday, Gates had many fans on his
side. ``I think that if the company is split up it will harm
consumers and raise costs,'' said an employee at a rental car
counter. ``Tell Bill Gates that Jenny at Avis said hi and is
supporting him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenny noted that she owned a small amount of Microsoft stock.
When asked about its recent performance, she frowned slightly and
turned her thumb down.

FDA ADDS HURDLES IN APPROVAL OF ABORTION PILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The long-running effort to bring the French
abortion pill to women in this country has encountered yet another
obstacle: a suggestion by the Food and Drug Administration that it
may place tight restrictions on how the drug, RU-486, is
distributed and who can prescribe it.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, once a drug is approved, any doctor can prescribe it
for any purpose. But people familiar with negotiations between the
FDA and the sponsor of RU-486, which is also known as mifepristone,
say the agency is considering taking several unusual steps,
including restricting prescribing privileges to doctors who perform
surgical abortions.
</P>
<P>
   That would effectively eliminate what advocates of abortion
rights see as mifepristone's main advantage, moving the procedure
out of potentially high-profile clinics and into the private
offices of gynecologists, family practitioners and other doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kills the drug if it can't be used by primary care
providers,'' said Dr. Eric Schaff, a professor of family medicine
at the University of Rochester who has run clinical trials of
RU-486 in the United States. ``The whole idea of mifepristone was
to increase access.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that is mifepristone's potential. A study released
Wednesday by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that one in three
gynecologists who do not perform abortions would prescribe
mifepristone if it were approved by the FDA. But the study also
found that doctors would have second thoughts if they were required
to undergo training to use the drug, another condition the FDA is
considering imposing.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the food and drug agency refused to comment on the
negotiations, as did the Population Council, which holds the rights
to mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   Heather O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the Danco Group, the
investors who have licensed those rights and are arranging for the
drug to be manufactured and distributed in this country, said ``The
agency's initial approach is more restrictive than we had
envisioned for a drug that has been used safely by so many women.''
</P>
<P>
   But she would not elaborate, beyond saying, ``We are in the very
early stages of a delicate negotiation process with the FDA.'' FDA
Studies show that when taken in combination with misoprostol, an
already approved medication, mifepristone causes abortion, in
essence, a miscarriage, in more than 95 percent of women who are no
more than 49 days pregnant. After years of controversy, the FDA
announced in 1996 that the drug was safe and effective for use in
this country.
</P>
<P>
   But the final approval process has been fraught with
complications, in part because the drug's sponsors had trouble
finding a manufacturer. That issue has been settled (the
manufacturer's identity remains undisclosed), and in February, the
FDA notified the Danco Group it would give final approval to RU-486
if certain labeling and manufacturing issues could be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has until Sept. 30 to make a decision. Negotiations
were proceeding apace when, at a Population Council meeting last
Friday, officials from the Danco Group announced that they had just
received a new set of requirements from the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Burnhill, medical affairs vice president for Planned
Parenthood of America who was present at the meeting, said the list
caught Danco officials by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought all the FDA requirements had been dropped on the
table in February,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to requiring that only abortion practitioners
prescribe mifepristone, Burnhill said, the FDA is demanding that
prescribing doctors be trained in mifepristone's use; be trained in
reading ltrasound scans; and maintain admitting privileges at
hospitals with emergency facilities no more than an hour from their
offices, in case women experience complications.
</P>
<P>
   Burnhill said doctors would have to register with the drug's
distributor, ``so that the distributor would not be supplying the
product to every Tom, Dick and Harry.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposal contained a subtle, but important,
wording change: because the word ``physician'' and not ``provider''
was used, nurse-practitioners would be unable to prescribe
mifepristone.
</P>
<P>
   Though rare, similar requirements have been imposed on drugs
including thalidomide and certain narcotics used to relieve pain in
cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Some abortion rights advocates and others who favor approval of
Ru-486 fear that the requirements mean a national list of
mifepristone providers would be created, giving abortion opponents
an opportunity to single out those doctors. Others say the FDA is
succumbing to political pressure and treating women unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``To encumber a drug like this is extremely unusual for the
FDA,'' said Dr. Wendy Chavkin, a professor of public health at
Columbia University. ``We have Viagra that went out in widespread
fashion even though there was some suggestion that it might cause
serious cardiovascular events. In contrast, this is a highly
studied drug where the safety and efficacy have been demonstrated.
That indicates how the political climate is really interfering in
the science.''

<P>
   The effect on consumers of Wednesday's decision to split the
Microsoft Corp. into two companies remains unclear, in large part
because Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's orders are on hold until
the appeals process is concluded, which could take years.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors are contributing to the uncertainty, including
the profound shift to the Internet as the driving force of personal
computers and the emergence of Internet-based consumer appliances
and wireless devices that are independent of Microsoft's monopoly
on desktop PCs.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent Microsoft from abusing its monopoly power in the
future, Jackson has ordered that it be broken into two separate
companies, one for operating systems and one for applications and
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   That may never happen if Microsoft is successful in its appeals.
But some analysts suggest that the three-year Justice Department
pursuit of Microsoft has already affected consumers, at least
indirectly, by making Microsoft less blatantly aggressive against
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrutiny that Microsoft has been under has already made
them a better citizen and is giving the rest of the industry some
breathing room,'' said Tim O'Reilly, chief executive of O'Reilly &AMP;
Associates of Sebastopol, Calif., a high-technology information
provider. Venture capitalists are now more willing to finance small
companies that in the past would have been ignored, he said,
because they would have either been crushed by Microsoft or
absorbed by it.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's order also included behavioral remedies that could
go into effect within 90 days. Among these are changes that could
have a more immediate, although still indirect, effect on
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Microsoft no longer would be able to require PC
makers to buy a copy of Windows for every computer made, regardless
of whether consumers want Windows. Because PC makers pass the cost
of the software along to consumers, the price of some computers
could fall, especially for inexpensive PCs in which the operating
system is a more significant part of the price.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will Microsoft be able to compel computer makers to bundle
other Microsoft products with the PC, like the Microsoft mouse, as
a condition for favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the Dell Computer Corp. in Austin, Texas,
said his company would continue to provide Microsoft products
because customer demand for them remains exceptionally high. The
demand for such products as Windows and Microsoft Office is not
expected to abate just because the software comes from two
different companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Judson True, assistant program director at the Commonwealth Club
in San Francisco, noted that both companies would have monopolies
in their respective areas. ``When you've got one really big head,
and then two really big heads, I don't understand what's going to
really change.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows drives me crazy,'' he added. ``I can't imagine it
getting much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is easy to find people who are frustrated by
Microsoft software, it is harder to find businesses willing to
abandon it. Information systems managers are extremely reluctant to
change software once it has been installed and is working properly
and employees have been trained to use it. Microsoft's hold on the
operating systems and major applications used by business computers
is secure, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   And since many consumers are familiar with Microsoft software
from using it at work, they have adopted it at home. As a result,
demand for Microsoft products is expected to remain strong
regardless of the eventual outcome of the antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to change my life at all,'' said John Kelley, a
PC user from Palo Alto, Calif., ``because I'm going to persevere
through using Windows 98.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said he also used Corel WordPerfect GroupWise, a
collection of application programs that compete against Microsoft
Office.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Office dominates the application software category as
thoroughly as Windows does in operating systems. Corel has doubled
its market share over the last year, which indicates some gains
against Microsoft, but it still has less than 1 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my own personal and emotional opinion, which is that I
frankly would like to see the company split up,'' said Peter
Carson, who works at the law firm of Cooley Godward in San
Francisco. ``But if I look at it functionally, I don't think a
split will have much of an impact on me.'' He said most of his
clients used Microsoft software and that being compatible with them
was beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   But while Microsoft's grip on desktop computing appears secure,
new technologies are evolving that have no need for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the market for handheld personal computers, the Palm
operating system from Palm Inc. is dominant. Microsoft recently
introduced a new version of its relatively unsuccessful Windows CE
operating system, called Pocket PC, to gain ground against Palm.
But Wednesday, Sony announced that it would introduce a range of
new consumer devices, including a handheld computer, based on the
Palm system.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect wireless phones and other handheld devices to be
the main conduit to the Internet in just a few years, passing
personal computers, and so far, Microsoft has not had success in
moving its operating systems, browsers or other applications to
these devices. Indeed, almost all of the large cellular phone and
handheld device companies have adopted an operating system called
Symbian, which is not controlled by Microsoft but by major
electronics companies led by Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new paradigm that is network centric rather than
desktop centric,'' O'Reilly said. ``Most of the interesting new
consumer applications are delivered over the Web, like eBay and
Amazon.com. So in one sense, for Microsoft the cat is already out
of the bag. Without the intervention of the government, many of
these exciting new developments might be brought back under
Microsoft's thumb.''

 &HT;    It's Rocker's day to quit or play
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Rocker is a lot of things to a lot of people, but
a quitter?
</P>
<P>
   The controversial Braves closer threatened to do just that on a
radio show, two days after being optioned to the Braves' Class AAA
team. The Braves said the move was made so he could work on his
control on the mound, although it came the day after Rocker's
outburst at Sports Illustrated writer Jeff Pearlman.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has until today to report to Toledo where the Richmond
Braves are playing. If he doesn't, he can be fined or suspended
without pay.
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker goes to Richmond _ and the Braves still expect him to
_ he's not going to go quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't even decided if I'm going down or not,'' Rocker said
on 96 Rock's morning show, on which he has regularly appeared in
the past year. ``I'm still pretty chafed about the whole situation.
I'm just not wanting to play anymore, just shut it down . . . for
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves players and general manager John Schuerholz agreed
Wednesday that Rocker was just upset, like any player is when he's
sent down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a position where he's ticked off and not thinking,''
pitcher Tom Glavine said. ``Come on. Where else is he going to make
the kind of money he can in this game? He has a talent to play the
game. . . It's up to him. Plain and simple. That's the biggest
thing he has to learn.''

In ``The Patriot,'' which opens in the United States late this
month,  &UR; Mel &LR;   &UR; Gibson &LR;  plays an American farmer,  &UR; Benjamin Martin &LR; ,
a historic figure who fought against England in the Revolutionary
War. British newspapers aren't taking this well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is far from an accurate account of (Martin's)
participation,'' says the Sunday Times of London, in a passage
quoted by MSNBC. ``Instead, in the hands of an Australian actor
working with a German director and funded by Hollywood money, his
story has been transformed into a 160-minute polemic against the
British.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mail agreed. ``I don't know what Mel Gibson has
against the English, but he gives them absolute hell in `The
Patriot,' '' said that newspaper. As did the Belfast Telegraph:
``New York-born, Australia-raised Mel Gibson loves bashing the
Brits in his movies.''

 &UR; Miya-Jervis &LR;  described as ``familiar faux-lesbian porno iconography
to make its sales pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the editors realized the photo could be taken as a
``gross usage of women's bods'' or ``an example of empowered women
manipulating their own image,'' when they realized that magazines
such as Maxim were running it, ``We knew our instincts were right.
Satire or not, an ad that uses the body language of porn to speak
to the Maxim reader is not getting its powerful, women-in-charge

DRIVING WHILE CELLING: SHOULD IT BE A CRIME?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Has a sidebar, CELL-ONWHEELS-NAY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
UNDATED: motor vehicle accident. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We caution,'' wrote authors Donald A. Redelmeier, M.D., and
Robert J. Tibshirani, Ph.D., ``against interpreting our data as
showing that cellular telephones are harmful and that their use
should be restricted. Even if a causal relation were established,
drivers are vulnerable to other distractions that could offset the
potential reductions in risk due to restricting the use of cellular
phones.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors also wrote that they found no safety advantage in
using hands-free units. What this could mean, they said, is that
motor vehicle collisions result from a driver's limitations with
regard to attention rather than dexterity.
</P>
<P>
   What this could mean, I extrapolated, is that it wasn't juggling
the phone that was the problem in cellphone-related accidents.
</P>
<P>
   It was that the drivers involved were AQ-challenged. The
cellphone was their distraction of choice. But it could have been a
cigarette. A Big Gulp. Or the radio.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what Nicholas Trott had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A grave problem that developed has all the motor-vehicle
commissioners of the Eastern states in a wax. It's whether (they)
should be allowed in cars. Some states don't want to permit them at
all _ say they distract the driver and disturb the peace. The
manufacturers claim that the sound ... is less disturbing than
backseat conversation.... The whole problem is getting very
complex.''
</P>
<P>
   Trott wrote this in 1930, and he was talking about the radio
(this letter was published in the ``Farmer's Almanac'' in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   But the debate sounds familiar. New technology has a habit of
frightening people.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy years later, we've learned that the radio is the tool,
not the terror.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling my defense of the car phone, I decided to take
another ride, this time on the Internet, where statistics abound.
Here's the best of what I found regarding car phone safety:
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study
showed that distraction by a cellphone can increase the risk of
crashing, but also pointed out that anything that distracts the
driver of a vehicle _ from fiddling with the radio (!) to talking
with passengers _ increases that chance.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 California Highway Patrol survey concluded that ``none of
the researchers were able to make the statement that cellular
telephone use causes traffic collisions.''
</P>
<P>
   A current article on Drivers.com points out that drivers often
talk with other passengers, eat, smoke cigarettes and much more.
``Some drivers do this better than others, and this is an area
where appropriate research is lacking.'' As the author notes, there
is no such driver's test for attention-dividing skills (aha! my
sister's AQ test concept!).
</P>
<P>
   According to a Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association
1986 study published in the ``New York Journal of Medicine,''
smokers had 50 percent more traffic accidents than nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   Just imagine if a smoker had a Big Gulp, I thought.
</P>
<P>
   On the way home from the office, having digested all this
cellphone information, I dialed up my sister again. She had some
more to say about cellphones _ how they make you more productive
(''Look, you're working now!'' she pointed out). They make things
easy. They improve the quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   And if they were such a true problem, why the heck hadn't the
hordes of statistics-loving actuaries jumped at the chance to hike
up cellphone users' car insurance rates?
</P>
<P>
   While Laura and I were mulling this, I made a mental note that
the woman ahead of me failed to use her signal indicator and then
moved across four lanes of traffic so she could get to the exit.
</P>
<P>
   Was she on the phone? It doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   You see, we've got laws against reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   And clearly this woman was at fault, not whatever was
temporarily driving her to distraction.

DRIVING WHILE CELLING: SHOULD IT BE A CRIME?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Has a sidebar, CELL-ONWHEELS-NAY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CATHERINE NEWTON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first week I had a car phone, I backed out of my space in
the supermarket parking lot, gleefully dialing as I drove _ right
into the side of a white Subaru station wagon. No one was hurt, the
driver was abnormally kind as I confessed that it was all my fault,
and it was the beginning of a beautiful four-year friendship.
Between me and my cellphone.
</P>
<P>
   I am not alone in my infatuation with the wireless wonder.
Joining me are 92,367,059 Americans, many of whom, like me, take
the phones with us to the places we love (and hate) most. Grocery
stores. Medical appointments. Vacations. The car.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the car. It is its status as car accouterment that has
gotten the cellphone into a lot of trouble lately. Critics say the
phone is a menace, a distraction that impairs a driver's ability to
tend to the task at hand. Drivers with cellphones cause accidents,
they say, and they wave copies of a 1997 ``New England Journal of
Medicine'' study on cellphone safety under the noses of legislators
as proof-positive that Driving While Celling is as much of a danger
as Driving While Intoxicated. Wireless phones should be banned from
our autos, they say, noting that at least 35 states have considered
measures banning cellphone use in the car since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   I knew these anti-phone fanatics were wrong. And to prove it, I
decided to make a few phone calls. I started on the way home from
work.
</P>
<P>
   The first call was to my sister in New York. Laura is not an
expert on cellphone safety, but she has a lot of opinions and
offers them with the ring of authority. She tells me she thinks the
nay-sayers are probably people who can't multitask, people like
men.
</P>
<P>
   She says that if she weren't on the cellphone when she drives,
she'd be listening to books on tape, jotting down work-related
notes, carrying on a conversation with her husband and assuaging
the carsick puppy who is invariably in the way-back.
</P>
<P>
   Potential drivers, Laura proposed, should have to take an AQ _
attention quotient _ test to get on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all got distractions,'' she summed up. ``And tell me
drinking a Big Gulp in the car is any safer than using the cell.''
</P>
<P>
   These seemed like personal examples, but apparently my sister
had a point. The next phone call involved a librarian at the
National Safety Council in Chicago. She told me she'd fax me a copy
of the council's fact sheet on cellphone safety _ which clearly
said that there is no research that demonstrates that car phone use
while driving increases crash risk _ as well as a 1998 Traffic
Safety Facts sheet on crash data. This data looked at related
factors for drivers involved in fatal crashes and showed that
Inattention was a factor in 7.2 percent of the crashes that year.
Conversations on the cellphone would fall into that category, she
said, but so would eating. Unrestrained pets. Smoking. And,
presumably, Big Gulps.
</P>
<P>
   She also said she'd fax a copy of the ``New England Journal of
Medicine'' article.
</P>
<P>
   I thanked her, and immediately dialed up the baby sitter.
Traffic was a little heavy, and I was going to be late getting back
to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your time,'' the sitter said, sensing my panic. ``We're
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   I slowed down, flipped through my CD holder and popped in
Santana to soothe my nerves. In the car ahead of me, the driver was
shaving.
</P>
<P>
   The report from the ``New England Journal of Medicine,'' on my
desk by 9 a.m., showed me how numbers can be crunched to suit
various purposes. I had read in at least one newspaper that the
report said driving while talking on the car phone was as dangerous
as driving drunk. But that wasn't exactly right.
</P>
<P>
   What it really said was that the study, involving 699 drivers,
showed an association but not necessarily a ``causal'' relation
between the use of cellular phones while driving and a subsequent
motor vehicle accident. &QL;

ONE MAN'S RANT AGAINST RECKLESS TALKERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Has a sidebar, CELL-ONWHEELS-YEA) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUGLAS PERRY 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever been driving along, minding your own business,
when suddenly some car appears beside you, and the lunatic driving
it is screaming obscenities at you and shaking a threatening fist?
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you should do when that happens: Hang up the dang
phone!
</P>
<P>
   It's time we face up to it. Americans' obsession with the
cellphone has gotten out of control. A ``New England Journal of
Medicine'' study suggests that talking on the phone while driving
is about as mind-muddling as being drunk. To be sure, studies and
stats can be twisted to suggest just about anything, but there's no
way around the fact that the worldwide car chaos has become severe
enough that a dozen countries prohibit the use of cellphones by
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, of course, is not one of those countries _
and that doesn't seem likely to change. (When a city councilman
from The Colony in Denton County, Texas, recently suggested a ban
after a fatal car crash that may have involved a cellphone, the
public clamor against the idea was immediate.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, please understand, I'm no by-the-book driver's ed hard
case. Preoccupied drivers, one could argue, provide some spice to
life. For example: I once watched a young blonde woman, cruising
along in a lime-green VW Bug, skillfully shed her business suit
and, shifting gears in the altogether, replace it with a bikini.
Not once did her car drop below 40 mph. (This was, needless to say,
Southern California.)
</P>
<P>
   Even besides such eye-opening Left Coast moments, I can
acknowledge legitimate excuses for letting your focus occasionally
wander from the road. For one thing, we're not robots. And for
another, danger is an integral component of the driving experience
_ especially in Texas, where driving is a test of our martial
spirit. With no foreign wars to fight, we must take our combat
where we can find it _ and that's on the road. The car has become
our chariot, the horn (or middle finger) our sword.
</P>
<P>
   So, the reason no one should be allowed to use a cellphone while
driving isn't simply that it's dangerous. Putting on makeup and
brushing your hair while driving are dangerous, too, but we all
have our personal grooming standards to uphold. No, the clincher is
that it's also extremely inconsiderate.
</P>
<P>
   Ever been on Interstate 30 when it's as wide open as the West
Texas horizon and you find yourself stuck behind a car going 35 in
the left lane? Nine times out of 10 it's some idiot chatting away
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Before you nod in agreement, though, you should take a moment to
be grateful for the ones who simply go slow. It's better than the
folks so caught up in their phone conversations that they
mindlessly pull out into traffic or drive the wrong way on a
one-way street (I've witnessed both more than once). More typical
than the cell users who seem to be having an out-of-body experience
_ although often just as troublesome _ are the chatty drivers who
are aware of their surroundings only in fits. For no particular
reason, they slow down, speed up, slow down again, then begin to
drift sloppily into the next lane before suddenly jerking back into
place.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to say that such arguments are purely anecdotal
or that the accident stats are suspect. But anyone who drives knows
_ even if only deep, deep down in their subconscious _ that this is
the simple truth: No matter who you are or how long it's been since
you've gotten a moving violation, you cannot drive competently
while cupping a phone to your ear. You will get in an accident,
cause an accident, or, at the very least, get a lot of people's
blood boiling.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so we've established that talking on the phone while driving
is needlessly dangerous and inconsiderate. That said, in all
fairness, there are a few situations when it's all right. When you
are stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic and barely moving, there's
nothing wrong with calling the baby sitter to say you're going to
be late. Using a cellphone is similarly acceptable when you're lost
(I realize that's a big loophole for some people). And if, heaven
forbid, you're being menaced by another driver, a phone can be the
most valuable purchase you've ever made.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say, the best idea is always to pull off the road
and stop the car when you need to make a call. Unless, of course,
you're dialing 4-1-1 for the listing of the naked blonde whose VW
you're trying to keep up with. .MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

PUTTING PROUST'S WORLD ON FILM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France, Chile, Belgium)   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 By LESLIE CAMHI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In his 3,000-page monument to lost time, Marcel Proust
barely mentions the cinema. Writing in the decades immediately
following film's invention, he appears to have been largely
uninterested by the medium in which so many memories of the 20th
century would be stored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he saw very few films,'' said Jean-Yves Tadie, a
professor at the Sorbonne, over tea recently at his home here in a
graceful fin-de-siecle apartment building. The English translation
of Tadie's biography, ``Marcel Proust: A Life,'' will be released
by Viking in August. ``Perhaps a few newsreels, or some light
Gaumont comedies. He went out very little toward the end of his
life, fearing attacks of asthma. He died before Abel Gance's
`Napoleon,' and probably never knew the films of Chaplin. And so he
must not have understood that film was an art.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in ``Remembrance of Things Past,'' the narrator's
memories of childhood in the village of Combray _ with its
black-steepled church and all its inhabitants _ which unfold like a
Chinese paper flower from the cup of tea in which he's dunked a
madeleine, seem an apt metaphor for film's remarkable power to
revive the past and make the dead live again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Film is a very Proustian medium,'' said Raul Ruiz, the
director of ``Time Regained,'' during an interview after the film's
premiere at the Cannes International Film Festival last year. This
remarkable adaptation of the final volume of ``Remembrance of
Things Past'' opens in New York on Friday. ``At any given moment,
you can be kidnapped by the past.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Remembrance of Things Past'' does not lend itself easily
to film adaptation. Filmmakers must cope with the novel's
extraordinary length, and its strangely porous nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most novels, you have action, dialogue and commentary,''
Tadie said. ``But in Proust, the commentary takes up so much space.
A few lines of dialogue are followed by five pages of the
narrator's observations. And if you reduce things to action, there
just isn't much of it. He's no Sir Walter Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the question of finding a cinematic equivalent for
those interminable sentences, which seem to explore every shading
of erotic ambivalence or gilt Sevres porcelain, and in which one
can almost hear the asthmatic author gasping for breath.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the problem common to all literary
adaptations, but extreme in Proust's case, of reconciling cinematic
time with the experience of reading. Film's gratifications are
relatively speedy and immediate, while Proust's novel preaches the
infinite pleasures of deferral. Months or even years may separate
the reading of the first volume from the seventh and last. How can
all those intimate, solitary hours of enchantment be translated
into a marketable 120 minutes on screen ?
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz explained his working method. ``For a long while, Einstein
thought that, if time were a dimension, it should be visible,'' he
said. ``In making this film, I wondered how I might play with that
idea. I approached it in the most naive manner possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Using flashbacks, repetitions and visual refrains, he created a
film as intricately structured as a symphony, where each part
refers back to another in an infinite play of mirrors. He cast a
mother and daughter (Catherine Deneuve and Chiara Mastroianni) as
Odette and Albertine, figures who are unrelated in the novel but
whose roles as loved women echo each other across generations.
Within the continuous flow of his film's two-and-one-half hours,
time seems to expand exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in Proust's novel, the narrator describes the long
afternoons he spent in his room at Combray, amusing himself with a
magic lantern, a pre-cinematic device something like a slide
projector, whose glass negatives could be changed to create the
illusion of motion. The luminous images swallowed whole the forms
of the doorknobs and curtains onto which they were projected, and
took on extraordinary life for him. So every director who has
adapted Proust's work for film finds his own vision of cinema
reflected in that impossible project.
</P>
<P>
   Late in life, Luchino Visconti, the poet of smoldering,
suppressed passion among Italian aristocracy, planned a screen
version of Proust's middle volume, ``Sodom and Gommorah,'' but the
work was never realized. Near the end of his career, Joseph Losey
commissioned a screenplay called ``Proust Scenario,'' based on the
novel and written by the playwright Harold Pinter, but no film
emerged from it.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Adlon's ``Celeste'' (1981) was inspired by the memoirs of
Celeste Albaret, who worked as Proust's maid during the last eight
years of the author's life. Proust, a notoriously big tipper in
restaurants, was also known for his extravagant kindness toward
servants. Adlon's film, a strange combination of reticence and
caricature, follows a woman living in the antechamber of greatness,
rising at 3 p.m. each day to bring Monsieur his ``morning'' coffee,
and remaining on call for most of the night _ a portrait of the
intimate bond between the invalid artist and his servant.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one had to wait until 1984 before a filmmaker tackled the
novel directly. For ``Swann in Love,'' Volker Schlondorff cast
Jeremy Irons as the cultivated Jewish art collector Charles Swann
and a remarkably fluffy Ornella Muti as Odette, the courtesan he
eventually marries. There's lots of lingerie, with heavy emphasis
on a pulchritudinous orchid tucked into Odette's swelling breast.
But by eliminating the crucial position of narrator, Schlondorff
sacrificed the novel's philosophical dimension, which transforms
Proust's account of aristocratic decadence and erotic despair into
a highly evolved work of art.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Chantal Akerman's ``Captive'' had its premiere in
the Director's Fortnight at Cannes. Akerman's Proust draws upon
passages from ``La Prisonniere,'' the novel's darkly minimalist
fifth volume, which describe the relation between the narrator and
his lover, Albertine _ a complex and ever-changing equation whose
key elements are jealousy, domination, sequestration and flight. To
render this bond, Akerman returned to the claustrophobic style of
``Jeanne Dielmann, 23 Quai de Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles,'' the
monumental film she made in 1975 when she was just 24 years old,
about three days in the life of a Belgian housewife, mother and
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``For `La Captive,' I worked a lot in interior spaces,'' Akerman
said in a cafe on the Place des Vosges. ``The town houses, the
cars. Through them, the viewer is projected into a mental universe.
At the same time, you escape all psychological explanation. You're
just caught in a machine that moves forward.'' Akerman's signature
style is the long traveling shot. In ``La Captive,'' it tracks the
movements through Paris of a young woman in a floral print dress,
and evokes the narrator's libidinal fixations.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Proust's iconic stature in French culture may explain why to
date there have been no French film interpretations. Adlon and
Schlondorff are German; Akerman is Belgian, though she has lived in
France for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of some 60 films, Ruiz (a Chilean who moved to
Paris in the 1970s) has cultivated a surrealist sensibility far
removed from the conventions of period drama and the salons of the
Belle Epoque. But ``Time Regained'' is a summation of themes that
have preoccupied him throughout his career, from the theoretical
rigors of ``Hypothesis of a Stolen Painting'' (1978) to more recent
thrillers like ``Genealogies of a Crime'' (1996): a fascination
with doubles and the uncanny, memory and childhood, the visual arts
and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   His Proust is imbued with a narrative self-consciousness that
owes much to the author Jorge Luis Borges. But Ruiz also is able to
train an almost ethnographic eye on Parisian habits and manners.
Among his reference points for ``Time Regained'' were Edward
Curtis' sepia-toned, early-20th-century portraits of Native
Americans, in which grandeur combines with the threat of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to explore what it's like to be a member of a
tribe,'' he explained. ``These French aristocrats, with their
boredom and their rituals. I tried to describe the behavior of that
tiny part of society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Regained'' opens in 1922 as Proust (played by Marcello
Mazzarella, an Italian actor who bears a striking resemblance to
the writer) lies on his deathbed, attended by the faithful Celeste.
He regards a series of photographs of figures in his life through a
magnifying glass.
</P>
<P>
   Subtly, the furniture in his room starts moving, and we are
carried back in time to Parisian soirees during World War I, where,
far from the front lines where men were dying, the upper classes
drank Champagne and listened to Beethoven. The infidelities of
Robert de Saint-Loup (Pascal Greggory), who betrays his wife
Gilberte (Emmanuelle Beart) with both the actress Rachel (Elsa
Zylberstein) and the arriviste violinist Morel (Vincent Perez); the
ghosts of the narrator's childhood love for Gilberte and his adult
passion for Albertine; the social ambitions and artistic
pretensions of Mme. Verdurin (Marie-France Pisier); the lingering
vanity of Odette; the strange sexual proclivities of the Baron de
Charlus (John Malkovich); and the stench of death which hangs
equally over soldiers on leave from the trenches and le tout Paris
arrayed for an elegant matinee concert; all these memories swarm
around the narrator. The effect is like a piece of music, a gradual
building of a sense of loss and time's passing, combined with a
fanatical devotion to detail and a gently ironic regard for human
frailty.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz reflected upon the author's perennial fascination. ``There
are Proustians who have nothing to do with the world of Proust,''
Ruiz said. ``Myself, for example. But also, Taiwanese dentists,
African economists, rock stars, and others. One of the characters
in Jack Kerouac's `On the Road,' either Sal Paradise or Dean
Moriarty, is continually reading Proust while he's working in a
parking lot. You can apply a Proustian vision to almost any
context. My explanation is that Proust teaches you a way to look at
your own life, and that the life of any human being is incredibly
rich.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft
Corp. on Wednesday, saying the severe remedy was necessary because
Microsoft ``has proved untrustworthy in the past'' and did not
appear to accept his ruling that it had broadly violated the
nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that
Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as
it has in the past and may yet do to other markets what it has
already done'' to dominate operating systems and Internet software,
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson said in his final
ruling in the long-running trial.
</P>
<P>
   Under his order, Microsoft would be broken into separate and
competing companies, one for its Windows operating system and one
for its other computer programs and Internet businesses. Microsoft
would also be forced to comply with a long list of restrictions on
its conduct that would last three years, if the breakup order
withstands appeal, and 10 years if it does not.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's order stays the breakup plan, but not the other
measures, while an appeal proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   The government charged, and the judge agreed, that Microsoft
used its monopoly in operating systems to put competitors at a
disadvantage and stifle innovation.
</P>
<P>
   And in surprisingly assertive language, Jackson accepted the
government's remedy proposal in its entirety, attaching it to his
ruling _ utterly rejecting Microsoft's repeated assertions that the
breakup plan was ``draconian,'' ``unwarranted'' and ``bad for
consumers, the high tech industry and our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft said it would take the case to the Court of Appeals,
filing the papers within a few days, while the government said it
would seek to bypass that court and ask immediate review by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman, called the judge's ruling ``an
unwarranted and unjustified intrusion into the software
marketplace, a marketplace that has been an engine of economic
growth for America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that someone would say that a breakup is a reasonable
thing comes as quite a surprise to us,'' Gates added. ``We have a
very strong case on appeal, and we look forward to resolving these
issues through the appeals process and putting this case behind us
once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates was in Washington on Tuesday, planning to meet with
lawmakers Wednesday. But anticipating the ruling, he canceled the
meetings and hurriedly flew back to Seattle overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, smiling broadly, said Wednesday
afternoon that the ruling ``will have a profound impact, not only
by promoting competition in the software industry, but also by
reaffirming the importance of antitrust law enforcement in the 21st
century.'' And Joel I. Klein, head of the department's antitrust
division, said, ``Microsoft itself is responsible for where things
stand today.''
</P>
<P>
   If the judge's order withstands appeal and Microsoft is
eventually broken up, it would join the ranks of only a handful of
major national monopolies that have been taken apart over the last
90 years as the result of antitrust violations, including Standard
Oil, American Tobacco and the Aluminum Co. of America.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, speaking on behalf of the 19
states that are partners with the Justice Department in the suit,
said the ruling ``sends a strong message that no company is above
the law.'' (Two of the 19 states, Illinois and Ohio, declined to
support the breakup plan.)
</P>
<P>
   While appealing the judge's verdict, Microsoft will also ask for
an immediate stay of all the remedy provisions. If the request is
rejected, Microsoft must begin complying with the restrictions on
its conduct by Sept. 7 and submit a detailed plan for dividing the
company in two by Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson's encouragement, the Justice Department announced
Wednesday evening that it would take the case directly to the
Supreme Court, under a 1974 revision to the federal antitrust laws
allowing fast-track consideration of significant antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft opposes the direct appeal to the Supreme Court,
preferring to take its case first to the Court of Appeals, which
ruled in its favor in a related lawsuit two years ago and reversed
a decision by Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Supreme Court would even take the case is at best
uncertain. Microsoft argued Wednesday evening that the suit filed
by the states would not be eligible for expedited appeal because
the states have no similar law. In that case, the states' appeal
would be taken to the Court of Appeals. But state and federal
officials said the cases were joined for trial, and it would make
no sense to separate them for differing legal appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The officials acknowledged that the point of law was ambiguous.
But Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal, said ``today's
victory vindicates and soundly validates our decisions as state law
enforcement officers to join this historic action.''
</P>
<P>
   If the conduct remedies were allowed to take effect, computer
manufacturers would be allowed to offer customized versions of
Windows on their computers in ways they never could before. And
future versions of Windows would be offered in a form that allows
buyers to accept certain new features Microsoft chooses to offer _
or to decide they do not want them and use a competing product.
</P>
<P>
   It was Microsoft's decision four years to tie a Web browser to
Windows that prompted the investigation and lawsuit that led to
Wednesday's breakup order.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some years from now, if the government's remedy plan works as
intended, consumers might also begin to see alternate operating
systems on sale that are competitive with Windows, as Apple
Computer's operating system is now. If that occurs, the broad
compatibility among personal computers that now exists may begin to
erode.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson issued his ruling at 4:30 Wednesday afternoon, just
after the markets had closed. His decision had been widely
expected, and investors appeared to have already taken the break up
plan into account. Microsoft stock was up 88 cents Wednesday, to
close at $70.50.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked at press conference Wednesday if he had any regrets, Gates
said: ``If I look back at anything, I think, perhaps I should have
taken the opportunity to go in person and talk about this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Gates might be called as a witness was a continuing
question hanging over the antitrust trial. His halting, obdurate
performance during a videotaped deposition proved to be a powerful
tool for the government in court.
</P>
<P>
   While Jackson accepted the remedy plan put together by the
federal and state governments, his endorsement was not unequivocal.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, he noted that the plan was the collective work of
senior state and federal officials ``in conjunction with multiple
consultants.'' And, ``it appears to the court to address the
principal objectives of relief in such cases, namely to terminate
the unlawful conduct, to prevent its repetition in the future and
to revive competition in the relevant markets.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, he added, even though several experts
have provided ``some insight as to how the provisions'' of the
remedy might work, ``for the most part they are merely the
predictions of purportedly knowledgeable people as to effects which
may or may not ensue if the proposed final judgment is entered. In
its experience, the court has found testimonial predictions of
future events generally less reliable even than testimony as to
historical fact.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft leveled serious criticism at the judge Wednesday
evening for his decision to hold no substantive hearings on the
government's remedy proposal, saying the company was surprised by
the scope of the plan and ill equipped to respond to it in the six
weeks since it was offered.
</P>
<P>
   But in his order Wednesday, Jackson retorted: ``Microsoft's
profession of surprise is not credible. From the inception of this
case Microsoft knew, from well-established Supreme Court precedents
dating from the beginning of the last century, that a mandated
divestiture was a possibility, if not a probability, in the event
of an adverse result at trial.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the government first made plain to Microsoft during
settlement negotiations a year ago that it planned to ask for a
so-called structural remedy. That was repeated during mediation
efforts by a federal judge early this year, though the government
ultimately offered terms short of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also explained why he moved through the remedy phase
so quickly, noting that he wanted to pass the case to a higher
court as soon as possible for validation, revision or rejection of
his decision, ``to abort any remedial measures before they become
irreversible as a practical matter.''
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, the judge said he could hold hearings later or
``modify the judgement as necessary in accordance with instructions
from an appellate court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson noted, with some apparent irritation, that after he
ruled April 3 that Microsoft was in wide violation of the nation's
antitrust laws, Microsoft's leaders continued to assert that ``the
company has done 'nothing wrong' and that it will be vindicated on
appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is well aware,'' he added, ``that there is a
substantial body of public opinion, some of it rational, that holds
a similar view. If true then an appellate tribunal should be given
an opportunity to confirm it as promptly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's continued assertions of innocence were one reason
for his ruling, he said. Another, he added, was that ``Microsoft
has shown no disposition to voluntarily alter its business
protocols in any significant respect.''
</P>
<P>
   And a third reason, he explained, was that ``Microsoft has
proved untrustworthy in the past.'' As an example, he referred to
the precedent case he tried in the fall of 1997, when the Justice
Department charged Microsoft with illegally tying a Web browser to
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, Jackson issued a preliminary injunction,
ordering Microsoft to separate the two products. That was the
ruling later overturned by the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Microsoft's purported compliance while it was on appeal,''
Jackson said Wednesday, ``was illusory and its explanation
disingenuous.''

JUDGE ORDERS MICROSOFT BROKEN INTO TWO SEPARATE COMPANIES  

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Microsoft, the software giant whose products are found
on nearly all personal computers, was ordered broken into two
separate companies Wednesday by a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Unless halted by appeals, Microsoft must present to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson a plan to split itself into
two entities.
</P>
<P>
   One business would develop and market operating systems, the
software handling the basic functions of a computer. The other
would handle Microsoft's line of programs, including the ubiquitous
Office productivity suite.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first court-ordered breakup of a major U.S.
corporation since the 1984 divestiture of AT&AMP;T, and it concludes a
contentious two-year battle between the Redmond, Wash.-based
company and the Justice Department in alliance with the attorneys
general from 19 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's order today is the right remedy for Microsoft's
serious and repeated violations of antitrust laws,'' said Assistant
Attorney General Joel Klein, who prosecuted Justice's case.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft co-founder and Chairman Bill Gates said the company
would appeal immediately, seeking a stay on both the divestiture
and a series of restrictions that Penfield ordered take place
immediately. That appeal will be aimed at a Washington, D.C.,
appellate court that has been friendly to Microsoft in past cases
</P>
<P>
   But Justice officials said they will pursue a little-used
statute that allows for an expedited appeal directly to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Gates called the decision ``an unwarranted and unjustified
intrusion into the software marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling says to creators of intellectual property that the
government can take away what you've created if it proves too
popular,'' he said during a news conference at Microsoft's
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded decision, Jackson called Microsoft
``untrustworthy,'' citing the company's failure to adhere to
consent decrees in previous antitrust cases. The judge also said
that Microsoft should have known this was coming after attempts to
settle failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final judgment proposed by plaintiffs is perhaps more
radical than might have resulted had mediation been successful and
terminated in a consent decree,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, if not struck down by appeals and stays sought by
Microsoft, takes place in stages.
</P>
<P>
   The divestiture order is stayed pending the appeals process, but
Microsoft is far from off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   In 90 days, a series of restrictions on Microsoft's behavior
will kick in. Attorneys for the company said some of the
restrictions could be as damaging as the breakup itself.
</P>
<P>
   They include:
</P>
<P>
   --Requiring Microsoft to disclose technical details about the
inner workings of its operating systems to those wanting to write
software for them. Competitors had complained that Microsoft had
secret ``hooks'' in Windows that it used to make its applications
perform better.
</P>
<P>
   --Barring Microsoft from charging varying prices for Windows to
different customers in the computer industry. The company had been
accused of charging more for the operating system to those who
didn't do as Microsoft wished.
</P>
<P>
   --Allowing PC makers to customize Windows by adding to, changing
or even removing components. Microsoft was accused of strong-arming
manufacturers such as Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. to ensure
that Windows was installed in a certain way.
</P>
<P>
   --Barring Microsoft from including code in its programs that
would hurt the performance of competing products. Competitors
charged Microsoft deliberately designed products that would hamper
the way other programs work.
</P>
<P>
   --Restricting Microsoft from including new programs, which the
court called ``middleware,'' in the Windows operating system unless
consumers and manufacturers could easily remove them.
</P>
<P>
   This last requirement cuts to the heart of the government's case
against Microsoft. The Justice Department argued during the trial
that Microsoft used its monopoly power in operating systems to gain
a foothold in the market for World Wide Web browsers.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Jackson said that Microsoft's refusal to admit
that it had broken any laws and its behavior when under past
consent decrees indicated that ``structural changes'' to the
company is the best remedy.
</P>
<P>
   During the news conference, Microsoft attorney William Neukom
said a full appeal would be filed ``in a matter of days'' with the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that court had overturned a previous ruling by Jackson
in June 1998, and predicted that both the restrictions and the
breakup order would be struck down by those justices.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom said Microsoft's appeal would rely heavily on the fact
that the company had not been allowed to call witnesses in the
remedies phase of the case, in which the government was pressing
for a breakup of the company. Among those Microsoft wanted to
testify was Compaq Chief Executive Michael Capellas.
</P>
<P>
   Neukom said Microsoft would oppose the government's attempt to
take the case directly to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft loses its appeals process, the company's split
would be along the lines proposed by the Justice Department after
Microsoft lost a conclusions of law ruling from Jackson. The ruling
restricts how much the two entities could interact.
</P>
<P>
   One company would have control over the various versions of
Windows. Microsoft makes operating systems that run on PCs, TV set
top boxes, handheld computers, telephones and even computers built
into the dashboards of cars.
</P>
<P>
   The other company would own the rights to Microsoft's extensive
portfolio of programs, ranging from the Excel spreadsheet and Word
word processing program to its children's software and the popular
Flight Simulator game.
</P>
<P>
   That applications company would also have the rights to the
controversial Internet Explorer browser, which currently doubles as
the user interface for Windows 98, Windows 2000 and the
soon-to-be-released Windows Millennium Edition.
</P>
<P>
   While the application business would be able to license the
rights to use Internet Explorer to the operating system company,
the latter would not be able to change it or develop a browser on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers had widely divergent views about what effect
the ruling will have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think it matters,'' Michael Fitzgerald, editor of Red
Herring, a magazine that tracks the technology and electronic
commerce industries. ``Nothing will happen for the next couple of
years while the case winds its way through the appeals courts. Even
beyond that, we don't think it would alter how Microsoft operates
all that much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft could be more powerful as two companies than it can
as one,'' said Rob Enderle, an analyst with Giga Information Group.
``Right now they are self-limiting.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous outcome of all, Enderle said, is for
Microsoft to fight the verdict for 18 months _ and lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you fight to the death, you end up dead, especially when
you are fighting the government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A national firm specializing in outplacement of employees agrees
that a protracted battle would create an atmosphere of uncertainty
at Microsoft that could hurt the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will want to sign with a company with a publicly discussed
uncertain future?'' said John A. Challenger, chief executive at
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas.``Microsoft's human resource
management will have the enormous task of retaining the workforce,
no matter how loyal they have been in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   A weakened Microsoft could provide a significant opportunity for
hardware makers able to break out of Microsoft's control. Companies
such as Compaq could benefit by being able add new features and
differentiate themselves more from competitors, said Chris LeTocq,
a research director at The Gartner Group, a technology market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Compaq was not in a celebratory mood Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compaq opposes any effort toward the breakup of Microsoft,''
said company spokesman Alan Hodel.

STUDY FINDS RACIAL DISPARITY IN SENTENCING FOR NARCOTICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Md., La., N.J., N.C., S.C, Va., Texas, Okla.)   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nearly twice as many black men and women are being
imprisoned for drug offenses than are whites, even though studies
show that there are five times more white drug users than black
ones, an international human rights organization said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Human Rights Watch joins a growing body of
evidence compiled by liberal advocacy groups showing racial
disparities in the country's soaring prison population. That
population has quadrupled since 1980 and is expected to surpass 2
million next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These racial disparities are a national scandal,'' Ken Roth,
executive director of Human Rights Watch said. ``Black and white
drug offenders get radically different treatment in the American
justice system. This is not only profoundly unfair to blacks, it
also corrodes the American ideal of equal justice for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that the overwhelming bulk of the increase in
the prison population could be attributed to drug offenses. The
report said 62.7 percent of drug offenders sent to prison in 1996,
the last year for which complete statistics were available, were
African-American, while 36.7 percent were white.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau estimates that blacks currently make up about
12.8 percent of the population and that whites, including Hispanic
whites, are about 82.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While the Human Rights Watch underlined the racial disparities
in the criminal justice system, other experts in the field said the
issue was more complicated than racism.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at the Bureau of Criminal Justice Statistics, a division
of the Justice Department, say that while studies indicate there
are five times as many white users of illegal drugs as black users,
drug abuse among African-Americans tends to be more chronic and
involve harder drugs such as crack cocaine and heroin.
</P>
<P>
   Studies suggest black incarceration rates are still being fueled
by the crack epidemic of the 1980s, which helped produce a cadre of
chronic drug users, most of whom are above the age of 30. Many of
these abusers have either been imprisoned for long sentences or
have been in and out of a criminal justice system that fails to
provide very much in the way of drug treatment, said Gen. Barry R.
McCaffrey, director of the White House Office of National Drug
Control Policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of how severe you wish to be on punishing them, you
simply have to give them a drug-free prison environment,''
McCaffrey said. ``And there has to be a follow-on component. That,
I would allege is the largest issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Wednesday's report, Human Rights Watch based its study on
prison admissions statistics in 1996. States voluntarily provide
statistics to the Justice Department, and the study does not
include figures for the 13 states that chose not to report
statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In much of the country, though, the report paints a picture of
stark disparities. In Illinois and Maryland, Africans-Americans
represent 90 percent of those who were incarcerated for selling or
using drugs. In five other states _ Louisiana, New Jersey, North
Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia _ blacks make up more than 80
percent of those imprisoned on drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Because so many African-Americans have been convicted of drug
crimes and sent to prison, 7 percent of all black people living in
Texas and Oklahoma are behind bars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Human Rights Watch point to a myriad of causes
for the disproportionately high number of blacks incarcerated for
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   They note that because so much of the drug activity in poor
black neighborhoods is conducted on the street, sellers and users
are easier to spot and arrest. In addition, they contend that law
enforcement agencies direct much of their resources to combating
drug activity in black areas, rather than in white neighborhoods
where drug sales and use tend to occur behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   Also low-income African-Americans often cannot afford lawyers to
win them more lenient sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Human Rights officials say, the numbers of
African-Americans being sent to prison far out of line with the
proportion of blacks and whites shown in studies to use and sell
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And they say that the disparities need to be addressed by
politicians, including the two presidential contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think racial disparities in the criminal justice system is
like the elephant in the room that no one is talking about,'' said
Jamie Fellner, associate counsel of Human Rights Watch and the
report's author. ``I find it incomprehensible that neither of the
presidential candidates is talking about this. There still is a
timidity to say anything that would lend them being accused of
being soft on crime. Nobody is willing to say enough is enough.'' &QL;

OSUNA STRUGGLES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Dodgers needed Antonio Osuna on Wednesday
afternoon. But his head was still in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who got the loss Sunday against the Angels, took over for
Darren Dreifort to begin the eighth inning. The Dodgers held on to
win 11-6, but Osuna again didn't pitch well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked four in the Angels game and I was still thinking
about that,'' said Osuna, who faced just four batters on Wednesday,
retired only one and allowed two runs. ``I felt good, but I
couldn't make the pitches. I tried too hard not to mess up and I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   With closer Jeff Shaw just coming back from shoulder trouble and
Mike Fetters still unable to pitch on back-to-back days, the
Dodgers were hoping Osuna could close out the game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson had to pull him almost
immediately. Johnson wound up using Shaw in the ninth in a non-save
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hadn't pitched in a while so I figured he'd be strong,''
Johnson said of Osuna. ``But he didn't have any pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, once projected as the team's closer, returned from the
disabled list May 5 after missing most of the past two years with
elbow problems. With six other relievers, Osuna has been in a
position to ease his way back. But with Shaw struggling, Wednesday
was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me the problem today was more mental than anything,'' Osuna
said. ``I have to stop worrying about the walks and just throw.''
</P>
<P>
   CORA STAYS HOT: Dodgers rookie shortstop Alex Cora had two more
hits Wednesday and scored three times. He was 4 for 9 in the last
two games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Opening-day shortstop Kevin Elster could be back by the weekend
from a tender groin. Adrian Beltre is eligible to return from a
strained hamstring on Monday but could be out a while longer.
</P>
<P>
   Elster probably will move to third and Cora will stay at short.
But what happens to Cora when Beltre returns?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a day-to-day situation,'' Johnson said. ``Cora is playing
great. We don't have to make a decision right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre remained in Los Angeles during the Texas trip and began
light running. But he still hasn't taken batting practice and
Johnson said it's unlikely he'll be ready Monday.
</P>
<P>
   SUSPENSION HEARING DATES: Paul Beeston, chief operating officer
for major-league baseball, will hear arguments June 20-22 in
Houston from the 16 Dodgers players and three coaches suspended for
the May 16 fight at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 89 games in suspensions and $77,000 in fines were
handed down by Frank Robinson, baseball's vice president of
on-field operations. But Beeston is expected to reduce and in some
cases wipe out the penalties imposed on the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS: Left-hander Trever Miller, who was designated for
assignment after posting a 23.14 ERA in two games with the Dodgers,
has cleared waivers and was outrighted to Triple-A Albuquerque. ...
Rangers starter Rick Helling, who appeared to regain the form that
led to 20 victories in 1998, was battered by the Dodgers. Entering
the game fourth in the AL with a 3.45 ERA, Helling allowed seven
runs and a career-high 11 hits in five-plus innings. ... Texas
catcher Ivan Rodriguez might be the AL MVP but he also leads the
league grounding into 15 double plays. He had two more Wednesday
and also had his second passed ball of the year. Rodriguez had one
all last season. ... Gabe Kapler, the Taft High product who was
part of the Juan Gonzalez trade with Detroit, wound up a brief
rehab assignment (partial tear right quad) Wednesday night. He went
6 for 8 in the first two games, with two homers. The Rangers
already have made plans to bring him back, sending out pitcher
Jonathan Johnson, who pitched three innings Wednesday. &QL;

SUCCESS OF CHRISTIAN THRILLER REFLECTS RISING INTEREST IN RELIGIOUS
FICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEATON, Ill. _ The latest thriller in a hugely popular
Christian fundamentalist series about the Apocalypse will enter the
New York Times fiction best-seller list at No. 1 on Sunday, an
unparalleled achievement for an evangelical novel.
</P>
<P>
   The book, ``The Indwelling: The Beast Takes Possession,'' by Tim
F. LaHaye, a retired evangelical minister, and Jerry B. Jenkins, a
professional writer, is the seventh installment in the ``Left
Behind'' series, which in the last five years has sold some 17
million copies in the United States, about three million less than
the Harry Potter series. In April, before its official publication,
it reached No. 1 on the Amazon.com best-seller list, based on
advance orders.
</P>
<P>
   On the Times fiction best-seller list, it is displacing ``Easy
Prey,'' a detective novel by John Sandford. The authors of ``The
Indwelling,'' who say they have so far made $10 million each from
the series, are on a 10-city tour, and their stop in this college
town last weekend had all the panoply of a revival meeting. They
attracted 900 people who paid $12 to $25 each to hear them talk
about the book in a Wheaton College auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye and Jenkins were accompanied by a retinue of 17,
including a blind singer, Ginny Owens, and a singer-guitarist,
Wayne Watson, who played with a throbbing rock sound as the authors
sat on thronelike black leather chairs bathed in cyclamen-colored
lights. Two huge candelabra lent the scene a ``Phantom of the
Opera'' ambience as they took questions from a rapt audience.
</P>
<P>
   The latest book combines traditional elements of science fiction
with the authors' unorthodox interpretation of the Book of
Revelation to create a Rambo-style potboiler with a strong
conservative ethos and noticeably contemporary characters who drive
Range Rovers, use the Internet and have everyday worries.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the series is Rayford Steele, a married commercial
airline pilot who in an early scene in the first book flirts with a
stewardess and minutes later discovers that more than 100 of his
passengers have disappeared in midflight. As it turns out, his
devout wife and son have vanished, too. All of them have, in
evangelical parlance, ``accepted Christ'' and have been summoned by
Jesus to the Rapture, a precursor to the Apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Indwelling,'' Steele is suspected by the authorities of
assassinating Nicolae Carpathia, the Antichrist, a former secretary
general of the United Nations. But the false god is resurrected,
battle rages between Heaven and Earth, and the Beast takes control
again.
</P>
<P>
   Since its publication on May 23, the book has sold 1.9 million
copies. ``This is a phenomenal number of books we're talking
about,'' said Daisy Maryles, executive editor of Publishers Weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The book's remarkable success reflects a rising interest in
religious fiction among not only among fundamentalists but a
broader audience as well, and the growing popularity of such pop
genres as Christian rock. The Times bestseller list does not take
into account sales from Christian, or other specialized,
bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really love the character development and the real people,
and you can relate to them,'' said Drid Wilson, who came to the
event at Wheaton College with her husband and two children. Best of
all, she said, ``there's hope for a Second Coming.''
</P>
<P>
   To capitalize on the book's potential, the book's Christian
publisher, Tyndale House, has advertised not only in Christian
trade publications but also on ``The Rush Limbaugh Show'' and other
conservative radio programs and in USA Today as well. It has
financed special displays in general-interest bookstores and
superstores like Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the five-year-old series seemed propelled by the
national fixation on the year 2000, with its apocalyptic themes.
But even though interest in the millennium has died down, ``The
Indwelling'' is doing better than previous books in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of the series may be unprecedented, but it is by no means
the only Christian novel to achieve big numbers. The novels of such
contemporary writers as Janette Oke and Frank Peretti have sold
millions of copies.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream book critics have been less than overwhelmed by the
series. ``The books read like artifacts of a time machine sent to
retrieve pulp science fiction _ and our morality _ from the 50s,''
Douglas E. Winter wrote in a review in The Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Left Behind'' books reflect the apocalyptic beliefs of
LaHaye, Jenkins and other fundamentalists. They say that their
interpretation of the Book of Revelation is a literal one. Their
belief is often referred to as ``pre-millennial
dispensationalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Under this teaching, the Rapture will be followed by a
seven-year period of Tribulation and the rule of the Antichrist,
who will establish a single world government and monetary system.
(The authors believe the United Nations and the euro are signs of
the impending Tribulation.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tribulation will culminate in an Apocalypse and the Second
Coming of Christ. Christ will reign for 1,000 years; there will be
another great battle and then, the creation of a new Heaven on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Like many fundamentalists, LaHaye and Jenkins say that before
the Second Coming can occur, there must be an ``indwelling'' of
Jews to Israel. During the tour stop at Wheaton College, an
interdenominational Christian college, LaHaye explained that this
had come to pass with the founding of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One hero of ``The Indwelling'' is Tsion Ben-Judah, the spiritual
leader of the Tribulation Force, a Jew by birth who has accepted
Christ as the Messiah. He announces his conversion on international
television. LaHaye says that according to his interpretation of the
Book of Revelation, 144,000 Jews must be converted to Christianity
after the Rapture, before the Second Coming can occur.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that this view was abhorrent to many Jews.
``Jews have a deep-rooted conviction that the Messiah has yet to
come,'' he said.`` They will not accept Jesus as the Messiah.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Roman Catholics and mainstream Protestants do not have this
level of fascination with the end of time or focus on this
elaborate and literal prediction of events. Nor do most mainstream
denominations focus on the conversion of Jews, particularly since
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with its enormous popularity, the ``Left Behind'' series may
ultimately ``influence the theology'' of Christian end-time belief,
said Charles Strozier, author of ``Apocalypse: On the Psychology of
Fundamentalism in America'' (Beacon, 1994), and a professor of
history at John Jay College of Criminal Justice and the City
University of New York Graduate Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the textual evidence is so slim, it lends itself to
elaboration by interpretation,'' he said. ``Vivid factual
interpreters selling millions and millions of copies are adding
something important.''
</P>
<P>
   Several explanations have been offered for the books' success:
the readers' identification with recurring characters, the
popularity of the action-adventure genre in general, and the belief
of large numbers of Americans in the Rapture and the eventual
return of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, there are characters who are recognizably human
living through supernatural times. Contemplating the disappearance
of millions during the Rapture, Steele, the airplane pilot,
reflects: ``Everyone had lost someone, and not a second could pass
when one was able to forget that. It was the fear of missing the
school bus, losing your homework, forgetting your gym clothes,
knowing you'd been caught cheating on a test, being called to the
principal's office, being fired, going bankrupt, cheating on your
wife _ all rolled into one.''
</P>
<P>
   In another passage, a character experiments ``with five-minute
catnaps every few minutes, fearing he would otherwise sleep through
the resurrection of the Antichrist.''
</P>
<P>
   LaHaye, 74, a soft-spoken evangelical minister from Palm Desert,
Calif., attended Bob Jones University in Greenville, S.C. He calls
himself ``a prophecy scholar,'' and has established three churches,
a Christian school system and the Christian Heritage College with
900 students, all in the San Diego area.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins, 50, of Colorado Springs, Colo., helped write Billy
Graham's memoir ``Just As I Am,'' and is the author of best-selling
sports books, including one with Orel Hersheiser, the baseball
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our message is the greatest message of hope in this world,''
LaHaye said in the interview. ``There is a new age coming resulting
in the coming of the most benevolent King of Kings, who's already
demonstrated his compassion by dying on the cross.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jenkins, who has a self-deprecating sense of humor, said:
``There are some times when I think I was born for this project.
Other times I think I was born to play golf.'' He called the drama
inherent in Revelation ``a novelist's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep pace with the demand for ``The Indwelling,'' Tyndale
House has built a new warehouse at its headquarters in Carol
Stream, Ill. Four printing plants worked for 40 days around the
clock and 79 semi-trailer trucks were required to deliver the first
print run of two million books to the warehouse. The series also
includes children's and audio books.
</P>
<P>
   The next novel in the projected 12-book series is ``The Mark,''
already completed and scheduled to be published on Nov. 14. A movie
based on ``Left Behind,'' adapted by Alan B. McElroy, a writer for
the 1997 horror movie ``Spawn,'' is to be filmed by a small
independent production company in partnership with a producer of
Christian videos and is scheduled for release next February.
</P>
<P>
   The authors say that business matters less than the testimonials
of people who say have ``received Christ'' by reading their books.
``We've heard from more than 2,000 people who tell us that,'' said
Jenkins. They say they have donated nearly half their earnings to
religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage at Wheaton College, where he and his co-author were
interviewed by Mike Trout, the co-host with Dr. James Dobson of the
radio program ``Focus on the Family,'' Jenkins told of receiving a
letter from a man on death row in Texas who was scheduled for
execution last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I've read `Apollyon''' _ the fifth book in the
series _ ``and I've grown in the Lord. The problem is I would like
to read `Assassins,''' _ the sixth book,'' a volume that had not
yet been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called our good friends in Tyndale House and they rushed a
copy to him,'' Jenkins said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The man has still not been executed, but LaHaye says that if he
has accepted Christ, he will go to heaven. &QL;

EXPERTS WARN ABOUT READING TOO MUCH INTO POLLS AT THIS STAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Politicians are fond of saying the only poll that
counts is on election day.
</P>
<P>
   But five months before the presidential election, the public is
being swamped with surveys telling them exactly what they think
about Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Media pundits and political campaigns often seize upon such
polls to validate their perceptions about whether candidates are
gaining momentum or backsliding.
</P>
<P>
   A raft of May polls showing Gore slipping behind Bush were cited
as evidence that the vice president's campaign had lost its footing
and that the Texas governor had recovered from a rough primary.
</P>
<P>
   However, a crop of new polls finding the race a statistical dead
heat has prompted some analysts to opine that Gore may have halted
the hemorrhaging and Bush may have peaked.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to spin poll results their way, Bush campaign aides
briefed reporters in Austin this week to stress that the Texas
governor has led in the vast majority of surveys since the Super
Tuesday primary in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does this give us confidence that we've been right in
executing the plan in the way we have? Does it give us confidence
that if we continue to execute it the way that we have that we have
a good shot at it (the election)? You bet,'' said a high level
strategist to Bush, a candidate who regularly proclaims on the
stump that he would not govern by the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign, which like the Bush campaign has professional
pollsters on the payroll, has not brandished poll results in media
briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane accused the Bush campaign of being
``obsessed'' with polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Polls go up. Polls go down. They are merely a moving
picture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And experts warn about reading too much into polls at this early
stage, when much of the public is spending more time pondering
summer vacations than presidential options.
</P>
<P>
   They say that voters will tune into the presidential race during
the national political conventions in late July and August and
begin to firm up their voting intentions around Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientists argue that other factors, particularly
public satisfaction with the economy, have historically been more
indicative of whether voters will reward the candidate whose party
currently controls the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The polls today just don't tell you a lot about what is going
to happen in November,'' said Christopher Wlezien, a political
scientist at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Wlezien, along with Columbia University Professor Robert S.
Erikson, has developed a forecasting model that uses economic data
and presidential approval rates to determine who will win the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the the booming economy and President Clinton's high
approval rating at the beginning of this year, Wlezien's model has
predicted that Gore will win with 56.1 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes toward Bush are less relevant than how voters feel
about the performance of the current administration, Wlezien said,
because the election is largely a referendum on the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We either stay the course or we change,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 Wlezien was only slightly off in his prediction that,
excluding Reform Party candidate Ross Perot, Clinton would beat Bob
Dole with with 54.5 percent of the vote. In the two-way match-up
Clinton actually took 54.6 percent of the vote _ though in total
votes Clinton fell below 50 percent both times he was elected. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But some pollsters scoff at the notion that presidential
elections are determined by historical trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we only relied on history to make predictions, then nothing
new would happen,'' said Andy Kohut, the director of the Pew
Research Center Poll, whose May results had Gore trailing Bush by a
statistically insignificant one percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut said his polls show that while respondents are giving
Clinton credit for the good economy, they do not transfer that good
will to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the polls are bouncing around right now because
many voters still are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   However, Frank Newport of the Gallup Poll says that despite
slight variations in polls, the basic dynamics of the race have not
changed. He said Bush was ahead of Gore last year and has remained
so through the spring, although by a smaller margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup Poll taken at the end of May had Bush leading Gore 49
percent to 42 percent
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters agree that just looking at horse race numbers is not
enough. They say that response to the question of whether voters
believe the country is headed in the right or wrong direction is
helpful in gauging the depth of support for the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   For example, even though June 1992 polls showed President Bush
ahead of Clinton, only about 14 percent of those surveyed by Gallup
said they were satisfied with the way things were going.
</P>
<P>
   Bush eventually lost the election, which political observers
attributed largely to voters' unhappiness with the sour economy.
The most recent Gallup poll found that 55 percent were satisfied
with the direction of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters also point to the favorable-unfavorable ratings of
candidates as a gauge of how the public is responding to more
intangible aspects of a candidate, such as his character and
likability
</P>
<P>
   In the latest Gallup Poll, Bush scored slightly better than Gore
on this measure, with 61 percent of voters giving him favorable
marks and 33 percent unfavorable. Gore had 53 percent favorable and
38 percent unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   Newport said that polls at this stage are not intended to be
predictive but rather ``here's where this race stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the vast majority of the presidential elections since
1936, the contender who was ahead in the June or late spring Gallup
Polls went on to win the White House.
</P>
<P>
   However, these polls were an accurate predictor in only one of
the three elections involving sitting vice presidents, who often
have trouble emerging from the shadow of the president until the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960 John F. Kennedy was slightly ahead of Vice President
Richard Nixon in the June polls and went on to win in a cliffhanger
election.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later Vice President Hubert Humphrey was ahead of
Nixon in the early polls but lost in the close 1968 contest. And in
1988 Vice President Bush trailed Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis
in June but later beat him by a healthy margin.
</P>
<P>
   Experts note that it is important to look not just at national
surveys but at state polls, particularly in traditional
battleground states, since the presidential outcome actually is
determined on a state-by-state basis under the Electoral College
system.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are close in a number of swing states that
Clinton won in 1996 including Michigan, Illinois, New Jersey and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   A tally of state polls _ some of them several months old _ by
The Hotline, an on-line political newsletter, found that Bush led
in 26 states with 282 electoral voters while Gore led in 13 states
with 178 electoral votes. To win, a candidates must get 270
electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Independent polls also provide insight into the behavior of
campaigns, which track their progress through their own private
surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The internal polling often ``drives what candidates are doing,''
said pollster John Zogby.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when polls showed Bush losing support among
independents after his primary battle with John McCain, the Texas
governor quickly tried to move back to the middle by proposing a
number of of initiatives aimed at moderate voters.
</P>
<P>
   And after recent polls detected Gore's support among women
waning after his harsh attacks on Bush, the vice president toned
down his rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the year Zogby's polls have bounced from
double digit leads for Bush to a one-point advantage in a survey
released late last week. The New York-based pollster said he now
believes Bush may have peaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard for me to see Gore losing this race,'' he
said. But he added, considering the strong economy, the vice
president should be doing better in the polls. ``He really ought to
be clobbering the guy.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The centerpiece of the government's cure for the
predatory, monopolistic, take-no-prisoners behavior that Microsoft
was found to have embraced is to chop the company in two.
</P>
<P>
   One new company would make the Windows operating system, the
other would make the applications that are run by the operating
system, as well as Microsoft's Internet and computer hardware
businesses. The government called the companies ``Ops Co.'' and
``Apps Co.'' in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decree is sustained on
appeal, Microsoft would not be able to keep the vow made in court
by its lawyer, John L. Warden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not acquiesce in our own commercial demise,'' Warden
declared.
</P>
<P>
   If not acquiescing, Microsoft would at least have to cooperate
in radical surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Microsoft is granted a stay pending appeal, it must give
Jackson and the Justice Department's antitrust division a
reorganization plan by early October.
</P>
<P>
   So Microsoft, which consisted of three people and had sales of
$16,000 in its first year, 1975, and now has 36,000 employees and
annual sales of $20 billion, would cease to exist in its present
form.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's decree spelled out how the present Microsoft must
behave toward other companies and how the new companies that would
arise from it, must behave toward each other and toward other
companies, some of which have been bitter competitors or even
adversaries in court.
</P>
<P>
   Once Microsoft submits its proposed plan, the Justice Department
and the states that joined in the lawsuit would have 60 days to
file objections. Microsoft would then have 30 days to respond.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge reviews the new paperwork and issues a final
reorganization plan, and assuming the government wins on appeal,
reorganization would take place within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The two entities are to have separate employees, assets and
intellectual properties. There would be separate stock, so that
principals in ``Ops Co.'' did not own stock in ``Apps Co.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge described the fire wall against anything that
resembled cross-ownership or excessive coziness between the new
companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ No board member of one can acquire securities or assets of the
other. No one who is an officer, director or employee of one
business shall be an officer, director or employee of the other.
</P>
<P>
   _ The operating system business and the applications business
are barred from merging, recombining or entering into joint
ventures for 10 years. The new companies are barred, for the most
part, from entering into any agreement under which one develops,
sells, licenses or distributes products or services developed,
sold, licensed or distributed by the other.
</P>
<P>
   _ One company cannot provide the other with any technical
information that is not ``made readily available'' to other makers
of computer products. Nor can the two companies license, sell or
make available to each other ``any product or service'' on better
terms than are offered to outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new companies are allowed to license technologies (other
than middleware, like e-mail programs or browsers) to each other,
provided the technologies have not been separately sold, licensed
or offered as a product.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Microsoft is ordered to do its best to run both
the operating systems end of its business and the applications
branch at a profit, and to support research and development for
both.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft must do nothing ``that undermines, frustrates,
interferes with, or makes more difficult'' the reorganization.
Again, unless it is granted a stay, Microsoft must file a report no
later than 90 days from now on steps it is taking to comply with
this portion of the decree.
</P>
<P>
   Until the reorganization takes effect, the present Microsoft is
not to punish or threaten any computer maker for using,
distributing, promoting, licensing, producing or selling any
product or service that competes with Microsoft. (This and other
restrictions on conduct would remain in effect for three years if
the breakup takes place, 10 years if the breakup is rejected on
appeal.)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft must license its Windows operating system products to
computer makers under uniform royalty terms, with exceptions
granted for different language versions and ``reasonable'' volume
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft may not stop a computer maker that uses the Windows
system from modifying its start-up sequence and desktop so that
Microsoft icons, start-menu entries and other features are removed
_ as long as users can get them back, if they want. Nor can
Microsoft restrict a computer maker from offering its own
Internet-access provider.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cannot terminate a computer maker's license to use
Windows without providing a written notice and allowing the
computer maker at least 30 days to correct its supposed
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that Microsoft shares technical information with all
hardware, software and computer makers that are entitled to it,
Microsoft must create ``a secure facility'' where representatives
of those companies can study it.
</P>
<P>
   With limited exceptions, Microsoft cannot interfere with the
performance of any non-Microsoft middleware that operates with any
Windows operating system product.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is not to give or withhold any consideration, or take
or threaten any action, based on a hardware or software maker's use
of a Microsoft product or service, or its choice of non-Microsoft
products or services. And it must not enter into arrangements in
which third parties agree or are offered considerations to favor
certain Microsoft products to the exclusion of non-Microsoft
products.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cannot link the licensing of a Windows operating
system to a customer's agreement to use other Microsoft products.
</P>
<P>
   And when Microsoft releases a new version of Windows, it must
continue selling the previous version without raising the price and
must continue to offer service and support for it.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a stay, Microsoft has 90 days to set up a compliance
committee on its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   That committee is to hire a chief compliance officer, who would
be given broad powers to see that Microsoft obeys the ruling. Among
other things, the compliance officer would obtain written
statements from senior corporate officers certifying that they have
read the court's ruling, that they understand it and that they will
abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   The compliance officer is to report immediately to the court and
government any violations of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messages of high-ranking Microsoft executives engaged
in software development are to be saved for at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   The court reserves the right to act on its own to issue orders
ensuring compliance with the ruling, and to punish violations.
</P>
<P>
   The court's final judgment would expire in 10 years.

 WASHINGTON: through Saturday.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the plan announced last week would reduce bills by as much
as 50 percent for a consumer who made no long distance calls, it
would increase rates for those on the basic plan who made more than
12 minutes of calls and followed the national pattern for calls,
according to an analysis by the Consumer Federation of America.
</P>
<P>
   A customer who, for instance, decided one month to make 45
minutes worth of long-distance calls on Saturdays under the old
plan would pay $4.95 plus taxes and special fees. Under the plan
filed last week, that same customer would pay $13.05 plus taxes and
fees. And under another current plan the company will be promoting
that charges 19 cents a minute, the customer would pay $8.55.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups and Wall Street analysts said on Wednesday that
they did not blame AT&AMP;T for what some said was, in effect, a
pricing shell game of reducing rates in some areas and increasing
them in others. But they criticized the FCC for both being
misleading and for failing to prevent rates from increasing.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, Scott Cleland of Legg Mason Precursor Group, who
had praised the FCC for putting forward a rate plan that eliminated
some hidden subsidies from bills, on Wednesday compared officials
there to a scene in the Peanuts comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like Lucy and the football,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Kimmelman, the co-director of the Washington office of
Consumers Union, said the day's developments had demonstrated that
the FCC had failed to negotiate a rate plan that it could properly
monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has put out a plan which has no effective monitoring
or compliance mechanisms,'' he said. ``The decision announced by
AT&AMP;T today is not a bad deal. It is fine for today, but what about
tomorrow, next week and next month when you don't have the outrage
that was clearly felt today by the company.''
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom and Sprint, the nation's second- and third-largest
long-distance companies, will also benefit from last week's
agreement cutting the fees they pay to local phone companies to
connect customers' calls.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike AT&AMP;T, neither has filed a rate increase for basic
service in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T executives said that Wednesday's announcement would not
affect its plan to increase charges on some One Rate plans, in
which customers pay a flat fee on top of a set per-minute charge.
The flat fee on those plans will increase by 66 percent, to $5 a
month from $3.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that they had proposed the new basic rates
presuming that many customers would shift making long-distance
calls to Sunday to save money. The proposed plan would have reduced
Sunday calling rates on the basic plan to 7 cents a minute from 11
cents.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 20 percent of all residential calls are placed on
Sunday, and the filing last week with the FCC raised rates for the
other six days.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old basic plan, customers paid 11 cents a minute for
Saturday long-distance calls. For calls made on Monday to Friday
during the peak hours of 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., the basic rate charged
26 cents a minute. For off-peak hours, long-distance calls cost 16
cents a minute.

   U.S. Judge Orders Breakup of Microsoft Into 2 Units
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ordered the breakup of Microsoft, saying the
severe remedy was necessary because Microsoft ``has proved
untrustworthy in the past'' and did not appear to accept his ruling
that it had broadly violated the nation's antitrust laws. Under his
order, Microsoft would be broken into separate companies, one for
its Windows operating system and one for its other businesses.
Microsoft would also be forced to comply with restrictions on its
conduct. The order stays the breakup plan, but not the other
measures, pending an appeal. As Microsoft assesses the implications
of the breakup order, the advice from professional communicators on
how the company ought to handle the consequences is being offered
almost as quickly as the ``I Love You'' computer worm infested
e-mail in-boxes.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Puts Off Its Rate Increase
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T gave into pressure from embarrassed federal regulators and
outraged consumer groups and said that it would put off a planned
rate increase that would have raised telephone bills for tens of
millions of customers. The announcement came after a flurry of
calls between senior AT&AMP;T executives and the chairman of the
Federal Communications Commission, William Kennard.

   A Bitter Showdown in Indonesia
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Indonesia's central bank governor was named as a
suspect in a financial scandal, he and the government squared off
in a bitter showdown that could erode what little confidence
investors have in this fragile country. The governor of Bank
Indonesia, Syahril Sabirin, left, said he would not step down
despite repeated requests from Indonesia's president, Abdurrahman
Wahid. Sabirin denied any wrongdoing and said he was a victim of a
political witch hunt.

   Technology Issues Bolster Stocks
</P>
<P>
   Paced by technology issues, stock prices resumed their climb. A
jump in IBM after a positive analyst report accounted for about 60
percent of the Dow Jones industrial average's rise of 77.29 points,
or 0.7 percent, to 10,812.86. The Nasdaq composite index advanced
82.89 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,839.26. And the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index climbed 13.52 points, or 0.9 percent, to

   Big Board in Talks on Global Link

   Consumer Credit Up 7.8 Percent in April
</P>
<P>
   Americans increased their borrowing at a less feverish pace in
April, ringing up the smallest rise in consumer credit in six
months, the Federal Reserve said. Total consumer credit rose a
seasonally adjusted $9.3 billion in April for an annual growth rate

borrowing rose by $5.3 billion.

   Complacency on the Trade Deficit
</P>

   Every time the trade deficit reaches another record, as it did

nothing, to worry about. But the rising level of debt is not
sustainable indefinitely. Why are we so complacent?

CHINESE HERB, LINKED TO KIDNEY FAILURE, MAY ALSO CAUSE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs for additional details and some reorganization; story grows
by about 150 words)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an example of the dangers of untested and unregulated herbal
products, doctors are reporting that a Chinese herb, already linked
to kidney failure, may cause cancer as well.
</P>
<P>
   The herb, Aristolochia fangchi, was given to patients at a
weight-loss clinic in Belgium from 1990 to 1992, according to a
report being published Thursday in The New England Journal of
Medicine. By 1993 more than 100 of the patients had kidney damage,
and so far more than 70 of them have suffered kidney failure,
requiring transplants or dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a some of these patients are also developing cancers of the
urinary tract. The report gave no indication how many patients
might have taken the herb at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of kidney failure from the herb have also been reported in
France, Britain, Spain, Japan and Taiwan. Dr. Christine Lewis,
director of the office of nutritional products, labeling and
dietary supplements at the Food and Drug Administration, said there
had been no reports of Americans being harmed by Aristolochia.
Lewis also said the FDA did not know how much of the herb might be
on the market in this country.
</P>
<P>
   In a check of 14 stores in New York City on Wednesday,
Aristolochia was available at two. At one it was being sold under
the name of Aristolochia Sertentaria for $13.95 an ounce. Another
said that it had Aristolochia available under the name Senega and
that it was used to heal snake bites. A third store said it had
discontinued the herb because it was not selling well.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the FDA sent letters to doctors and to the supplement
industry, with a six-page list of herbal remedies known or
suspected of containing Aristolochia. The agency urged
manufacturers to test their products for the presence of the herb.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is also preparing to issue an ``import alert'' within a
few weeks that will, in effect, ban importation of the herb,
including every item on the six-page list, Dr. Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Cardellina, vice president for botanicals at the
Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group for the supplement
industry, said Aristolochia had been found in some Chinese
medicinal mixtures, but in few other products. Nonetheless,
Cardellina said, because Aristolochia is so dangerous, the
supplement industry supports the FDA's decision to list every item
that might possibly contain the herb.
</P>
<P>
   Herbs, amino acids, vitamins and other so-called dietary
supplements are now a $15 billion industry, which is largely
unregulated. Unlike drugs, supplements do not have to be proved
safe and effective before they are marketed, and no outside agency
even checks to make sure that the products actually contain the
ingredients on the label. Regulation is lacking because in 1994,
Congress passed the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education
Act, which cut back the FDA's authority.
</P>
<P>
   Under that law, the FDA does not have have the authority to take
supplements off the market until they are proved dangerous, in
which case people may already have been harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The report published Thursday in The New England Journal of
Medicine tells of 39 patients who took the herb and had kidney
transplants or dialysis at Erasme Hospital in Brussels, by a team
led by Dr. Joelle L. Nortier. Eighteen of the 39 have also
developed cancers of the urinary system. Nineteen others have
abnormal cells in the urinary tract, possibly precancers.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the article, Dr. David Kessler,
former head of the FDA and now dean of the Yale School of Medicine,
urged Congress to change the law to give the FDA more power over
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said he had bought a bottle of Aristolochia capsules,
sold as ``Virginia Snakeroot,'' from an American supplier via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At the Belgian weight-loss clinic, Aristolochia was given to
patients by mistake; doctors had prescribed another herb, but the
product that the patients were given was later found to contain
Aristolochia, possibly because of a manufacturing error. On
average, the patients took it for about a year. Those who took the
highest amounts were most likely to develop cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Aristolochia contains compounds called aristolochic acids, which
are known to damage the kidneys and to cause cancer in rats in the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The herb has been used historically in Chinese medicine for a
variety of ailments, but about 25 years ago German researchers
found it to be highly toxic, according to Dr. Varro E. Tyler, an
expert on herbal medicine at Purdue University. Nonetheless, he
said, some manufacturers in China continue to use it.
</P>
<P>
   When a patient who had taken the herb in the Belgian weigh-loss
program developed cancer, doctors tested other patients in the
program. A high proportion, 18 of 39, had cancer in the kidney,
bladder or ureter, the tube connecting the kidney and bladder, the
report said. Nineteen other patients had abnormal cells, possibly
precancers, in the urinary tract.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, tissue from all 39 patients had molecules derived
from the herb attached themselves to the patient's genetic
material, known as DNA adducts. Adducts can interfere with DNA
function and is thought to increase the risk of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said the high incidence of abnormal cells and adducts
even in the patients without tumors was worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA warning letter and a list of products that might contain
Aristolochia can be seen on the agency's Web site, www.fda.gov, by
clicking on ``what's new'' and then on ``dietary supplements.''

 &HT;    Closer's radio rant shrugged off by team
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves have learned to expect the unexpected as
far as their _ for now _ demoted closer John Rocker is concerned.
But on Wednesday afternoon, they had to chuckle when they heard he
had gone on 96 Rock and said he might quit baseball rather than
report to the minor leagues, and offered this alternative:
</P>
<P>
   ``Stockbroker?'' Chipper Jones asked, eyes widening as he read a
copy of Rocker's morning comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of things I can do besides deal with the
headaches of this garbage every single day,'' is what Rocker said
on the air. ``I'd be a stockbroker probably. There's something to
be said for having a job that's not just a complete headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Cox got word on Wednesday afternoon that Rocker had come
by the Braves clubhouse to collect his belongings and Cox fully
expected he would soon be on his way to Toledo to join the Class
AAA Richmond Braves on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker didn't report there on Wednesday night but few of the
Braves were actually convinced Rocker wouldn't show up in Toledo by
his deadline today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody who's ever been sent down to the minor leagues is ever
happy about it, especially one who established himself as one of
the top closers in the game,'' Jones said. ``It was a shock to him
and a shock to everybody else. He's probably venting a little bit.
You can't just quit, just stop playing the game and not want to
play anymore. I think he'll go down. He won't like it, but he'll do
it. Hopefully it'll be a wake-up call for him. I'd like to see him
get down to business and work on some things. It's still not beyond
the realm of comprehension that he can come back and be the closer
for the rest of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has to be in the minors for a minimum of 10 days from
when he was optioned (Monday) before he can be recalled to Atlanta.
The longer he takes to report the less likely he'd be back when
those 10 days are up. Some players are estimating privately he's
got a 50-50 shot of making it back to the majors with the Braves
period - mentally and physically. Others weren't so generous.
</P>
<P>
   The way Tom Glavine figures, Rocker is doing himself a
disservice by spending time on the radio instead of the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they say they want you to go down and work on some things
and get back as quickly as possible, normally that's a crock,''
Glavine said. ``He's in a rare position. In this case it's true.
And he's already wasted two days. It's another decision you say to
yourself `What are you thinking?' The smartest thing he could have
done was to get down there as soon as you can and see where you are
for 10 days. He's doing nothing but prolonging his absence from
this team. And that's nobody's fault but his own.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker refuses the assignment, the Braves can fine or suspend
him. They wouldn't likely grant him release to make him eligible to
other clubs. So it's either the Richmond club or nothing, for a
while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a pretty raw deal of raw deals this time,'' Rocker had
said.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later he's got to look in the mirror and take
responsibility for his actions,'' Glavine said. ``Everything that's
happened has been a direct result of something he's said or done.
Nobody else said anything to the photographer in San Diego, nobody
else did that to (Jeff) Pearlman.''
</P>
<P>
   No Brave is willing to say the team is better off without
Rocker, although they're beginning to prepare themselves for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he wouldn't be missed, somebody is lying to
themselves,'' Jones said. ``The fact of the matter is life goes on
whether John Rocker is here or not.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it get to the point all the shenanigans overrides that
and it causes you more problems that it helps you?'' Glavine said.
``Possibly. But I don't think it's going to happen with us. We have
too many guys who are professional and won't let one guy bring us
down.''

MUTED REACTION TO BREAKUP RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (With MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST)  
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al
Gore, the presumptive presidential nominees, declined to comment
Wednesday on the court order to break Microsoft into two companies,
but congressional Republicans condemned the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Bush, who in February had
expressed concerns that a breakup would threaten economic growth,
said Wednesday night: ``Governor Bush has said all along that it
would not be appropriate for him to discuss the specifics of the
case while it is still before the courts, and Microsoft has
indicated that they intend to appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hattaway, a spokesman for Gore, said that ``since it's an
ongoing legal matter, it would be inappropriate to comment.''
Hattaway declined to explain why silence was indicated in this case
when Gore freely commented last month on the case involving
political asylum for Elian Gonzalez, as has Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Their reluctance to comment reflected a sense among political
professionals that the decision was unlikely to have much impact on
the presidential election, except perhaps in Microsoft's home
state, Washington, where it could hurt Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, both supporters and foes of Microsoft have contributed
heavily to all sorts of candidates this year. As one Washington
lobbyist put it, ``It's obvious why no one is getting too far out
front _ there's too much money to be raised from both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But that did not stop Republicans on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant majority leader,
said the decision marked ``a sad day for the American consumer.''
Nickles said the Clinton administration apparently wanted a
``federal department of software regulation,'' but said Congress
should decide ``whether we need federal bureaucrats and federal
judges writing our computer software and deciding how we surf the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, denounced
the decision even before it was issued. In a statement released at
3:56 p.m., 34 minutes before the ruling was made public, Armey
said: ``Judge Jackson's ruling will divert innovative companies
from creating better products. Worse, it will send the message to
innovators around the world that in America we punish success.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats were more hesitant in their comments. Sen. Patrick
Leahy of Vermont, the senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee,
said the implications of the ruling ``are anything but clear right
now.'' Leahy urged the government and Microsoft to ``invest new
urgency'' in trying to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the penalty was too severe.
``Obviously,'' Schumer said, ``if Microsoft broke the law, they
should be punished, But not all legal roads lead to a breakup,''
which he said should be used only as a ``last resort.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from Washington state were vehement in their
complaints, regardless of party. Sen. Patty Murray, a Democrat,
called the decision disappointing, saying it would ``hobble
Microsoft at a critical time in the development of our
information-based economy'' and ``cripple a major technology
innovator.''
</P>
<P>
   That was mild compared with the comments of Sen. Slade Gorton, a
Republican running for re-election. Calling the result a sham,
Gorton said: ``Wednesday is truly a sad day in our nation's
history. Never before has our government so viciously pursued a
company that has done so much good for not only Americans, but for
people worldwide. Microsoft, the driving force behind the booming
U.S. economy, has revolutionized how we communicate, how we educate
our children and how we live.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of any immediate denunciation of Microsoft, even
from members of Congress who have been critical of its activities,
reflected not only a desire to study the decision by Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson and weigh the politics of attacking a generally
popular company, but perhaps also represented a bow to the
corporation's increasing role as a campaign contributor.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that while
Microsoft, and individuals and political action committees
connected to it, gave candidates and parties about $1.8 million
from 1993 to 1998, in just the first 17 months of the current
election cycle they gave $2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   And while almost three-fifths of the earlier giving went to
Republicans, the donations between Jan. 1, 1999, and June 1 of this
year were divided with almost surgically exactness. Democrats
received 50.2 percent, or $1,118,014; Republicans took in 49.8
percent, or $1,083,723.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, has made strenuous efforts to
cater to Democrats as well as Republicans. During his visit to
Capitol Hill on Tuesday, he met at length with the all-Democratic
Congressional Black Caucus and the heavily Democratic Hispanic
Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Microsoft officials are known to hope that if Bush
is elected, his administration might be willing to settle the case
on terms more generous to the company than would the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's spokesman, McClellan, avoided that issue, saying, ``As
president, Governor Bush will fully enforce our antitrust laws to
foster competition and innovation and protect consumers,'' but he
declined to say whether that meant Bush would have supported
government action against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the case seems to have little national
political impact. Last month, an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll
did find the public opposed to a breakup, by 52 percent to 35
percent. And many polls have found the company and Gates popular
with the public.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no indication either in those surveys or elsewhere
that the subject was one that could change votes. Charles Cook,
editor of a highly regarded political survey, The Cook Political
Report, said he had seen no impact anywhere.

AT MEETING OF TRIBAL LEADERS, GORE TAPS A NEW FONT OF CASH 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Vice President Al Gore, ever on the prowl
for money, has found a new source: American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning a three-day West Coast campaign swing, Gore raised
nearly $1 million at three events Wednesday, including $400,000
from a group of Indians at a luncheon at the Hilton Hotel in Palm
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Edward G. Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, which organized the events, said that although many
Indians had attended fund-raisers for the party in the past, these
were the first events held exclusively with Indians.
Representatives of 16 tribes from the region _ there are more than
400 tribes across the country _ were in Palm Springs attending a
tribal council meeting, and about 40 of them ate lunch with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell, who noted the emerging economic power among Indians
through casinos and shopping malls, said that at least 80 percent
of those Indians who voted traditionally voted Democratic, and
there seemed to be considerable support for the vice president
among this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has made a commitment to who we are as a people,''
Mary Ann Martin Andreas, chairwoman of the Morongo Band of Mission
Indians from Banning, said in introducing the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Gonzales Lyons of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahulla
Indians, and vice chairwoman of the council, said, ``Vice President
Al Gore has taken the time to meet and speak with us and candidate
Bush has not,'' referring to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gore's
Republican rival.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said Indians looked more favorably on Gore than
on Bush because Bush had suggested that states be allowed to
determine whether gambling could take place on Indian reservations.
Without directly endorsing gambling, Chris Lehane, Gore's
spokesman, said of the Indians, ``We support their right to do what
they want to do on their land.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brief and solemn speech, Gore said he recognized that the
tribes' agenda _ including better health care and more economic
opportunities _ had received too little attention. ``I don't wear
rose-colored glasses,'' he said, ``but I think that it's important
to take stock of the fact that we have made success in the
direction of progress.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited his support for tribal sovereignty, tribal hunting and
fishing rights and economic empowerment zones, but said more needed
to be done to attract investments and jobs to Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know _ I say that I know, but I don't know in the same way
that you know _ the burden of history on Indian people,'' Gore
said. He said he understood how ``travails as well as opportunities
can cascade down through the generations, parents to children to
grandchildren and on and on, to the seventh generation and then
beyond.'' Indians traditionally refer to the seventh generation as
a symbol of the future. But, he said, ``we have the ability to
interrupt the cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore was collecting money from this group, he lamented
doing so. ``I accept that there's a great irony in this process,''
he said, adding that he was determined to overhaul the campaign
finance system. ``We need sweeping reforms to end the money
chase.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore then flew to a fund-raising reception at the Santa Monica
home of Brad Krevoy, chief executive officer of the Motion Picture
Corporation of America, where 100 people gave $1,000 each to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   He then had a date at the Conga Room in Los Angeles, where 65
people were paying $5,000 each to have dinner with him and where he
expected to raise $325,000.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1980, Victor Sheymov was a Soviet man in a
hurry.
</P>
<P>
   At 33, he was the youngest major in the KGB, in charge of
coordinating security for the Soviet spy agency's code and
communications systems worldwide. An engineer and computer
specialist by training, Sheymov was clearly headed for big things
as a member of the Soviet elite.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Sheymov also had a secret. After intensive reading and
study, he had concluded that the Communist system in which he had
thrived was based on a big lie. He was in a hurry to get out.
</P>
<P>
   So he contacted the CIA, which spirited Sheymov and his wife and
daughter out of Moscow and resettled them in the United States. He
soon began work as a consultant to the National Security Agency,
the United States' super-secret eavesdropping arm. For the rest of
the Cold War, Sheymov helped the agency try to breach the KGB code
systems that he had once worked so hard to defend. In his spare
time, he earned a master's degree in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 20 years later, Victor Sheymov is again a man in a hurry,
but this time to cash in on the Internet gold rush of his adopted
capitalist country. He has teamed up with American cold-war
veterans from the security agency to put their old cyberspy skills
to use in the new world of Silicon startups.
</P>
<P>
   Sheymov has struck out on his own to develop a new computer
security system that he believes could make computer networks
nearly impervious to penetration by outside hackers. He has brought
in computer experts from the security agency and elsewhere to help
design the new system, and has also persuaded a former director of
central intelligence, R. James Woolsey, to join his new company's
board.
</P>
<P>
   Sheymov developed a new algorithm, on which he has a patent
pending, after accepting a challenge from a cybersecurity expert in
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kidding him, saying, `I can't believe you guys can't
stop these kids from breaking in,''' Sheymov recalled. ``So he
said, `If you're so smart, why don't you do it.' That got me
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   His software is still at least six months away from the market.
But the spy-versus-spy backdrop to Sheymov's new company, Invicta
Networks of Laurel, Md., is certain to provide a compelling
storyline that will help it attract the kind of attention that
other computer startups would kill for.
</P>
<P>
   The story behind Sheymov's company also provides a glimpse into
the shadowy role the National Security Agency plays in computer
security and professional hacking, and underscores its potential as
an incubator for start-ups in the booming computer security
industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the secrets of the security agency, which is in Fort
Meade, Md., not far from Sheymov's Laurel offices, had been that it
employs professional hackers who try to break into the computer
networks of foreign governments, terrorists and international drug
cartels. It also employs computer security experts who try to stay
one step ahead of hackers to protect government computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey notes that cybersecurity and computer hacking are two
subsets of the computer world where the government _ and the
security agency, in particular _ have long been ahead of private
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with viruses, e-mail ``spamming'' and hacking all emerging
as major national headaches and as national security threats, at
least a few veterans of the security agency are moving into the
private sector, holding out the possibility that the Maryland
region around Fort Meade could soon be transformed into a new
hotbed of the cybersecurity industry.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, when Sheymov sought to test his computer security
system against the best hackers he could find, he turned to another
company staffed with security agency veterans, Netsafe Inc. of
Annapolis, Md., which conducts ``ethical hacking'' to help
companies determine the security of their computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   Netsafe's hacking team tried and failed to break into Sheymov's
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried and couldn't get into it,'' said Joe Patanella, the
president of Netsafe, an 18-year veteran of the National Security
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Patanella cautioned that Netsafe's test of Sheymov's system was
not a real-world exercise, since his software had not been
installed on a live corporate computer system. But he came away
impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Patanella said, ``It certainly has good access control
capability,'' which is computerese meaning that Sheymov's system
was hard to breach.
</P>
<P>
   Computer riches may now be within sight, but Sheymov's American
dream has been a long time coming.
</P>
<P>
   In his time with the Soviet spy agency, his expertise on
communications security _ and his detailed knowledge of the inner
workings of the KGB _ rendered him such a national security asset
that his Moscow apartment was bugged and he was subjected to
regular surveillance. When he traveled abroad, he was required to
stay on Soviet Embassy grounds rather than in hotels.
</P>
<P>
   But on duty in Warsaw, he slipped away from his minders long
enough to contact the Central Intelligence Agency, and the
Americans immediately realized he was potentially one of the most
important defectors of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   For years after he defected, he was locked in a bitter dispute
with the CIA over the amount of money he was owed by the federal
government for his defection and collaboration against the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Sheymov believed he had been promised $1 million by the CIA
before he defected, but he received far less after he arrived here.
Agency officials, on the other hand, came to believe that Sheymov
could never be satisfied, and had a bottomless appetite for
ever-larger helpings of CIA money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The CIA cheated me in a major way,'' Sheymov insists.
</P>
<P>
   Current and former officials familiar with Sheymov's case
against the CIA have equally unkind things to say about him in
response.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Sheymov hired Woolsey, a Washington lawyer who served
as CIA director in 1993 and 1994, to represent him in his battle
with the agency. The sides finally reached a settlement last
October, and, while Sheymov remains dissatisfied, he agreed not to
reveal its terms.
</P>
<P>
   But with his new computer company, Sheymov seems to have put his
wars with the CIA in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of defectors have trouble adjusting after they have come
to the United States,'' Woolsey said. ``But Victor is one of those
guys who could thrive in any system. He is one of those guys who,
if you put him down on a desert island, he would build a house and
then create a signaling system to catch the attention of passing
ships.''

KLM AND BRITISH AIRWAYS BEGIN MERGER TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to align the proper chief financial officer with the proper
company 5 grafs from end.)   By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN and ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The game of musical chairs sweeping the global airline industry
expanded to yet more players Wednesday, but it appears that it will
be some time before the music stops.
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Airways PLC, Europe's largest airline, and
the Netherlands-based carrier, KLM Royal Dutch NV, acknowledged
they had entered into merger negotiations. Across the Atlantic, AMR
Corp., the parent of American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines held
preliminary merger discussions earlier this week, according to two
people close to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The talks between AMR and Delta followed an overture by AMR to
Northwest Airlines. Those discussions in turn were sparked by the
acquisition of US Airways by UAL Corp., the parent of United
Airlines, for $4.3 billion, a deal that would create by far the
world's largest airline. That poses a direct threat to American and
Delta, the second and third-largest carriers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are increasingly keen to merge in order to expand their
networks and pare costs. UAL has said that buying US Airways, the
largest carrier on the East Cost, will fill a large hole in its
route network, making it more attractive to corporate customers and
to its airline partners in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Investors sent the shares of all four airlines in the latest
reported pairings up Wednesday. KLM shares surged 8.5 percent to
30.1 euros or $28.29, and have risen 45 percent since rumors that
it might be purchased began to swirl weeks ago. British Airways
shares rose 1.3 percent to 390 pence or about $5.85. Delta shares
rose 3.2 percent or $1.625 to $52.50 on the New York Stock
Exchange, and AMR shares rose 12.5 cents to $28.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the reaction to the talks in the stock market, it is
notoriously difficult to combine airlines smoothly. British Airways
and KLM tried once before, in 1992, but the deal foundered over
price. Yet even if the two managements can agree on price and
management control, the powerful role played by labor unions often
make mergers more trouble than they are worth. In addition, there
is a real chance that regulators would block such large deals.
</P>
<P>
   Both British Airways and KLM dominate their respective home
markets and have little room to expand. They have also been hurt by
competition that has eroded their profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   A British Airways-KLM would create the world's fourth largest
airline with $19.5 billion in sales. It would have hubs outside of
London serving trans-Atlantic and long haul flights to Asia as well
as a hub outside Amsterdam that could serve connecting flights and
intra-Europe routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a necessity for consolidation to take place,'' said
Andrew Light, an aviation analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
London. He said a deal is especially important for KLM, which broke
off its alliance with Alitalia of Italy in April. ``It gives them a
lifeline,'' he said. ``They are desperately in a need of a
partner.''
</P>
<P>
   Both British Airways and KLM cautioned that the talks were ``at
a preliminary stage.'' Executives close to the negotiations who
spoke on condition of anonymity said that it would take
considerable time to negotiate any deal. The executives said price
has not been significantly discussed yet. But on the assumption
that a deal would be structured as a British Airways purchase of
KLM, analysts estimate KLM's price could exceed $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   KLM has a strong alliance with Northwest Airlines in which the
two carriers have merged their trans-Atlantic operations. British
Airways has an alliance with AMR. Those were among the reasons many
analysts believe an AMR merger with Northwest makes the most sense.
</P>
<P>
   But people close to the initial talks between the two carriers
said Northwest sought a premium price, which gave AMR pause. The
talks between AMR and Delta, which took place in New York on Monday
and were reported by The Wall Street Journal, were also described
as very preliminary. Present at the meeting were Edward West and
Tom Horton, the chief financial officers of Delta and AMR, along
with lawyers and investment bankers from Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
representing Delta, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter representing
AMR.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people walked away from it with the conclusion: Here
are some things we need to think about,'' said one person close to
the discussions. It was not clear when the two sides would meet
again.
</P>
<P>
   A merger would bring together Delta's strong European and East
Coast routes with American's dominance of Latin America and its
access to London's Heathrow airport. But the two carriers together
would control nearly 40 percent of the domestic market, and they
overlap heavily in the South and Soutwest. In addition, neither has
a strong network in Asia, which is a jewel in Northwest's crown.
</P>
<P>
   That is why most analysts believe AMR and Northwest make a
better fit, while Delta and Continental Airlines are considered
more suitable partners.
</P>
<P>
   But as all the recent activity proves, nothing is ruled out.
Some analysts and airline executives believe that the talks
involving AMR were publicized at such an early stage to try to
scuttle the UAL-US Airways deal by alarming antitrust regulators in
Washington. They may also have been intended to send a message to
Northwest that it may be passed over if it does not lower its
asking price.

DRUG COSTS ARE FOCUS OF NEW DEMOCRATIC ADS 
</HEADLINE>
  By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a low-key commercial in which Vice President
Al Gore expresses his concern about the cost of prescription drugs,
the Democratic Party embarked Wednesday on the general election's
first large-scale television advertising campaign, paid for partly
with unrestricted soft-money donations.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, which is to begin running on Thursday in 52 media
markets in 15 states, predominantly in the Midwest, South and
Pacific West, was described by some Democratic leaders as the
starting point of an effort to provide Gore with a needed boost
before the nominating conventions this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials used the release to renew their criticism
of Gore for going back on what they called his promise not to have
the Democratic Party pay for its commercials with soft money, the
donations that corporations and unions can make to parties in
unlimited amounts. And aides to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
suggested that the Democratic commercials would not go unanswered
on the air for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an opportunity for the RNC to begin their campaign,'' a
Bush adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity said of the
Republican National Committee. ``I'm sure they will be engaging in
short order.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials say the 10-week advertising campaign could
cost more than $25 million. The party is spending an estimated $1.9
million this weekend alone in the 15 states, which include crucial
swing states like Michigan, Illinois, Pennsylvania and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Edward G. Rendell, general chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said the effort would have the goals of reintroducing
Gore to voters, highlighting Gore's contributions to the Clinton
administration and taking a critical look at Bush's time in office.
Rendell added that he and other Democrats thought it was necessary
to try to counter what they viewed as a large volume of positive
news coverage accorded in recent weeks to Bush, who has introduced
a series of policy initiatives over the last two months and is
leading in some polls.
</P>
<P>
   The first commercial diverges little from the kinds of spots
Gore's campaign ran during the primaries. It not only looks like
earlier Gore spots, but the vice president's own image-making team,
led by Robert Shrum and Carter Eskew, also produced the party's new
commercial, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with the Senate minority leader, Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, and the House minority leader, Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri, Joe Andrew, national chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, said the party had chosen to make
the high cost of prescription drugs the focus of the first
advertisement because it had the potential to be a ``defining
issue'' of the campaign. Daschle and Gephardt are supporters of
legislation to add a prescription drug benefit for Medicare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The spot depicts a 74-year-old man, Bob Darthez, who an
announcer says is ``at the mercy of the big drug companies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using money and lobbyists to stop progress in
Washington,'' the announcer says, adding, ``Al Gore is taking them
on, fighting for a Medicare prescription drug benefit for seniors
like Bob Darthez.'' The spot then cuts to an extended shot of Gore,
speaking about his frustration with the high cost of medication.
</P>
<P>
   In issue advertisements like these, the parties are barred from
using terms like ``vote for'' or ``defeat.'' But in most ways, they
resemble commercials run by candidates themselves. Andrew said that
what made it appropriate for the party was the ubiquity of the
topic in congressional campaigns around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that we've got U.S. Senate candidates from Montana
to Missouri running on this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials reacted less to the content of the
commercial than to the chance to criticize Gore anew for how it was
financed. Under Federal Election Commission rules, the national
parties pay for issue advertisements with 65 percent hard, or
federal, money and 35 percent soft money. In a March 14 e-mail
message to Bush, the vice president proposed that both campaigns
renounce the use of soft money to pay for issue advertisements.
After Bush rebuffed the proposal, Gore said he could not be bound
by the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Today, two Republican proponents of campaign finance reform,
Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee and Rep. Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina, met with reporters to add their criticisms of Gore. At a
news conference here, a tape was played of a March 15 CNN interview
in which Gore said he would not spend soft money on issue
advertisements ``unless and until the Republican Party does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether that was a smart promise or not, I can't tell you,''
Graham asserted. ``It wasn't a genuine promise.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The centerpiece of the government's cure for the
predatory, monopolistic, take-no-prisoners behavior that Microsoft
was found to have embraced is to chop the company in two.
</P>
<P>
   One new company would make the Windows operating system, the
other would make the applications that are run by the operating
system, as well as Microsoft's Internet and computer hardware
businesses. The government called the companies ``Ops Co.'' and
``Apps Co.'' in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   If Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's decree is sustained on
appeal, Microsoft would not be able to keep the vow made in court
by its lawyer, John L. Warden.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not acquiesce in our own commercial demise,'' Warden
declared.
</P>
<P>
   If not acquiescing, Microsoft would at least have to cooperate
in radical surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Microsoft is granted a stay pending appeal, it must give
Jackson and the Justice Department's antitrust division a
reorganization plan by early October.
</P>
<P>
   So Microsoft, which consisted of three people and had sales of
$16,000 in its first year, 1975, and now has 36,000 employees and
annual sales of $20 billion, would cease to exist in its present
form.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's decree spelled out how the present Microsoft must
behave toward other companies and how the new companies that would
arise from it, must behave toward each other and toward other
companies, some of which have been bitter competitors or even
adversaries in court.
</P>
<P>
   Once Microsoft submits its proposed plan, the Justice Department
and the states that joined in the lawsuit would have 60 days to
file objections. Microsoft would then have 30 days to respond.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge reviews the new paperwork and issues a final
reorganization plan, and assuming the government wins on appeal,
reorganization would take place within a year.
</P>
<P>
   The two entities are to have separate employees, assets and
intellectual properties. There would be separate stock, so that
principals in ``Ops Co.'' could not own stock in ``Apps Co.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge described the fire wall against anything that
resembled cross-ownership or excessive coziness between the new
companies.
</P>
<P>
   _ No board member of one can acquire securities or assets of the
other. No one who is an officer, director or employee of one
business shall be an officer, director or employee of the other.
</P>
<P>
   _ The operating system business and the applications business
are barred from merging, recombining or entering into joint
ventures for 10 years. The new companies are barred, for the most
part, from entering into any agreement under which one develops,
sells, licenses or distributes products or services developed,
sold, licensed or distributed by the other.
</P>
<P>
   _ One company cannot provide the other with any technical
information that is not ``made readily available'' to other makers
of computer products. Nor can the two companies license, sell or
make available to each other ``any product or service'' on better
terms than are offered to outside companies.
</P>
<P>
   The new companies are allowed to license technologies (other
than middleware, like e-mail programs or browsers) to each other,
provided the technologies have not been separately sold, licensed
or offered as a product.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Microsoft is ordered to do its best to run both
the operating systems end of its business and the applications
branch at a profit, and to support research and development for
both.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft must do nothing ``that undermines, frustrates,
interferes with, or makes more difficult'' the reorganization.
Again, unless it is granted a stay, Microsoft must file a report no
later than 90 days from now on steps it is taking to comply with
this portion of the decree.
</P>
<P>
   Until the reorganization takes effect, the present Microsoft is
not to punish or threaten any computer maker for using,
distributing, promoting, licensing, producing or selling any
product or service that competes with Microsoft. (This and other
restrictions on conduct would remain in effect for three years if
the breakup takes place, 10 years if the breakup is rejected on
appeal.)
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft must license its Windows operating system products to
computer makers under uniform royalty terms, with exceptions
granted for different language versions and ``reasonable'' volume
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft may not stop a computer maker that uses the Windows
system from modifying its start-up sequence and desktop so that
Microsoft icons, start-menu entries and other features are removed
_ as long as users can get them back, if they want. Nor can
Microsoft restrict a computer maker from offering its own
Internet-access provider.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cannot terminate a computer maker's license to use
Windows without providing a written notice and allowing the
computer maker at least 30 days to correct its supposed
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that Microsoft shares technical information with all
hardware, software and computer makers that are entitled to it,
Microsoft must create ``a secure facility'' where representatives
of those companies can study it.
</P>
<P>
   With limited exceptions, Microsoft cannot interfere with the
performance of any non-Microsoft middleware that operates with any
Windows operating system product.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is not to give or withhold any consideration, or take
or threaten any action, based on a hardware or software maker's use
of a Microsoft product or service, or its choice of non-Microsoft
products or services. And it must not enter into arrangements in
which third parties agree or are offered considerations to favor
certain Microsoft products to the exclusion of non-Microsoft
products.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft cannot link the licensing of a Windows operating
system to a customer's agreement to use other Microsoft products.
Strict limits are placed on Microsoft's binding middleware products
to operating-system products.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Microsoft is barred from penalizing computer makers
who install Windows but choose not to use Microsoft middleware.
</P>
<P>
   The new companies cannot retaliate against ``any person or
entity'' for providing evidence in the lawsuit against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   And when Microsoft releases a new version of Windows, it must
continue selling the previous version without raising the price and
must continue to offer service and support for it.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a stay, Microsoft has 90 days to set up a compliance
committee on its board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   That committee is to hire a chief compliance officer, who would
be given broad powers to see that Microsoft obeys the ruling. Among
other things, the compliance officer would obtain written
statements from senior corporate officers certifying that they have
read the court's ruling, that they understand it and that they will
abide by it.
</P>
<P>
   The compliance officer is to report immediately to the court and
government any violations of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail messages of high-ranking Microsoft executives engaged
in software development are to be saved for at least four years.
</P>
<P>
   The court reserves the right to act on its own to issue orders
ensuring compliance with the ruling, and to punish violations.
</P>
<P>
   The court's final judgment will expire in 10 years.

U.S. MAY FORGO HEARINGS ON EGYPTAIR CRASH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More certain than ever that a pilot deliberately
caused the crash of Egyptair 990 as it left New York on Oct. 31,
American investigators are wrapping up their investigation and may
approve their conclusions without a public hearing.
</P>
<P>
   This unusual approach is meant to avoid further damage to
relations with Egypt, which have been strained by the inquiry,
government officials say.
</P>
<P>
   But the Egyptian government, which has resisted the theory that
the crash was caused by a suicidal pilot, has developed a competing
theory, that the plane, a Boeing 767, developed a mechanical
problem in its tail, a problem that has been seen on 767s operated
by AeroMexico and other airlines. None of those planes have
crashed. All 217 people aboard Egyptair 990 died when it plunged
into the Atlantic off Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian theory has been informally rejected by experts at
the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates
crashes, but Egypt is pressing its case. On Tuesday, the Egyptian
Civil Aviation Authority asked the Federal Aviation Administration,
which is in charge of safety regulation, to begin an investigation
of the suspect part, and to order all airlines to conduct daily
inspections of the tail to screen for the kind of failure the
Egyptian agency says may have brought down Flight 990. The FAA has
not made a decision on the request.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian theory was developed with help from a phalanx of
U.S. aviation experts who are retired from the NTSB or the FAA. It
involves the controls on the two elevator panels, the movable
surfaces on the horizontal tail that point the plane's nose up or
down.
</P>
<P>
   Each panel is controlled by three actuators, for a total of six.
Salvagers have recovered four acuators from the ocean bottom. One
of those acuators bears marks that the Egyptians argue show that it
malfunctioned. In a presentation to the Safety Board in April, they
argued that if a second actuator on the same elevator had also
failed, the plane's nose would have suddenly been forced down. The
flight data recorder from Flight 990, recovered after the crash,
showed that the plane was proceeding in level flight until it
dived.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. investigators say the marks are not a sign of
malfunction and could have been caused by the plane's impact on the
water. They say that even if two actuators failed and forced the
elevator down, engineering studies performed at Boeing's simulator
in Seattle showed that the crew could have recovered from the
resulting nose dive.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators say they suspect suicide because the flight
data recorder, an advanced model, does not give evidence of
mechanical malfunction. Nor does the cockpit voice recorder. It
does record the first officer uttering what the Americans, but not
the Egyptians, regard as a final prayer. Then it records the
captain, who investigators think had left the cabin, returning and
forcefully asking his first officer what was going on. During the
dive, someone turned off the engines, an action not called for by
emergency procedures, the Americans say.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the flight data recorder shows that after a long dive,
the elevators pointed in opposite directions, a sign that the two
men were working their controls in opposite directions, U.S.
investigators say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Egyptians have argued that a pilot who intended to crash
his plane would not have put it into a dive, from which another
crew member might have rescued it. More likely, they have said,
such a pilot would try to roll the plane upside down. And they have
argued to the NTSB that although engineers in a simulator could
recover from the dive, a crew startled by a sudden malfunction
while flying over the ocean at night might not be so skilled.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member NTSB tries jealously to maintain a monopoly on
public statements about investigations in progress, and, as a
result, people involved in the investigation were not willing to be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   But some U.S. investigators are frustrated that the inquiry,
which the Egyptian government delegated to the United States, has
not been completed. As one said, in investigations of domestic
crashes, each party has a ``constituency,'' because each represents
the airline, or the plane manufacturer, but, he said, ``usually you
want to solve it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, said the investigator, the Egyptians ``don't care
about solving it; they want to cover themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptians, on the other side, have complained about what
they call a ``rush to judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines often hire retired government investigators to help
with safety problems, but Egyptair has assembled a particularly
distinguished crew: Carl W. Vogt, a former chairman of the Safety
Board; a retired deputy chief of aviation safety; a retired top
metallurgist from the NTSB; and a former FAA chief accident
investigator.

WILLING TO TAKE A WALK IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Ariz., New Zealand, Australia)   (For release Sunday, June 11)  
 (Editors: Subs to correct slug.)  
 By HOWARD FEINSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``The films that I want to do are perceived as a
little bit risky and dark,'' the director Alison Maclean says. Now
that is an understatement.
</P>
<P>
   Maclean languished in director hell after her debut feature, the
defiantly noirish psychological thriller ``Crush,'' which she shot
in New Zealand in 1992, piqued the interest of a number of American
critics and producers. ``I moved to New York right after `Crush'
and have spent most of the last eight years writing three feature
scripts,'' she says. ``Two seemed like they were almost fully
financed, then fell apart. It's definitely been a frustrating time.
Then this came at me from left field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' is ``Jesus' Son,'' an adaptation of Denis Johnson's
collection of interwoven short stories about alienation, ennui and
drugs in the American heartland in the 70s, which Maclean shot
early last year in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Arizona. It has
proved to be a godsend, pardon the expression. Not only did it
offer her the chance to get back behind the camera for a feature
film, it successfully transcended its $2.5 million budget. It has
received excellent reviews at the Venice and Toronto Film Festivals
and at the recent New Directors/New Films series at the Museum of
Modern Art. (Lions Gate will open the film on Friday.)
</P>
<P>
   Maclean, a tall, lean, slightly androgynous woman who looks a
lot younger than her 41 years, is sitting in the living room of her
unpretentious West Village apartment, which is ultraminimalist save
for a bit of furniture and several sculptures she made as an art
student in New Zealand. She says she was approached by the
co-producers and screenwriters of ``Jesus' Son,'' Elizabeth
Cuthrell and David Urrutia, who had just optioned the book. They
had seen ``Crush'' and Maclean's 1989 short, ``Kitchen Sink,'' and
considered her a perfect match for the material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted someone who could create a strong sense of tension
that could link Denis' fragmented stories,'' Cuthrell says. ``We
called Alison. She called back in 10 minutes and said: `You don't
understand. This is a book I dearly love.' We met the next day, and
that was that.''
</P>
<P>
   The finished film is fragmented, though accessibly so. Its
structure mimics the mind-set of its protagonist (Billy Crudup), a
heroin user/drinker/petty thief/voyeur/layabout with an unprintable
nickname _ its initials are F.H. _ while he makes his way across
the United States trying to find himself. Essentially an innocent,
F.H. is also a spiritual seeker. (The film's title comes from Lou
Reed's lyrics to the Velvet Underground song ``Heroin.'') He
encounters a motley assortment of wacky, amoral guys, like Georgie
(Jack Black), a hilariously incompetent emergency room orderly with
whom F.H. works as they pop uppers and downers simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   F.H. falls in love with Michelle (Samantha Morton), a tragic
young woman who also shoots up regularly and is the character
closest to those in Maclean's own scripts. F.H. hallucinates all
sorts of things, often objects with religious associations. His
fantasies are not surreal or heavily exaggerated in the style of
Terry Gilliam's ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas'' or the
psychedelic films of the '60s. They are more akin to what Maclean
calls ``a slightly heightened reality, part of the fabric of daily
life.'' On a snowy night, F.H. walks through a drive-in movie
theater dotted with car-speaker stands and experiences it as a
cemetery with gravestone crosses. In the film's central scene, he
imagines a sacred heart emerging from the chest of a thin, scruffy
man whom he's followed from the Chicago El into a laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   Maclean says that the religious iconography of the book and the
script was one of the project's main attractions. She is interested
in Buddhism. Her mother, Mary Forrest, a potter, lives the
spiritual life in a New Age sort of way, to the point where,
according to one of Maclean's old friends, she dangles crystals
over her food before eating. (Maclean's parents divorced when she
was a teen-ager.) Her maternal grandfather, on the other hand, was
a Christadelphian, a strict fundamentalist who taught his family to
deny themselves pleasure (including movies) and placed
Christ-affirming banners on his front lawn. Those probably would
have caught F.H.'s eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another thing I liked about the project is that there is a lot
of comedy in it, and a lot of optimism as well,'' says Maclean,
who, for someone with such a somber oeuvre and reserved demeanor,
has a deep, endearing laugh. The humor in ``Jesus' Son'' is very
black, but the film is far less disturbing than her earlier work
(in addition to ``Crush'' and ``Kitchen Sink,'' she wrote and
directed four shorts in New Zealand), and those screenplays over
which she has been tenaciously laboring in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She is willing to go for lighter fare _ she directed the first
two episodes of ``Sex and the City'' for HBO _ but her own
sensibilities lead her on precarious journeys into the unconscious.
``I do choose the difficult path,'' she concurs. ``I'm not sure
why.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some clues are provided by Bridget Ikin, a New Zealander who
lives in Sydney, Australia, and a close friend; she produced
``Crush'' and three of Maclean's shorts. ``For me, the journey that
Alison's taken to New York, living as a single woman, hacking it
out for eight years now, has been beyond,'' Ikin says. ``We could
have happily continued to make films together, but Alison always
goes for the hard option. I don't think it's any coincidence that
one of the projects that took her to the States was a film from her
own script of `Moby-Dick.''' (Maclean's version, which she herself
says she ``hijacked,'' has a female Ishmael.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Alison is a troubled person, embattled with demons that she's
dealing with,'' Ikin adds. Like several other longtime associates
of Maclean, Ikin feels that she suffers for her art. ``What
interested me about the work I produced for her was her use of
personal material,'' she says. ``The scripting for `Crush' was a
completely torturous process.
</P>
<P>
   ```Crush' was about an anxious moment in her relationship with
New Zealand, about her sense of alienation from that culture, about
female sexuality and desire, about shifting sexuality and about
shifting power relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Maclean says: ``There's something ominous in me somewhere. I
love the warts-and-all people.'' The two main characters in
``Crush,'' both women, are a New Zealand journalist, Christina
(Donogh Rees), and an American opportunist, Lane (Marcia Gay
Harden), who just might be lovers. Lane is responsible for
Christina's becoming paralyzed in a car accident; she then abandons
Christina and assumes her identity to gain access to _ and
ultimately have a love affair with _ a noted author, Colin (William
Zappa), who lives with his teen-age daughter, Angela (Caitlin
Bossley). Angela becomes lovingly obsessed with Lane, then does a
flip and begins to intensely hate her. At film's end, the severely
damaged Christina musters the energy to climb out of her wheelchair
and, just when you think she's going to hug and forgive Lane, she
shoves her off a cliff, an incident witnessed by the horrified
Angela.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ikin: ``Alison is the young girl, Angela, desiring
the powerful American woman. America is this metaphor of power and
desire, the longing to be in the other, more exotic, unreachable
place. In fact, Alison's never felt at home in any country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus' Son'' reflects its director's outsider status. ``I
think the film has a European sensibility,'' says Maclean, who
lived in Canada, New Zealand and Australia before moving to New
York. ``It's in the framing, in the way there is a certain distance
or detachment, a certain remove, which is really my temperament.''
</P>
<P>
   On the commercial front, her feelings of estrangement have
resulted in collisions with some powerful people. She came to the
United States at the behest of Disney's Touchstone Pictures, with
the idea of developing projects. The one that most appealed to her
was ``Up Close and Personal'' (eventually directed by Jon Avnet,
starring Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert Redford). ``I read Alanna
Nash's `Golden Girl,''' Maclean says. ``It was about the TV
anchorwoman Jessica Savitch, who had a bad cocaine habit and died
young in this freak car accident with her boyfriend. It was dark
and tragic. I was interested in the real story. But Joan Didion and
John Gregory Dunne, who at that point had written a few drafts of
the screenplay, were interested in `The Star Is Born' element for
the film. They turned Savitch into an ingenue.'' (Dunne's 1997 book
``Monster'' lays at least some of the blame on Touchstone
executives.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Touchstone and I agreed that we disagreed,'' she continues.
``It was a perfectly amicable parting of the ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so with ``Bedlam.'' Maclean was hired by the producer Ruth
Charney to rewrite a John Sayles script based on an atmospheric
1946 thriller produced by the legendary Val Lewton, and then direct
the film. ``Bedlam'' was to be a vehicle for the actress Illeana
Douglas, then the girlfriend of Martin Scorsese, who was the
executive producer. Set in the 18th century, it is the tale of a
Quaker who tries to expose the conditions inside an insane asylum
and who himself becomes an inmate. Douglas was to play his love
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alison was attracted to all aspects of it,'' Charney says.
``It had a lot of morality lessons.'' After much tinkering, Maclean
finally gave up trying to tailor the screenplay to suit Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alison didn't see Illeana in the role, and that is where it
all broke down,'' Charney says. ``Alison is a very moral person, so
she told Marty herself. She was willing to risk her career to do
that. She's incredibly pure that way.'' According to several people
who were involved, Scorsese hit the roof. (Both he and Maclean have
declined to elaborate.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that the reception for ``Jesus' Son'' has changed her luck,
Maclean has been able to begin her next project, ``Iris,'' the
third of the scripts gathering dust at home. To be financed by New
York's Good Machine and Britain's FilmFour, and produced by Good
Machine's Ted Hope, the film could go into production as early as
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iris'' is a contemporary, supernatural, psychological tale
``about a woman who starts remembering things from her childhood
that didn't happen,'' Maclean says. ``One of the things it deals
with is sexual abuse of a child as a metaphor. The deep dark secret
of the family turns out to be that there is not a dark secret.''
But the film is dark nonetheless, and that sounds like Alison
Maclean at her most deliciously unadulterated.  &QL;

EGYPT'S FIRST LADY IS AT CENTER OF STRUGGLE FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Five years after thousands of women converged
on Beijing to draft what amounted to a bill of rights for women,
government officials and women's organizations are huddled again in
conference halls here, trying to turn those promises into concrete
prescriptions for action.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, midway through the process, some cultural
confrontations had kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   When familiar tensions between Western delegations and
conservatives led by the Vatican and supported by Catholic and
Muslim nations threatened to reopen battles over abortion and
family relationships, Suzanne Mubarak, Egypt's first lady, was
dismayed. Mubarak, who has worked to advance the rights of women
against the background of Islamic militancy, warned in an interview
Wednesday that such battles risk provoking a backlash that could
impede progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to be pulled into all these controversies,''
said Mubarak, who is leading the Egyptian delegation. ``We have too
many problems as it is. This makes people who are not extremists
become ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has been viewed as a pivotal country on women's rights
since the 1994 international conference on population in Cairo,
which put individual women, not governments, at the center of
family planning and demanded that they be given the tools to
determine their own reproductive lives.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1995 Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the
chairwoman was an Egyptian, Mervat Tallawy, a diplomat who is now a
government minister. Since the Cairo and Beijing conferences, Egypt
has outlawed genital cutting of girls and revised its civil code to
make it easier for a woman to obtain a divorce, and has expanded
and clarified women's rights in family law. A national council for
women has been established, which leads brainstorming sessions on
issues like how to field more female candidates in national
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak said Egyptian women did all this carefully, without
combative claims of absolute equality, and she believes that they
will have to continue this way. It is an argument heard frequently
from nations on the edge of cultural conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, she said, women have to speak against
false notions of Islam promoted by extremists who would deny girls
an education and their mothers jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the history, even the wife of the prophet was a
brave woman,'' Mubarak said. ``She was a businesswoman. So don't
come and tell me women can't go to work, if she was working.''
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak, who had an English mother and who married Hosni
Mubarak, an air force officer who is now Egypt's president, when
she was 17, decided after her two sons were in school ``that there
was something more I should do in my life.'' She enrolled at the
American University in Cairo, where she received a bachelor's
degree in political science and an master's in sociology. ``My
husband supported me,'' she said. ``He said, `OK, try it out. See
if you can do it, but on one condition: not at the expense of the
boys.'''
</P>
<P>
   She now urges other privileged women, many of whom she describes
as ``apolitical and apathetic,'' to do more for themselves and
other Egyptian women through civic organizations that are springing
up around the country. Some of these owe their inceptions to U.N.
conferences, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these international conferences, I think we have come a
long way both on the national and international level in bringing
women's issues to the forefront,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Bunch, who directs the Center for Women's Global
Leadership at Rutgers University in New Jersey, agrees with Suzanne
Mubarak that even with disagreements, the value of a meeting like
this one should not be discounted. ``Proposals and ideas are being
exchanged,'' Bunch said. ``I think a lot of good things are going
to come out of this that have nothing to do with the final
minutiae.''

U.S. SENDS CUBAN ATHLETE HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Breaking a long tradition, the Clinton
administration forcibly repatriated Wednesday a prominent Cuban
baseball player who had tried to slip into the United States by
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The athlete, Andy Morales, a big-hitting third baseman on Cuba's
national team, was returned home by Coast Guard authorities after
he failed to persuade American immigration agents that he deserved
political asylum, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-American advocates and Morales' family in the United
States voiced outrage at the action, which they said was
unprecedented. An immigration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, acknowledged that it was the first time in memory that
the United States had sent home a prominent Cuban athlete who had
tried to flee the country.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has welcomed dozens of defecting Cuban
athletes over the years, including Orlando Hernandez, the New York
Yankees pitcher, and his brother, Livan, the 1997 World
Series-winning pitcher of the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, who is Cuban-American, called the
decision on Morales ``a real shame.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Morales has renounced the government of Cuban President
Fidel Castro, ``it's going to be very hard for him,'' said
Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican. ``His life will be in
jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Batista, a Miami-based sports agent who was asked by
Morales' relatives to represent him, said that ``if he had made it
to the United States, I'm sure he would be in the major leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that Morales, who was picked up
off the Florida coast on Friday with 32 others, did not merit
special treatment and that his case had been handled like that of
any other Cuban refugee caught trying to enter the country
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Morales was aboard a speedboat when he was intercepted by the
Coast Guard and had apparently paid smugglers to help him cross the
Florida Straits, officials said. Two suspected smugglers are being
held in Florida. The other 30 would-be refugees were returned
Wednesday with Morales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not unprecedented to interdict migrants attempting to
enter the United States illegally,'' a State Department spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said Morales had been interviewed
twice by immigration agents and both times failed to make a case
that he faced persecution if returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who enjoyed a brief moment in the American spotlight
last year with a three-run homer in Cuba's victory over the
Baltimore Orioles in an exhibition game, told American authorities
he wanted to play in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he came here to play baseball. That does not
constitute a well-founded fear of persecution,'' said the
administration official, who asked not to be identified. ``This was
a blatant case of alien smuggling, well-organized and highly
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration position appeared to signal a hardening
toward Cubans who defy established procedures for immigrating to
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1995 accord, the United States agreed to take in a
minimum of 20,000 Cuban immigrants a year, processing them through
the American mission in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   From the administration's standpoint, the migration agreement
has been a rare point of harmony in United States-Cuban relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not condone blatant violations of U.S. law and do not
bring interdicted individuals into the United States except under
extraordinary circumstances, generally involving medical
emergencies,'' the State Department spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials have recently voiced fears that the case of Elian
Gonzalez, a 6-year-old Cuban boy locked in a custody battle between
his Cuban father and his Miami relatives, might jeopardize the
stabilizing accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is making sure there's no forced migration
issues and no rafter crisis,'' said Pamela Falk, a professor of
international law at the City University of New York law school.
``Partly it's because the mood in the country has shifted because
of Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   American policy, which is commonly referred to as the ``wet
foot, dry foot'' distinction, returns Cuban refugees like Morales
if they are intercepted at sea and cannot demonstrate a fear of
persecution. If they can demonstrate such a fear, the United States
will seek haven for them in a third country. But Cuban refugees who
reach American soil become eligible for permanent residency in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of Morales contrasted starkly with that of Orlando
Hernandez, who was one of Cuba's most celebrated pitchers until
1996, when he was banned from baseball after the government
suspected his intention to defect.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who said he had endured frequent harassment in Cuba,
drifted into the Bahamas after setting out in a leaky boat with six
others in 1998. Attorney General Janet Reno offered him political
asylum in the United States after Bahamian authorities refused to
hear his claim and prepared to send him home.
</P>
<P>
   But, guided by a savvy sports agent, Hernandez took refuge in
Costa Rica, which allowed him to avoid baseball's draft and
negotiate a $6.6 million contract as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Morales' father-in-law, Carlos Castillo of Miami, said the
ballplayer had left behind his wife and two children in Cuba
because he was ``desperate'' to make a better living in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Castillo, who was in touch by telephone with Morales' relatives
in Havana Wednesday night, accused American authorities of putting
the whole Cuban family at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They buried him alive and all the family,'' Castillo said.
``They just ended his career.''

   GORE PLANS `PROSPERITY TOUR'
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore will embark on a ``prosperity tour'' next
week. In contrast to President Clinton's ``poverty tour'' last year
highlighting failing communities that had been left behind
economically, the vice president plans to highlight the economic
successes of the last eight years _ and by extension hopes to
become associated with those successes.
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers say the flights to several cities across the
country are part of a larger strategy to emphasize the positive and
optimistic aspects of Gore's candidacy and will coincide with the
start this week of a $10 million advertising campaign that is also
intended to redefine the vice president's image. In that same
political vein, as part of the ``family agenda'' he has been
promoting over the last two weeks, Gore called Wednesday for a $30
billion package of tax credits and other assistance to help
children care for their elderly parents in the coming decade. ``I'm
proposing an initiative that's partly based on the experience that
Tipper and I have had,'' he told a group of nursing home residents
and their families in Palm Springs, Calif. ``Tipper's mother lives
with us, and we help provide her health care.''
</P>
<P>
   But since at least 2 million families are not fortunate enough
to have the resources to handle such expenses comfortably, he said
that what was needed was a $3,000-a-year tax credit to help others.
</P>
<P>
   CHALLENGE IN MASSACHUSETTS
</P>
<P>
   Jack E. Robinson, the Republican challenger for Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy's seat, says reports of the demise of his campaign have
been greatly exaggerated. It looked unlikely for a while that
Robinson would succeed in gathering the 10,000 signatures of voters
he needed by Tuesday to qualify for the race. But the Massachusetts
secretary of state's office credited him with 10,139 signatures
before the deadline passed, so Robinson, an entrepreneur, is still
in the running. But he still faces another major obstacle _
overcoming the embarrassing disclosures about his personal life,
from bad relations with women to traffic problems.

   The way that Molly Beth Malcolm, leader of the Texas Democratic
Party, sees it, Gov. George W. Bush is the kind of person who women

Morning News the other day. `There were lots of guys who were lots
of fun to go out with, and you wanted them at your party. But when
it came time to settle down, he wasn't the one you're looking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Texas Republican Party, Susan Weddington,
found that a ``real offensive'' observation and countered in Bush's
defense: ``We're choosing the leader of the free world, not a prom
date.''

ALBRIGHT TELLS SYRIANS AN ACCORD FOR PALESTINIANS IS FIRST GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told Syrian and
Egyptian officials Wednesday that the Clinton administration was
willing to push once more for peace talks between Damascus and
Israel, but that its main goal in its remaining months in office
was a settlement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no higher foreign policy priority for the Clinton
administration than an Israeli-Palestinian peace,'' Albright said
between meetings with President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Foreign
Minister Farouk Shara of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Capping a hastily scheduled three-day swing through the Middle
East, Albright appeared to be trying to clear the rubble off both
tracks of the peace effort. Arriving Wednesday morning from Israel,
where she secured an agreement to resume talks with the
Palestinians next week in Washington, Albright reiterated President
Clinton's hopes for conclusive negotiations there this summer with
Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and the president of the
Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the troubles of Barak's coalition might disrupt
the plans, Albright said Washington was sticking to ``its own
timetable'' for a peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rare opportunity to reach an accord, and we cannot
let it slip away,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong meeting with Shara, she stressed that ``the door
is still open'' to a renewal of American-sponsored talks between
Syria and Israel, a senior American official said. This was the
first high-level Syrian-American encounter since Clinton's meeting
with President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva in March, when the Syrians
effectively ended the talks by insisting that Israel would have to
surrender not just the entire Golan Heights, but also the
northeastern shore of the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beyond Geneva,'' a senior American official said after
the meeting. ``We are looking forward. We are not looking
backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright made it clear that the administration was aiming for a
comprehensive pact between Israel and the Palestinians, not Syria.
She said she believed that Israel and the Palestinian Authority
could negotiate compromises on core issues like refugees and the
status of Jerusalem before Sept. 13, the date that Arafat has
pledged to move toward the establishment of an independent state
with or without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes deadlines focus the mind,'' Albright said. ``I would
just like to announce, for those who care, we are not having a
summer vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington is also keeping a wary eye on the still volatile
situation in southern Lebanon. Albright said she expected the
United Nations to certify soon that Israel has fully withdrawn,
following the terms of U.N. resolutions adopted after Israel
occupied the zone 22 years ago. But Lebanon and Israel continue to
wrangle over fragments of territory along the hilly border line,
which has never been definitively negotiated or even surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Israel pulled back Wednesday from two small outposts north of a
provisional boundary newly demarcated by U.N. cartographers. But
the U.N. mission that is supervising the pullout contends that
Israel continues to violate withdrawal requirements in another
pocket, of pastures, near a border kibbutz. The disagreement,
though minor, may further delay official certification of the
withdrawal, which is required before U.N. forces can be deployed in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's discussions with Shara dealt as much with the Israeli
withdrawal from Lebanon as with prospects for new bilateral talks,
U.S. officials said. American and Israeli officials have voiced
concern that violence in southern Lebanon could disrupt talks with
the Palestinians, because of its political effects in Israel and
the fear that it could spark outbreaks by dissidents in the West
Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has more than 30,000 troops in Lebanon and maintains
effective political and economic control over the country. Albright
urged Beirut and Damascus to do more to pacify the frontier zone
that Hezbollah guerrillas now largely govern.
</P>
<P>
   In her talks with Shara, Albright did not reiterate the demand
for a Syrian withdrawal, concentrating on Syrian acceptance of the
U.N. verification of Israel's withdrawal, U.S. officials said.
Damascus and Washington are now ``pretty much in agreement'' about
the certification terms, an American official said.

 &HT;    UM's Hamilton considering Washington Wizards offer
 &HT;    By Jorge Milian
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. _ An emotionally-torn Leonard Hamilton
expects to decide soon whether he will accept Michael Jordan's
offer to coach the NBA's Washington Wizards or remain at the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who signed a seven-year extension to stay at UM in
April, has reached an agreement in principle with the Wizards on a
four-year contract that would pay him an average of $2 million per
season, according to the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton makes approximately $750,000 under his new UM contract.
</P>
<P>
   All that's left is for Hamilton to decide whether he wants to
accept the Wizards' job, then negotiate a buyout clause in his UM
contract that is believed to be worth at least $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an easy decision,'' said Hamilton on Wednesday.
``I just need time to sort this out and come to a conclusion that I
feel comfortable with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what I do. I love working with the kids here at the
University of Miami...(but) like most of us, I'm ambitious. So when
opportunities are made available, I think it's only the right thing
to do to give them strong consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked when he would decide, Hamilton said, ``As soon as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   UM Athletic Director Paul Dee said he hoped to convince Hamilton
to stay, but added the university had no plans to sweeten the
coach's contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want Leonard Hamilton to stay at the University of Miami,''
Dee said. ``We've been through good times and thin times...I'm also
a realist. I understand this opportunity is magnificent.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, Washington's president of basketball operations, and
Hamilton began talking about the Wizards' vacant coaching job in
May. The two men have known each other for ``a long time'',
according to Hamilton. Talks began to heat up after St. John's
coach Mike Jarvis turned down the Wizards' job just over two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 51, has never coached in the NBA. That doesn't seem to
bother Jordan who told the Associated Press on Wednesday that
Hamilton ``is certainly our leading candidate right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could make the transition from college to the NBA,
Hamilton said, ``If you're asking me if I think I'm capable of
coaching (in the NBA), I think time will tell.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton held a team meeting at his home with some of his
players on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   UM senior center Dwayne Wimberly, who was ``in shock'' when he
first heard the news concerning Hamilton, said the coach was very
emotional during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us he wanted our support,'' Wimberly said. ``He cares
about us. You can tell it's a hard decision for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton has coached at UM for 10 seasons. Last season, he led
the Hurricanes to their first Big East Conference regular season
championship and the school's first Sweet Sixteen berth. It was
UM's third consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Those accomplishments and the pursuit of several universities
looking for a coach earned Hamilton a contract extension and an
annual raise of approximately $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 144-147 at Miami, said Wednesday he was concerned that
he might be viewed as disloyal to UM if he accepts the Wizards'
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just uncomfortable because I don't want to be perceived as
a person that doesn't live up to his obligations,'' Hamilton said.
``I hope people don't automatically feel like I've lost my
integrity. I hope people understand that this is an opportunity
that I need to give strong consideration to.''
</P>
<P>
   A stumbling block to Hamilton accepting the job could be his
buyout. Sources have placed the fee anywhere from $1 million to $2
million. Dee declined to give specifics accept to say that on-going
discussions would ``lead to some resolution one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be very difficult for us to lose (Hamilton), to
replace somebody like that,'' Dee said.
</P>
<P>
   If Hamilton leaves, UM's new coach might have to worry about
keeping a recruiting class that has been consensusly ranked among
the nation's top 10. Those players, which include McDonald's
All-America forward Darius Rice, have already signed letters of
intent and are obligated to UM for one season. Rice's father said
Wednesday night that the family would have no comment until ``Coach
Hamilton makes his final decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee said UM would be unlikely to give players their release if
Hamilton left. Dee cited a situation in 1989 when Jimmy Johnson
left as UM's football coach and was replaced by Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Krein, an incoming freshman, requested but lost an appeal
to be released from his scholarship. Krein went on to become an
All-Big East defensive end.

LAWSUIT ACCUSES FASHION HOUSE OF RUNNING SWEATSHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A class-action lawsuit filed Wednesday accuses one of
New York's best-known fashion houses, Donna Karan, of running
sweatshops that cheated workers out of millions of dollars in
overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by the Asian American Legal Defense and
Education Fund, contends that Donna Karan and several factories
that make or made its clothing systematically break the law by not
paying time and a half to employees who are forced to work seven
days a week, usually putting in nearly 75 hours each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too scared to miss a day because I was worried that if I
did, I would lose my job,'' said Feng Jiang, an immigrant from
China, who also said she sometimes worked 100 days in a row for a
Manhattan factory that made Donna Karan gowns and dresses.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, is the
first class-action suit accusing a New York clothing manufacturer
of operating sweatshops. In other instances, once workers accused
their factories of not paying the minimum wage or overtime, the
fashion houses abandoned those factories and moved work to others,
where conditions were often little different.
</P>
<P>
   This suit seeks to prevent that by covering workers at any
factory that does a substantial amount of work for Donna Karan.
``This is a broad-based attack on sweatshops in New York,'' said
Kenneth Kimerling, legal director of the Asian American fund.
``We're sending a clear signal that you can't run away.''
</P>
<P>
   Jiang and the other four plaintiffs said they worked for a
factory, Jen Chu Fashion, that did not pay them time and a half for
the time they worked in excess of 40 hours a week, as is required
by law.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang said she typically worked 73 hours a week _ 11 hours a day
Monday through Friday, 10 hours on Saturdays and 8 hours on
Sundays. Many of the workers earned $8.50 an hour, but Jiang, who
is paid piecework, said she often earned less than the minimum wage
of $5.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said that most of Jen Chu Fashion's work was for
Donna Karan and that the factory closed two weeks ago, shortly
after they made their overtime claims. They said most of the Donna
Karan work had been moved to a factory owned by the same family and
in the same building on Eighth Avenue. Efforts to reach officials
at both factories were unsuccessful Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As many fashion houses do, Donna Karan International asserts
that it should not be held responsible for wage and hour violations
committed by factories with which it contracts. In a statement
Wednesday, the company said it expected its contractors to comply
with labor laws and ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
   The company said: ``We believe that the claims against the
company are without merit, and plan to defend against them
vigorously. We do not believe we should be held responsible for
another company's business practices over which we have no control,
particularly where we understand the workers are represented by a
union.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimerling contended that under federal and state law, Donna
Karan should be considered a joint employer with its contractors'
factories because it exercises so much control over the factories
and because most of their production is for Donna Karan. Joint
employers can be held liable for wage and hour violations.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs and about 50 supporters held a noontime
demonstration yesterday in front of the DKNY store at 60th Street
and Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   At the demonstration, which was organized by the Chinese Staff
and Workers' Association and National Mobilization Against
Sweatshops, protesters carried signs saying, ``Donna Karan is the
Sweatshop Queen'' and ``Donna Karan exploits women.''
</P>
<P>
   Most workers at the Manhattan factories that Donna Karan uses
are female immigrants from China.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerling said the proposed class for the suit would consist of
at least 300 workers, spread over several factories. He estimated
that each worker was owed at least $10,000 in overtime pay and, he
said the damages would beclimb into the millions.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Jen Chu factory closed, its 60 workers were
represented by Local 89-22-1 of the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees. Richard Rumelt, the manager, said
the local had no knowledge of extensive overtime violations because
the workers had not filed grievances about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what's in the lawsuit is true, it's absolutely
outrageous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Staff and Workers Association, an advocacy group
that often accuses the union of not representing garment workers
vigorously, worked closely with the employees in bringing the
lawsuit and organized Wednesday's demonstration.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts say garment workers are often reluctant to
complain about overtime violations because they fear they will be
fired, and because they often receive off-the-books cash payments
that they fear may be brought to light.

 ANALYSIS: CONSUMERS SHOULDN'T EXPECT IMMEDIATE CHANGES  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Whatever real changes in the technology
landscape Wednesday's decision in the Microsoft antitrust case
ultimately produces, consumers won't see them any time soon. And
when they do come, they're likely to take a gradual and subtle
form, rather than revolutionary upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's not-so-final judgment itself
notes that the most dramatic provision _ the splitting of Microsoft
into two companies, one selling Windows operating systems, the
other offering Office, Internet Explorer and all the other current
company's products _ won't go into effect until appeals are
complete.
</P>
<P>
   And to no one's surprise, Microsoft lawyers confirmed within
minutes after the ruling's release that they will file an appeal in
the next few days. Experts expect the appeal process to take a year
or more.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, there will still be only one Microsoft.
Windows will still come preinstalled on virtually every new
consumer PC, although starting sometime this summer, it will be a
new version called Windows Millennium Edition, which will look and
feel pretty much like the familiar Windows 95 and 98. In the
business market, the company will continue to promote Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Explorer Web browser will still be built into both
versions of the system. And Microsoft will still be issuing press
releases about its plans to integrate Windows and the Internet more
tightly in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the prices for new PCs, operating-system upgrades or
applications and games likely to change appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Some Action Could Happen Soon
</P>
<P>
   The ruling does, however, impose a long list of restrictions on
Microsoft's business practices that are scheduled to go into effect
in 90 days _ the week after Labor Day. Microsoft will undoubtedly
seek to get these provisions, like the breakup plan, suspended
pending the outcome of the appeal, but there's no guarantee higher
courts will grant the company's request.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Unlike the breakup plan, these restrictions, or ``conduct
remedies,'' address evidence of Microsoft misdeeds presented during
the 78-day trial. Microsoft will be hard put to prove that the
remedies would do it harm, so there is a good chance they will go
into effect this fall, as the case winds its way through the
appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   If imposed, the conduct remedies could give users _ at least
those buying new PCs _ noticeably more choice about how their
systems look and work. The judge's order, for example, gives PC
manufacturers more freedom to customize the desktop by adding their
own first screen, browser favorites and setup ``wizards.'' They'll
also have the option of removing icons Microsoft has traditionally
locked onto the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The order even allows PC makers to provide alternatives to the
conventional Windows user interface, as long as they also include a
button that would take the user back to the standard Windows
desktop. Some PC makers could take advantage of this clause to
appeal to the 50 percent or so of U.S. households that don't yet
have a PC by offering products with simpler interfaces, perhaps
tailored to specific market segments like young children, teens or
seniors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
New Options for PC Makers
</P>
<P>
   And because the order bars Microsoft from forcing PC makers to
include its other software products or to limit bundling of
third-party software, more PCs could come with competitors'
products: Netscape Navigator in addition to Internet Explorer, for
example; Corel's WordPerfect Office or Sun's StarOffice instead of
Microsoft Office; Real Networks' RealPlayer or Apple's QuickTime in
addition to Microsoft's Windows Media Player.
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft adds new features to Windows, such as multimedia
viewers, PC makers could choose not to include them. As a result,
Microsoft would have to reduce its price for the operating system
proportionately, and the savings could be passed on to customers in
the form of lower prices for PCs without all the bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   If the breakup plan ultimately takes effect and Microsoft is
split, the likely results are harder to predict. The Justice
Department contends that its plan will restore competition to the
software marketplace, but it would do so only in indirect ways.
Instead of a single monopoly there would be two, at least at the
beginning of the post-split period. One would market the dominant
operating system and the other the dominant office productivity
suite and Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   The case that this will produce new competition rests on several
unproved assumptions about the behavior of the new companies. Part
of the argument is that the proposed applications and browser
company will have strong incentives to offer its products in other
operating systems, such as Linux, and thereby make these
alternatives more credible competitors to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department argument, now accepted by the judge, also
assumes that both new companies will be motivated to develop
additional ``cross-platform products'' _ software and Internet
services that will be available on any computing platform, not just
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It even foresees the possibility that each could begin competing
with the other. The applications company, in theory, could
eventually produce its own operating system to compete with
Windows, while the operating-systems company could develop its own
alternative to Office.
</P>
<P>
   sh1 More Competition Possible
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, even though both new companies would be
powerhouses in their own right, neither could match the wealth,
clout and talent Microsoft has amassed, and Bill Gates could direct
only one of them. That presumably reduces the chances that either
could acquire the grip Microsoft has today on such emerging markets
as Web services, hand-held computers, Web-capable cell phones and
``set-top boxes'' that integrate digital services with television _
markets that are expected to set the technology pace in the coming
decade.

 JUDGE ORDERS MICROSOFT SPLIT IN TWO  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The federal judge who found that Microsoft
crushed rivals and stifled innovation Wednesday ordered the
software titan to be sliced into two, ending a major chapter in the
acrimonious two-year antitrust battle and setting the stage for a
lengthy appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ruling hewed
closely to the remedy proffered by the Justice Department and
attorneys general from 17 states, including California.
</P>
<P>
   If it survives the appeals process, the plan is expected to have
wide-ranging effects on the high-tech industry and on consumers,
though opinions differ on whether competition will flourish and
consumers will pay less for software _ goals that have motivated
the government's crusade against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the judge said that Microsoft can't be trusted to compete
fairly, therefore necessitating the first breakup of a U.S. company
since AT&AMP;T was carved up into ``Baby Bells'' 16 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A structural remedy has become imperative,'' the judge wrote.
``Microsoft as it is presently organized and led is unwilling to
accept the notion that it broke the law or accede to an order
amending its conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's plan entails breaking the company into two distinct
firms:
</P>
<P>
   -- One would develop and sell the Windows operating systems for
corporations and consumers.
</P>
<P>
   -- The other would control the company's applications _
including the popular Office suite of word processing and
spreadsheet programs _ and Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft must submit a plan to split itself up in four months.
The two companies could not unite for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Jackon's order, widely expected last week but delayed by one
last round of briefs from both sides, also includes a range of
curbs on Microsoft's legendarily aggressive business tactics. They
include prohibiting the company from discriminatory pricing for
hardware makers and making public portions of the closely guarded
Windows source code.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, the so-called conduct remedies could go into
effect within 90 days. However the company said it is seeking an
injunction preventing the measure from going into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said the ruling will have a profound
impact ``not only by promoting competition in the software industry
but by reaffirming the importance of antitrust laws in the software
era.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has called the plan ``draconian'' and
``unjustified,'' vowed again to appeal both the legal findings and
the remedies and believes it will succeed in overturning those
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling ... is unreasonable in its call to break up
Microsoft and regulate software design; and it contradicts the
reality that consumers see every day,'' said the company's
chairman, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly the most massive attempt at government
regulation of the technology industry ever, and it was conceived by
the government and imposed by this ruling without a single day of
testimony or scrutiny,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   From Jackson's courtroom, the case is likely to move to the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., although government
attorneys are seeking an expedited review by the U.S. Supreme
Court. The appeals court had sided with Microsoft in a similar
case.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's remedy is aimed at spurring additional product
offerings from smaller companies now squeezed out of the
marketplace and precluding the software behemoth from future
antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that
Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as
it has in the past, and may yet do to other markets what it already
has done in the PC operating system and browser markets,'' the
judge wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that Microsoft competitors, armed with the
Windows code, will develop word-processing programs, Web browsers
and other products that will compete with Microsoft's popular
stable of applications. The ``apps'' company will develop programs
for alternative operating systems, such as Linux, thereby lessening
Windows' dominance. Eventually, the two entities may compete with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is little consensus on the long-term
ramifications of the ruling for the software industry, hardware
makers and consumers, in part because the high-tech landscape is a
fluid, ever-changing place.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, handheld devices like cell phones and digital
personal organizers _ an arena where Microsoft has proven weak _
are expected to shift computing beyond Microsoft's traditional
bastion, the PC. Some say that evolution makes the decision moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has been operating under a competitive paradigm
that has become almost obsolete,'' said Hillard Sterling, a Chicago
antitrust attorney. ``Every day brings new products and mrkets
that provide increasing access to consumers and that have nothing
to do with Microsoft's browser and the operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's opponents _ which the company has accused of
pressuring Washington to pursue the case _ hailed the decision as a
first step toward creating real alternatives in the software
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Microsoft can stifle Apple and Netscape, they can do it to
thousands of people who can't get their ideas off the ground,''
said Mike Pettit, executive director of an anti-Microsoft trade
group. ``Splitting up the company will unleash a robust new round
of innovation ... and I think that will be the greatest benefit
when we look back at the judge's ruling 20 years hence.''
</P>
<P>
   Some immediate winners may be the big dogs like networking giant
Cisco and the Finnish cell phone maker Nokia.
</P>
<P>
   While the antitrust shadow lingers over Microsoft, ``companies
are going to be shifting from buying PCs and operating systems to
building out their networks and wireless systems,'' said Rob
Enderle, analyst at Giga Information Group.
</P>
<P>
   However, Enderle is concerned that dismantling the world's
largest software company will create chaos in the consumer market,
which has come to rely on the ubiquity of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're an MSN user, you touch Microsoft a lot,'' he said.
``This next phase is going to make it very difficult for consumers
to depend on the people within Microsoft who might answer their
service questions, because many of them will be departing.''
</P>
<P>
   Though much remains murky, a few things are certain. The legal
salvos will continue, and a breakup probably won't occur for at
least a year or more, if it happens at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has a real shot at reversing Jackson outright,''
Sterling said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Sterling, the government never proved that
Microsoft locked competitors out of the marketplace; and he
believes the breakup order goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he questioned the speed at which Jackson concluded
the last phase of the trial. In one of its last filings, Microsoft
requested an additional six months to hold essentially a mini-trial
on the remedies. Jackson denied the motion.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday's ruling came just about 24 hours after Microsoft
filed its last response to the government's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackson's lightning-quick decision raises inferences for these
appellate judge that something is wrong here,'' Sterling said.
``These appellate judges must be wondering why judge Jackson didn't
take more time to craft a remedy carefully and deliberately.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the details of its fate are more clear, many wonder
whether Microsoft's zenith has come and gone _ along with its stock
price. Since late December, the company's shares have fallen 42
percent, erasing tens of billions in market value.
</P>
<P>
   Investors fear a dismembered company will not be worth the sum
of its parts. Others wonder how the company will function in the
interim.
</P>
<P>
   In two weeks, Microsoft is scheduled to hold a splashy confab
for media and analysts on its ``Next Generation Windows Services''
project. The multibillion-dollar initiative is aimed at making
Microsoft's mainly PC-dependent software available on a host of
devices, from cell phones to personal digital assistants. Gates has
said the effort is ``doomed'' if the company is carved up.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe the company will be in dire straits well before
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to start losing people. Companies aren't going
to trust them, because Microsoft's future is going to be so
uncertain and Next Generation Windows Services will essentially be
stillborn,'' Enderle said. ``They're going to be severely crippled
until the appeals process is over.''

 microsoft's bay area staff reacts to judge's decisaHEADLINE HERE  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF and CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Employees on Microsoft's Mountain View, Calif.,
campus rarely watch television together except to talk about how to
make it more Internet compatible.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, about a dozen of them in Building No. 5 made an
exception for a few minutes to confirm what they already assumed:
their company would be divided in two.
</P>
<P>
   They watched silently, some leaning against the wall, some
standing on scooters, some petting a colleague's dog, as
Microsoft's fate was reported on CNBC, the cable news channel.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing enough, they eagerly explained that the decision
will not be a distraction and, in fact, many had meetings to go to
in a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of work to do,'' said Alex Crovetto, a software
testing manager, while standing on a skateboard and finishing off a
protein milk shake. ``None of this impacts what we're doing. I'm
just glad to see a decision finally made.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, employees unanimously agreed that the decision to
break up Microsoft is wrong. A few snickered when a television
journalist reported that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who oversaw
the trial, wrote in his opinion that the company was
``untrustworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you determine that an entire company is
untrustworthy?'' asked Mo Harkness, a test engineer, who said that
the breakup left her feeling ``pretty bummed.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkness is one of many employees who said she did not know
where she would fit in a Microsoft divided into separate operating
systems and software companies. The problem, she and others said,
is that employees often work in both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like breaking up McDonalds into separate hamburger and
french fry companies,'' said Dick Craddock, a group manager. ``How
can you make a Happy Meal?''
</P>
<P>
   Craddock added that Wednesday's ruling should not affect
employee retention, even though the company's lawyers claimed
during the trial that a break_up might lead employees to leave.
Despite the uncertainty caused by the trial, he said, only one
worker has left his group in the past two years and that was for
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,000 people work at Microsoft's Mountain View campus on
projects like Internet Explorer for Apple computers, Powerpoint
software and Web TV, which enable people to use the Internet in
conjunction with television. The company's headquarters is in
Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that the ruling did not seem to destroy was the
employees' appetite for amusement. Not long after getting the news,
about a dozen workers were standing around a ping pong table to
watch a match.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the microsoftSF store in San Francisco was an art
exhibit that provided a series of mini-metaphors of Microsoft's
plight. To raise money for charity, artists and local celebrities
had crafted dioramas around the Microsoft computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   One called ``Tidy Bowl Dreams'' had a disemboweled Microsoft
mouse immersed in a jar of clear liquid, while the ``X-Actosaurus''
was a mouse decked out like a porcupine, bristling with dozens of
razor-sharp X-Acto blades _ similar to the way Microsoft's rivals
view it.
</P>
<P>
   Another display said it all. Called ``End of Game/Richest Player
Wins,'' it was a hamster cage filled with shredded Monopoly money,
with a Microsoft mouse perched strategically on the exercise wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers at microsoftSF, the only store in the world dedicated
to the software giant, were tepid about the prospect of splitting
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Casebolt, who works at business-systems maker EDS in Denver
and whose brother is a project manager at Microsoft, said he thinks
Gates may be ruthless, but ``the nature of business is
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilona Nagy, a buyer at Macy's in Manhattan, was worried about
how a break-up might affect her work life. ``We use all their
software. Will everything we've done have to go through a huge
conversion process?'' she wondered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monopoly is a bad word, but it's not necessarily a bad
thing,'' said Bruce Hunter of Sausalito. ``It lets them create
things on a bigger scale and make things work together.''
</P>
<P>
   The lone dissenter was Isaac Silverman, who just finished his
junior year of high school in Meadow Vista, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea'' to break up Microsoft, he said.
``The Windows OS seems to have squashed all the competition, even
though the Macintosh is a superior machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Next door at the Moscone Center, the JavaOne conference was in
full swing, drawing 20,000 Java programmers. Sherry Wang, a
quality-assurance engineer from Mountain View, supported the
break-up. ``I want to be able to choose what applications I use
with my OS and not have it chosen for me,'' she said. ``I don't
want to boot up my machine and have IE (Internet Explorer) staring
me in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Orville Pike, a programmer from Annapolis, Md., said he thinks
market forces ultimately will decide Microsoft's fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``No company has stayed the leader from one generation to the
next. No matter what the judge did, their time has come. Look at
the new Net companies _ it's their turn now.''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague Nick Bhadanga agreed. ``Microsoft has had its 15
minutes _ okay, 20 years _ of fame.''

 GATES SEEKS FRIENDLIER LEGAL TURF  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Faced with U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's damning antitrust verdict and breakup order, Microsoft
will move quickly to shift its case to what it hopes will be the
friendlier turf of the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the appeals court is considered potentially so much
friendlier that the Department of Justice _ with Judge Jackson's
encouragement _ may attempt to invoke a little-used procedure to
bypass the appeals court and take the case directly to the U.S.
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates seemed almost relieved that the
case was finally out of Jackson's court, calling Wednesday's ruling
``the first day of the rest of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates announced that he will immediately request a stay on the
so-called conduct remedies, ordered to take effect in 90 days, that
restrict Microsoft's business behavior.
</P>
<P>
   How the appeals court rules on that request could signal its
posture toward the case. More important, legal experts said, a stay
could quash any effort to short-circuit the case to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic of a stay is that it is less likely that the Supreme
Court will take the case if the D.C. appeals court is engaged
substantively in the matter,'' said Daniel M. Wall, a partner at
the San Francisco law firm Latham &AMP; Watkins.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts said it is unlikely the case will go directly
to the high court, given its focus on narrow issues of law and
distaste for taking huge cases that have not already been
thoroughly sifted by the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member appeals court _ from which a three-judge panel
would be drawn at random to hear the Microsoft case _ is considered
one of the country's most conservative. A majority of its judges
were appointed by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The court includes Judge Douglas H. Ginsberg, schooled at the
University of Chicago, the academic nerve center of free-market
antitrust thinking that has shifted antitrust law in a much less
interventionist direction over the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The D.C. Court of Appeals is also considered one of the nation's
most sophisticated, handling many cases dealing with the arcane
technicalities and applications of federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a court which has, even more so than other courts of
appeal, a roster of highly intelligent judges used to dealing with
pretty complicated factual and legal issues,'' said Joe Sims, a
partner at the Washington law firm Jones, Day. ``So if you're
interested in getting the right answer, assuming there is one, this
is the court you'd like to see it go to, which is more likely than
most to produce the legally correct answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The D.C. Court of Appeals also is the court that overturned
Judge Jackson in a 3-to-2 ruling for Microsoft in 1998 _ just
before the current case began.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court held that Microsoft did not violate a 1995
consent decree by incorporating its Web browser, Internet Explorer,
into its Windows operating system _ the very heart of the current
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty conservative court,'' Wall said. ``I think the
betting is that Microsoft would be very unlikely on appeal to draw
a panel that didn't contain at least one quite conservative judge
that the government would have little prospect of persuading.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Microsoft case has demonstrated anything, it is
ideology a poor predictor of how people view the company's
behavior. Judge Jackson was a Reagan appointee. Judge Robert Bork,
a Chicago-school antitrust scholar, is among Microsoft's most
vociferous critics.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Jackson's ruling was so unambiguous that the software
giant faces an uphill battle on appeal, even though chairman Bill
Gates insists that Microsoft will ultimately prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals courts seldom overturn a lower court's findings of fact
unless they are clearly erroneous, and Judge Jackson's fact
findings hold that Microsoft illegally abused its monopoly in the
Windows computer operating system to foist its other products on
consumers and elbow out competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the most important things is the record,'' said Ed
Black, president of the Computer and Communications Industry
Association, a vocal Microsoft critic. ``And here we have a very
exhaustive 412 findings of fact, so there is a very, very powerful
record, and Microsoft has lost on the facts overwhelmingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's chief line of attack will focus on Judge Jackson's
findings of law, which are more open to re-examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``On legal conclusions, courts reverse all the time, and that
would not be horribly surprising,'' Sims said.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments could focus on such questions as whether a breakup is
workable, whether it is properly aimed at Microsoft's contested
behavior, and whether it is ``disruptive or disabling to the
defendant'' in reaching that goal, Sims said. ``If that's the
standard they use, you can see there's a lot of room for argument
on all those points.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Microsoft's chief arguments _ won at the D.C. Appeals
Court once before _ is that it should not be illegal to incorporate
new products, such as its Web browser, into Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Wall called that argument ``the strongest point without a
doubt,'' noting that Judge Jackson went so far as to state that the
appeals court had wrongly overturned him on that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is very central to this case,'' Wall said. ``It's not
some backwater issue, and here the odds favor Microsoft. The whole
notion that integrating new functions into a product could be
illegal is contrary to most existing authority.''
</P>
<P>
   But Black contends that Microsoft's chances on appeal are dim
because it will not have an opportunity to reargue the entire case.
Black said the appellate court need only find that Judge Jackson
``did a sensible job of using facts and judgment,'' and if that is
the case, ``the presumption is his ruling stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Some contend that Jackson's brusque dismissal of hearings on the
proposal to break up the company _ the most radical remedy in
antitrust law _ could invite scrutiny on due process grounds.
</P>
<P>
   However, if Microsoft won an appeal on due process grounds, the
most it could gain is time, because the case would simply be
remanded back to Jackson for more hearings, with probably the same
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The case has few precedents, making predictions hazardous. The
famous breakup of the AT&AMP;T in 1984 was the result of a settlement,
not a court order. Moreover, AT&AMP;T was a government-regulated
monopoly, not an independent company. And there has never been a
court-ordered breakup of a legally acquired monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a big track record of monopoly cases that have
been tried to conclusion and a remedy imposed and reviewed on
appeal,'' said Sims. ``I can't think of a situation since I've been
practicing law, and that's 30 years, of any significant case where
this situation has arisen before.''

COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: AOL PICTURES SEEN BUT NOT SENT  &HT;     BY DAVID EINSTEIN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Q: I connect to the Internet via America Online.
When I save pictures off the Web, I can view them just fine. But if
I e-mail pictures to other people, sometimes they can't open them
up. What's the problem and, more important, what's the solution?
</P>
<P>
   A: The problem is that AOL saves some images in its own
proprietary format, using the extension .art. Unfortunately, few
other programs can open .art files. The newest version of
Microsoft's Internet Explorer has an installation option that lets
you view them, but that's not going to solve your problem, because
you can't be sure that the person to whom you send pictures has IE
with the .art viewer installed.
</P>
<P>
   There is a solution, however. After saving your image as an .art
file, open it up in AOL by using the Open function in the File
menu. Then re-save the image _ only this time you should have the
option of saving it in .jpg format. That's the most popular format
for storing Internet images, and all your friends should be able to
view it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Whacked-Out Printer
</P>
<P>
   Q: I use Internet Explorer for Web surfing. Somehow, something
got switched and my printer now prints in landscape instead of
portrait mode _ in other words, sideways on the paper instead of
top to bottom. I have tried everything I can think of to fix this.
I've gone to File, then Print and changed the properties, which
works until I log off. But the next time I get online, it's back to
landscape. So I have to go in every time and change it before I
print. Help.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It sounds like you've somehow changed your printer's global
default setting from portrait to landscape. That would affect the
printing orientation of most, if not all, Windows programs. And
changing the properties from inside a program won't change the
default _ as you've discovered.
</P>
<P>
   What you need to do is switch the properties for the printer
itself _ rather than for the individual print job. Click the
Windows Start button, point to settings and choose Printers.
Right-click the icon for your printer and choose Properties. Now
find the settings for paper orientation and choose Portrait (the
dialog box for this may be different for different printers).
Finally, click OK and close the Properties window. That should do
it.
</P>
<P>
   The Skinny on Screen Burn
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: What is the truth about ``screen burn''? How long must an image
remain on the screen before it burns in and ruins the monitor? Some
of my screen savers have partially static images that I would think
are just as dangerous as any other image such as a home page or
desktop wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Relax. Today's PC monitors are practically impervious to screen
burn. In fact, you don't even need a screen saver. I had a computer
at work that I never turned off, and it would sit there all night
displaying the Windows desktop. After two years, there was no
burn-in, and the display was as sharp and clear as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than worry about screen savers, why don't you configure
your PC to turn the monitor off after 15 or 20 minutes if nobody's
using it. That way, you'll put your mind to rest, and at the same
time you'll score points with the conservationists by saving
electricity. Right-click any empty area of your desktop and choose
Properties, then tab over to Screen Saver. If your monitor supports
energy-saving features, you'll see a special section for that at
the bottom of the window. Click Settings, and the rest of the
procedure should be easy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Banishing Unwanted Icons
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: How can I get rid of the icons in the bottom right corner of the
Windows Desktop? I have a Dell computer and it preloads a bunch of
stuff I don't need. I have 12 icons down there, not counting the
clock and the Internet connection icon. I know I can right-click on
them and close them temporarily, but how can I get rid of them
permanently?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: First thing to do is check your c:Windows/Start Menu/Programs/
StartUp folder. You should find files there that are responsible
for loading some of the unwanted icons. Feel free to delete those
files.
</P>
<P>
   Not all programs are loaded via the StartUp folder, however. If
your computer is loaded with Windows 98, you can track down the
programs by following these steps: Click the Windows Start button,
choose Run, type in MSConfig and click OK. This will open the
System Configuration Utility. Tab over to Startup and you'll see
checked boxes for programs that load during startup. If you find
one you don't want, uncheck the box. But be careful. Some of these
programs may be required by your system. So only dump the ones
you're sure about.
</P>

EISNER CALLS FOR WAR ON INTERNET PIRATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner urged Congress
on Wednesday to protect copyrighted intellectual properties by
enacting tough new curbs against piracy on the Internet, including
mandating that computer manufacturers produce hardware with
built-in safeguards against hacking.
</P>
<P>
   Using clips from the new Disney animated feature ``Dinosaur'' as
a prop, Eisner told an all-star lineup of Senate and House members
at the Capitol luncheon that ``there is no way around it, theft is
theft, whether it is enabled by a handgun or a computer keyboard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have created a movie (`Dinosaur') that took four years to
make, during which 45 million megabytes were crunched - enough to
fill 70,000 CD-ROMs - all to generate data for an 80-minute film,''
Eisner said. ``Were it to fall in the wrong hands, it could be
compressed onto a single DVD disc in a matter of minutes and put on
the Internet while the movie is still in theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   His announcement came amid growing worries in the entertainment
industry over the impact of new broadband Internet technology.
Broadband, now in an estimated 5 million homes nationwide, allows
for much faster transmission and downloading of computer data,
including digitized movies and music.
</P>
<P>
   Using older Internet technology, it can take up to 24 hours to
download a feature-length film. With broadband, the process can
take 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner specifically asked Congress to mandate that all computer
and software manufacturers build anti-hacking systems into their
products. He also called for an expanded international crackdown on
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney chief also announced that the entertainment industry
plans to take a leading role in efforts to develop encryption and
other security systems ``to stay one step ahead of the hackers.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner also called for a campaign to educate the public on the
evils of copyright infringement. He also advocated a fair pricing
policy for movies and music that would make pirated copies less
attractive to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   While Eisner expressed confidence that the computer industry
would cooperate with the anti-piracy effort, he noted that some
leaders of the high-tech sector are reluctant to put any access
restrictions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it disingenuous of computer companies to fight
copyright protections,'' said Eisner.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that failure to curb piracy could lead to the demise
of the Internet. Eisner said that if intellectual properties and
income from such efforts are ``allowed to be pirated away, then the
creative risk takers will put their energies elsewhere and the
Internet will become a wonderful delivery system with nothing
wonderful to deliver.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner told the lawmakers that legislation was the only real
remedy, adding: ``Would the car companies have put in seat belts
without a law?''
</P>
<P>
   California Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, the House's
leading expert on copyright protection, expressed support for
Eisner's proposal. He led the fight in 1998 for passage of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which bans the manufacture and
import of technology that is specifically designed to facilitate
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   Berman is currently pushing a bill that would step up
enforcement of copyright laws by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to put more resources and a higher priority on this
effort,'' Berman said. ``I believe a few high-profile prosecutions
can have a tremendous effect on piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The film industry's effort to shut out pirates will be led by
the Motion Picture Association of America. Jack Valenti, MPAA
chairman and Hollywood's star Washington lobbyist, said Wednesday
that he is putting together a team of experts ``to put a
technological armor plate around our properties on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti and Eisner said piracy of films is still in its infancy,
given the limited access to broadband technology. And many films
posted on the Internet are of poor quality, including some
videotaped off theater screens.
</P>
<P>
   But both men warned that Hollywood could be in for a pirate
siege within 18 months, when both broadband and digital video disc
technology are expected to be in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   Among the existing gateways to film piracy on the Internet is
Scour.com, which allows users to seek out, exchange and copy
movies. On Wednesday, the Web site advertised links to
download-ready copies of ``Gladiator'' and ``Mission: Impossible
2,'' which are still in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood agent and Disney president
who received a $130 million golden parachute when he left the
Burbank-based entertainment giant in 1996, is one of two majority
owners of Scour.com.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on Ovitz's Internet venture, Eisner said:
``He's just one of 30 companies out there involved in this. But I
believe he has more sensitivity to the needs of the artists.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisner said piracy threatens the nation's overall economic
health, noting that from 1977 to 1997, the combined income of the
film, TV, home video, music, publishing and computer software
industries rose from $160 billion per year to $530 billion. He also
stressed that the value of exports of U.S. intellectual properties
increased from $36 billion to $66 billion per year from 1991 to
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Eisner, ever the showman, sprinkled his presentation with
playful plugs for Disney. In addition to the ``Dinosaur'' clips,
his audience - which included Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and
California Reps. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, and Henry Waxman,
D-Los Angeles - was given multimedia reminders of the extent of
Disney's realm. Plugs were inserted for ESPN, the Disney Channel,
ABC-TV and its hit game show, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eisner was dead serious when discussing Internet pirates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about the comical characters sailing the high
seas at the Pirates of the Caribbean,'' he said. ``Rather, I'm
talking about an underground of secretive and sequestered Pirates
of Encryption, the hackers who shamelessly assert that anything
they can get their hands on is legally theirs.''

DREIFORT WILL TAKE `W' FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Darren Dreifort wanted to pitch better. But
it was more important just to get a win.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort hadn't done that in three weeks and had been pretty
awful since throwing a two-hit shutout last month in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But in the postgame clubhouse Wednesday afternoon, Dreifort
looked over at teammate Kevin Brown, who was brilliant in losing
two nights earlier, and made no apologies for his part in an 11-6
victory over the Texas Rangers at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take this any time,'' said Dreifort, who allowed nine
hits and four runs in seven innings. ``You look at what happened to
Brownie the other night and it doesn't make sense. You just have to
go with what you've got. Winning is all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, that means some occasional
anxiety. Dreifort was counted on to be one of the club's top
starters in his final year before free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said recently that the key to his team making a move in
the National League West will be the consistency of his starting
pitching. He has to look no further than division-leading Arizona,
which has dropped five straight since Randy Johnson skipped a start
with a tired shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   For the Dodgers, Brown is Brown. Tuesday, rookie Eric Gagne
finally won his first game on his eighth try. Chan Ho Park pitches
tonight against Houston at Dodger Stadium having won his last two
starts.
</P>
<P>
   They still are concerned about erratic left-hander Carlos Perez,
who has won four games but has a 5.61 ERA. Perez, who starts Friday
against the Oakland A's, has agreed to be sent to the minors if he
doesn't pitch well.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort was pounded for 13 runs in seven innings during his
last two appearances. And Wednesday, after his team took a 4-0 lead
in the second against Rick Helling (7-4), Dreifort quickly gave up
two runs.
</P>
<P>
   But after Rusty Greer doubled home a third run in the bottom of
the third, Dreifort found his composure, retiring eight of the next
nine batters.
</P>
<P>
   He was nicked for another run in the fifth on an RBI double by
Rafael Palmeiro, but when Dave Hansen's two-run double capped a
four-run Dodger sixth, this was a game Dreifort wouldn't give back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good to see him get in a rhythm,'' Johnson said. ``He
found himself later in the game and I thought he pitched pretty
well. We needed that.''
</P>
<P>
   With just four regulars in the lineup because of injuries to
catcher Todd Hundley, shortstop Kevin Elster, center fielder Devon
White and third baseman Adrian Beltre, the Dodgers also needed a
big game from their bench.
</P>
<P>
   F.P. Santangelo went 3 for 6 and scored twice. Since taking over
for Todd Hollandsworth in center last weekend, Santangelo has gone
7 for 16, including an RBI double in the Dodgers four-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The hot streak only raised his average to .187, which says
something about how poorly he hit the first two months of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to find a way to start the season in June,'' he said.
``Every year is like this for me. Always a slow start and
aggravating. It's tough to stay sharp when you don't play a lot,
but that is the job description. When you get a chance to play
every day like I've been doing lately, it feels great.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Hanson, the club's top left-handed pinch hitter
who played all three games against Texas, including two as a DH.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Hansen had a two-run single. Wednesday, he went 3 for
4, raising his average to .348.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to be prepared when you get your chances,''
Hansen said. ``It's a hard job when you don't play a lot. You have
to take advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort had a chance not only to right his season, but to give
the bullpen a day off.
</P>
<P>
   With closer Jeff Shaw needing to work his way back from rotator
cuff trouble, Johnson was hoping to get some innings from Antonio
Osuna on Wednesday. But after replacing Dreifort to start the
eighth, Osuna lasted just four batters.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers couldn't use Mike Fetters, who has closer experience
but who Johnson said won't pitch on back-to-back days until after
the All-Star break. Shaw wound up on the mound in the ninth inning,
but he was preserving a five-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go nine every time,'' Dreifort said. ``But like I
said, it's more important to win.'' &QL;

IN NEW JERSEY, U.S. SENATE CANDIDATES QUICKLY STAKE THEIR GROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID M. HALBFINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Robert D. Franks was not halfway through his
victory speech early Wednesday morning when he began ripping into
Jon S. Corzine, his opponent in the U.S. Senate race in New Jersey,
as a dangerously out-of-touch spendthrift.
</P>
<P>
   The race to control the wide middle of New Jersey politics began
even before all the votes were counted in Tuesday's primary, which
left Franks as the apparent Republican nominee. And Franks' swift
attack raised a question that he clearly hoped would define the
race: Can he succeed in turning the liberal proposals and
record-setting spending that won Corzine the Democratic nomination
into liabilities big enough to keep Corzine from winning the
general election?
</P>
<P>
   ``What's dangerous about Jon Corzine isn't the fact that he has
spent tens of millions of his own money,'' Franks said. ``What's
really dangerous is the prospect of Jon Corzine sitting in the
United States Senate, where he will have the power to spend your
money.''
</P>
<P>
   In giving his own acceptance speech, Corzine, emotional and
exhausted after his overwhelming but hard-won victory over former
Gov. Jim Florio, seemed to be thinking more about how soon he would
be able to take a vacation than about his next opponent. But his
advisers suggested Wednesday that Corzine, the former co-chairman
of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., would soon begin pointing to his Wall
Street background as evidence that, for all his expansive ideas, he
would understand as well as any lawmaker the importance of fiscal
moderation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon Corzine is a can-do, pro-jobs Democrat who understands the
new economy,'' said Steven Goldstein, a top official in the Corzine
campaign. ``He's running against a lifelong politician who's never
had any real-world experience. And New Jersey, whether it's Frank
Lautenberg or Bill Bradley, likes real-world experience in its
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, aides to Corzine outlined a plan to depict Franks, who
was elected to the House in 1992, as an ideological soul mate of
former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a strategy used most
successfully by President Clinton in his 1996 campaign against Sen.
Bob Dole, and by Sen. Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey in his
race the same year against Rep. Richard A. Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Franks-Gingrich agenda is hopelessly out of touch with New
Jersey,'' Goldstein said. ``Bob Franks can't possibly be moderate
when he voted for the Contract With America.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Smith, an aide to Franks, made it clear that he would
not be intimidated by Corzine's stated willingness to spend
whatever it takes to win the Senate race, which he demonstrated by
spending close to $35 million in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we'll have the financial wherewithal to compete,
with a message that's much more in tune with New Jersey's voters
than Jon Corzine is with his immense wealth,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that $10 million was an acceptable rule-of-thumb
estimate for what an effective fall campaign would cost.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Republican officials in Washington, whose help Franks
will sorely need, expressed glee Wednesday at the prospect of
helping him take on Corzine, whose advocacy for ambitious
government programs, against the death penalty, and for affirmative
action, gun control and gay rights made his campaign as
left-leaning as any successful Senate primary bid in memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Franks is an accomplished legislator and an
outstanding candidate, while all Corzine has is rich liberal
guilt,'' said Steven Law, executive director of the National
Republican Senatorial Committee. ``We believe in this race because
Bob Franks has New Jersey common-sense values, while on the other
hand, if Corzine goes any more to the left, he'll be in
Pennsylvania.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much more Corzine will spend in the fall campaign was
the subject of much speculation Wednesday. His advisers have said
they long believed that a primary campaign against Florio would be
much more difficult and costly than a general election. And after
an unprecedented 12-week saturation of the New York and
Philadelphia television stations with Corzine's image in gauzy
commercials, he enters the race with Franks, who is little known
outside his congressional district except among Republican
stalwarts, holding an incumbent's name-recognition advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But Franks' decision to focus on Corzine's spending was striking
not only because he picked right up where Florio left off, vowing
to make campaign finance reform a central issue, but because
Florio's efforts in that regard had won him newspaper endorsements
but had failed to sway most Democratic voters. Goldstein also said
Franks was vulnerable to attack for his own acceptance of
special-interest contributions.

BRODEUR SET TO EXORCISE GHOST OF MATTEAU PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Perhaps one of these seasons Martin
Brodeur will step onto the ice at Madison Square Garden and not
hear Stephane Matteau catcalls.
</P>
<P>
   Matteau's goal, of course, will forever live in Ranger fans'
memories. His shot eluded Brodeur at 4 minutes 24 seconds of double
overtime of Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals in 1994, and
propelled the Rangers to their first Stanley Cup in 54 years. After
one of his poor performances against the Philadelphia Flyers,
Brodeur was asked if one of the soft goals he allowed was as
devastating as the one to Matteau.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go to Madison Square Garden I hear someone
mention the guy's name,'' Brodeur said of Matteau, now a member of
the San Jose Sharks. ``I don't even know where the guy's playing
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur recovered from Matteau's goal to lead the Devils to the
Stanley Cup a year later. On Thursday night, Brodeur and the Devils
have a chance to win another cup with a victory over the Dallas
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur has been terrific in the series with a 1.75 goals
against average. One of his numerous strengths is what the golfer
Chi Chi Rodriguez calls ``instant amnesia'' after a bad shot. If he
has a bad game, he forgets about it and looks ahead to the next
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with him for seven years,'' Jacques Caron, the
goaltending coach of the Devils, said Wednesday, ``and I've learned
that his mental strength is unbelievable. He recovers well from a
bad game.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur has had a handful of stressful moments against the
Stars. In Game 3, with the Devils holding a 2-1 lead, he was
assessed a delay-of-game penalty with 4:15 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty didn't think my hair was gray enough,'' Coach Larry
Robinson said. Brodeur redeemed himself with 50 seconds left in the
game, however, when he denied Brett Hull on a blistering 20-foot
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him with the puck, I said, `Anybody but him,'''
Brodeur said about Hull, who scored the winning goal in Game 2. ``I
didn't want to have to face him like that because I know the kind
of shot he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at practice the Devils were looking to close out the
championship series. Standing on a small platform, Sergei Brylin
reminded listeners what the Devils accomplished after facing
elimination three times against the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dallas can do what we did in the last series,'' Brylin said.
``I know it's difficult to concentrate on the game and not think
about the Stanley Cup, but we know what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Claude Lemieux said, ``You focus on what you have to do to get
it, rather than what to do after you get it.'' Lemieux speaks from
experience. He won the Stanley Cup with the Devils in 1995 and
again a year later with the Colorado Avalanche. He won his first
cup with the Montreal Canadiens as a rookie in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the dressing room knows they'll have to play
their best game of the series,'' Brodeur said. ``I feel pretty good
about the way I'm playing personally, but it's the team that
counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Caron said: ``Marty wants to be the best, but that's not his
focus right now. What he wants more than anything now is to win the
next game.''
</P>
<P>
   Including the regular season and the playoffs, Brodeur has 58
victories this season, which ties Mike Richter's mark with the
Rangers in 1994. Brodeur needs to win one more game to tie the
league record for victories in a season with 59, accomplished by
Bernie Parent of the Flyers in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   With these credentials, perhaps Brodeur will finally get some
respect from the hockey fans in the metropolitan area.

HULL PLANS TO DO HIS TALKING ON THE ICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Things are so desperate for the Dallas Stars right now
that even Brett Hull is talking.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who leads all playoff scorers this season with 11 goals
and 23 points, sat in front of his locker stall here Wednesday
morning at the Stars' practice facility, reflecting on the reasons
why his team was one loss away from relinquishing the Stanley Cup
to the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas trails the series by three games to one, and since the
finals went to a four-of-seven game format in 1939, the 1942
Toronto Maple Leafs are the only team to rally from a similar
deficit and win the cup.
</P>
<P>
   Hull was asked he had previously avoided the news media during
the finals, allowing interviews only after he had scored two goals
in the Stars' victory in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   He replied, ``I don't have anything to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to the questions,'' said Hull, who called them, at
best, ``all rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll believe anything I say,'' he said. ``It's more time
consuming than anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all propaganda. No one wants to say anything too
controversial. It will only end up being put on the other team's
bulletin board. All you do is get chastised for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to hear it, but then they call you a baby for
speaking out. And more than three quarters of the players never
back you up on it, even though privately they agree with you.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old right wing has long been known not only for his
deadly release and pinpoint accuracy on the ice, but for his
penchant for verbosity most of the time off it. His teammate and
good friend, Mike Keane, had a hat made that says, ``Shut Up,
Hull!''
</P>
<P>
   ``All year, he talks 24 hours a day about everything _ sticks,
crossword puzzles,'' Keane said. ``It just saves me from having to
tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least in his dealings with the news media, Hull has taken
Keane's hat to heart. Teammates like Derian Hatcher, Mike Modano,
Guy Carbonneau and Keane have done the talking for him _ unless he
scores a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the team we have and the people we have on it,
we have enough people to speak,'' Hull said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has been one of the few athletes willing to speak his mind
on any subject imaginable. But since coming to Dallas, he has had
to trade in his candor to fit into Coach Ken Hitchcock's faceless
system of 12 interchangeable forwards and six interchangeable
defensemen, full-court pressing, checking and trapping for 60
minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off has had its benefits. Last season, Hull won his
first Stanley Cup _ and scored the controversial cup-winning goal,
to boot.
</P>
<P>
   But it is obvious that he is not altogether comfortable in his
low-key role, consecutive appearances in the finals or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people that have been around the team for this season have
seen a frustrated athlete,'' said Hitchcock, alluding to the
career-low 24 goals Hull scored in the regular season. ``During the
playoffs, he has made a determined effort to focus on his play and
not on what he's said. He's done this to get away from the
limelight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's cagey. He knows that if he talks too much, the other team
is going to point at him. So he doesn't bring attention to himself
on the ice. He's almost like a sandbagger in golf. The regular
season was embarrassing to Hully. He's trying to make amends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a lot different,'' Hitchcock said of Hull in the
playoffs. ``He's been a lot more sincere, a lot less sarcastic. He
still comes up with his one-liners every 30 seconds, but they've
been different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's the bitterness there was in the regular
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is there the outspokenness that the old Hull used to
possess before he came the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no old Brett Hull, so I'm not saying anything,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Do you miss him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes I do,'' he said, almost wistfully. ``Very much. He was a
lot of fun.''

   YUGOSLAVIA: SENTENCE VOIDED

<P>
   The Supreme Court has overturned a guilty verdict and prison
sentence against Kosovo's most prominent human rights activist, Dr.
Flora Brovina, her lawyer said. The court sent the case back to a
lower court for review, which is likely to mean a new trial or,
possibly, the dropping of charges. The court also urged that
Brovina be released on bail, her lawyer said. Brovina, an ethnic
Albanian, was convicted of terrorism on Dec. 9 and sentenced to 12
years in prison, prompting an international outcry.

   RUSSIA: HOPE FOR POPE
</P>
<P>
   Talks on a reconciliation between the Roman Catholic and Russian
Orthodox churches may resume this fall, officials said, raising
hopes Pope John Paul II might still make the first papal visit to
Russia. The two churches have been at odds since the schism of
1054. Relations were further strained in 1999 after NATO's attack
on Yugoslavia, an ally of Russia. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin,
while on a visit to Italy this week, raised the prospect of a papal
visit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   GREECE: CHURCH CALLS PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   A week after branding the prime minister a dictator, the Greek
Orthodox Church has called on its followers to take to the streets
and protest the government's decision to abolish religious
affiliation from state identity cards. Archbishop Christodolous and
a council of 79 prelates agreed to the move after Prime Minister
Costas Simitis turned down their request for a meeting. The
church-led protests will start in Salonika next Wednesday and end
in Athens a week later.

   SLOVENIA: NEW GOVERNMENT
</P>
<P>
   After two months without a government, Slovenia got a
center-right cabinet headed by Andrej Bajuk, a conservative prime
minister. The tiny nation, which broke away from Yugoslavia in
1991, is the wealthiest, per capita, in eastern Europe and among
the first nations in line for membership in the European Union. All
sides were worried that the government crisis would hurt Slovenia's
reputation abroad.

of a leader of the local farmworkers' union. ``This is a historic
moment,'' said Luiz Eduardo Greenhalgh, a lawyer for the union.
``It is the first time in Brazil that the mastermind of a crime

FOR FLORIO, HIS DAYS AS THE `COMEBACK KID' MAY BE OVER 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ As a former boxer who once dared to fight with a
broken cheekbone, Jim Florio, the politician, has endured countless
analogies to his middleweight pugilist days. He lost the race for
governor three times, once by 1,797 votes out of the 2.3 million
cast, only to win the State House by an impressive margin in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But after the knockout he suffered Tuesday night at the hands of
Jon Corzine, Florio, a scrappy veteran of 16 political campaigns,
may never again be described as a ``Comeback Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio has not spoken publicly about his plans for the future.
And before the returns were in on Tuesday, he would not say whether
he would ever run again. His friends and close associates said they
thought there was little chance Florio, 62, a presence in New
Jersey politics for three decades, would run again for elective
office. Florio, who lost the race, 42 percent to 58 percent, spent
the day with his wife, Lucinda, in their home in Metuchen.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign spokesman, Jim Lanard, said Florio was commiserating
with friends and mulling his future. After months of media
attention, Florio, he said, would not speak to the press. ``He
needs some privacy,'' Lanard said. ``Besides, today is Mr.
Corzine's day.''
</P>
<P>
   Having lost his previous two races, as well as the support of
the state's Democratic organization, Florio, political analysts
said, would have a hard time persuading even the most stalwart
loyalists to fight with him another day. ``I can't imagine him
running again,'' said Cliff Zukin, a political science professor at
Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Although he publicly conceded the race Tuesday night with
graciousness and a smile, Florio, friends said, is still
disappointed that his opponent spent $35 million to his $2 million.
Just as disheartening, they say, is that a liberal Democrat chose
to highlight the $2.8 billion tax increase Florio championed as
governor. Lost in the welter of attack ads, they said, was the fact
that Florio only did so because he was faced with a $600 million
deficit and a court order to increase education spending in poor
districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, three different candidates were using Florio's
tax in their commercials,'' said Chuck Chiarello, head of the
Atlantic County Democratic Party. ``It was one man against the
universe,'' he said. ``It made for pretty insurmountable odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio performed well in the southern portion of the state,
especially in areas he represented during his 15 years in Congress.
But in the more densely populated north, where Corzine enjoyed the
support of the party, Florio lost badly. ``It's hard to make your
voice heard when the Democratic organization is against you,''
Zukin said.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said the negative tone of the race obscured
Florio's accomplishments, and the media, always hungry for a good
fight, helped pump up the tax issue. During his years as governor,
they pointed out, Florio pushed through the nation's toughest
assault weapon ban, cut insurance rates by 20 percent and
solidified his reputation as a protector of the environment. During
his first year as governor, there was even talk of a President
Florio. But that was then.
</P>
<P>
   As they took stock Wednesday, campaign workers, supporters and
friends said they hoped that at the very least Florio's legacy
would be rehabilitated. They took heart that after years of
deriding Florio for his tax hike, most newspapers in the state
endorsed him for Senate, praising his record, principles and
commitment to working people.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they thought such a high-profile loss would focus
national attention on the need for campaign finance reform. Rep.
William Pascrell Jr. of Passaic, one of the few elected officials
to stand by Florio's side Tuesday night, said he hoped the race
would prod Congress to move on tougher rules for campaign finance
and spending. ``If ever we needed proof, it was this election,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, Florio still has his law practice and a
consulting business. He could always go back to teaching public
policy, which is what he did at Rutgers University before he
decided to run for the Senate. There is even talk he could be part
of a Gore administration, if there is one.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is sure, associates said. Florio will not spend
his days in the pursuit of personal wealth. ``It might sound like
puff, but Jim Florio is devoted to the public good,'' said Angelo
Genova, a friend and a lawyer who worked for the Florio
administration. ``He's not in it for the ego, or for the power.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kessler, who has worked as Florio's fund-raiser since
1989, said Florio is happiest as a public servant. ``After he lost
the governor's race, he had no idea what he would do, and believe
me, today is the same,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, things are different. He has experienced
life outside politics, and at least he and his wife have a car, a
home and furniture, none of which they had after Florio was voted
out of Trenton in 1993. ``He's not in the same place,'' Kessler
said.

MIDDLE-CLASS, MIDDLE-OF-ROAD FRANKS IS HAPPY AS CORZINE'S RIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, N.J. _ If a moment can have a message, Bob Franks
was sending one by beginning his race as the Republican nominee for
the U.S. Senate at the Lido Diner here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lido Diner, that's as middle-class New Jersey as you can
get,'' Raymond Bateman, an experienced Republican leader in the
state, said with a laugh. ``That's Bob Franks.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the spring, Franks, who is in his fourth term in
Congress, and the other three Republican candidates for governor
were eclipsed by the civil war within the Democratic party between
Jon Corzine and Jim Florio.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Franks is the presumed Republican nominee, he will step
out into the limelight alone to face Corzine in the general
election. The face he is most likely to present is of a typical New
Jerseyan, a successful suburban lawyer with a wife and a little
daughter, stepping out of the Lido Diner after breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of the vote counted, Franks had 95,801 votes,
35.4 percent, and state Sen. William L. Gormley had 92,454, 34.2
percent. But with absentee ballots uncounted, Gormley refused to
concede Wednesday morning, saying in a statement that the vote had
to be certified first.
</P>
<P>
   The image Franks presented at the Lido is one he evidently
expects New Jerseyans to be comfortable with, and one he hopes to
contrast with Corzine's self-financed $35 million scorched-earth
campaign against Florio. Franks has said that Corzine is out of
touch with average New Jerseyans, and in his victory speech early
Wednesday morning he challenged Corzine to meet him at the Lido for
the first debate.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Corzine was up just as early, thanking voters at
Journal Square in Jersey City. So Franks stood alone in front of
the diner and took a poke at his rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon is going to have to answer the voters' questions,'' Franks
declared in the early light of a sparkling day. ``He can no longer
hide behind the multimillion-dollar ad campaigns and the focus
groups. He is going to have to come out here to these diners and
answer the tough questions.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the sharpest contrasts between Franks and Corzine is
political experience. Corzine has never held public office, and
Franks, 48, has spent much of his life in politics, including 14
years in the state Assembly and eight as a congressman. He has
never lost an election, although he has come close.
</P>
<P>
   Franks borrowed a campaign slogan from Florio on Tuesday night
when he introduced a theme he is sure to repeat in the next five
months: that he is a man ``with experience you can't buy.''
</P>
<P>
   He began in Republican politics in 1954, when he was a
13-year-old with a tab collar and a skinny tie going door to door
in suburban Chicago, where he lived, for Charles H. Percy's
unsuccessful campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   After he got his law degree from Southern Methodist University
in Dallas, Franks joined the staff of Tom Kean's successful
campaign for governor in 1981. The next year he directed James
Courter's Senate campaign, and then the 1984 House race of Dean
Gallo. He went on to two separate stints as chairman of the state
Republican Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Corzine's sudden dash from nowhere for the Senate
nomination, Franks spent years cultivating political friendships.
Instead of searching for a promising congressional seat, he
patiently waited for his friend, Matthew Rinaldo, to retire from
the 7th District in 1992 before running. He has held the seat ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched all of the politicians in both parties, and the
one who has developed the best is Bob Franks,'' said Bateman, who
can name every presidential candidate who carried New Jersey back
to Dewey in 1948. ``Before, he was not that good on his feet, now
he's terrific. He's good with people and he's good on the issues
and he's going to be tough for Corzine to handle.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, Franks is as middle of the road as diner
coffee. In 1998, the National Taxpayers Union, an antitax group,
rated him at 50 percent. The Concord Coalition, which aims to
eliminate the federal deficit, rated him at 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It was the absence of ideological rigor in Franks that prompted
Kean to make Franks his Assembly floor leader. Even Bateman, an
early admirer, once said he thought Franks was more comfortable
managing party business than legislating, with its tough up-or-down
choices.
</P>
<P>
   Franks earned Gormley's scorn in 1990, when he twice abstained
on a law that Florio had championed that would ban certain kinds of
semiautomatic firearms, and which Gormley supported.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' preference for compromise was also evident in 1998, when
he long resisted committing himself on the Republican House
leadership drive to impeach President Clinton. While other members
of the state delegation declared for impeachment, Franks remained
neutral, hoping that a vote would be averted, until finally voting
to impeach on three of the four counts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of this reputation, Franks has been called
bland. On the cover of the May issue of the New Jersey Reporter, a
public affairs magazine, Gormley was drawn holding cards and poker
chips, symbols of his support for Atlantic City's gambling
industry. Franks was drawn holding a pint of vanilla ice cream.

APTITUDE RECEIVES NOD AS FAVORITE FOR BELMONT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No Triple Crown suspense this time on the day of the
Belmont Stakes. No showdown between the Kentucky Derby winner and
the Preakness winner. For that matter, not even a solo performance
by either Fusaichi Pegasus or Red Bullet.
</P>
<P>
   But after three years of drama when star colts were thwarted on
the edge of completing a Triple Crown sweep, the race will still be
run Saturday at Belmont Park. It will still be the 132nd Belmont
Stakes, and it will still be run at a mile and a half with a purse
of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The race drew 11 horses Wednesday, with two Derby survivors
installed as the favorites: Aptitude, who ran second to Fusaichi
Pegasus in Louisville, listed first in the early betting line at
8-5, and Impeachment, who ran third in the Derby and the Preakness,
listed next at 9-2.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pletcher, who trains Impeachment, considered the question
that hung over the draw ceremony at Belmont Park, and said: ``How
is the race changed because the two best horses aren't running? I
don't think we know for sure if the best horses aren't running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Championships aren't decided this early in the year. The
3-year-old division is wide open and we have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude drew the No. 5 post position and Impeachment drew No.
8, but nobody saw any great significance in the starting-gate
assignments because Belmont Park is the longest, broadest track in
America; it is a mile and a half around with sweeping turns.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing Now, a 30-1 long shot, drew the rail; the speedy long
shot Hugh Hefner drew No. 10 and was listed at 50-1; and Tahkodha
Hills at 30-1 drew the No. 11 gate on the extreme outside.
</P>
<P>
   More important than post position, most trainers agreed, would
be the degree of freshness a horse brought into the starting gate.
Only Impeachment ran against Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet in the
Derby and the Preakness. But only Aptitude finished as high as
second in the Derby before skipping the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Aptitude finished second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the
Derby after running second to Red Bullet in the Gotham and third
behind both of them in the Wood Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to talk about championships,'' said Bobby
Frankel, who trains Aptitude. ``If you don't win the Kentucky
Derby, there are a million other races out there that will
determine championships and such. That's why we skipped the
Preakness. It is very easy to destroy these young horses early. It
didn't make sense to try to get one more victory. What for? We want
to have a horse for races like the Travers and for races later this
year and when he's older.''
</P>
<P>
   Another horse who ran a strong Derby but skipped the Preakness
was Wheelaway, a son of Unbridled who ran first in the Tampa Bay
Derby, third in the Blue Grass and fifth in the Kentucky Derby
under Richard Migliore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having a fresh horse is a positive in this race,''
said John Kimmel, who trains Wheelaway for his father, Caesar
Kimmel. ``He's trained better than ever at Belmont, and I think he
would have gotten third in the Derby had he gotten a more patient
ride. What we learned from the Derby was that this horse made a
premature, aggressive move and then got out in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is when to ask him and how much to ask him. If
you ask too soon, he'll give you everything. We can't do what we
did in the Derby, which was to run all out from the five-sixteenths
pole to the finish with everyone going fast up front. Richie knows
his horse better now. He knows to sit chilly on him a little
longer. You don't want to move too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Third in the betting line was Unshaded, who wasn't entered in
the Belmont until Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet left. He is also
a son of Unbridled, winner of the 1990 Kentucky Derby, and he
skipped the Derby and the Preakness because of inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   But he won the Lexington Stakes, ran second in the Peter Pan
while carrying 10 more pounds than the winner and was booked into
the Belmont only this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peter Pan was a confusing race for us because Unshaded was
in a school he had never been to before,'' said Unshaded's trainer,
Carl Nafzger. ``Once he figured things out, he made a pretty nice
run. On the last 50 yards, he focused really well and got up to
finish second.''
</P>
<P>
   So, without the two star colts who defected, the Belmont offers
a kind of reprieve for horses who could not catch them in the
classics. But it also reflects the sweep of modern racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no last chance for a horse these days,'' Pletcher
said. ``You have three classics within five weeks. Then you still
have the Haskell for a million dollars, the Jockey Club Gold Cup
for a million and the Breeders' Cup for a million and more.''  &QL;

GIULIANI TRIED TO SEE FAMILY OF DORISMOND
</HEADLINE>
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday that he had
tried to meet twice in recent days to express sympathy belatedly to
the family of Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed black man shot dead
earlier this year by the police. But the mayor said he backed away
from the meetings because the family members wanted their lawyer,
Johnnie Cochran, to be present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor was looking for a heart-to-heart, not a
deposition-like meeting with a lawyer,'' said Giuliani's
spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel.
</P>
<P>
   But an intermediary for the Dorismond family, the Rev. Brian
Jordan, said Wednesday that the presence of Cochran was not
necessarily a problem and that the mayor and the Dorismonds were
still negotiating ``mutual terms'' for a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's refusal to express sympathy to the Dorismond family
at the time of the shooting in March and his attempt to discredit
the victim, which shocked even fellow Republicans, has been called
the harshest example of the mayor's aggressive style.
</P>
<P>
   But when Giuliani withdrew from his U.S. Senate race against
Hillary Rodham Clinton because of his prostate cancer, the mayor
promised to be a better person who would reach out to the
minorities he had alienated. Blacks in the city, who are hopeful
but skeptical about the mayor's ability to change, are now watching
for clues.
</P>
<P>
   There were signs Wednesday of some thawing on both sides.
Kadiatou Diallo, the mother of Amadou Diallo, the unarmed black man
who was shot dead by the police last year, said she would meet with
Giuliani if he was willing to reach out to her.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president
and a longtime critic of the mayor, met privately with him for an
hour at City Hall to discuss the need for community policing,
Ferrer said, as well as policy on schools, housing and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, who is
black, announced Wednesday that she and the mayor were to meet
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The meetings with Ferrer and Fields were both initiated by
Giuliani. Normally such meetings between a mayor and his borough
presidents would hardly be news, but Giuliani has regularly warred
with both officials during his years in office. The meeting with
Fields would be their third. Ferrer said Wednesday that he could
not recall the last time he met with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer pronounced himself ``very pleased'' with the meeting, but
said he now wanted to see results. ``And that's always where the
rubber meets the road,'' Ferrer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the mayor's angriest critics, said
Wednesday that he was unimpressed with the mayor's efforts. ``The
mayor is being very selective in how he plays `the new Rudy,'''
Sharpton said. ``Clearly, he has not met anyone he has not met with
in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Mrs. Diallo and Marie Dorismond, the mother of
Dorismond, met in Albany with Gov. George Pataki, who expressed his
sympathy and hugged members of the Dorismond family. Mrs. Diallo
and Mrs. Dorismond were there with other relatives of victims of
shootings and injuries by New York City police.

CARBONNEAU'S LINE HAS DEVIL OF A CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The Stars have a number of problems to deal
with.
</P>
<P>
   How to win Game 5? Yeah, that's kind of a biggie.
</P>
<P>
   Where are goals going to come from? That would help.
</P>
<P>
   Which line, Mike Modano's or Guy Carbonneau's, will check the
Devils' top line of Petr Sykora, Jason Arnott and Patrik Elias?
They don't know because it's not their call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I am going to have a choice there,'' Stars coach
Ken Hitchcock said. ``That's going to be up to \RDevils coach\S
Larry Robinson.''
</P>
<P>
   With home ice comes the last line change, meaning the Devils can
decide who is going to go against whom for Game 5 of the Stanley
Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   If it's Modano's line, the Stars have to figure where the
scoring is going to come from. If it's Carbonneau's line, it has to
prove it is up to the task of stopping the NHL's most productive
postseason line. If Carbonneau wants the Stars' postseason to
continue, and maybe prevent the end of his career, his line must do
the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RCarbonneau\S needs to have a focus of a checking role,''
Hitchcock said. ``But that will start with Larry's decision and I
will have to read off that.''
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that Hitchcock prefers Modano's line against the
Arnott line?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with that,'' Hitchcock said. ``Now,
we're waiting on somebody else to get the job done offensively. And
we're kind of running out of time, aren't we? Last I looked it
wasn't a best-out-of-nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but the way Carbonneau is playing, he doesn't appear to be
running out of time. In Game 4, his line was matched against
Arnott's line the entire game, limiting it to no points as a unit.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem, though, is that Carbonneau's effectiveness
has been limited through the first four games because the Stars
haven't had something they normally have: a lead late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It's when the Stars have a lead to protect that Carbonneau's
ability to cross up opposing forwards becomes crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real effective in that particular role,'' Stars winger
Blake Sloan said. ``When you call that upon yourself, you are
taking a big responsibility and you want to play well with it. He
seems to thrive and absorb that. It defines him.''
</P>
<P>
   It has his whole career. Even as other lines have trotted out
against the Arnott line, few have had the defensive success of
Carbonneau's. Whether it was Wayne Gretzky or Peter Forsberg, it
always has been that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fairly fast, not even putting his age into
consideration,'' Stars defenseman Sylvain Cote said of Carbonneau.
``Anybody that plays 20 years, especially in hockey, is an
unbelievable athlete. Football players don't play 20 years, and
they don't play 16 games a year. He's played 200-some games in the
playoffs. A lot of football players don't do that in a career.''
</P>
<P>
   No, they don't, which makes the reality that Carbonneau might be
finally reaching the end of his career a little difficult to accept
or believe. He said before and during the season that this will be
his last. Of course, he's quick to mention that he seems to say
that every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone on the team that wants to win, wants him to
come back,'' Stars winger Brenden Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Preferably next season and definitely two more games this season
after tonight.

HULL HAS LITTLE TO SAY, BUT HIS SCORING TALKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Brett Hull has spent this playoff season saying
little and carrying a big stick with a nasty curve in the blade,
which is as at least halfway out of character. His fervent hope is
to remain equally unobtrusive _ off the ice _ for three more games
this playoff season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he'll get that chance depends entirely on whether the
Stars, down 3-1 to New Jersey in the Stanley Cup Finals, can win
tonight at Continental Airlines Arena] in East Rutherford, N.J.,
and bring the series back to Dallas for a Game 6 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hull has dodged the limelight throughout the playoffs, a
difficult tightrope to walk when you are your team's leading
playoff scorer with 11 goals and a dozen assists, not to mention
its most controversial figure.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, when Ed Belfour's enjoying a night on the
town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to say,'' Hull said with a shrug after
yesterday's practice at Dr Pepper StarCenter. ``Nobody wants to say
anything too controversial to put on the other team's bulletin
board. If you say something stupid, that's where it winds up.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Hull might have shrugged even that minor
problem away and let rip with a hot sports opinion or three. Now,
he's simply beaten down by it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you do is get chastised for it,'' Hull said. ``Everybody
\R in the media\S wants to hear it, then they call you a baby, so
it's not worth the effort because nobody gives you any credit for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of the controversial Hull holding court on the Stars'
dire situation heading into Game 5 tonight, he merely assessed the
situation in a straightforward, here's-what-we-have-to-do fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of like a real leader might do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing needs to be said,'' he said before the Stars boarded
their flight to New Jersey. ``You'd hope it wouldn't need to be
said anyway. It's all up to the individuals. You either want to
come back and win or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling of urgency coach Ken Hitchcock has been pleading
for throughout this series? It's there now, Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can call it panic, but obviously there's
desperation,'' he said. ``You have to be desperate and you have to
play with everything you have if you haven't already, because you
cannot lose. You have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The players must depend on each other, Hull said. They must
believe in and commit to the system and stick with it for 60
minutes. There can be no peeking beyond tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game can't get out of control,'' Hull said. ``Our system
is control and we're going to stick to that. We just have to be
better within the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you can do is go out and do the best you can and hope the
guy next to you is doing the best he can and that everybody's doing
what they're doing within the system. If you put in that effort and
pull on the same rope as everyone else is, more times than not you
are going to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hull, Hitchcock said, can't win this game by himself. Nor
can Mike Modano or anyone else. They fell into that trap in the
third period of Game 4 and watched a 1-0 lead turn into a 3-1
Devils victory in less than four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need Brett Hull to score for us to win,''
Hitchcock said. ``What we need from Brett Hull and guys like him is
to stay on the page for 60 minutes and not try to hit the home run,
be patient. Don't get too far ahead of the play or get impatient
with his positioning, with or without the puck.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to hear what the old Brett Hull might
say about this game, but he apparently doesn't exist any more. Or
if he does, he's being kept in a cellar somewhere, blindfolded and
handcuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hull admits he misses the devil-may-care nature of that
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I do, very much,'' he said. ``He was a lot of fun.''

STARS KNOW HISTORY NOT ON THEIR SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ While coaching juniors, Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock twice had his teams rally from 3-1 deficits to win
seven-game series. It can be done, but can the Stars do it?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars face an elimination game tonight in New Jersey. It is
the first time they have faced elimination in Game 5 since the
Western Conference Finals in 1998, when they finally lost to the
Detroit Red Wings in six games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we have come back and won,'' Hitchcock said. ``But I
think the difference being is that there was a goaltender \Rin
juniors\S that was saving the bacon for the other team. In other
words, he was making 40, 50 saves. This is different. We are going
to have to be at our best to win the next game. We felt like in
those games, it was just a matter of time before we got the
goaltender to crack. That is not the case here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars never have rallied from a 3-1 deficit to win a
postseason series.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the Stars players ever have been on a team _ NHL, juniors
or otherwise _ that has overcome such long odds.
</P>
<P>
   Winger Jamie Langenbrunner's 1995 Kalamazoo team was down 3-0
and forced Game 7 before losing. Winger Jon Sim's juniors team,
too, took a 3-1 series to Game 7 before losing. Defenseman Derian
Hatcher once was on a team that was up 3-1 only to lose three
consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look at it as a series right now,'' Stars winger
Kirk Muller said. ``I think you've got to look at it like we're
going into Jersey to play a game. Don't even think of Game 6. Don't
even think of Game 7. We're going into Jersey, and we have a game
to win. That's it. We can't look behind us. We can't look ahead. We
can't think about winning three in a row. We just have to win
one.''
</P>
<P>
   That few of the Stars have ever been on a team that has come
back from a 3-1 deficit proves how difficult it is.
</P>
<P>
   It has been accomplished only once in Stanley Cup history. The
1942 Toronto Maple Leafs won the Cup after falling behind the Red
Wings, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars know history is against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the odds right now, it's only been done once,''
Stars defenseman Sylvain Cote said. ``But I don't think we want to
even think and look at it that way. We just want to go game by
game. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars need inspiration, they need only to look across the
ice. The Devils trailed the Philadelphia Flyers, 3-1, in the
Eastern Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know what it's like,'' Hatcher said. ``They came back
\Rwhen they were\S down 3-1.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars need a three-game winning streak to keep the Cup. Six
times during the regular season they won at least three games in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident in what we can do,'' Stars winger Brenden
Morrow said. ``This game here is going to be the biggest game to
win. It's anyone's ballgame after that. We're coming back home to
our fans. If we can get this game, this is a big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though, most of the Stars have never seen it done, they
still believe it can be done. Even if no one else does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got to believe it can be done or else it's
going to be futile even trying,'' Stars winger Blake Sloan said.

STARS BATTLING INJURIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING _ Neither Stars center Guy Carbonneau nor forward Jamie
Langenbrunner participated in yesterday's practice. They might not
be ready for tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said both players were bothered by
sore knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of them would be question marks for \RGame 5\S,''
Hitchcock said. ``We'll see how they are \Rtoday\S.''
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner has played in only one game, Game 4, since
injuring his right knee in Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals.
Hitchcock said Carbonneau injured his knee yesterday morning.
</P>
<P>
   A decision on both players' availability will be made at the
morning skate.  &QL; 
A rare practice
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Brenden Morrow said yesterday's practice was their
best in months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our only practice in months,'' Ken Hitchcock said. ``It
was our third hockey practice in five and half weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars spent the hour working on a lot of game-type
situations. Hitchcock said it was just to remind the players what
they were expected to do in certain situations.  &QL; 
Scoring contributions
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock realizes a lot has been made of the scoring bite
of the Devils' No. 1 line of Petr Sykora, Jason Arnott and Patrik
Elias. But in his mind the difference makers in the series have
been the unexpected contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have gotten scoring from theirs. The Stars haven't.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Game 4, which looks like it has been the
pivotal game right now, we do a great job of shutting down their
key offensive people and they get goals from \RJohn\S Madden,
\RBrian\S Rafalski and \RSergei\S Brylin,'' Hitchcock said. ``Those
are our \RMike\S Keanes and \RGuy Carbonneau\S Carbos and Blake
Sloans and Brenden Morrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, I think you have to have those guys
scoring if you are going to win.''  &QL; 
Modano hits 30
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't it seem like yesterday that Mike Modano, with his spiky
short hair and his baby face, was being selected by the Minnesota
North Stars in the draft?
</P>
<P>
   Well don't look now but Modano turned 30 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of weird. It doesn't feel any different, but it's
kind of scary when you hit 30,'' Modano said. ``One year closer to
retirement, that's the way I'm looking at it.''  &QL; 
History against them
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars are looking for history to help them out in their
attempt to rally from a 3-1 Stanley Cup Finals deficit, they may
want to look at other sports.
</P>
<P>
   Only once has a team rallied from 3-1 down to win the Finals.
That was the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, who trailed Detroit, 3-0,
before winning the final four games to win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Do any of the Stars find solace in this?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible,'' Stars defenseman Sylvain Cote said. ``But, we
don't look at as, `Oh, it's been done.' It's been such a long
time.''

STARS JOKE UNDER PRESSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ A number of pseudo doctors, disguised as
reporters, descended on Stars practice yesterday in search of a
pulse.
</P>
<P>
   Their patient looked alert. The Stars were, after all, skating.
</P>
<P>
   Their vital signs were also encouraging. Nobody seemed to have
quit after Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   A strong pulse proved harder to discern until just that moment
when Stars winger Mike Keane slammed a pie into Mike Modano's face
to honor his turning 30. Players suddenly were laughing and
smiling.
</P>
<P>
   No need for further examination. The Stars may be one loss away
from having to hand the Stanley Cup over to the New Jersey Devils,
but there are definite signs of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Keane said. ``We're still here. We're not dead yet.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the Cup, the Devils have to beat them once, their first
chance coming in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals at 7 tonight at
Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford, N.J.. The Stars need
to win the remaining three games, including two in New Jersey, to
retain it. Did they mention the only other team to come back from a
3-1 deficit in the Finals was Toronto? In 1942. Not easy.
</P>
<P>
   For a team presumed to be dead, though, the Stars looked
strikingly confident and composed yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know what's up ahead, what's at stake and how tough it
is going to be,'' Stars winger Kirk Muller said. ``We're not
looking at Game 6 or Game 7. We're just looking at what we have to
do to walk into New Jersey and win one hockey game.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Stars have to do is be better at what they do best.
They have to play patient hockey. As Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said, players can't be looking for a ``home run.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is hard not to do when you're on the verge of elimination
and a home run seems to be exactly what you need.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can call it panic, but obviously, there is
desperation,'' Stars winger Brett Hull said. ``And you have to be
desperate, you have to play with everything you have if you haven't
already because you can not lose. You have to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperation gone awry is what coaches and players feel
contributed to them losing Games 3 and 4 at Reunion. The Stars
weren't scoring, generating four goals in the last three games. But
instead of patiently sticking with their system, their scorers like
Hull and Modano tried to win the game with one shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to them about that,'' Hitchcock said. ``That line
has so much responsibility on their shoulders because of we haven't
had that undercurrent scoring. When it doesn't come early, you get
impatient and try to stretch out your offense, in other words, try
to find holes that aren't there instead of stay with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The message has been received loud and clear. Modano and Hull
were preaching the virtues of staying with it and the necessity of
playing 60 minutes yesterday. They say this is what is going to get
them out of the hole they're in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't look further than your nose,'' Stars defenseman
Darryl Sydor said. ``That's for sure. That's where it starts,
yourself and what you bring to the team, what you got to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hull: ``It's all up to the individuals. You either want to
come back and win or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what 40-year-old center Guy Carbonneau asked
his teammates on Tuesday: Do we really want to go deep and try to
come back?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, yes and heck yes are a sampling of player responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something where we don't get this chance very often,''
Keane said. ``I think we take it for granted. We know we have a
good team; that's our goal every year, but, if you look around, a
lot of good teams don't get back. So we shouldn't take these
chances for granted. We're three wins away. Everyone is confident
we can win three games.''
</P>
<P>
   They said, sometime last night, they'd probably get together and
talk about where they are and where they want to be. They didn't
want the coaches around. They had some things to talk about,
leaders like Carbonneau, Keane, Hatcher, Modano, Nieuwendyk, et
al., reminding exactly what needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have exceptional performances from your leaders or
it doesn't work,'' Hitchcock said. ``There is no point in grabbing
control and go out and talk about it and not do it. They've been
excellent at it for two or three years now. Now, they need
exceptional performances. Good performances _ we've had a lot of
good performances _ isn't enough for us to beat this team.''
</P>
<P>
   And for anybody still wondering about that pulse, just listen:
</P>
<P>
   ``Strawberry something,'' Modano said. ``It was good, too.''

TAHKODA HILLS' TRAINER AIMS AT JACKPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Belmont Stakes' loss could be Ralph Ziadie's gain. A $1
million gain.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky Derby winner Fusaichi Pegasus and Preakness Stakes
winner Red Bullet are not running in the Belmont. It's the first
time in 30 years that the Belmont will be conducted without either
the winner of the Derby or the Preakness being there.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it makes for a dull race. Not unless you're Ziadie.
</P>
<P>
   Ziadie trains Lone Star Derby winner Tahkodha Hills, and the
colt will earn its owners an extra $1 million if he can win the
Belmont. Ziadie admits he isn't sure he would have tried this if
Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet \Rwould have\S showed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the two big horses were running in there, I would say
not,'' Ziadie said this week by telephone from his barn in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ziadie is in an enviable position, although his horse
is a 30-1 long shot to win the Belmont even after the withdrawal of
Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet. When Tahkodha Hills won the Lone
Star Derby on April 22 at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie, he
became eligible for a $1 million bonus if he would win any of the
Triple Crown events.
</P>
<P>
   No one else has a chance at that sort of money in the Belmont.
The owner of Unshaded has to pay a late entry fee of $100,000 to
get into the Belmont because he missed the regular nominating
payments when the horse was trying to overcome injuries earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unshaded did overcome his foot injury, and he won the $325,000
Lexington Stakes in Kentucky on the same day the $300,000 Lone Star
Derby was conducted. Unshaded is 5-1 on the Belmont morning line.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no bonus tied between the Lexington and any Triple
Crown event. First-place money in the Belmont is $600,000, and
Unshaded has to finish at least third to cover the entry fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unshaded ran for $25,000 more \Rin purse money in the
Lexington\S on the same day they were offering a $1 million bonus
at Lone Star,'' Lone Star leading trainer Steve Asmussen said.
``Now with the Derby winner and the Preakness winner missing the
Belmont, doesn't the Lone Star Derby look like a better prep than
the Lexington? Doesn't it look like Unshaded would have a big shot
at that million?''
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star contracted with Chubb Custom Market of Los Angeles to
underwrite the bonus. Lone Star isn't liable for the $1 million.
Chubb would pay that _ $750,000 to Tahkodha Hills owner Vernon
Heath and $250,000 to Ziadie _ if the colt wins the Belmont. Lone
Star general manager Steve Sexton said the track paid a premium of
$60,000 for the insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it to get better horses to run in our Derby, and I'd
say we did get a little better field,'' Sexton said. ``We'd
probably go ahead and do it again next year, as long as the policy
doesn't shoot up in price.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Racing Association offered a bonus of $250,000 for
victories in the Wood Memorial Stakes and the Kentucky Derby. That
one was collected when Fusaichi Pegasus won the Wood and followed
it with the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But Neil Drysdale, trainer of Fusaichi Pegasus, said the bonus
had no part in his decision to race in the Wood. He was looking for
a racing surface where he felt comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale said he's not comfortable with the idea of bonuses
because it appears some horses may race for a bonus even if they're
not 100 percent sound. He cited the year when Derby winner Sea Hero
and Preakness winner Prairie Bayou raced against each other in the
1993 Belmont. The horse with the best finish was given a $1 million
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Hero got the bonus despite finishing seventh. Prairie Bayou
was unable to finish the race because he suffered a broken leg and
had to be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was bad advertising for our sport,'' Drysdale
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ziadie said the bonus isn't driving him to run Tahkodha Hills in
the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to be 100 percent to go into this race,'' Ziadie
said. ``Before I ran in the Texas race, my ultimate goal was to run
in the Belmont. The bonus is nice, but it's not important to me.
I'd probably give most to the church anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering his Belmont odds of 30-1, it may take something
miraculous for Tahkodha Hills to win. / nn

   Eye on Martinez
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Add Dave Martinez of the Chicago Cubs to the list of
outfielders being considered by the Rangers as a way to replace
injured center fielder Ruben Mateo. The Cubs acquired Martinez from
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays last month but aren't happy with the way
he has played.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is hitting .185 with the Cubs but was hitting .260 with
the Devil Rays before the trade. He's also a left-handed hitter,
which would allow him to platoon with Chad Curtis in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis has taken over in right field with Gabe Kapler expected
to start in center when he comes off the disabled list in the next
week. But Curtis is 5-for-45 with 11 strikeouts in his past 13
games after going 0-for-4 yesterday. He is hitting .228 against
right-handed pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have considered trading for an impact player like
the Astros' Moises Alou but aren't sure they can afford to give up
the talent it would take to make that trade. Someone like Martinez,
Darren Bragg of the Colorado Rockies or Jon Nunnally of the New
York Mets could be available for minor- league prospects.  &QL; 
Clayton rests
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Royce Clayton, who is hitting .143 during his past 15
games, received the afternoon off yesterday. Clayton's slump,
though, had nothing to do with manager Johnny Oates' decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing unbelievable defense, and I just want to keep him
fresh,'' Oates said. ``It's very conceivable that this will be his
last day off until the All-Star break.''  &QL; 
Arm yes, bat no
</P>
<P>
   Back spasms prevented closer John Wetteland from taking batting
practice with Rangers pitchers in preparation for interleague games
at National League ballparks.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't concern Oates.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to depend on his bat to win a game,'' Oates said,
``I'm in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The spasms haven't prevented Wetteland from being effective on
the mound. Wetteland has recorded a save during each of his past 13
appearances.  &QL; 
Rochester honors Oates
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Oates will be inducted into the Rochester Red Wings Hall
of Fame during a ceremony before a June 19 game at Frontier Field
in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Oates played for the Red Wings during 1970 and '71 and managed
the Baltimore Orioles' Triple A affiliate to the International
League championship in 1988. Oates was recognized that season as
the league's manager of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Oates will become the 50th member inducted to the Red Wings'
Hall of Fame, which recognizes individuals for unique contributions
to the history of professional baseball in Rochester.  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mateo (fracture in right leg) attended yesterday's game
after being released from Harris Methodist Fort Worth earlier in
the morning. Mateo suffered his season-ending injury Friday and
requires the use of crutches.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers probably won't face right-hander Mike Mussina during
their three-game series with the Baltimore Orioles, which begins
Tuesday in Baltimore. Mussina is scheduled to pitch Sunday against
the Philadelphia Phillies. Mussina is 1-1 with a 1.59 earned-run
average in two starts this season against the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed Baylor right-hander Chad Hawkins and assigned
him to Class-A Savannah of the South Atlantic League. Hawkins,
selected 39th overall during Major League Baseball's 2000
First-Year Player Draft, received a $625,000 signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed left-hander J.J. Pearsall to a minor-league
contract and assigned him to Double-A Tulsa. Pearsall, a 15th-round
selection of the Los Angeles Dodgers from the 1995 draft, went 4-1
with one save and a 6.27 ERA at Double-A Chattanooga this season in
the Reds' minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   Infielders Derek Baker and Travis Hafner and outfielder Kevin
Mench of Class-A Charlotte were selected to play in the Florida
State League All-Star Game, scheduled July 11.

RANGERS' OFFENSE UNABLE TO KEEP PACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers hitters tried to be relentless
yesterday. Trailing from the beginning, they did almost everything
they could to bring the team all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   Their pitchers just couldn't let them finish the job. On a
long-and-weary afternoon at The Ballpark in Arlington, the Rangers'
inability to hold the Dodgers scoreless for more than a couple of
innings in a row proved agonizing for them.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, after trailing 4-0 in the second inning, rallied to
make it 5-4 in the fifth. But the Dodgers struck back with four
runs in the sixth against Rangers starter Rick Helling and reliever
Tim Crabtree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty much the decisive moment of the game,'' Crabtree
said. ``If I do my job, it's a totally different game.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling, after giving up five runs in the first three innings,
held the Dodgers scoreless in the fourth and fifth while the
Rangers mounted their comeback. But Alex Cora started the sixth
with a fly ball down the left-field line, and Rusty Greer just
missed making a diving catch on what turned into a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the daytime here it's very difficult to see,'' Greer said.
``More so for the infielders than the outfielders. But in the
outfield you have to wait a split-second longer to see the ball and
that can cost you making a play. But we've also played a lot of day
games here and won a lot of them, too.''
</P>
<P>
   F.P. Santangelo followed with a long drive to right-center, and
Chad Curtis, running out of room near the Rangers' bullpen, didn't
get far back enough. The ball landed just beyond him on the warning
track for a double that scored Cora and made it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates said that his outfielders were having
trouble with the cloudless sky, but Curtis refused to use that as
an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a rough day at work today,'' Curtis said. ``Bad
decisions and poor execution. I don't have any excuses. I just
didn't get it done. There are things I should have done that I
didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The next play was on his list. After Crabtree replaced Helling,
Mike Grudzielanek fought off a fastball and flared a single to
right. Curtis tried to throw out Santangelo at home, missed the
cutoff man and allowed Grudzielanek to reach second. Crabtree
walked Gary Sheffield, then struck out Shawn Green and Eric Karros.
He got ahead of Dave Hansen 1-and-2, but Hansen worked the count
full and fouled off two pitches before lining a fastball down the
left-field line for a two-run double that made it an 11-6 game
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a great at-bat,'' Crabtree said. ``I felt I was in a
groove after getting Green and Karros and had a chance to get out
of the inning. I had to go with a fastball down and away and all he
could do was stick his bat out there.''

BEST TOO LATE FOR RANGERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ At approximately 4:30 p.m. yesterday, the
Rangers got a 1-2-3 inning from a member of their pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Rangers, right-hander Rick Helling
delivered the afternoon's first pitch at 2:05 p.m. Furthermore,
that 1-2-3 inning belonged to right-hander Jonathan Johnson, whom
the Rangers plan to option to Triple-A Oklahoma before tomorrow's
game in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The end result was an ugly 11-6 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers
at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Helling surrendered seven runs and a career-high 11 hits before
being removed during the sixth inning with the Rangers trailing,
6-4. Right-hander Tim Crabtree relieved and allowed an inherited
runner to cross the plate and two of his own before the Rangers
returned to their first-base dugout staring at a five-run deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of bad pitches,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Johnson, who allowed only two hits and two unearned
runs during his three-inning appearance. The Rangers recalled
Johnson from the RedHawks on Tuesday after optioning right-hander
Ryan Glynn to Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to get an opportunity to throw,'' said
Johnson, the Rangers' first-round selection in the 1995 draft. ``I
was really hoping I wouldn't come up and just sit around for two
days. That would have been heartbreaking for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson only pitched, however, because those preceding him
endured a rough afternoon. Helling (7-4) lost for the third time in
as many starts, although he pitched better during his previous
losses to the Minnesota Twins and Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all command,'' Oates said. ``He was up all day. There
were a few balls that fell in, but he was up in the zone. He just
hasn't been as sharp with his command. Today was not Rick. He
struggled getting anything down in the zone. It wasn't from a lack
of effort, but he just couldn't get the ball where he wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I still felt like I made enough good pitches where it could
have been a better outcome,'' Helling said. ``There were probably
four or five balls that weren't hit hard that fell in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers did not play well in the field, Oates said,
referring to ``plays that could have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored in each of the first three innings, with
seven hits and two walks in that span.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to do a better job of getting out of the gate,''
Helling said. ``I seem to settle down, but it's hard when you put
the offense behind the 8-ball early, especially against a good
pitcher like \RDarren\S Dreifort.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (4-3) allowed three runs through three innings and
another in the fifth before pitching two scoreless frames.
Right-handers Antonio Osuna, Matt Herges and Jeff Shaw preserved
the lead, although the Rangers mounted a threat in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored twice and eventually loaded the bases with
one out, but line drives off the bats of pinch hitter Frank
Catalanotto and left fielder Rusty Greer found the glove of Dodgers
second baseman Mark Grudzielanek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't over 'til it's over,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``There was nothing that I liked about that game.''

STARS MIGHT BRING SERIES HOME, BUT AFTER THAT...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Don't even talk to me about Game 6; it's
not relevant.
</P>
<P>
   If you're wondering how in the world the Stars are going to win
three games in a row to keep the Cup in Dallas, get thee behind me;
that's not the issue at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Stars fan and you're focusing on anything but the
here-and-now of tonight's Game 5 showdown with the New Jersey
Devils at Continental Airlines Arena, then you're no real fan at
all.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Stars are at: Their noses are pressed against
a sheer wall of rock and ice as they try to climb Mount Everest.
One misstep, one slip, one break in concentration, and they're
yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   It is simple now. Win tonight or go home as second best. Give up
the Cup and let the Devils play with it. Settle in as last year's
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Win and play another day.
</P>
<P>
   The fashionable ploy in this age of shock-jock journalism would
be to step out and say the Stars are still going to win this series
with the Devils, that they'll somehow erase a 3-1 deficit, capture
three games in a row and repeat as NHL champions.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry. I may look stupid but occasional periods of soberness
prevail. Predicting that the Stars will beat the Devils three
straight, after what we've seen in the first four games of this
series, wouldn't be shocking, it would be moronic.
</P>
<P>
   But I will say this: The series is coming back to Dallas. It
won't end tonight in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Please, not that toxic wasteland in east Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at three games, it's really daunting,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock conceded yesterday after working his team out
at the Dr Pepper StarCenter before boarding a flight to New Jersey.
``Our whole focus is to bring it back to Dallas and see where this
thing goes.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not easy to be optimistic at this point. The Devils have
outplayed the Stars in three of the four games. Ironically, they
lost one of the three (Game 2) when they were the better team and
won Game 4 when the Stars dominated two of the three periods.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have done what no other team has done to Dallas in
two years: broken their system down. They have imposed ``their''
will on the Stars, instead of the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have run into a team willing to be more patient than
they are. The Devils have taken the blueprint that won the Stars a
Stanley Cup a year ago (and maybe it was the same blueprint that
won the Devils the Cup in '95) and taken it a step further.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils have done Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   They have been incredibly fast on the counterattack, constantly
turning the puck back up the ice and into the neutral zone for
odd-man rushes that even Eddie Belfour can't always stop with
spectacular plays.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the Stars aren't trying. Maybe they've been trying
too hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always about effort,'' Brett Hull said. ``Sometimes
it's about Xs and Os. You can work as hard as you want, but if
you're not doing the right things it kind of counteracts the
effort. Just as important is following your game plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the finals because of our Xs and Os. Stick with
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have been giving himself a pep talk because there's no
question that Hitchcock has fingered the Mike Modano-Hull-Jere
Lehtinen line for being partially responsible for that four-minute
breakdown in the third period of Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the Devils scored three quick goals to wipe out a
1-0 Stars lead. Modano and company were pressing to pick up another
insurance goal and in doing so, caused a breakdown in the Stars'
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been impatient,'' Hitchcock said. ``We've gotten
frustrated by our inability to score and we've talked to \RModano
and Hull\S about that. That line has so much responsibility on its
shoulders because we haven't had that \Rsecondary\S scoring and
they've stretched it out too early trying to create an offensive
odd-man rush.
</P>
<P>
   ``You like their attitude that they want that responsibility,
but what we want to see tomorrow is for them to stay with it and
not try to hit the long ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the attitude is good, even loose. Ask Modano. He celebrated
his 30th birthday yesterday with a strawberry cake. Lots of cake.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Keane skated over as the team gathered near the sideboards
for an apparent meeting near the end of practice and mashed the
cake into Modano's face as his teammates howled with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, as much as anyone, understands the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take it shift by shift, period by period,'' he
said. ``We can't take any time, any period, off, or they'll be
coming at us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now talk is real cheap. It's what you put on the ice and
who comes ready to play. Guys will be measured by how they move on
from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed they will. Lose and it's suddenly summer. Win and play
another game.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that?
</P>
<P>
   Don't even go there.

BRODEUR PLAYS QUIET, SUCCESSFUL ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ If the New Jersey Devils raise the
Stanley Cup tonight, rock-solid defenseman Scott Stevens is the
favored thoroughbred to win the Conn Smythe Trophy race as playoff
MVP.
</P>
<P>
   If not Stevens, then Jason Arnott. Or Petr Sykora. Or Patrik
Elias.
</P>
<P>
   Practically lost amid a Devils machine cranking on all cylinders
is the man behind the mask.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting recognized is getting recognized,'' Devils goaltender
Martin Brodeur said with a who-cares shrug of the shoulders. ``I am
real happy I have accomplished what I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur ranks among the top five playoff averages of all time
with his microscopic 1.76 goals-against average going into
tonight's Game 5. Yet, he's practically forgotten among the Devils'
high-scoring top line, their dominating defense and a stellar
rookie foursome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the whole key with our team,'' said John Madden, one of
those rookies. ``You can go through our lineup and there's six or
seven guys you can point to that in every series or every game they
made a difference. Marty, obviously, is right up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Where would the Devils be without the wizardry of Brodeur?
Likely not looking at a series-clinching Game 5 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to early in the second period of Game 1. The Devils
held a 2-1 lead when Stars center Mike Modano fired a shot from the
left circle. Brodeur made the save, but the rebound popped left to
a wide-open Brett Hull at the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Hull tried to whip the puck in, but, outstretched sideways on
the ice, Brodeur snatched it in his glove. Minutes later, the
Devils made it 3-1 and the rout was on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could have been a turnaround,'' Devils winger Claude
Lemieux said. ``He's made many great saves to keep us in the game.
He's been tremendous. You can only win if you have a contribution
from your goaltender like he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur provided the Stars another head-spinning, what-if
scenario in a scoreless second period of Game 4. Brodeur came way
out of the crease to challenge a one-on-one attack from Modano.
Brodeur disrupted Modano's progress and sent him flying head-first
behind the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty comes sliding out and makes a great save,'' Devils coach
Larry Robinson said. ``There are always little turning points.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are huge turning points in a Stanley Cup Finals in which
the past three games have been decided by four goals.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur took the heat when he allowed 11 goals in Games 2, 3 and
4 against Philadelphia as the team fell behind 3-1 in the series.
He responded with three consecutive one-goal games to propel the
Devils into the Finals. Against the Stars, he has limited his
mistakes, kept rebounds to a minimum and has allowed four goals in
the past nine periods, two coming on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   He's outplaying his counterpart, Stars goalie Ed Belfour, who
was the Stars' unanimous Conn Smythe candidate entering the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who ranks among the all-time best with a career playoff
goals-against average of 1.91, puts little stock in individual
awards. He's concentrating solely on a second Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``They \Rthe Stars\S will be fighting and they will be playing
well,'' Brodeur said. ``We need myself and the players that play in
front of me to be on top of our games.''

MOON MADNESS AT TMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Eddie Gossage does not believe in astrology.
But when it comes to night racing at the Texas Motor Speedway, he
sometimes wonders whether the moon and the stars really affect the
little world of TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Through the three years of night (though twilight is a more
appropriate description) races at TMS, some scheduled and others
not, some strange things have happened. From one former
Indianapolis 500 winner slapping another in Victory Lane to a pace
car hitting an Indy Racing League car last year, night racing at
the 1.5-mile quadoval has produced some interesting moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange things come out at night and strange things happen in
the night race here,'' Gossage said. ``I guess you need to go back
and look at the solunar tables and see whether those were full-moon
nights ... full-moon Saturday nights. Police and emergency room
personnel will tell you, it's no myth.''
</P>
<P>
   The annual June night-racing weekend begins today with
qualifying for the Pronto Auto Parts 400k NASCAR Craftsman Truck
race and the Casino Magic 500 Indy Racing Northern Light Series
event. The 167-lap Truck race is scheduled for tomorrow, and the
208-lap IRL event on Saturday. Though billed as night races, it
won't be dark when the 400k begins at 6:30 and the Casino race
starts at 7. But strange nighttime things happen.
</P>
<P>
   It was a hot June night during the 1997 IRL race that made an
indelible mark on the track. During the victory celebration for
apparent winner Billy Boat, Arie Luyendyk interrupted, saying that
he had won the inaugural 500-kilometer Indy-car race at the track.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt, who owned Boat's car, slapped Luyendyk as he exited
the victory celebration, a scene that made highlight reels across
the country. It turned out Luyendyk was right; a malfunction in the
U.S. Auto Club scoring equipment showed Luyendyk had won.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt has the trophy to this day, but Luyendyk is listed as the
official winner of the first night Indy-car race at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as a team we were very upset, and it showed,''
Luyendyk said three years ago. ``The telemetry doesn't lie, and we
were convinced that we had won. I do have to respect USAC for
stepping up to the plate and auditing the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat vindicated himself one year later by beating Plano resident
Greg Ray to the finish line, in a race where Ray tried to pass Boat
on the grass in the dogleg.
</P>
<P>
   Then last year, another strange incident made people wonder what
it is about racing under the lights at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   With a little more than 20 laps remaining in the last year's
June IRL race, pace-car driver Johnny Rutherford, a three-time Indy
500 winner, was trying to catch the leaders when he collided with
competitor Donnie Beechler on the bottom of the second turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Oldsmobile Aurora sustained some damage, which deployed the
driver's side air bag. Rutherford and Beechler were not hurt, but
it was another strange scene on the high banks at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like that before,'' Rutherford said.
``I think there's lessons to be learned from everything, and I
think chasing the leaders is something we won't do again.''
</P>
<P>
   Other oddities under the lights included Jack Sprague taking a
wild slide in the dogleg two years ago and returning to finish
sixth. In last year's June truck race, Dennis Setzer winning a race
that was extended more than 10 laps because of the rule the race
must end under green.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun goes down and the lights go on at TMS, something
out of the ordinary is likely to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars look faster, there is a different feel and it
certainly is special,'' Gossage said. ``When I was playing sports,
I felt like I could run faster and jump higher do whatever in a
night game.''

EDITORIAL: STERN JUSTICE FOR MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 8:
</P>
<P>
   Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's order to split Microsoft into
two independent companies _ one selling Windows, the other selling
applications like Word and Excel _ is the proper remedy for
repeated violations of the antitrust laws. A less drastic remedy
would prove ineffectual or horribly intrusive. Jackson chose
breakup because the two companies would then compete and innovate
without having government officials overseeing every move. Breakup
is the best way to create a market where Microsoft can no longer
smother software that would be good for consumers but bad for
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of deliberation, Jackson ruled in April that
Microsoft had abused its monopoly over Windows, the operating
system that runs nearly all personal computers, to crush
competition. It adopted business practices that would have been
unprofitable but for their role in blocking rivals from getting
fair access to customers. Specifically, for example, it used
illegal tactics to prevent Netscape from freely selling its
browser.
</P>
<P>
   That is important because the Netscape browser could have served
as the platform from which customers could run word processors and
other application programs, thereby diminishing the importance of
the Windows operating system. Using a monopoly to block entry into
a market by potential competitors is a blatant violation of the
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   The judge could have turned to a less drastic remedy, imposing
rules that would prohibit Microsoft from engaging in illegal
practices. Indeed, the judge did impose such rules for the next
several years. But relying on rules permanently would be
unworkable. In a fast-moving industry, rules become irrelevant
quickly. Besides, an army of government officials would be needed
to second-guess every contract that Microsoft would enter into and
every product design it would offer to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson decided instead to create two companies, each having
incentive to do business with independent software enterprises and
even encroach on the other's territory. The Windows company might,
for example, develop applications and the applications company
might develop a substitute for Windows. That should give consumers
the benefit of vigorous innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The government, with the judge's blessing, will try to take
Microsoft's appeal directly to the Supreme Court as the law allows
for important antitrust cases. That would bypass the normal
practice of having an appeals court first analyze the complicated
technological and legal issues raised by this case so as to provide
a fuller record before the Supreme Court is asked to render a final
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a case where an expedited appeal to the Supreme
Court, explicitly allowed under a 1974 revision to the antitrust
laws, is justified. The uncertainty over Microsoft's future is sure
to complicate business judgments in the fast-changing world of
high-tech industry, the company's monopolistic practices have been
egregious, and the nation deserves a speedy resolution of this
struggle by the highest court in the land. There is no need to drag
it out with an intervening appellate review.
</P>
<P>
   Though the content of Jackson's ruling was unsurprising, the
tone was startlingly stern. Microsoft, he says, has been ``not
credible,'' ``untrustworthy,'' ``disingenuous.'' And he added,
``There is credible evidence in the record to suggest that
Microsoft, convinced of its innocence, continues to do business as
it has in the past and may yet do to other markets what it has
already done.'' Jackson sided completely with the government in
part because he mistrusts the company. Wednesday, Microsoft reaped
the well-deserved consequences.

   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 8:
</P>
<P>
   A cabinet crisis was the last thing Israel's prime minister,
Ehud Barak, needed days ahead of a potentially decisive new round
of peace talks with the Palestinians. But that is exactly what he
got Wednesday when three member parties of his governing coalition
joined the opposition in a preliminary vote for new elections.
Three more votes must be held before the bill becomes law.
Regrettably, Barak must now divert attention from peacemaking to
repairing his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The most damaging defection came from the Sephardic religious
party, Shas. Without the party's 17 votes, the coalition would lose
its majority. Shas' argument with Barak is not over peacemaking but
over its demand for additional government money for its private
school system. Shas wants to be able to offer all-day classes,
easing the child care burdens of its working-class constituents.
The government wants to rein in the budget.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long-running quarrel in which both sides have shown some
willingness to compromise. Shas was wrong to press the issue to the
point of calling for new elections. But some further concession by
Barak toward Shas' demands is now probably necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Barak rightly decided when he formed his government last year
that he needed support from the broadest possible cross-section of
Israelis to sustain the compromises necessary for peace. That
assessment remains just as true today. The other two defecting
parties, the National Religious Party and the Russian immigrant
party led by Natan Sharansky, are two of the most hawkish in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Winning back these two relatively small parties would be
desirable. But retaining Shas is virtually essential. Barak's only
alternative would be to form an extremely narrow coalition of the
center-left that would have trouble selling any peace agreements it
reached.
</P>
<P>
   Early next week, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are
scheduled to begin talks near Washington meant to prepare for a
possible Camp-David-style retreat later this summer. That meeting
would bring Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and President
Clinton together in an effort to reach a final peace agreement.
Those talks should proceed as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, meanwhile, should be asked, as the price of any further
concessions, to pledge that from now on it will subordinate its
pursuit of parochial causes to the wider Israeli interest in
negotiating peace.

LEMIEUX LIKE ROLES TO `STIR THINGS UP'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Claude Lemieux doesn't try to get around it. No
sugar-coating, no ``no comment'' answers, no avoiding the question
about what his role on the ice often is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to deny that I cause \Rtrouble\S out there,''
Lemieux said. ``There are guys that get paid to do that, get paid
to bring life into the game and stir things up when you are down. I
can't try to change my game now. When I'm too quiet out there, I'm
not myself and I'm not helping the team as much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take a lot of pride in being a guy they rely on for the
dirty work. Somebody's got to do it, and that's just the way I
play.''
</P>
<P>
   In most arenas, Lemieux, a winger for New Jersey, is the most
hated Devil. He's the master of the hidden shoves, elbows and
slashes that frustrate the opponent as much as they pain them. It's
a part of the game every successful team needs. Not coincidentally,
every team for which Lemieux has played has been successful.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Lemieux is about much more than a slash across the back of
the knee. He's about more than his 517 career playoff penalty
minutes, which is third all time. He's about much more than his
most vicious check ever, which sent Detroit's Kris Draper
face-first into the boards in the 1996 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux, first and foremost, is about winning. Just check his
records.
</P>
<P>
   In his 15th NHL season, Lemieux is playing in his 15th
postseason. This is his fifth trip to the Stanley Cup Finals, and
if New Jersey can close out the series tonight with a Game 5
victory, he'll be one of four active players (including Paul
Coffey, Mark Messier and Larry Murphy) to have won four Cups.
</P>
<P>
   When Claude Lemieux walks in a locker room, any team suddenly
seems to become a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously there's something to it,'' teammate Ken Daneyko
said. ``He's like that gum on your shoe you can't get off. He's
just stuck to your sole. Every team he goes to, guys suddenly learn
what it takes to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemieux won his first Cup in 1986 as a rookie with Montreal.
That season he scored 10 goals and had a career playoff-high 68
penalty minutes. He and the Canadiens lost to Calgary in the 1989
Finals, but he had his name engraved on the Cup again in 1995 with
New Jersey. That year, he won the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP
with a league-leading 13 goals, including three game winners.
</P>
<P>
   He joked then about a name like his being on the Conn Smythe,
but there was no joking about his impact when he left New Jersey
for Colorado the next season and the Avalanche won the Cup. While
he was gone, the Devils were eliminated in the first round three
times and the second round once.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back, and New Jersey is one victory from its second Cup
in six seasons. And it's not a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought something back we needed,'' Devils defenseman Scott
Stevens said. ``He's a strong, physical guy playing up front who
knows how to win.''
</P>
<P>
   And he knows how to score. The list for game-winning playoff
goals, expectedly, starts with Wayne Gretzky, who had 24. This
season, Brett Hull of the Stars has moved into second with 21.
Third on the list? You guessed it _ Lemieux, with 19. Many wouldn't
put Lemieux's name near the other two, but he does belong.
</P>
<P>
   He's also eighth all time in playoff goals scored with 80,
trailing Gretzky, Messier, Jari Kurri, Glenn Anderson, Hull, Mike
Bossy and Maurice ``Rocket'' Richard. And, he's an impressive
plus-43 for his playoff career.
</P>
<P>
   He scores. He wins. And he has a wife who makes friends wherever
they go, even if he doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife was here with friends for two games,'' Lemieux said.
``The fans were so good to her. They said to her `we hate your
husband, but we're glad to have you with us.'''
</P>
<P>
   And luckily, like Lemieux, his wife has accepted the nature of
his job and the feelings it creates.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's comfortable with it,'' he said. ``She's been around me
long enough now she's fine with it.''

SPRAGUE READY TO BITE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jack Sprague's voice sort of changes when he
begins to talk about the Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series champion has had some
adventures in the four races at the 1.5-mile quadoval. There was
1997 when he qualified with what at that time was the fastest lap
in a NASCAR race truck, only to start from the rear of the field
because of a nonapproved cylinder head.
</P>
<P>
   He did not finish the race.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1998, he almost flipped on the front stretch but
nonetheless ended up sixth. And last year, he said he just did not
run well], finishing fifth in June and a disappointing 11th in
October after he crashed his primary truck in practice.
</P>
<P>
   Most would like to have such finishes at a track such as TMS,
where the series races in front of some of its largest crowds. But
not Sprague, who was once called the ``Master of the
Superspeedway.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to win this race because this place has bit me,''
Sprague said. ``We have won poles, but we just have not won a race
there. We are going there this time to win this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague enters this week's Pronto Auto Parts 400K at TMS leading
the points and fresh off a victory at Evergreen Speedway in Monroe,
Wash.  &QL; 
Twilight events
</P>
<P>
   It's billed as ``Racing Under the Lights at Texas Motor
Speedway,'' but the past two years, it has resembled racing in the
twilight. Early start times to both the NASCAR Craftsman Truck
Series and the Indy Racing Northern Light Series events have had
some competitors finishing before the sun is completely down.
</P>
<P>
   But television dictates the times for races. The Pronto Auto
Parts 400K Truck race is scheduled to start at 6:30 p.m. tomorrow
and Saturday's Indy Racing Series Casino Magic 500 is slated for 7
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very frustrated by it, and it is a TV thing,'' TMS
general manager and executive vice president Eddie Gossage said.
``NASCAR does not want it at 6:30 p.m. ... But TV has the right to
dictate some of this stuff to us.''  &QL; 
New trophy
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Saturday's Casino Magic 500 Indy Racing Northern
Light Series event at TMS will be awarded the Foyt-Rutherford
Trophy. The name for the 20-inch-tall crystal trophy was decided in
a contest conducted on the track's Web site, and will be awarded to
the winner of the June Indy Racing] winner each year.  &QL; 
Renfrow rebounds
</P>
<P>
   Randy Renfrow's season started similar to a lot of drivers with
a poor finish in the inaugural NASCAR Truck race at Daytona.
Renfrow, a Wilson, N.C., native who drives for Fort Worth-based TKO
Motorsports, has rebounded from a 31st at Daytona to finish with
four top-10s in the past nine races.
</P>
<P>
   His best finish in the Farris Concrete Dodge Ram was a fifth at
Mesa Marin Raceway near Bakersfield, Calif. Renfrow also has had an
eighth-place run at Phoenix, was seventh at Pikes Peak and 10th at
Madison, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   He was 11th at Monroe, Wash., last week and is 14th in the
series standings. He has won $102,225 this season, more than he has
won in the two previous seasons combined.  &QL; 
Texas drivers
</P>
<P>
   B.A. Wilson won't be the only native Texan attempting to qualify
tonight for tomorrow's race, with four other drivers from Texas on
the entry list for this event.
</P>
<P>
   David Starr, who drove in both races last year for Joey Sonntag,
will drive for John Conely this year. Also on the list is Jay
Stewart of Lubbock, Patrick Lawler of Colleyville and Joel White of
Royse City.
</P>
<P>
   Lawler, who has experience in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest
Tour and drives a Legends car, will drive a Truck owned by former
Rangers pitcher Jeff Russell.  &QL; 
Autograph session
</P>
<P>
   Drivers from the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series will conduct an
autograph session from 6 to 7 tonight in the main concourse. The
session will be before the final Truck practice of the evening,
which is scheduled to begin at 7:15 on the 1.5-mile quadoval.

EDITORIAL: NEW JERSEY'S EXCESSIVE SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, June 8:
</P>
<P>
   At his victory celebration after Tuesday's election, Jon
Corzine, New Jersey's new Democratic nominee for the U.S. Senate,
made a promise that could be taken two ways. ``I want to invest in
America,'' he told supporters. ``That's what this campaign is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   What the former Wall Street financier meant was that he wanted
to spend for better health care and schools, instead of cutting
taxes. But Corzine had also just invested a stratospheric $35
million to win a primary, more than any other Senate candidate in
American history.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag for this victory now stands as a distressing
symbol of a political system so driven by money that a candidate
must be either extremely wealthy or extremely beholden to
contributors in order to win. Corzine and Rep. Bob Franks, his
Republican competitor for the general election, should now commit
themselves to correcting the way money skews the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Both these candidates talk about favoring campaign finance
reform, but Corzine has a special obligation to push for remedies
to the very imbalance that helped him win. Campaigns for federal
office need a combination of public financing and free television
time.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey spectacle also offers only the latest important
signal to the Supreme Court of how its unfortunate 1976 decision
treating political money as free speech has given an unfair
advantage to wealthy candidates. When Congress finally begins
dealing with this issue as part of a desperately needed campaign
finance reform package, it should enact a mandatory limit on the
use of personal wealth in campaigns as a way of forcing the court
to correct its earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., is not
the first wealthy novice to try his hand at politics. A fellow New
Jersey resident, Steve Forbes, unloaded $70 million in two
unsuccessful tries for the presidency. Ron Lauder, Al Checchi and
Michael Huffington tried to buy victory, but lost. Corzine's
success at this stage appears to result not simply from $1 million
a week spent on television ads, but also from his heavy spending on
voter turnout and his lavish contributions to the state's
Democratic Party organizations. It was this generosity that party
regulars more than reciprocated when they trotted out the loyal
vote on this rain-soaked Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   What also fueled Corzine's victory was a deep anger at his
worthy but unpopular opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, who raised
taxes in 1990 to help schools in poorer areas. For the general
election, Corzine's opposition will not be so instantly unloved.
Franks has almost no sharp edges as a timid but moderate
Republican. Corzine ought to be able to gain traction from Franks'
tendency to slip away from hard votes or even from giving his views
as a candidate on how he would have voted on the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty. But Corzine also hid from the most important candidate
debate in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates should now readily accept offers to debate,
especially in the larger forums offered by such groups as the
League of Women Voters. New Jersey's residents deserve to see these
two candidates not in their soft and expensive television ads but
in debates that are not choreographed to shield them from tough
policy tests. Without such promises to debate linked to a solid
oath to reform campaign financing, the New Jersey race could
degenerate into an auction.
</P>
<P>
   But neither a Democrat's deep pockets nor Republican campaign
committees' habitual dependence on special-interest money should
determine the outcome of a race for the U.S. Senate. &QL;

ELLERY CHUN, 91, POPULARIZER OF SHIRT THAT WON HAWAII 
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ellery J. Chun, who might not have exactly invented the Hawaiian
shirt but who surely gave it a powerful push toward prominence,
died in Honolulu on May 16. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Once there were no shirts in Hawaii, much less pink ones with
ukuleles, but shocked missionaries hastened to introduce a plain,
solid-color work shirt called a palaka to men. Women got long,
shapeless dresses called muumuus. These early garments were made of
native tapa, or bark cloth. Soon patterns were added.
</P>
<P>
   As American tourists began to arrive on cruise ships in the
1920s, small tailor shops began making custom prints on the shirts
for the visitors. Hawaiians, in turn, started using them for
weddings and other special occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Chun, a native Hawaiian who graduated from Yale as an
economics major in 1931. He turned a Chinese dry goods shop,
King-Smith Clothiers at 36 North King Street, into the first mass
producer of Hawaiian shirts. Most important, he gave them the name
by which they are called on the Hawaiian Islands, aloha shirts.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Mildred, said the shirts were a way to keep his
clothing business going during the Depression. She told The
Honolulu Star-Bulletin that he started with a few dozen bright
printed Hawaiian patterns with palm trees, hula girls and
pineapples. She said his tailor sewed three or four dozen at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   By 1933, he was producing ready-to-wear models from cloth
imported from the United States mainland, Japan and Tahiti. Surfers
and beach boys snapped them up, and before long, the shirts had
become symbolic of easy, casual masculinity. To be sure, the cheap
imitations, particularly those featuring pink flamingos, became
gaudy badges for tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming higher, marketers let it be known that each color on the
more expensive styles carried ancient significance: Yellow meant
victor, red valor and white holiness.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery Clift wore the Diamond Head pattern in ``From Here to
Eternity''; Elvis Presley wore the Blue Hawaii pattern in the 1963
move of the same name, and Tom Selleck's Bird Airbrush shirt from
his ``Magnum PI'' television series ended up in the Smithsonian
Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sinatra, Arthur Godfrey and Bing Crosby wore aloha shirts.
Presidents Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower equated them
with weekends.
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, at least on Fridays, the shirts became acceptable as
business garb. And the older shirts became collector's items. The
most expensive command prices of up to $5,000. In 1997, the
Honolulu Academy of the Arts mounted an exhibition of the most
iconic aloha shirts.
</P>
<P>
   To Chun, the shirts were good business. His store embellished
its easygoing reputation by sponsoring a radio talent show in the
late 1930s, which originated from the stretch of Waikiki Beach
fronting the Moana Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, Chun became a director of American Security Bank. He
closed his clothing outlet and remained with the bank until
retiring in 1966. In 1991, the Hawaii state Senate honored him for
his shirt-making achievement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Mildred, he is survived by two
daughters, Colleen Hirano and Christine Chung; a son, Damon; a
sister, Wai-Chee Yee, and four grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out well,'' his wife said.

BIRD NOT WORRIED ABOUT L.A. FASTBREAK THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last time Larry Bird saw the Lakers in the Finals,
the one thing he had to guard against was the fastbreak. This time
around, the one thing he's not worrying about is their fastbreak.
</P>
<P>
   Showtime, where have you gone? Very far away, according to Bird.
</P>
<P>
   The dreaded Lakers fastbreak Bird had to concern himself as a
player with the Celtics in the '80s has been replaced by another as
the Pacers coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is very important for us to really not worry about
fastbreak points,'' Bird said. ``What we have to do is have all the
guys around the basket so we can pick up some rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're dominating on the boards. We'd like to have five guys
standing around there picking up as many as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   In the previous 17 playoff games, the Lakers outrebounded their
opponents by a combined 749-690; Indiana was outrebounded in its 17
playoff games 702-685.
</P>
<P>
   TIMELY ARRIVAL: Most of the Pacers barely got to Staples Center
in time to dress and warm up before tipoff on Wednesday. The second
Indiana bus, with eight Pacers and Bird, had this little problem
navigating the Los Angeles freeways.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson, Jalen Rose, Travis Best and Co. didn't arrive in
their locker room until 5:05 p.m. PDT for the 6 p.m. game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying a sneak attack,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the team didn't try to offer the driver any tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, man, he was a Lakers fan,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers were coming from their hotel in Santa Monica, a
direct commute up Interstate 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took the 10, the 15 and the 20,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bird was just used to his Celtics-Lakers days in the
Finals over at the old joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the Forum,'' Bird said. ``We were sitting over there
waiting for the game to start.''
</P>
<P>
   THOSE WEREN'T THE BLAZERS: Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal never
had as difficult a time getting his game going as he did against
Portland in the Western Conference finals, but the Pacers said
there isn't much they can take from the Blazers' approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blazers have a different type team than we do,'' Bird
said. ``They've got long arms, they're lanky, they've got
quickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the quickness they have. We don't have the arm
span they have. They're a good defensive basketball team. We're not
a great defensive basketball team. Obviously, Shaq is going to
cause us a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird said this before O'Neal went 7 of 8 from the field in the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   WE FIGURED: Bird said he was proud to be coaching his first team
in the Finals, but all things considered: ``I'd rather be playing,
to tell you the truth. It's completely different.'' &QL;

LAKERS TRY TO FOCUS ON PLAYING, NOT HYPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Banners draped over every Staples Center railing
screamed ``NBA FINALS 2000,'' but the Lakers' first objective
Wednesday was to ignore their enhanced surroundings and concentrate
on the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're really just stuck on basketball right now,''
fourth-year guard Derek Fisher said before tipoff. ``I think
because all season long we've just been focused on winning, that we
still don't really recognize that this is the Finals because we
haven't won it yet. So until maybe Game 4 or Game 5, when we get
close to actually winning it, then maybe some jitters and some
anxiety will start to come up because we know we're getting that
close to what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, as many Lakers playing in his first Finals, admitted to
some excitement, ``but I'm not overflowing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson's message to his team was simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us to recognize the situation but definitely live in
the moment and not allow, whether it's family members or friends
that are bugging you for tickets and calling about coming to town,
or whether it's the thousands of media personnel that seem to be
here,'' Fisher said. ``He allows us to soak in things but at the
same time, be in control and if you can't use it to your advantage,
don't use it at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jackson: ``This is great, but you have to narrow your
focus, you have to remember what we're here for, playing ball. ...
Try and stay to your routine, so you stay in touch with your game
and in touch with the kind of mental process you go through to get
ready for a game.''
</P>
<P>
   FLASHBACK: Jackson said there was no comparing this Finals (the
Lakers' first since 1991) to his first as Chicago Bulls coach
(coincidentally, the 1991 Finals, when the Bulls beat the Lakers).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing similar or anything like the first Finals,''
he said, ``That Bulls team I think had only lost one game going
into the Finals and lost one (game) in the Finals at that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``L.A. obviously was in the Finals, and that's a long time ago
for L.A. and we're happy to be back here again,'' Jackson said.
``Sam Perkins (then a Laker, now a Pacer) hit a key shot in that
first game, a very big shot at the end of that ballgame to give
them a (93-91) win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers lost the next four games of the series.
</P>
<P>
   FLASHBACK 2: The last time Jackson saw the Pacers in the
playoffs was in the 1998 Eastern Conference finals, won by the
Bulls in seven games. Jackson recalled the Pacers struggling at
Chicago in that series but said they have improved since _ they won
the East last week with a win at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've learned to win playoff games on the road in
this (postseason). I think they've improved as a basketball team on
the road during the playoffs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   STAPLES UPDATE: Staples Center will be open to the public to
show Games 3 and 4 from Indianapolis on Sunday and Wednesday,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Free tickets will be available today beginning at 10 a.m. PDT at
the Staples Center box office and at TicketMaster outlets at
participating Warehouse Music, Tower Records, Robinsons-May and
Ritmo Latino stores.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets, not available by phone, are limited to four per person,
per game.
</P>
<P>
   OUCH REPORT: Rookie swingman Devean George _ out since Game 3 of
the Western Conference finals _ is on the mend from his sprained
left ankle, and Jackson expects him to rejoin the rotation soon. &QL;

GEN. THOMAS KELLY, 67, DIES; PENTAGON VOICE IN GULF WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lt. Gen. Thomas W. Kelly, who was the voice and
face of the Army for millions of Americans in daily news briefings
on the Persian gulf war, died on Tuesday at his home in Clifton,
Va. He was 67.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, said his daughter, Elizabeth
O'eary.
</P>
<P>
   As the director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff
under Gen. Colin L. Powell during the gulf war, Kelly played a
major role in regulating the flow of news from the military to the
public via the news media.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials defended the policy as necessary to protect
American forces in the field; news executives and reporters
criticized it as too restrictive and self-serving.
</P>
<P>
   Known for injecting his news briefings with bluntness and
flashes of wit, Kelly was respected and admired by the press corps
for his ability to politely avoid answering questions that the
Pentagon believed might compromise national security.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in one briefing whether sending B-52 bombers to attack a
single Scud missile site was comparable to killing a fly with a
sledge hammer, he replied, ``My own personal opinion is that's a
delightful way to kill a fly.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his responsibilities with the news media, the
general helped plan the operation known as Desert Storm, and the
military action in Panama that removed Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega
from office.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they had failed to anticipate the
power of the Pentagon briefings over public opinion. But once they
recognized the briefings' influence, they capitalized on the
situation by staging elaborate rehearsals for key Pentagon
briefers, including Kelly, who once asked an aide ``if they'd
passed out the questions in advance'' to the journalists, because
it seemed the reporters were simply reading them back to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the press needs to step back and reflect on how they
cover things,'' Kelly said in an interview with The New York Times
on his retirement in 1991, adding that in World War II, for
example, ``the security of the force was absolutely accepted by all
correspondents covering the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Philadelphia on Nov. 16, 1932, Thomas William Kelly
chose the Army over a career in journalism after receiving a
bachelor of science degree from Temple University. He joined the
Reserve Officers Training Corps at Temple and was commissioned in
the Army in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from a newspaper family,'' he said. ``My father, my
grandfather, my uncle and my mother all worked at The Philadelphia
Inquirer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly retired in April 1991, after 34 years of military service
and after serving in a wide variety of assignments and posts,
including tours as war plans officer for NATO forces in southern
Europe; director of the special operation agency for the Joint
Chiefs of Staff; commanding general of Army security affairs;
commander of Fort Dix, N.J.; and as a tank commander at Fort Knox,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   He studied at the U.S. War College and served in Vietnam in 1967
and 1968. In those years, he was operations officer with the First
Infantry Division, known as the Big Red One. He commanded units
from a cavalry platoon to a tank brigade; while aboard Army
helicopters in Vietnam, he was shot down several times by enemy
fire and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's military awards and decorations included the Defense
Distinguished Service Medal, the Army Distinguished Service Medal,
three awards of the Legion of Merit, the Distinguished Flying
Cross, five Bronze Stars with a ``V'' insignia for service in
combat, as well as the Purple Heart. In 1995, he was presented the
American Legion's Distinguished Service Medal.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring, Kelly worked as a professional speaker and
served on the board of the Enron Corp. He joined the Wing Group of
Houston and Aspen, Colo., in 1993, serving as the company's
president and vice chairman. The company sought to build natural
gas power plants in China, the Middle East, Europe, Turkey,
Pakistan and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his daughter, of Manassas, Va., the general is
survived by his wife, Dorothy of Clifton, whom he married in 1957;
two sons, Francis, of Jacksonville, Fla., and Vincent, of Clifton;
and four grandchildren.

C.D. ATKINS, 86, INVENTOR OF ORANGE JUICE PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)   By ERIC V. COPAGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   C.D. Atkins, an inventor of frozen concentrated orange juice,
which revolutionized the Florida citrus industry, died last June 3
at his home in Winter Haven, Fla. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, Edwin L. Moore and L.G. MacDowell, who died in July
1986, were the research team that the Florida Citrus Commission
asked in the 1940s to improve the quality of processed orange
products. The purpose was to provide better juice for the armed
forces and make more efficient use of Florida's orange crop. The
work was done at a laboratory provided by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture in Lakeland, Fla., and began in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The concentration process, which involves heating the juice so
that the water evaporates, was already well known. But the three
invented the process in which the flavor of orange juice could be
retained by adding a bit of fresh juice to the concentrate and then
freezing it. Called the cutback process, it led to the expansion of
the Florida citrus economy as well as surrounding industries for
transporting and warehousing the juice.
</P>
<P>
   The cutback process also created a more nutritious product by
restoring some of the Vitamin C that was lost in heating.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Donald Atkins was born on Sept. 7, 1913, in Winter Haven.
He was the only child of James H. Atkins, a railroad telegraph
operator, and his wife, Christina, an elementary-school teacher.
The Atkinses had inherited a couple of hundred acres of land in
1887, and they planted orange groves, from which they earned a
second income, according to Atkins' son, Robert.
</P>
<P>
   C.D. Atkins attended the University of Florida for three years,
planning to be a doctor. But when his parents ran out of money, he
transferred to Florida Southern College near his parents' home in
Lakeland, where he could help finance his tuition by teaching
chemistry, biology and physics at the college. He graduated with a
Bachelor of Science degree in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   After college, he taught high school and coached football in the
Florida towns of Plant City, Fort Meade and Winter Haven. In 1942,
he became a research scientist with the federal Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins had seven patents in all, including one for a sports
drink containing orange juice, a pulp-free syrup for carbonated
beverages and a process for extracting the aroma from fresh juice,
then adding it to concentrate, which enhances its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The process for frozen orange juice was patented in 1946 under
an agreement in which the patent belonged to the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never mentioned regretting it,'' Atkins' son said. ``He
always had enough money to be comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Atkins is survived by his wife, the former Martha Kathryn Marsh;
a daughter, Barbara Atkins Smith, and his son, Robert, both of
Winter Haven; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.

 BLAIR CLARK, 82, CBS EXECUTIVE, McCARTHY'S '68 CAMPAIGN MANAGER  
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blair Clark, an influential executive at CBS News, a former
editor of the Nation and the campaign manager for Sen. Eugene J.
McCarthy in his unsuccessful bid for the 1968 Democratic
presidential nomination, died June 6 in Princeton, N.J. He was 82
and lived in Princeton and Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pulmonary complications after colon surgery, said
his wife, Joanna.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was something of a mandarin, playing key roles in the
careers of men who became much better known to the general public
than he, including managing the unsuccessful McCarthy campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, of Minnesota, was challenging President Lyndon B.
Johnson's stance on Vietnam and did well in the New Hampshire
primary, which helped persuade Johnson not to run for another term.
</P>
<P>
   From 1961 to 1964 Clark was general manager and vice president
of CBS News, after being a CBS correspondent based in Paris. He was
known for broadening the radio and television coverage of CBS News
by hiring additional correspondents in the United States and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Cronkite recalled Wednesday ``I've always assumed that,
as the general manager of CBS News, he was instrumental in
assigning me to the anchor role on `CBS Evening News,' beginning in
1962.'' The actual decision was made by Clark's superior, Richard
Salant, who was president of CBS News at that time.
</P>
<P>
   And Dan Rather recalled that Clark and another CBS executive,
Ernie Leiser, had hired him in 1961 because his hurricane coverage
in Texas had been good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blair was a pioneer of television news as a distinguished
correspondent based in Paris and later as an executive,'' Rather
added. ``As a correspondent he helped to build on and maintain the
CBS News reputation that had been built primarily during the World
War II years, and then as an executive he laid the foundation for
the modern television era at CBS News.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was born in East Hampton, N.Y., into the Clark family of
Coats &AMP; Clark's Thread.
</P>
<P>
   He was educated at a New England boarding school, St. Marks, and
received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   He was a reporter for The St. Louis Post-Dispatch before serving
in the Army from 1941 to 1946. Then he held other journalistic
posts before joining CBS News in 1953 in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   After he left CBS in 1964, he was associate publisher of The New
York Post, editor of The Nation magazine, where he found expression
for his liberal views, and a fellow of the New York Institute for
Humanities at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   His 1942 marriage to Jessie Holladay Philbin ended in divorce in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, the former Joanna Rostropowicz, whom he
married in 1971, he is survived by a son from his first marriage,
Timothy, of Bethesda, Md.; a son from his second marriage, Ian, of
Manhattan; a stepson, Tomasz Malinowski of Washington; a sister,
Anne Martindell of Princeton; and a brother, William, of
Stockbridge, Mass., and seven grandchildren.

POLICE SAY COUPLE TRIED TO ROB A BANK FOR WEDDING CASH
</HEADLINE>
 By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dorrell Mainer and Kevin Rainey were eager to
celebrate their wedding this Saturday in Brooklyn. They expected
150 friends and relatives, including Rainey's elderly mother from
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But the police said that when a financial setback threatened the
nuptials, the couple so worried about disappointing their relatives
that they devised a moneymaking plan not found in any bridal
planner: bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, after a botched bank robbery attempt on Coney Island,
their wedding plans were in even greater disarray, the police said.
The couple were arraigned in Brooklyn Criminal Court on one count
each of first-degree robbery.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to rob the Chase Manhattan Bank branch in Brighton
Beach shortly after noon on Tuesday, the police said. Mainer, 38,
who wore a brown floppy hat and sunglasses, walked up to a teller
and passed a note, while Rainey, 41, was a lookout by the door, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The note demanded money and said a bomb linked to the bank's
telephone system would detonate if the teller called the police,
according to a police supervisor familiar with its contents. It
also referred to a sick child who needed care and said the couple
``had nothing to lose in robbing the bank,'' the supervisor said.
</P>
<P>
   But the teller stalled Mainer, the police said, forcing the
couple to flee without taking any cash. They were arrested minutes
later, after stopping at a doughnut shop to use the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   After their arrests, Mainer and Rainey admitted that they did
not have a sick child, according to investigators. Instead, they
said, Mainer told a different tale of woe: a tax refund that was to
be used to pay for the wedding had been taken back by the
government because the Internal Revenue Service had overpaid her.
</P>
<P>
   They tried to rob the bank, the police supervisor said, because
``they didn't want to disappoint their family members.'' The police
also said Mainer was a suspect in two bank robberies in Queens. But
Mainer's lawyer, Paula Notari, said she was a ``stellar member of
the community'' with no criminal record, who supported her three
children, ages 11, 14 and 21, and had a bachelor's degree from John
Jay College.
</P>
<P>
   At the arraignment, Rainey's lawyer, Julie Clark, said he had
known nothing of the robbery and thought that his fiancee had
stopped by the bank to make a wire transfer.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Wednesday whether the wedding, which has been set
for 11 a.m. on Saturday at the First A.M.E. Zion Church in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, would go forward. Neither Rainey nor Mainer
immediately posted bail. And the church clerk, Hazel Harvey, said
she was astounded to hear about the arrests.

STRUGGLING SALON.COM LAYS OFF 13 EMPLOYEES
</HEADLINE>
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The carnage in the world of Web-based journalism continued
Wednesday as Salon.com, one of the highest-profile Web magazines,
laid off 13 employees in an effort to make up an expected $7
million shortfall in its $35 million budget.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, which has gained attention with thoughtful
commentary, breaking news and some less savory endeavors _ one of
its correspondents said he tried to pass his germs on to a
presidential candidate by licking the doorknobs at campaign
headquarters _ announced the cutbacks in the same week that
APBNews.com, a crime and justice site based in New York, laid off
its 140 employees and the CBS Internet division in New York
dismissed a quarter of its approximately 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   David Talbot, Salon.com's founder, said the cutbacks would help
the site's long-term prospects. But he also made it clear that in
this season of investors' discontent with dot-coms, journalism that
does not directly bring in viewers, advertisers or partners is
unlikely to survive.
</P>
<P>
   And writers competing in the most heavily populated niches
online are among the most vulnerable. Of the seven editorial
employees laid off, three _ Sean Elder, the media writer; Craig
Seligman, the books editor; and Craig Offman, a senior business
writer who covered book publishing _ covered media news. The online
competition for that audience includes Powerful Media's new site,
Inside.com; the Web sites of magazines like Brill's Content, the
Industry Standard and Editor &AMP; Publisher; and the Web sites of
national newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs also show the financial strain in producing original
content for the Web. One competitor of Salon for media news, for
example, is Jim Romanesko's Poynter Institute site, which, at
little cost, compiles daily links to media coverage around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The criterion for the layoffs, Talbot said in an interview, was
the number of readers _ as measured by hits, or page views _ and
the number of sponsors or advertisers. As he described it: ``We
looked at the hits and the sponsorship.''
</P>
<P>
   Salon's stock price, which had dropped as low as $1.9375 during
the day Wednesday, rebounded on the news of the layoffs, closing at
$2.175. The stock was offered to the public one year ago at $10.50,
and reached its peak price of $15.175 shortly thereafter. Its
current market capitalization of $30 million is about 25 percent of
what it had been at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   The site added dozens of employees last year, when sites with
original content were at the peak of popularity with venture
capitalists and investors. APBNews.com had also increased its staff
during that time. Wednesday, an APBNews.com executive said the site
had between $50,000 and $75,000 in the bank and debts of $6 million
to $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the layoffs have not affected APBNews.com's public presence.
Yesterday, with more than half of the laid-off employees at their
old desks, the site posted a special report on the percentage of
ballplayers in the National Basketball Association playoffs with
arrest records (18 percent, or less than the national average of
lifetime arrests). Executives of APBNews.com, meanwhile, continued
to talk with possible partners, including America Online and Fox
News, the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   And as its bank account was dwindling to nothing in the last six
days, APBNews.com's journalists were winning awards _ one from the
Investigative Reporters and Editors group over the weekend, and on
Tuesday, a separate award for international reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Schanberg, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who is one
of the most senior and visible members of the site's staff, said
Wednesday that the journalists who were laid off came in to work
without being asked and without being paid.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs at Salon were in response to a recent financial
analysis that projected a shortfall of at least $6 million in the
company's original projection of about $20 million in revenue,
according to Michael O'Donnell, Salon's president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the $14 million in expected revenues and
the $28 million in expected expenses, O'Donnell said, would be made
up from the $18 million the company has in the bank. As Talbot
described it, ``The situation is short-term pain, which we're going
through, in exchange for long-term viability.''
</P>
<P>
   The pattern of Salon's layoffs reflected its competitors'
success. Talbot said he was laying off Don George, the travel
editor, because travel sites that provide booking opportunities
trump travel sites that just provide reading opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   The news was unnerving for those who had left the familiar
confines of old media to join the Web adventure. Offman, who left a
reporter-researcher job at Time magazine to join Salon, said,
``You're not held for space; to some extent you don't have to
compete to get into the book,'' a reference to the vicissitudes of
journalistic life at Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he added, referring to the audience counts that cost
him his job, ``there is some kind of competition going on. It's
just not perceptible to the human eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of those laid off yesterday, Camille Peri and Kate Moses,
the founders of the ``Mothers Who Think'' section of the site, are
the wives of Talbot and Salon's executive editor, Gary Kamiya,
respectively. Asked how he gave his wife the news, Talbot said,
``Very carefully.''

DEATH TOLL COULD RISE WITH AS MANY AS EIGHT WOMEN, BABY LINKED TO
MURDER SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD ESPINOZA and TONY RIZZO  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ As many as eight women and a baby linked to
John Edward Robinson Sr. could be dead, authorities said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, the suspect in the deaths of five women whose bodies
were recently found in barrels, is connected to three women and a
baby girl reported missing from Overland Park, Kan., in the 1980s,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those cases that continues to unfold every day,
and I think it's impossible for anyone to speculate where it will
end,'' Johnson County, Kan., District Attorney Paul Morrison said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Robinson was connected to the 1984
disappearance of Paula Godfrey, 19, of Overland Park, Kan. About
four months later, police suspected he had a hand in the
disappearance of Lisa Stasi, 19, and her 5-month-old daughter,
Tiffany. Authorities also have linked him to Katherine Clampet, 27,
of Overland Park, who was reported missing in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison and police officials from Overland Park and Lenexa,
Kan., also said that Izabela K. Lewicka, a Polish immigrant with
known connections to Robinson, could not be found. Lewicka, 22, had
been living in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators asked anyone who has information about the missing
women or Robinson to call the task force at (913) 477-7633.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   - Authorities confirmed that one of two bodies found in barrels
on property Robinson owns in Linn County, Kan., was that of Suzette
Marie Trouten, 28, of Monroe County, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   - Authorities were finishing draining a pond on the Linn County
property. They wouldn't discuss any evidence they found there, but
said a pickup that was pulled from the pond earlier did not appear
significant to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 56, is suspected of recently meeting some victims
through sadomasochistic connections made on the Internet,
authorities said. But in the 1980s, he was presenting himself as a
businessman and philanthropist who wanted to help unwed mothers and
other women who needed a hand, according to Overland Park Police
Capt. Jeffery Dysart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears as if all these women were just getting started in
their lives,'' Dysart said at the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said police do not believe the bodies in the barrels
are those of the missing women from the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a guy here who has lived in a lot of
different places and has had a lot of contacts,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said detectives worked the earlier cases as far as they
could in the 1980s, but never learned what happened to the women or
gathered enough information to charge anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Police reopened those cases in March, when Trouten was reported
missing. Trouten met Robinson on the Internet and told relatives
she was going to Lenexa to see about a job, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two bodies found Saturday in Linn County,
officers on Monday discovered barrels containing three bodies in a
storage locker Robinson had rented in Raymore, Mo. All five women
had sustained blows to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have been hampered in their efforts to identify
the bodies by not knowing where the women came from or even how
long they have been dead. For now, investigators are taking dental
and DNA samples. Also, police and relatives of missing persons from
around the country have been calling the task force in Lenexa to
see whether their cases may be related to Robinson's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said authorities suspect that one of the bodies could
be that of Lewicka, who had been living around Westport in Kansas
City before she moved to an Overland Park apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators think Lewicka dated Robinson and worked with him,
although they would not say what Robinson did for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Lewicka may have known Robinson since 1997, according to a
marriage license application filed then in Johnson County District
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The application lists the name Isabella Katyzma Lewicki of
Kansas City as the prospective bride and John Anthony Robinson of
Olathe, Kan., as the prospective groom.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's real middle name is Edward, and he has been married
to the same woman for more than 20 years, but the marriage
application lists his correct date of birth.
</P>
<P>
   Although marriage applicants state under oath that information
they are providing is correct, no proof of identity is required
when requesting the application.
</P>
<P>
   After the application was requested, no further action was taken
and no marriage license was issued, according to the records.
</P>
<P>
   Murder charges have not yet been filed against Robinson,
although Morrison and Chris Koster, the Cass County, Mo.,
prosecuting attorney, have said that capital murder charges are
likely.
</P>
<P>
   He is being held on a $5 million bond on charges of sexually
assaulting two women he met on the Internet who were interested in
sadomasochistic sexual activity. Because of the high bond,
prosecutors say, murder charges can wait.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County Jail officials said Robinson was being held in
protective custody because of concerns that he might harm himself
or be harmed by other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's attorney, District Defender Byron Cerrillo, filed
notice Tuesday that Robinson was invoking his constitutional rights
and did not want to give any statement to police.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they have talked to Robinson's relatives and do not
believe they are involved in the case.
