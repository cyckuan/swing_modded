U.S. warship rescues yacht crew off Australia

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ A helicopter from the USS Valley
Forge plucked four men from a disabled catamaran in heavy seas and
high winds south of Australia on Friday.
	   The guided missile cruiser picked up the men's mayday call,
launched the rescue helicopter and brought them on board after
their catamaran, the Catch 22, was overwhelmed by high seas off the
southwestern coast of Victoria state.
	   Lt. Cmdr. Werner Urinka said the weather was very bad, with
heavy seas battering his ship.
	   He said the catamaran had capsized and its Australian crew was
delighted to see the American ship.
	   ``They've been pretty ecstatic, that's for sure. They were very
happy,'' Urinka said.
	   The USS Valley Forge is on its way back to the United States
after a tour of duty in the Persian Gulf. The ship is visiting
Victoria's capital, Melbourne, for rest and recreation.
	   Victoria police said the catamaran crew reported engine trouble
about 4 a.m. (1700 GMT), then soon afterwards sent a distress call
saying they had been swamped by a wave and were taking in water.

U.S. lawmaker: North Korea's countryside turning into graveyard
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ An alarming number of white grave
markers are popping up in North Korea's countryside as the
communist country enters its fourth winter of famine without heat
or medicine, a U.S. Congressman said Friday.
	   Rep. Tony P. Hall, an Ohio Democrat fresh from a five-day visit
to North Korea, said the situation in Pyongyang, the capital, was
improving but food shortages and the resulting human toll in the
countryside were getting worse.
	   ``What is happening in North Korea when you scratch the surface
is very, very critical,'' Hall said at a news conference in Seoul.
	   Hall said he saw gaunt children and adults roaming a countryside
stripped of trees, gathering twigs and gleaning what was left of
the harvest.
	   At a small east coast town, called Orang, people ground leaves,
corn stalks and twigs into powder and made noodles out of them.
	   ``I was taken aback. ... They are relying more and more on this,
on what they call substitute food,'' he said. ``You can't digest
them. You see a lot of people holding their stomach at hospital.''
	   ``Every other hill, you see a tremendous number of new, white
grave markers. When you fly over the countryside or drive through
it, they flash out because they are so new,'' he said.
	   Hall, an expert on hunger and poverty who has traveled widely in
Africa and Asia, visited North Korea from Sunday through Thursday
to assess what international aid officials have called a ``famine
in slow motion.'' It was his fourth visit to North Korea since 1996
and his first this year.
	   Hall said North Korea's unwillingness to open up and adopt
measures to reform its Stalinist regime should not deter
humanitarian aid.
	   If it does, ``we will have confrontation, and a lot of people
will die. And it is not officials but people who will die,'' he
said.
	   Hall drew this picture of the catastrophic damage to North
Korea's people and economy:
	   Even the best hotels in provincial cities did not have water and
were only partially heated at best. With 90 percent of the
country's water contaminated, diarrhea, dysentery and other
water-born diseases were rampant.
	   Virtually all factories were idle. Doctors were operating
without anesthesia, heat or even light. There were not many old
people on the street.
	   ``At orphanages, I saw room after room full of children with
sores, scabs and swollen faces _ all signs of malnutrition. There
was hardly any noise coming out of these children,'' he said.
	   ``Some of them were so malnourished that they were sometimes
lucky to be able to force feed them,'' he said. ``At a classroom,
we saw a 10-year-old boy who was 12 inches below what he should
be.''
	   Overall, 30 percent of the North Korean children of one and two
years of age are severely malnourished and 65 to 67 percent of all
children stunted, he said.
	   Three years of floods and drought that started in 1995
devastated North Korea's collective farming and planned economy,
already teetering from the loss of its Soviet bloc trading
partners.
	   This years's grain harvest is finished and by U.N. estimates
little improved over last year's: about 3 million tons, only enough
to meet two-thirds of the needs of North Korea's 22 million people.

King says broad coalition government deal reached

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk said Friday
that Cambodia's bitter political rivals have agreed to form a new
coalition government and expressed hope that remaining stumbling
blocks over who fills the key jobs could quickly be overcome.
	   Speaking after both sides arrived at his opulent Royal Palace
for a second day of meetings, Sihanouk called the atmosphere
``positive'' and said both sides had made ``important concessions''
to break the three-month-old political deadlock.
	   Sihanouk said in a statement that his son, opposition leader
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the royalist FUNCINPEC party,
had agreed to form a coalition with strongman Hun Sen and his
Cambodian People's Party but that details needed to be worked out.
	   A remaining stumbling block is the presidency of the Cambodian
parliament, a powerful position coveted by both parties.
	   The CPP has insisted it should take the post as the majority
party in parliament, but FUNCINPEC has argued that it gave up the
position after winning a 1993 election and the favor should be
returned.
	   Sinahouk expressed hope that both sides could reach a deal
Friday afternoon. If not, the 76-year-old monarch said the pair
should continue meeting after he leaves Saturday for medical
treatment in Beijing.
	   ``Should issues remain after I leave, you must continue to talk
and compromise,'' Sihanouk said.
	   Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to a request
by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political
pardons.
	   All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that are
widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has broad powers to grant
pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically
sensitive cases.
	   Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been at
loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections in
July that were supposed to put an end to instability after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a coup last year.
	   The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy
held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to widespread
fraud and intimidation.
	   The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh seeking Hun
Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. After the new
parliament was sworn in Sept. 24, the opposition leaders and many
supporters left the country for Thailand, saying their safety was
endangered.
	   Ranariddh, under extreme pressure from Cambodia's international
aid donors to reach a deal so normal business with a government can
resume, returned to Phnom Penh on Thursday after receiving security
guarantees.
	   Sam Rainsy, under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his
role in the demonstrations, has remained abroad. His 15 seats in
the 122 seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working
government.

India, Pakistan begin last day of peace talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India _ India and Pakistan entered the last day of a
contentious round of peace talks Friday, discussing how to use
cultural ties to bring the two nations closer.
	   After five days of talks on issues ranging from water sharing to
military exchanges on a Himalayan glacier, New Delhi and Islamabad
had by Friday achieved little more than restating their positions
on the knotty disputes.
	   The two sides had accused each other on Thursday of supporting
terrorism.
	   Looming over the talks is the most sensitive issue between the
South Asian neighbors _ their rival claims to the Himalayan
province of Kashmir. The two countries have fought two of their
three wars over the territory.
	   Indian Culture Secretary R.V.V. Ayyar and his Pakistani
counterpart Syed Roshan Zamir opened discussions Friday at the
National Museum, an opulent British-era red sandstone building in
the heart of New Delhi.
	   The two officials were to discuss measures like releasing
fishermen from both countries routinely arrested for trespassing in
the other's waters, and starting a bus service between New Delhi
and the Pakistani city of Lahore.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistan released 151 Indian fishermen in a
gesture of goodwill. Some of the detained fishermen had been in
jail for two years, all charged with illegally fishing in Pakistani
waters.
	   Indian singers, dancers and artists are not allowed to perform
in Pakistan. Meanwhile, hard-line Indian politicians campaign
against visits from Pakistani singers, actors and athletes.
	   Cricket is extremely popular in India and Pakistan, and both
have top international teams. But the two countries have only
played each other in third countries the past few years, fearing
fans' emotions could turn violent at home.
	   There are plans for a Pakistani tour of India next year.

Indonesian military caught between its past and push for change
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Indonesia-Politics
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Peering through thick helmet visors, a
row of riot officers stood silent as student protesters prodded
their plastic shields with sticks and hurled taunts.
	   ``The Indonesian armed forces are useless,'' exultant
demonstrators chanted before security forces dispersed them with a
barrage of tear gas, water cannon and plastic bullets.
	   As students prepared for more protests Friday after a night of
violence, Indonesia's military finds itself in a difficult
position.
	   Once the enforcer of an authoritarian regime, the 450,000-member
military is struggling to adapt to a new, self-declared role as the
guardian of Indonesia's transition to democracy.
	   It's clear that without the backing of the powerful military,
President B.J. Habibie will be unable to pursue the array of
democratic reforms that he has promised to implement.
	   While the military pledges to safeguard parliamentary elections
next year, it is reluctant to bow to clamor that it abandon a
longstanding prominence in Indonesian political life. Former
President Suharto, an ex-army general, awarded his subordinates
that privilege.
	   Yet the chaotic scenes in central Jakarta this week were
reminiscent of Suharto's heavy-handed era. One officer and one
student died and at least 110 protesters were injured in the worst
unrest in Jakarta since street turmoil unseated Suharto in May
after 32 years in power.
	   The spectacle of police and soldiers racing through downtown
Jakarta streets, battering pro-democracy protesters with clubs, was
bound to exacerbate the military's tainted image.
	   Accused of widespread human rights abuses, the military is
already conducting a string of internal probes that critics say are
unlikely to target any high-ranking culprits.
	   The students who tangled with officers on Thursday oppose a
government assembly convened by Habibie to dismantle the rigid
political controls fashioned by his predecessor.
	   Yet large numbers of assembly delegates, most of whom got their
jobs by loyally serving Suharto, are unwilling to strip the
military of all its 75 appointed seats in Parliament.
	   One proposal would allot as few as 25 seats to the armed forces
and remove all of them in five years. The People's Consultative
Assembly includes all 500 members of Parliament and presidential
appointees.
	   ``The armed forces is too important to our politics to be
discarded,'' said Salim Said, a military expert who is a member of
the ruling Golkar party.
	   Students, intellectuals and even some retired military officers,
argue there can be no democracy unless all legislators are elected.
	   The military's dual role in the country's political and defense
affairs, a philosophy dubbed ``dwifungsi'' in Indonesian, is
constitutionally enshrined.
	   The armed forces has always cast itself as a foundation of
national stability in an ethnically diverse archipelago of 202
million people. Beset by an economic crisis, Indonesia is enduring
an especially fragile period in its history.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto, viewed as a possible presidential
candidate next year, on Friday seemed to be vying with student
protesters for the title of champion of democracy.
	   ``The soldiers will take stern action against whoever and
whatever party violates the law and constitution,'' he said,
warning of a crackdown on troublemakers.

Anwar plans legal challenge to his dismissal from government

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, the former
Malaysian deputy prime minister, said Friday he plans a legal
challenge to his ouster from the government.
	   The development is the latest twist in the showdown between
Anwar and his former patron, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``I have decided to contest Mahathir's decision to sack me as
deputy prime minister and finance minister,'' Anwar said in a
statement. ``I'm advised that the sacking isn't valid and goes
against the federal constitution.''
	   Anwar held both Cabinet posts at once, until he was fired 2 1/2
months ago.
	   However, Anwar also made it clear he doesn't want to serve again
under Mahathir's authoritarian leadership.
	   ``My move to challenge the decision isn't because I yearn to
return under Mahathir. He has lost his integrity, and is cruel and
corrupt,'' the statement said. It added the ouster showed
Mahathir's ``arrogance'' in allegedly trying to put himself above
the law.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, provided the statement to The
Associated Press.
	   Karpal Singh, one of Anwar's attorneys, said he planned to file
the challenge later Friday. He said King Tuanku Jaafar was informed
of the dismissal only after Anwar had been ousted, in violation of
Malaysian law.
	   Singh said the suit would also challenge Mahathir's decision to
take over the finance minister's post after Anwar was fired on
Sept. 2.
	   ``It will raise questions whether the prime minister's
appointment as finance minister is valid,'' Singh told reporters
outside the courthouse in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar was driven back to prison at lunchtime Friday, after his
trial on abuse of power and sexual misconduct allegations was
recessed until Nov. 23. He denies the charges against him and says
he's the victim of a political vendetta.

Girl, 11, set for boxing match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOLD COAST, Australia (AP) _ An 11-year-old girl is set to fight
in a boxing tournament which has been banned by one government and
condemned by medical authorities.
	   Zoe Norford, 11, has nominated for the girls under-13
championship of the breakaway Australian Amateur Boxing League next
week, an official said Friday.
	   ``There is nothing illegal about what we are doing,'' said AABL
secretary Dennis Magnay.
	   He admitted the organization was forced to move the tournament
from New South Wales state to neighboring Queensland because laws
against female boxing existed in the former.
	   He conceded that some people might be shocked by the idea of
young girls boxing at the Nov. 16-18 tournament.
	   ``I understand how it can be a shock to their systems because
it's something new but given a few years it will be absolutely
nothing,'' Magnay said. ``We make sure that they are well protected
_ that's the main thing.
	   ``They wear a head guard, a compulsory breast protector,
slightly softer gloves and box shorter rounds than the boys.''
	   Magnay said women boxers also had to undergo a pregnancy test
the day of their fights.
	   He said he was sure that in a few years, when people understood
more about women in boxing, it would become more accepted.
	   ``So many people are frightened about things they don't
understand,'' Magnay said.
	   The Australian Medical Association is opposed to all forms of
boxing but will campaign to ban all fighters under 18 years, a
spokeswoman said.
	   Previously the AMA's national president David Brand said young
boxers exhibited early evidence of brain damage in some studies,
despite not being able to punch as hard as older fighters.
	   ``The danger of boxing for young people was underscored by the
1987 death in the United Kingdom of a 15-year-old amateur boxer,
Joseph Sticklan, due to brain damage after his second fight,''
Brand said in a statement earlier this year.
	   ``We are also concerned that young people may not be capable of
making rational decisions about the dangers of boxing when choosing
a sport.''
	   The officially sanctioned Amateur Boxing Union of Australia does
not endorse female boxers.

Israeli warplanes attack guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Friday in the sixth such
attack in as many days, security officials said.
	   Two Israeli jets fired four missiles in two sorties at the
abandoned village of Aqmata in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a Hezbollah
stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave in
southern Lebanon, the officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the targeted area, some 12 kilometers
(seven miles) north of the southern market town of Nabatiyeh, the
Lebanese officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   There was no immediate word on casualties from the 6.30 a.m.
(4:30 GMT) air raid, the second on Aqmata in two days.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army confirmed Friday's air strike. An
army spokesman said warplanes attacked ``terrorist targets'' in
south Lebanon and returned safely to base after scoring ``accurate
hits.''
	   Israeli planes have raided suspected bases of the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah guerrilla group in southern Lebanon each day since
Sunday.
	   On Thursday, jets fired missiles at Aqmata and targets near
Zibqine, a village 35 kilometers (21 miles) southwest of Nabatiyeh.
No casualties were reported in the raid.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, leads a guerrilla war to oust 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the
occupied zone that Israel set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border
attacks.

South Korea: China pledges help on Korean peninsula
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-China-SKorea-APEC
 &UR; AP Photo BEJ101
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China pledged to help rivals North Korea and
South Korea resolve their differences and not support armed
provocations on the peninsula, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
said Friday.
	   Kim said Chinese President Jiang Zemin also agreed that a
Northeast Asia-wide security forum between their governments, North
Korea, Russia, Japan and the United States was worth looking into.
But the South Korean president added that such talks won't happen
soon.
	   In reviewing his 2 1-2 hour meeting Thursday with Jiang, Kim
counted the ``personal friendship'' the leaders developed as one of
the achievements of their summit. To solidify the ties, Kim invited
Jiang to visit South Korea and Jiang accepted.
	   On opposing sides of the 1950-53 Korean War, South Korea and
China have developed robust economic ties since formally setting up
diplomatic relations only six years ago. The two are each other's
No. 3 trading partners with dlrs 23.7 billion in trade last year.
	   Their close relations have complicated Northeast Asia's
security, with North Korea, once a close Chinese ally, increasingly
isolated, impoverished and unpredictable.
	   Making his first visit to China since becoming president in
February, Kim set out to broaden relations beyond commerce. He and
Jiang agreed to set up a ``cooperative partnership'' for the 21st
century.
	   Kim will also meet Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji and three other
senior Communist Party members Friday, his last day in Beijing
before touring Shanghai, China's financial capital.
	   A joint statement, released Friday, committed both sides to
working together to fight terrorism and drugs, halt environmental
degradation, remove impediments to business and resolve a trade
imbalance, dlrs 3.5 billion in Seoul's favor.
	   China's state-grain trading company, South Korea's National
Livestock Cooperative Federation and U.S. agribusiness giant
Cargill signed a contract in Beijing on Friday to deliver 89,500
metric tons of Chinese corn to South Korea.
	   Kim also said Seoul and Beijing agreed to step up
military-to-military consultations.
	   The joint statement also noted China's wish for a peaceful
reunification between North Korea and South Korea and both sides'
support for continuing the four-party talks that also include the
United States.
	   At a news conference, Kim said he and Jiang held broad-ranging
talks on North Korea. He cited as the chief accomplishment of his
trip a pledge by Jiang that ``China will further play a
constructive role for the peace and stability of the Korean
Peninsula.''
	   China would not support any armed provocations or conflicts on
the peninsula and backed South Korea's insistence that disputes be
resolved in direct talks between Seoul and Pyongyang, Kim told
reporters.
	   When asked his assessment of North Korea, Kim said the country
appeared to be making tentative steps to opening up its planned
economy and noted recent multimillion dollar ventures with South
Korea's Hyundai conglomerate.
	   ``While North and South Korean relations have these kinds of
good signs, there are also some things we do not want to see,''
said Kim. He cited incursions by North Korean submarines and the
late August launch of a rocket.
	   ``These kinds of incitements produce an extremely bad effect in
our country,'' Kim added.

Howard: Strong economy gives Australia greater say at summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australia will have greater clout at
this year's meeting of Pacific Rim leaders because its economy has
weathered the Asian economic storm, Prime Minister John Howard said
Friday.
	   Howard cited shrinking domestic unemployment figures, continued
growth, business investment and consumer confidence as reasons why
Australia will be more influential at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit in Kuala Lumpur next week.
	   ``All of these things speak of an economy that is going ahead
very, very powerfully,'' Howard said.
	   Australia's economy was ``obviously weathering the Asian storm
better than most thought, and our critics dare to imagine.''
	   ``That will give Australia a lot of strength and a lot of clout
and a lot of authority (at APEC)'' Howard said.
	   Australia would ``be trying very hard to keep APEC true to the
principles on which it was established and through the meeting to
send some kind of signal to the region that despite recent
difficulties, it ought to plow ahead,'' with trade liberalization,
Howard said.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the summit
on Tuesday and Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine
sectors covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, and fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Howard also said he expected to talk with U.S. President Bill
Clinton during the summit about the possibility of military strikes
against Iraq.
	   ``I have not personally spoken to President Clinton, but my
office has been in regular contact with the White House and I will
no doubt discuss the matter with him in Kuala Lumpur,'' he said.

Australia backs Thailand's deputy premier for world trade chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia announced Friday that it
will back Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy prime minister,
in the race to head the World Trade Organization.
	   Tim Fisher, Australia's deputy prime minister and trade
minister, made the announcement upon his arrival in Kuala Lumpur
for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ministerial meeting.
	   Fisher said that the role of director-general of the world's
trade watchdog would be ``crucial'' in the international response
to present global economic difficulties.
	   ``Supachai has already attracted a wide spectrum of support from
WTO members and I am confident he would make an outstanding
director-general,'' Fisher said.
	   Fisher said key WTO activities next year would be to prepare for
a ministerial meeting to decide the shape of further multilateral
trade talks, plus resumption of negotiations on agriculture and
services.
	   ``The new director-general will have Australia's full support in
moving these important issues forward,'' Fisher said.
	   Fisher said he would be using the APEC meeting during an
upcoming tour of Latin America to push Supachai's candidacy.
	   Supachai, 52, who is also commerce minister and a former
president of Thai Military Bank, has the backing of Southeast Asian
and some Scandinavian countries in his bid to succeed outgoing WTO
boss Renato Ruggiero, an Italian who will step down by April.
	   Supachai has said that dealing with the Asian economic crisis _
triggered last year when the previous Thai government was forced to
float the baht under pressure from currency speculation _ has
provided valuable experience for leading the WTO.
	   Supachai has said that the WTO boss should be dynamic and have a
thorough knowledge of boom and bust.
	   Also running are former Moroccan trade minister Hassan Abouyoub;
Michael Moore, former prime minister of New Zealand; and former
Canadian trade minister Roy Maclaren.
	   The contest will be decided by consensus rather than a vote and
the WTO general council hopes to confirm the appointment by the end
of this year.

Nigerian youths take oil workers hostage

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Armed youths stormed an offshore oil
exploration rig used by Texaco Inc. near southern Nigeria and took
seven foreigners and a Nigerian hostage, a Texaco official said.
	   The hostages included three Americans, a Briton, a South
African, an Italian and a Croatian along with the Nigerian oil
worker, said Paul Weeditz, a spokesman for the White Plains, New
York, company.
	   ``There were no injuries we know of and no damage to the rig,''
Weeditz said.
	   A Texaco official in Nigeria, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the hostages were taken at gunpoint Wednesday from
the drilling rig by a boatload of youths from the Ijaw ethnic group
and ferried ashore.
	   ``They were taken to an undisclosed location and are being held
until a ransom is paid,'' the official said. The official said the
youths were also demanding improved infrastructure facilities for
their communities in the poverty-ridden Niger River delta region.
	   U.S. Embassy officials in Lagos were unavailable for comment.
	   Oil companies are frequently the targets of protests and
occasionally hostage-takings as local communities vent their anger
over what they see as government and the oil company neglect for
their plight.
	   Although Nigeria is one of the world's largest oil producers,
the people who live in the oil-rich Niger delta often live in
poverty without electricity or running water.
	   The Shell oil company recently was forced to temporarily shut
down several oil pumping relay stations after armed youths stormed
the facilities and demanded compensation from the government.
	   Texaco says the workers taken on Wednesday were contract
employees working for other oil service companies hired to conduct
exploratory drilling in the region.
	   Belinda Doyle of Glenmora, Louisiana, said her husband, Robby, a
rig manager employed by Noble Drilling US Inc., was one of the
Americans taken hostage. Mrs. Doyle has been handling a stream of
calls by worried family and friends, and searching for hope.
	   ``The whole town knows about it because everybody's been praying
for us,'' she told the Alexandria (Louisiana) Town Talk newspaper.
``It's wonderful, the support, but I have my faith in God. He's
going to see us through this.''
	   Houston-based Noble Drilling declined comment.
	   Texaco's Weeditz said the company's Nigerian subsidiary, Texaco
Overseas Petroleum Co., was coordinating with local authorities and
the police.

Thai premier claims new signs of economic stability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai believes
that Thailand's economy has become more stable since he took office
a year ago, when the country was sinking into its worst recession
in decades.
	   But Chuan was wary, in talks with business reporters late
Thursday, of stating that the Thai economy had reached rock bottom
and was on an upturn.
	   Chuan, perceived as Thailand's most honest political leader, has
received mixed marks during his first year in office, but heads
into the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Malaysia next
week as a model student for sticking to austerity measures to
revive the economy.
	   Pundits credit him with generally succeeding in stabilizing an
economy in free-fall when he took power, and restoring Thailand's
image abroad. But they say he has failed to take a stern line on
corruption within his governing coalition and has left the poor to
suffer.
	   ``One year ago, it was a situation of uncertainties,'' Chuan
said. ``Currently, you can tell that the situation is changing for
the better.''
	   Chuan was appointed by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, the country's
constitutional monarch, as prime minister Nov. 9, 1997, replacing
former general Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who resigned under public
pressure for mismanagement of the economy.
	   Chuan noted that the Thai currency, or baht, has become more
stable now and has been recovering fastest among all regional
currencies hit by Asia's financial turmoils.
	   At the close of Asian spot trade Thursday, the U.S. dollar was
at 36.88, up from a low in January of 56.45 to the dollar. The baht
still is down 29 percent from its level when floated by Chavalit
last year after a failed defense against currency speculators.
	   Chuan said that domestic interest rates have also dropped
sharply in the past year. He said that overnight interbank rates
were at a high of 24 percent in December. The rate was at 3.5
percent to 4 percent Thursday.
	   Prime lending rates of Thai commercial banks have also been cut
by up to 4 percent from the beginning of this year. The rates of
major banks currently stand at 12 percent to 14 percent.
	   Chuan said that net foreign reserves have also climbed to a
current dlrs 17 billion from a low dlrs 5.3 billion at the time he
took office.
	   Thailand's exports have been growing in terms of volume despite
a decline in value in dollar terms.
	   Chuan said inflation for 1998 is likely to be lower than earlier
projected. He said 1998 inflation is now estimated at about 8
percent.
	   In addressing the same function, Finance Minister Tarrin
Nimmanahaeminda repeated earlier assertions that he expected the
economy to start recovering by the second quarter of 1999 and to
grow up to 1 percent next year.

Pacific trade talks adjourn without broad tariff deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with APEC senior officials failing to
achieve broad tariff cut package, U.S. blaming Japan for standoff
on tariff reductions. No pickup.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Senior officials from Pacific Rim
countries failed Friday to achieve the goal of a broad package of
tariff cuts aimed at expanding global trade, as various countries
led by Japan sought to carve out exceptions for politically
sensitive goods.
	   A frustrated U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky left
what she called an ``exceptionally blunt'' meeting with the
Japanese saying the United States was growing ``increasingly
impatient with Japan on this and a number of issues.''
	   The United States had hoped to achieve broad agreement on a
massive package of tariff cuts covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in traded
goods, ranging from chemicals to medical equipment, as a way of
demonstrating that during the current global financial crisis, the
Pacific Rim nations were not turning protectionist.
	   However, Japan, the world's second largest economy, argued that
it could not participate in two key sectors _ forestry products and
fish _ because Japanese producers were already struggling with the
country's worst recession in 50 years.
	   Other countries also pushed to exempt specific products or draw
out the deadlines for cutting tariffs, arguing that with much of
Asia in recession it would be politically difficult to sell faster
removal of border tariffs.
	   The senior officials ended up developing a scaled back package
which will be taken up by their bosses _ trade ministers and
foreign ministers of the APEC countries _ at meetings in Kuala
Lumpur on Saturday and Sunday.
	   Sumadi Brotodiningrat, an Indonesian official, said most of the
disagreement was on the degree of flexibility to allow, with some
countries willing to reduce or completely eliminate tariffs on 90
percent of a given sector and others holding out for cuts covering
only 50 percent.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is scheduled to leave
Washington on Saturday for the APEC leaders' meeting, and other
American officials have repeatedly said that the forum's 21 members
must move forward with tariff cuts to show nervous financial
markets that the Pacific region is not turning inward.
	   The impasse on trade issues cast a further cloud over an already
troubled APEC summit. With Clinton weighing the possibility of air
strikes against Iraq, his administration had been seriously
considering canceling the president's 10-day trip to Asia, which
will also include stops in Japan and South Korea.
	   The Clinton administration has been concerned about the
anti-free market positions taken by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, the host for the gathering, and his handling of
the firing and jailing of Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim as well.
	   Hoping to reduce pressure to eliminate trade barriers and
demonstrate that it is doing its part to pull Asia out of a deep
slump, Japan on Thursday unveiled a proposed 18 trillion yen (dlrs
148 billion) economic stimulus package.
	   U.S. officials were also working behind the scenes to line up
support for proposals to help debt-ridden banks and companies in
countries leveled by the flight of frightened foreign investors.
	   The United States also wants a bigger social safety net for
millions of people pushed back into poverty by the Asian crisis.
	   Malaysian government officials have made it clear that Mahathir
will use his prerogative as meeting chairman to push views directly
opposed to the free-market approach championed by the United States
and the International Monetary Fund.
	   In a speech Friday to an APEC trade fair, Mahathir called the
steps he has taken to insulate his economy from the global turmoil
the way to put Malaysia ``quickly on the path of recovery.''
	   He attacked international credit rating agencies, which have
downgraded Malaysia's credit rating, as ``negative and biased'' and
forecast that his economy, now in a deep recession, will resume
growth by next year.
	   This is the second APEC summit overshadowed by the Asian crisis,
which erupted in Thailand in 1997, and has since pushed several
Asian countries and Russia into steep nose dives. It also now
threatens Latin American nations.
	   In September, Mahathir, who has blamed foreign currency traders
for his country's economic problems, made it illegal to buy and
sell ringgits, the Malaysian currency, outside of the country. He
also imposed stiff controls on the withdrawal of foreign capital,
an attempt to stop panicked investors from leaving.
	   U.S. officials argue there is no alternative to the IMF formula
of austerity measures to fix flawed economies and restore investor
confidence.
	   At the same time, they have begun to stress the need to be
sensitive to the people and bankrupt companies harmed by economic
downturns. Already, 40 percent of the world is estimated to be in
recession.
	   The United States fears that unless some way is found to help
the victims of free-market turmoil that their suffering will
trigger growing social unrest and embolden other countries to
follow Malaysia's lead and close their economies to U.S.
corporations seeking investment opportunities.
	   The United States wants to tap dlrs 30 billion that Japan is
offering as aid to its Asian neighbors to pay for Washington's debt
restructuring proposals. That has prompted Japanese officials to
complain that the United States wants to put up the ideas and have
Japan put up the money.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join APEC at this summit.

Cambodian premiers accused of selling illegal timber
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ A British environmental group
accused Cambodia's co-premiers Friday of approving the export of
millions of dollars worth of illegally cut timber to Thailand.
	   Citing obtained copies of the timber deal, Global Witness said
co-premiers Hun Sen and Ung Huot and the army chief of staff, Gen.
Ke Kim Yan, authorized the military to sell 20,000 cubic meters
(26,000 cubic yards) of timber to a Thai company by shipping the
wood through Laos.
	   The deal fell through when Thai authorities refused to allow the
wood to cross the border into Thailand, Global Witness said in a
statement from London.
	   The documents described the timber as ``anarchically cut logs,''
a term used by the government to describe illegally felled trees.
	   The confiscation and sale of illegally cut logs by the
government is seen by environmentalists as a loophole allowing
corrupt army units and government officials to profit on the trade
despite restrictions on the amount of timber that is supposed to be
cut and exported.
	   Current forestry rules state that logs can only be extracted and
sold from a government-approved timber concession.
	   Global Witness blasted the leaders for authorizing the sale,
saying the deal quoted an extremely low price of dlrs 740,000 for
the wood and split the proceeds among the military, police and the
Agriculture Ministry's forestry department without authorization
from the Finance Ministry.
	   ``Even with the economic crisis these logs are worth between
dlrs 3 million and dlrs 10 million,'' Global Witness said.
	   ``The good news is that the cutting of trees ... for this deal
stopped as a direct result of the Thai border closure _ and for
that Thailand must be congratulated,'' the environmentalists said.
	   Global Witness said it had faxed copies of the deal to
Agriculture Minister Tao Seng Huor, who announced a crackdown on
illegal logging in October. Earlier directives issued by the
ministry have had little effect.
	   Tao Seng Huor said Friday that he was unaware of the deal and
had not seen the Global Witness statement and documents.
	   More than 70 percent of Cambodia's once-thick forest cover has
been lost to logging in recent years. Foreign donors have made
accountability over logging a condition of aid, but the trade
continues.
	   Cutting has reportedly picked up pace in current confusion over
who is running the country since disputed elections in July.

Lawyer will fight death sentence for Hong Kong crime boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Chinese death penalty handed down to a
reputed Hong Kong crime boss violates terms of Britain's handover
of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, according to a lawyer who said Friday
he will seek international help to spare his client's life.
	   ``I think they made a mistake,'' attorney Ivan Tang told Radio
Hong Kong, a day after a mainland Chinese court delivered verdicts
and sentences for Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' and 35
members of his gang.
	   Tang said he would appeal on grounds that the mainland had no
jurisdiction over Cheung's case since many of Cheung's alleged
crimes _ including kidnappings of two Hong Kong tycoons _ were
committed in Hong Kong.
	   Tang said the verdict was a violation of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration intended to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition to
Chinese rule, so he also will complain to British officials and
international rights groups.
	   Some say the case _ the first high-profile cross border trial
since the handover last year _ has set a dangerous precedent and
befuddled Hong Kong's legal experts and legislators.
	   Crimes committed in Hong Kong, where no death penalty is
imposed, can now be prosecuted in mainland China, where the death
penalty is widely used.
	   Many Hong Kong residents believe the end justified the means in
the Cheung case.
	   ``It's better to execute him in China rather than wasting the
Hong Kong government's time and money,'' housewife Chan Lee Kit-ho
was quoted as telling the South China Morning Post.
	   ``His family should pay the Chinese government for the bullets
to execute him,'' an import and export worker, Li Huamin, told the
Post.
	   The Chinese news agency Xinhua has reported that all proceedings
were appropriate under Chinese law, noting that many of the alleged
crimes were plotted in China and some were carried out there.
Cheung and his gang were all arrested in China, and half of the
defendants were mainland residents.
	   Because Hong Kong is now part of China, international agreements
on the transfer of criminal suspects do not cover such cross-border
crimes _ even though the outcome of cases can be vastly different
under the two legal systems.
	   ``This is what has fueled an ongoing controversy over
jurisdiction, which cannot easily be laid to rest given the many
gray areas in Hong Kong-mainland relations,'' the Hong Kong
Standard said in an editorial Friday.
	   Tang said that because neither evidence against Cheung nor
details of the court proceedings were made known in the territory,
Hong Kong residents could face the possibility of arbitrary arrest
and trial while in China.
	   ``My warning to Hong Kong people is: Be careful traveling on the
mainland,'' Tang was quoted as telling the Post.
	   Four of Cheung's henchmen were also given the death penalty,
while two more got death sentences that could later be converted to
prison terms if they show good behavior. The rest of the defendants
are going to prison, some for life.

Russian envoy released in Chechnya after six months as hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's envoy to Chechnya was released Friday
after being held hostage for more than six months in the breakaway
region, a news report said.
	   Valentin Vlasov, who was abducted in May after conducting
negotiations with Chechen officials, has been freed by Russia's
Interior Ministry, the Interfax news agency said.
	   No additional details on the circumstances of Vlasov's release
were immediately available.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in and around Chechnya
following its 1994-96 war with Russia, and dozens remain in
captivity. Vlasov was the most prominent of those who had been held
hostage.
	   Most of the kidnappings are carried out by criminal gangs
seeking ransom, and have no political motive. The Russian media
reported that Vlasov's kidnappers were seeking millions of dollars
in ransom.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said that Russia did not pay
any ransom for Vlasov's freedom, Interfax reported. Stepashin was
on hand to greet Vlasov when he arrived at a Moscow airport Friday.
	   Chechen officials have said that ransoms have been paid in some
cases, though the parties involved in the negotiations rarely if
ever provide details.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew in the fall of 1996, but Moscow still considers it a part
of Russia and no country has recognized its independence.

IMF, Brazil finalize dlrs 42 billion bailout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP ) _ The International Monetary Fund and Brazil
have wrapped up details of a long-expected dlrs 42 billion rescue
package designed to prevent the financial turmoil that has swept
Asia and Russia from reaching Latin America.
	   An IMF official said Thursday that he could not confirm the
exact amount of the bailout because details still were being worked
out.
	   ``This is not a done deal,'' said the spokesman, who spoke on
condition he not be identified. But he said dlrs 42 billion was
close to the total amount of the package needed by Latin America's
largest economy.
	   An announcement could come as early as Friday.
	   The IMF and the world's wealthy nations led by the United States
provided the package to Brazilian President Fernando Enrique
Cardoso to support his austerity plan of tax increases and spending
cuts aimed at saving dlrs 23.5 billion so he can avert a
devaluation of the country's currency, the real.
	   A devaluation could set off an economic meltdown in Latin
America and worsen turmoil in other world markets including the
United States, which contributed an estimated dlrs 5 billion to the
rescue plan.
	   For months, Brazil has been one of the most closely watched
patients on the emerging markets sick list. After Asia's financial
crisis last year and Russia's economic upheaval this summer
triggered late summer panic in global markets, the big fear among
international investors and bankers was that Brazil would be forced
to devalue.
	   Brazil's foreign exchange reserves have dropped from dlrs 65
billion to dlrs 47 billion as investors moved their money out. In
an attempt to stem the flow, Cardoso's government raised interest
rates to 50 percent.
	   To put the IMF-led bailout in effect, Cardoso had to win
re-election in early October, which he did, present an austerity
budget plan to parliament and then get wealthy nations to
participate in the financial plan.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India and Pakistan entered the last day
of a contentious round of peace talks Friday, discussing how to use
cultural ties to bring the two nations closer.
	   After five days of talks on issues ranging from water sharing to
military exchanges on a Himalayan glacier, New Delhi and Islamabad
had by Friday achieved little more than restating their positions
on the knotty disputes.
	   The two sides had accused each other on Thursday of supporting
terrorism.
	   Looming over the talks is the most sensitive issue between the
South Asian neighbors _ their rival claims to the Himalayan
province of Kashmir. The two countries have fought two of their
three wars over the territory.
	   Indian Culture Secretary R.V.V. Ayyar and his Pakistani
counterpart Syed Roshan Zamir opened discussions Friday at the
National Museum, an opulent British-era red sandstone building in
the heart of New Delhi.
	   The two officials were to discuss measures like releasing
fishermen from both countries routinely arrested for trespassing in
the other's waters, and starting a bus service between New Delhi
and the Pakistani city of Lahore.
	   On Wednesday, Pakistan released 151 Indian fishermen in a
gesture of goodwill. Some of the detained fishermen had been in
jail for two years, all charged with illegally fishing in Pakistani
waters.
	   Indian singers, dancers and artists are not allowed to perform
in Pakistan. Meanwhile, hard-line Indian politicians campaign
against visits from Pakistani performers and athletes.
	   An international squash tournament scheduled this year in
Bombay, India's industrial hub, had to be moved out of the country
to the Gulf state of Qatar after the rightist Shiv Sena party
threatened to attack Pakistani squash star Jansher Khan.
	   Cricket is extremely popular in India and Pakistan, and both
have top international teams. But the two countries have only
played each other in third countries the past few years, fearing
fans' emotions could turn violent at home.
	   There are plans for a Pakistani tour of India next year.

decision to cut all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. Since
then, the United States has sent more warships to the Gulf and
speculation about American airstrikes has deepened.
	   Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Thursday in Baghdad
that Annan was ``the best person in the world'' to solve the
crisis. ``It's his responsibility to do it,'' Aziz said.
	   But Annan, who cut short a trip through North Africa and
returned to New York on Thursday afternoon, put a damper on
speculation that he might make an 11th-hour mediation visit to
Baghdad.
	   ``I have no plans to go to Baghdad at the moment, but I need to
talk to the council members,'' Annan said.
	   Earlier, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the secretary-general
``does not at this time see a possible role for himself'' as
mediator in Baghdad. ``That's not to say he would not be available
if the council asked him to do something,'' Eckhard said.
	   However, even Iraq's usually sympathetic friends on the council
_ France, Russia and China _ haven't pushed for an Annan trip to
Baghdad.
	   The council and Annan's office has made clear that the onus is
on Iraq to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors charged
with eliminating Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The responsibility is not the secretary-general's, and not the
Security Council's at this point,'' U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter
Burleigh, the council president, said Thursday. ``What everyone is
waiting for is for the Iraqis to come back into compliance and
rescind their decisions.''
	   During the last Iraqi crisis in February, the secretary-general
flew to Baghdad and secured an agreement to allow unfettered
weapons inspections that averted U.S. and British airstrikes. Iraq,
however, has been reneging on its part of the bargain for months,
and on Oct. 31 it cut all dealings with the weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq wants a timetable for the lifting of crippling economic
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under the
cease-fire that ended the Persian Gulf War in 1991, sanctions
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that the
country has been disarmed.
	   Eckhard was asked under what conditions Annan might go to Iraq.
	   ``I think first he'd want an indication from the Iraqis that
they're prepared to return to full compliance, and he would want
the support of the council that they would like him to mediate,''
Eckhard responded.
	   He noted that at the moment, however, such signs just weren't
there.

Timlin gets dlrs 16 million from O's, Burks dlrs 10 million from
</HEADLINE>
San Francisco &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Boston tried to figure out the next step
following Mo Vaughn's departure. Meanwhile, AL East rival Baltimore
began retooling by agreeing to a dlrs 16 million, four-year
contract with Mike Timlin.
	   As baseball's offseason marketplace remained busy, Seattle
plugged a hole in its beleaguered pitching staff by agreeing to a
two-year contract Thursday with closer Jose Mesa.
	   Outfielder Ellis Burks decided to re-sign with the San Francisco
Giants, getting a dlrs 10 million, two-year deal. And pitcher
Masato Yoshii, who had the option of becoming a free agent,
accepted a dlrs 5 million, two-year contract to stay with the New
York Mets.
	   Meanwhile, Cleveland was said to have made an offer to second
baseman Roberto Alomar, and San Diego was negotiating to retain
third baseman Ken Caminiti. The Padres also were trying to deal
reliever Randy Myers.
	   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette left the general managers'
meetings in Naples, Florida, to pursue other free agents, team
spokesman Kevin Shea said. After Vaughn rejected a dlrs 62.5
million, five-year offer that Boston said was its final proposal,
Duquette mentioned outfielders Albert Belle and Bernie Williams,
third basemen Robin Ventura and Ken Caminiti and first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro as players of interest.
	   ``The Red Sox are a team that Robin would want to play for,''
John Boggs, Ventura's agent, said Thursday. ``They're very close to
winning.''
	   Vaughn has been offered a dlrs 72 million, six-year contract by
the Anaheim Angels, but isn't close to deciding where he wants to
play.
	   Baltimore, after finishing with the highest payroll in baseball
and a losing record, didn't waste much time in starting to rebuild.
	   Timlin, who excelled after taking over the closer's job in
Seattle for the second half of the season, pitched in a career-high
70 games for the Mariners. The 32-year-old right-hander was 3-3
with a team-high 19 saves and 2.95 ERA.
	   ``This is the first of what we hope are many moves to improve
our ballclub,'' said Frank Wren, the Orioles' new general manager.
``It was very apparent that one of our primary needs was to get a
closer.''
	   The Orioles were a disappointing 79-83 last season and finished
fourth in the AL East, 35 games behind New York. Armando Benitez
was inconsistent as the closer, going 5-6 with 22 saves and a 3.82
ERA.
	   Timlin made dlrs 3,025,000 in 1998. With the Orioles, he gets a
dlrs 1 million signing bonus, a dlrs 2 million salary in 1999, dlrs
4 million each in 2000 and 2001 and dlrs 5 million in 2002.
	   Mesa, traded from Cleveland to San Francisco in July, takes over
as Seattle's closer. He was 3-4 with one save and a 5.17 ERA in 44
games as Mike Jackson's setup man in Cleveland, then went 5-3 with
a 3.52 ERA in 32 games with the Giants.
	   Burks, a 34-year-old outfielder, was acquired by San Francisco
from Colorado on July 31 for Darryl Hamilton. The two-time All-Star
hit .292 with 21 homers and 76 RBIs this season. With the Giants,
he batted .306 with five homers and 22 RBIs.
	   Coming off a dlrs 9.1 million, two-year contract, Burks gets
dlrs 4.5 million next season and dlrs 5.5 million in 2000.
	   ``Today's signing of Ellis Burks has significantly improved our
run-producing capabilities,'' Giants general manager Brian Sabean
said. ``As we all witnessed late last season, Ellis really changes
the look of our lineup.''
	   Yoshii, a 33-year-old right-hander, joined the Mets last January
following a successful career in Japan. He went 6-8 with a 3.93 ERA
in 29 starts.
	   ``Masato deserves a lot of credit,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``He easily could have stayed in Japan last season
and made more money, but he was determined to prove himself in the
United States. He did just that and more.''
	   Yoshii had a dlrs 200,000 base salary with the Mets this year,
but earned dlrs 875,000 more in performance bonuses to increase his
earnings to dlrs 1,075,000. His new deal calls for salaries of dlrs
2 million next year and dlrs 3 million in 2000.
	   ``I really enjoyed myself with the Mets last year,'' Yoshii said
in a statement. ``Bobby understands me and the type of pitcher I
am. I think I proved I can pitch in the major leagues last season,
and it is my goal this year to improve and help the Mets get to the
playoffs.''

Pacific trade talks adjourn without broad tariff deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 9 grafs with Japanese official saying Barshefsky
angered by impasse &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Senior officials from Pacific Rim
countries failed Friday to achieve the goal of a broad package of
tariff cuts aimed at expanding global trade, as various countries
led by Japan sought to carve out exceptions for politically
sensitive goods.
	   A frustrated U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky left
what she called an ``exceptionally blunt'' meeting with the
Japanese saying the United States was growing ``increasingly
impatient with Japan on this and a number of issues.''
	   A senior Japanese official, briefing reporters on the talks,
quoted Barshefsky as saying, ``Clinton and I feel a strong sense of
indignation that Japan is not going along with the agreement''
reached last year at the summit of leaders of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit in Vancouver, Canada, to lower trade
barriers in nine areas.
	   The United States had hoped to achieve broad agreement on a
massive package of tariff cuts covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in traded
goods, ranging from chemicals to medical equipment, as a way of
demonstrating that during the current global financial crisis, the
Pacific Rim nations were not turning protectionist.
	   However, Japan, the world's second largest economy, argued that
it could not participate in two key sectors _ forestry products and
fish _ because Japanese producers were already struggling with the
country's worst recession in 50 years.
	   Other countries also pushed to exempt specific products or draw
out the deadlines for cutting tariffs, arguing that with much of
Asia in recession it would be politically difficult to sell faster
removal of border tariffs.
	   The senior officials ended up developing a scaled back package
which will be taken up by their bosses _ trade ministers and
foreign ministers of the APEC countries _ at meetings in Kuala
Lumpur on Saturday and Sunday.
	   The Japanese official, who spoke to reporters on condition of
anonymity, said that Barshefsky at points became so irritated she
beat her pen against a pad and looked like she ``wanted to pound a
table.''
	   ``She berated Japan for not taking a leadership role in Asia,''
the official said, speaking in Japanese. ``She also accused Japan
of trying to export its way out of its economic problems.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is scheduled to leave
Washington on Saturday for the APEC leaders' meeting, and other
American officials have repeatedly said that the forum's 21 members
must move forward with tariff cuts to show nervous financial
markets that the Pacific region is not turning inward.
	   The impasse on trade issues cast a further cloud over an already
troubled APEC summit. With Clinton weighing the possibility of air
strikes against Iraq, his administration had been seriously
considering canceling the president's 10-day trip to Asia, which
will also include stops in Japan and South Korea.
	   The Clinton administration has been concerned about the
anti-free market positions taken by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, the host for the gathering, and his handling of
the firing and jailing of Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim as well.
	   Hoping to reduce pressure to eliminate trade barriers and
demonstrate that it is doing its part to pull Asia out of a deep
slump, Japan on Thursday unveiled a proposed 18 trillion yen (dlrs
148 billion) economic stimulus package.
	   U.S. officials were also working behind the scenes to line up
support for proposals to help debt-ridden banks and companies in
countries leveled by the flight of frightened foreign investors.
	   The United States also wants a bigger social safety net for
millions of people pushed back into poverty by the Asian crisis.
	   Malaysian government officials have made it clear that Mahathir
will use his prerogative as meeting chairman to push views directly
opposed to the free-market approach championed by the United States
and the International Monetary Fund.
	   In a speech Friday to an APEC trade fair, Mahathir called the
steps he has taken to insulate his economy from the global turmoil
the way to put Malaysia ``quickly on the path of recovery.''
	   He attacked international credit rating agencies, which have
downgraded Malaysia's credit rating, as ``negative and biased'' and
forecast that his economy, now in a deep recession, will resume
growth by next year.
	   This is the second APEC summit overshadowed by the Asian crisis,
which erupted in Thailand in 1997, and has since pushed several
Asian countries and Russia into steep nose dives. It also now
threatens Latin American nations.
	   In September, Mahathir, who has blamed foreign currency traders
for his country's economic problems, made it illegal to buy and
sell ringgits, the Malaysian currency, outside of the country. He
also imposed stiff controls on the withdrawal of foreign capital,
an attempt to stop panicked investors from leaving.
	   U.S. officials argue there is no alternative to the IMF formula
of austerity measures to fix flawed economies and restore investor
confidence.
	   At the same time, they have begun to stress the need to be
sensitive to the people and bankrupt companies harmed by economic
downturns. Already, 40 percent of the world is estimated to be in
recession.
	   The United States fears that unless some way is found to help
the victims of free-market turmoil that their suffering will
trigger growing social unrest and embolden other countries to
follow Malaysia's lead and close their economies to U.S.
corporations seeking investment opportunities.
	   The United States wants to tap dlrs 30 billion that Japan is
offering as aid to its Asian neighbors to pay for Washington's debt
restructuring proposals. That has prompted Japanese officials to
complain that the United States wants to put up the ideas and have
Japan put up the money.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join APEC at this summit.

Indonesian capital braces for more protests after two die

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Students gathered for more
anti-government protests on Friday, despite warnings from the
powerful military and news that two people had died following
earlier clashes.
	   A high school student and a police officer died in hospitals
after 20,000 students attempted to march on Parliament but were
blocked by security personnel Thursday.
	   Troops and police dispersed the crowds with baton charges, tear
gas, rubber bullets and water cannons.
	   More than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious
injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested that people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
Thursday's protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt
to forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Some 1,000 student protesters on Friday blocked the runway and
airplane parking lots at the airport in Ujungpandang, the capital
of South Sulawesi province, the privately-owned SCTV television
station reported.
	   Airport authorities canceled at least six flights because of the
demonstration.
	   In Jakarta, student leaders said bigger protests would be staged
on Friday. Hundreds of students were seen gathering at several
Jakarta college campuses in the morning.
	   There was no immediate sign of trouble, although many stores,
offices and schools were closed.
	   Thursday night's violence was the worst outbreak of unrest in
Jakarta since riots forced Indonesia's former President Suharto to
quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new political
system for the world's fourth most-populous nation.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Edward Aritonang said no arrests were
made on Thursday.

Anwar plans legal challenge to his dismissal from government

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim, the former
Malaysian deputy prime minister, said Friday he plans a legal
challenge to his ouster from the government.
	   It's the latest twist in the showdown between Anwar and his
former patron, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar's trial on abuse of power and sexual misconduct charges
was recessed until after next week's summit of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation group in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Malaysian officials want to prevent the Anwar case from becoming
a sideshow to the summit. However, several high-ranking officials,
including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, are expected
to meet with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   ``I have decided to contest Mahathir's decision to sack me as
deputy prime minister and finance minister,'' Anwar said in a
statement. ``I'm advised that the sacking isn't valid and goes
against the federal constitution.''
	   Anwar held both Cabinet posts at once, until he was fired 2 1/2
months ago.
	   However, Anwar also made it clear he doesn't want to serve again
under Mahathir's authoritarian leadership.
	   ``My move to challenge the decision isn't because I yearn to
return under Mahathir. He has lost his integrity, and is cruel and
corrupt,'' the statement said. It alleged the ouster showed
Mahathir's ``arrogance'' in trying to put himself above the law.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah, provided the statement to The Associated
Press.
	   Karpal Singh, one of Anwar's attorneys, said he planned to file
the challenge later Friday. He said King Tuanku Jaafar was informed
of the dimissal only after Anwar had been ousted, in violation of
Malaysian law.
	   Singh said the suit would also challenge Mahathir's decision to
take over the finance minister's post after Anwar was fired on
Sept. 2.
	   ``It will raise questions whether the prime minister's
appointment as finance minister is valid,'' Singh told reporters
outside the courthouse in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar was driven back to prison at lunchtime Friday, after his
trial on abuse of power and sexual misconduct allegations was
recessed until Nov. 23. He denies the charges against him and says
he's the victim of a political vendetta.
	   Before the trial recessed, assistant police commissioner Mazlan
Mohamed Din said he was wrong in forcing two key witnesses to
retract allegations of sexual misconduct against Anwar.
	   ``It was wrong and improper to do so,'' Mazlan said. ``I wasn't
thinking about whether what I was doing was right.''
	   Defense attorney Gurbachan Singh asked Mazlan: ``Do you agree
it's wrong and improper to force a person to tell a lie?''
	   ``Yes,'' Mazlan responded.
	   The prosecution says Anwar ordered police to obtain the
retractions, as part of a cover-up.

Dollar lower against yen in Tokyo, Japanese stocks rise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar declined against the yen Friday on
concern American interest rates may fall further after recent cuts.
Tokyo stocks rose.
	   The dollar bought 121.24 yen at midday, down 1.98 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 121.98
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 193.15
points, or 1.37 percent, to close at 14,268.21. On Thursday, the
average closed down 352.96 points, or 2.45 percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar's downward move came
after the currency rose as high as 124.08 yen in New York on
Thursday _ its highest level since Oct. 7 _ as investors sought
safer assets while U.S. military forces moved closer to Iraq.
	   But the greenback quickly lost ground in Tokyo trading amid
lingering nervousness the U.S. Federal Reserve might cut interest
rates as soon as Tuesday, the next scheduled meeting of its Open
Market Committee.
	   ``It's hard to say whether the Fed will act now, but they will
act sometime,'' said Takeo Suzuki, assistant foreign exchange
manager at Nomura Trust and Banking.
	   Lower rates tend to make interest rate sensitive securities such
as government bonds less attractive to overseas investors, which
can reduce demand for a country's currency.
	   Traders said, however, that the dollar's drop may be short-lived
due to continued speculation the United States may strike Iraq over
its rejection of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We don't really want to go too short on dollars given the Iraq
issue,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank
Ltd. ``But I think dollar buying by Japanese commercial players may
have run its course for the day.''
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market posted a gain in light
trading after having dipped into negative territory earlier in the
day. Traders attributed the uneven trading to uncertainty about a
government stimulus package due out on Monday.
	   ``It's hard for investors to change their positions before they
see the contents of the government's economic package on Monday,''
said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor information group at
Kankaku Securities Co.
	   The package was expected to meet or exceed a set of proposals
issued Thursday by the ruling party which called for a record 18
trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in spending on public works
projects and tax cuts.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section picked up 10.59 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,093.52. The
TOPIX closed down 15.19 points, or 1.38 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.815 from Thursday's 0.820 percent, pushing its price
up to 108.75 yen from 108.71 yen the previous day.

Economic crisis key test for APEC, South Korean president says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With China-SKorea

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Coming up with plans to battle the Asia's
financial crisis is a crucial test for a summit of Pacific Rim
leaders next week, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said Friday.
	   A failure to deliver at the summit in Malaysia could call into
question the role of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
and its annual meetings, Kim said at a news conference midway
through a five-day China visit.
	   ``This is a measurement of APEC's existence,'' Kim said. ``I
expect this summit will focus on whether APEC is just an
organization to discuss things, or rather an organization with
strong supportive and executive power.''
	   Kim noted that APEC has been divided between developed countries
who stress trade and investment liberalization and developing
countries who want more access to technology and scientific
know-how.
	   To overcome the financial crisis, Kim said developed countries
need to provide more aid and greater market access. At the same
time, developing countries need to push ahead with economic
reforms, he said.
	   After visiting Shanghai, Kim will head to Kuala Lumpur on Sunday
to take part in the APEC summit.
	   In addition to economic matters, Kim said while at APEC his
aides would also take up with the Russians a possible visit to
Moscow next year.

Russia-Japanese summit to focus on money issues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Talks between the Russian and Japanese prime
ministers were expected to jump to the bottom line Friday: When can
Japan hand over an dlrs 800 million installment on a loan it
promised last summer?
	   On the second day of his Moscow summit, Keizo Obuchi of Japan
was meeting his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny Primakov, for talks
that were expected to focus on the nuts and bolts _ or, more
accurately, rubles and yen _ of the two countries' relations.
	   The day before, Japanese Premier Keizo Obuchi and Russian
President Boris Yeltsin ``exchanged views from broad and lofty
perspectives,'' as Obuchi's spokesman put it. The two made
incremental progress toward solving a dispute over the Kuril
Islands that has kept the two countries from signing a peace treaty
to formally end World War II.
	   Japanese spokesman Sadaaki Numata observed that it was ``not the
sort of discussion that might take place between bankers.''
	   That sort of talk was reserved for Friday's meeting between
Obuchi and Primakov.
	   While the subject of the disputed islands was likely to come up,
the main focus of the two premiers' discussions was expected to be
the timing and logistics of Japan's loan, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
	   The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer. Both the
IMF and the World Bank put their loans on hold after Russia
effectively defaulted on foreign loans at the outset of its
economic crisis in August.
	   In addition to agreeing to free up the loan, Obuchi has offered
to give Russia dlrs 100 million to promote economic development on
the Kuril islands, dlrs 10 million to medical assistance and dlrs
20 million to support youth exchange programs.
	   The two prime ministers were expected to sign a spate of
agreements, including one on guarantees of capital investments that
is expected to pave the way for large-scale Japanese investment in
Russia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   They also were expected to sign memorandums on cooperation in
tourism, transport, mail and telecommunications, as well as support
for Russia's small- and medium-size companies.
	   Also, the premiers were expected to release a declaration that
sums up the progress so far in resolving the Kuril dispute.
	   Tokyo claimed title to the islands _ Etorofu, Kunashiri,
Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty with Russia in 1875.
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War
II, a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 poor and restive Russian
residents, many of whom would welcome Japanese administration. The
Kurils are important to both countries for symbolic reasons and
because they are surrounded by prime fishing waters.

Healy holds up England charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ England's bowlers made a strong start
to the final tour match ahead of the five-test Ashes series against
Australia but were held up by old rival Ian Healy on Friday.
	   Healy, the world record holder as a wicketkeeper, once again
demonstrated his fighting qualities with the bat. He scored 57 as
Queensland struggled to stumps at 193 for eight on the first day of
the four-day game.
	   England, still seeking a win in a first-class match on tour
after two draws, bowled impressively in helpful conditions and was
denied an even better start by a 90-run stand between captain Healy
and Geoff Foley.
	   Foley remained on 64 at stumps with Queensland virtually nine
down after the loss of opener Matthew Hayden.
	   The former test player suffered a broken finger when England
paceman Darren Gough got one to rear off a length from the second
ball of the match. Hayden is not expected to take any further part
in the game.
	   Gough took 2-37 off 16 overs while spinner Robert Croft claimed
three wickets, including Healy's, down the order. Dean Headley,
Alan Mullally and Dominic Cork each claimed a wicket.
	   The opening test will start in Brisbane on Nov. 20.

Singapore employers endorse proposal slashing wages and pensions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore companies have endorsed
recommendations from a government-linked council to cut business
costs by slashing workers' total income by 15 percent, news reports
said Friday.
	   ``At this point in time, a 15 percent cut in wage costs is
enough and appropriate,'' Singapore National Employers Federation
president Stephen Lee was quoted as saying in The Straits Times.
	   On Thursday, the government-dominated National Wages Council _ a
tripartite body that also represents businesses and unions _ urged
a 5 percent to 8 percent cut in wages this year compared to 1997,
and a reduction in employer contributions to the mandatory
state-run pension fund from 20 percent of a worker's salary to 10
percent.
	   The total cuts equal about 15 percent of most worker's total
income, and are seen as the most direct way to help ailing
businesses in recession-hit Singapore.
	   While the Ministry of Manpower said Friday the government is
studying the recommendations, observers expect the measures will be
fully adopted when Parliament meets later this month.
	   The employers federation, which is one of Singapore's most
influential business organizations, called on all companies to
``make a concerted effort to reduce wage costs'' in line with the
council's suggestions, according to Lee.
	   The federation also agreed with the council's advice that
higher-income employees, especially those in management, accept
greater wage cuts than their lower-earning employees, said The
Straits Times.
	   The business group argued that the pension fund reduction, which
is the main component of the entire labor cost cutting package,
should be revoked only once Singapore returns to healthy economic
growth, reported The Business Times.
	   Echoing warnings from various government leaders, Lee said
Singapore should prepare for slower expansion once the recession
has ended.
	   ``I envisage at most 4 to 7 percent growth,'' Lee was quoted as
saying in The Business Times.
	   Since independence in 1965, Singapore has averaged robust 8.9
percent annual economic growth.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ It was meant to be the moment of
glory before he retired: a proud host standing among the most
powerful leaders of the world, showing off the modern Southeast
Asian democracy he has led for 17 years.
	   But Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, will go into the summit
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum with his grip
weakened by a political challenge and his image tarnished by
allegations of political intolerance.
	   Several of Mahathir's guests, including President Bill Clinton,
plan to snub him during the summit Tuesday and Wednesday because he
fired and imprisoned his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will seek a meeting
with Anwar's wife. In addition, Clinton and other U.S. officials
will shun all private contact with Malaysian officials outside of
the meeting.
	   Mahathir's credibility has been battered and attention has
focused on Malaysia's human rights record and its intolerance of
dissent.
	   ``Mahathir will try to use APEC to show that he is in control of
the situation, that he is not an authoritarian leader on his last
legs,'' said Bruce Gale, an analyst in the Singapore-based
Political and Risk Consultancy.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired Sept. 2 and arrested by armed police 18
days later. He is on trial for 10 counts of corruption and illegal
sex acts, charges he says are politically motivated.
	   Mahathir points out that the ruling United Malays National
Organization stood behind his decision to fire Anwar by expelling
him from the powerful party, which has dominated Malaysian politics
since independence from Britain in 1957.
	   ``Mahathir is certainly in control. But if a leader resorts to
the power of coercion, it illustrates his fear and not his
strength,'' said Abdul Razak Baginda, executive director of the
Malaysian Institute of Strategic Research.
	   Mahathir said Thursday he expects Anwar supporters to try to
humiliate him during the summit.
	   ``I'm sure they'll want to demonstrate to show how unstable
Malaysia is,'' he said with customary sarcasm. ``For them, it's a
political issue. They want to make the most of this.''
	   Most Malaysians still unhesitatingly credit Mahathir for the
remarkable progress the country has made since he took over as the
fourth prime minister in 1981.
	   ``It is entirely possible that there is a kind of generation gap
... but I feel that, if I am given a chance, they are willing to
listen, I can convince them,'' Mahathir, a
doctor-turned-politician, recently told visiting American physician
John N. Simons.
	   Few, however, are as prepared to ignore his high-handed methods
as they did when the economy was growing and a middle-class
enriched itself with large homes and more cars.
	   The high-growth strategy produced the world's tallest building,
but dlrs 157 billion has been lost in market capitalization since
the Asian turmoil.
	   All this has turned Mahathir into a reluctant free trader.
	   Many have chided Malaysia for imposing selective capital
controls and fixing the rate of the country's currency, the
ringgit, instead of allowing the markets to determine it.
	   Mahathir has said that was needed to insulate the economy from
marauding currency traders, a group he blames for triggering the
economic slowdown. But for the Asian crisis, Malaysia would have
caught up with the industrialized West by 2020, he has said.
	   But all the troubles have not dampened Mahathir's style or his
rhetoric. He has remained a hands-on leader, following a ``do-it
yourself'' philosophy of the kind advocated by Popular Mechanics
magazine, which he reads avidly.
	   ``In my dealings with politics, with the administration of the
nation, I use the same method,'' Mahathir told Simons. ``I reach a
diagnosis, through a process of examining the history and the
physical signs and symptoms, and once I have done that, I prescribe
what I feel is right for the country.''

Lawyer will fight death sentence for Hong Kong crime boss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: LEADS with comments from Hong Kong legislator; CORRECTS name

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The Chinese death penalty handed down to a
reputed Hong Kong crime boss violates terms of Britain's handover
of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, according to a lawyer who said Friday
he will seek international help to spare his client's life.
	   ``I think they made a mistake,'' attorney Ivan Tang told Radio
Hong Kong, a day after a mainland Chinese court delivered verdicts
and sentences for Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' and 35
members of his gang.
	   Tang said he would appeal on grounds that the mainland had no
jurisdiction over Cheung's case since many of Cheung's alleged
crimes _ including kidnappings of two Hong Kong tycoons _ were
committed in Hong Kong.
	   Tang said the verdict was a violation of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration intended to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition to
Chinese rule, so he also will complain to British officials and
international rights groups.
	   Some say the case _ the first high-profile cross border trial
since the handover last year _ has set a dangerous precedent and
befuddled Hong Kong's legal experts and legislators.
	   Crimes committed in Hong Kong, where no death penalty is
imposed, can now be prosecuted in mainland China, where the death
penalty is widely used.
	   But many Hong Kong residents believe the end justified the means
in the Cheung case, which was tried in Guangzhou, 100 miles (160
kms) north of the border.
	   ``It's better to execute him in China rather than wasting the
Hong Kong government's time and money,'' housewife Chan Lee Kit-ho
was quoted as telling the South China Morning Post.
	   ``His family should pay the Chinese government for the bullets
to execute him,'' an import and export worker, Li Huamin, was
quoted as telling the Post.
	   The official Chinese news agency Xinhua has reported that all
proceedings were appropriate under Chinese law, noting that many of
the alleged crimes were plotted in China and some were carried out
there. Cheung and his gang were all arrested in China, and half of
the defendants were mainland residents.
	   Because Hong Kong is now part of China, international agreements
on the transfer of criminal suspects do not cover such cross-border
crimes _ even though the outcome of cases can been vastly different
under the two legal systems.
	   Legislator James Toh of the major opposition Democratic Party
said Friday the court's verdict did not reflect the Basic Law _
Hong Kong's post-handover constititution approved by China and
Britain.
	   Toh predicted the verdicts would lower people's confidence in
Hong Kong's independent legal system.
	   Tang said that because neither evidence against Cheung nor
details of the court proceedings were made known in the territory,
Hong Kong residents could face the possibility of arbitrary arrest
and trial while in China.

	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party dropped insistence on
having a joint chairmanship of the assembly shared by Ranariddh and
party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker. It was one of the main
stumbling blocks in months of discord.
	   Instead, Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modified
to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head. As Senate leader,
Chea Sim will still serve as acting head of state during the king's
frequent absences from the country.
	   ``The major political crisis in the country has been resolved
and the political deadlock facing the nation has also come to an
end,'' the king said in his statement.
	   The agreement came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's
return Thursday from Thailand, where he had been holed up with
other opposition figures for several weeks amid fears for their
safety if they stayed in Cambodia.
	   The deal should allow the rapid formation of a new government
that would make it possible for international donors and businesses
to again operate within the poverty-stricken country, which is in
desperate need of aid.
	   ``There will be an amendment over one section in the
constitution in order to allow the Kingdom of Cambodia to have a
Senate, along with the National Assembly, as practiced by other
liberal democratic countries in the world,'' Sihanouk said.

Stung by sour reception of economic package, Japan mulls sweetening
</HEADLINE>
deal
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Just one day after Japan's ruling party announced
plans for the nation's biggest ever economic recovery package,
speculation mounted Friday the government will sweeten the deal
with even more stimulus steps.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party unveiled a set of proposals
Thursday calling for a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in
spending on public works projects and tax cuts to put Japan back on
track for recovery.
	   But the plan failed to impress with many private economists and
stock market investors who say it will not provide the jolt needed
to resuscitate the world's second-largest economy.
	   ``It's not enough to prevent a significant contraction in GDP
next year,'' said Jeffrey Young, an economist in the Tokyo office
of Salomon Smith Barney.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government will release an
official stimulus package on Monday based largely on the ruling
party's plan. Yet the government will reportedly up the ante
considerably.
	   Most government officials kept quiet on the matter Friday.
	   Questioned by reporters about the size of the package, Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa would say only that ``It will be rather
big.''
	   But Taichi Sakaiya, the outspoken director general of Japan's
Economic Planning Agency, hinted vaguely that the official plan
might include something extra to sate the demand for more stimulus.
	   ``I hope there will be a surprise,'' he told reporters without
elaborating.
	   Leading financial newspaper Nihon Keizai reported the official
package, which is likely to be passed in a special session of
Parliament convening Nov. 27, will exceed 20 trillion yen (dlrs 165
billion).
	   The Asahi newspaper said the plan would total 22 trillion yen
(dlrs 181 billion) _ an amount roughly equal to the size of the
entire economy of Austria.
	   Primer Minister Obuchi, facing growing pressure both at home and
abroad, sees the package as his best change to stop the economy
from contracting for a third consecutive year _ a key pledge made
after taking office in July.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton will likely urge Obuchi to kick
start the Japanese economy at a summit meeting this weekend in
Malaysia of leaders from members of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   Speculation the package will include more aggressive stimulus
measures bolstered Japanese stock prices on Friday, sparking a 1.37
percent gain in the benchmark index. That came after Thursday's
2.45 percent slide on disappointment with the ruling party's
economic policy proposals.
	   One wild card cited by investors involves a possible reduction
or suspension of an unpopular national sales tax instituted in
1993.
	   The government's decision to raise the consumption tax from 3
percent to 5 percent in 1997 was widely blamed for choking off a
growth spurt and tipping the economy back into recession.
	   ``A cut in the sales tax, even if only temporary, will have a
big impact on spending,'' said Setsuo Nagao, a manager in the
equity division at Tokyo Securities Co.

Indonesian capital braces for more protests after two die

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of students hit the streets
for more anti-government protests on Friday, despite warnings from
the powerful military and two deaths from clashes the night before.
	   Students left at least three campuses in Jakarta. Some said they
would attempt to march on Parliament where a special government
assembly was putting the final touches to a new political blueprint
for the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   A high school student and a police officer died in hospitals
after 20,000 students were blocked by security personnel from
reaching Parliament on Thursday.
	   Troops and police dispersed the crowds with baton charges, tear
gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. More than 100 students were
hospitalized, some with serious injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested that people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
Thursday's protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt
to forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   Some 1,000 student protesters on Friday blocked the runway and
airplane parking lots at the airport in Ujungpandang, the capital
of South Sulawesi province, the privately-owned SCTV television
station reported.
	   Airport authorities canceled at least six flights because of the
demonstration.
	   At the University of Indonesia about 1,500 students gathered but
were split on whether to march again on Parliament or to protest on
campus.
	   ``If we go out there will be more victims and only the military
will benefit,'' said one student who failed to convince others not
to march.
	   There was no immediate sign of trouble, although many stores,
offices and schools were closed.
	   Thursday night's violence was the worst outbreak of unrest in
Jakarta since riots forced Indonesia's former President Suharto to
quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new political
system as Indonesia battles with it worst economic crisis in
decades. Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation
into past corruption.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Edward Aritonang said no arrests were
made on Thursday.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya was
released Friday after being held hostage for more than six months
in the breakaway southern region.
	   Valentin Vlasov, who was abducted in May after conducting
negotiations with Chechen officials, has been freed by Russia's
Interior Ministry, Russian news reports said.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin, who greeted Vlasov at a
Moscow airport early Friday, said no ransom was paid.
	   Chechen officials immediately countered that claim, saying that
Russian officials paid for Vlasov's release.
	   ``By doing that, they once again financed the Chechen criminal
groups,'' Nasrudi Bazhiyev, Chechnya's deputy security minister,
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Russia's Interior Ministry, which announced Vlasov's release in
a terse statement, said he was freed in a multi-stage rescue
operation, but gave no further details.
	   Ruslan Yeshugayev, the chief of the ministry's anti-organized
crime squad in the region, said Vlasov was brought from Chechnya to
neighboring region of Inghushetia early Friday and then flown to
Moscow, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Yeshugayev said Vlasov's condition was satisfactory but he
looked haggard.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in and around Chechnya
following its 1994-96 war with Russia, and dozens remain in
captivity. Vlasov was the most prominent of those who had been held
hostage.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said that an
estimated 150 people were still being held in captivity in
Chechnya.
	   Most of the kidnappings are carried out by criminal gangs
seeking ransom, and have no political motive. The Russian media
reported that Vlasov's kidnappers were seeking millions of dollars.
	   Chechen officials have said that ransoms have been paid in some
cases, though the parties involved in the negotiations rarely, if
ever, provide details.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew in the fall of 1996, but Moscow still considers it a part
of Russia and no country has recognized its independence.

PHNOM PENH: Sihanouk said.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Earlier, as both sides arrived at his palace for a second day of
meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form a
coalition and made ``important concessions'' to break the deadlock.
	   The king, the sole force in Cambodian politics able to broker a
deal, pressured both sides to reach agreement before he leaves
Saturday for medical treatment in Beijing.
	   Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to a request
by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political
pardons.
	   All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that are
widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has powers to grant
pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically
sensitive cases.
	   Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been at
loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections in
July. They failed to put an end to instability after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a coup last year.
	   The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy
held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to widespread
fraud and intimidation.
	   The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh seeking Hun
Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. After the new
parliament was sworn in Sept. 24, the opposition leaders and many
supporters left the country for Thailand, saying their safety was
endangered.
	   Sam Rainsy, under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his
role in the demonstrations, has remained abroad. His 15 seats in
the 122 seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working
government.

Japanese stocks rise, dollar lower in Tokyo

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose Friday on speculation
the government may announce a larger-than-expected economic
stimulus package next week. The U.S. dollar fell against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average recovered from a
midday dip into negative territory, rising 193.15 points, or 1.37
percent, to close at 14,268.21. On Thursday, the average closed
down 352.96 points, or 2.45 percent.
	   Trading was uneven for much of the day amid uncertainty about
the details of the economic stimulus measures due out Monday,
traders said.
	   ``It's hard for investors to change their positions before they
see the contents of the government's economic package on Monday,''
said Masatoshi Sato, manager of the investor information group at
Kankaku Securities Co.
	   The package was expected to meet or exceed a set of proposals
issued Thursday by the ruling party which called for a record 18
trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in spending on public works
projects and tax cuts.
	   Major Japanese newspapers reported Friday that it would total
between 20 trillion yen (dlrs 165 billion) and 22 trillion yen
(dlrs 181 billion).
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section picked up 10.59 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,093.52. The
TOPIX closed down 15.19 points, or 1.38 percent, the day before.
	   An estimated 450 million shares changed hands on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, up from 404 million on
Thursday. Gainers outnumbered retreating shares 692 to 428, with
162 issues closing unchanged.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, the dollar bought 121.68
yen in late afternoon trading, down 1.54 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 121.98 yen
overnight.
	   The dollar's downward move came after the currency rose as high
as 124.08 yen in New York on Thursday _ its highest level since
Oct. 7 _ as investors sought safer assets while U.S. military
forces moved closer to Iraq.
	   But the greenback quickly lost ground in Tokyo trading amid
lingering nervousness the U.S. Federal Reserve might cut interest
rates as soon as Tuesday, the next scheduled meeting of its Open
Market Committee.
	   ``It's hard to say whether the Fed will act now, but they will
act sometime,'' said Takeo Suzuki, assistant foreign exchange
manager at Nomura Trust and Banking.
	   Lower rates tend to make interest rate sensitive securities such
as government bonds less attractive to overseas investors, which
can reduce demand for a country's currency.
	   Traders said, however, that the dollar's drop may be short-lived
due to continued speculation the United States may strike Iraq over
its rejection of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We don't really want to go too short on dollars given the Iraq
issue,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank
Ltd. ``But I think dollar buying by Japanese commercial players may
have run its course for the day.''
	   The dollar traded as low as 121.00 yen and rose as high as
122.97 yen.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.815 from Thursday's 0.820 percent, pushing its price
up to 108.75 yen from 108.71 yen the previous day.

	   HAVANA (AP) _ The Cuban government has approved the reopening of
The Associated Press bureau in Havana.
	   Approval came from the Foreign Ministry on Thursday during a
visit here by a delegation of senior AP officials.
	   The office will be the news agency's 95th international bureau
and its 240th overall, including bureaus in the United States.
	   ``We are pleased that our long-standing request has been granted
and we look forward to the opportunity to cover this important
story with staff members regularly based here,'' said Louis D.
Boccardi, AP president and chief executive officer.
	   Boccardi said that a bureau chief would be appointed shortly and
that the AP hoped to have the office open within weeks.
	   Cable News Network is the only U.S.-based news organization with
a permanent presence in Cuba. It opened a bureau in March 1997,
after it received approval from both the Cuban and U.S.
governments.
	   The AP was forced by the Cuban government to close its Havana
bureau in 1969 when its last permanent correspondent was expelled.
In recent years, it has been sending staff correspondents to Cuba
on a regular basis for brief reporting visits.

Rabbis call on religious party to quit Israeli government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Scores of rabbis from Jewish settlements and
Israeli cities Friday moved to bring down Israel's government and
stop the handover of West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Taking a stand in a dispute that has split the National
Religious Party, the rabbis called on the party to pull out of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
	   The rabbis' demand came after Netanyahu's Cabinet approved an
agreement with the Palestinians that calls for Israel to turn over
another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu has a one-seat majority in the parliament. The NRP has
nine seats in the legislature and two ministers in Netanyahu's
17-person cabinet.
	   In an advertisement in Hatsofe, the NRP newspaper, 160 rabbis
declared that handing over territory in the biblical land of Israel
to ``gentiles'' is forbidden by the Torah, the Old Testament of the
Bible.
	   ``All of the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people,''
declared the ad. The biblical borders include the West Bank.
	   Referring to the Palestinians, the rabbis wrote that handing
over additional territory would ``strengthen the enemy'' and
endanger Israelis.
	   The NRP's central committee is to meet Sunday to consider
whether to remain in the Netanyahu government. The party is closely
identified with Jewish settlers in the West Bank, who hotly oppose
the agreement, negotiated last month at a marathon summit meeting
at Wye Plantation outside Washington.
	   Party leader Rabbi Yitzhak Levy, who serves as education
minister, is sharply critical of Netanyahu and has indicated he
favors leaving the coalition. But his party colleague,
Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom, opposes a quick move out.
	   ``Let's see how the government behaves in the next month or
two,'' Yahalom told Israel radio. Israel is supposed to implement
its partial pullback in the West Bank within 12 weeks.
	   An NRP exit would remove Netanyahu's majority in parliament and
leave him vulnerable to no-confidence motions. But the moderate
opposition Labor Party, which supports concessions for peace with
the Palestinians, has pledged to give Netanyahu a ``safety net,''
keeping him in power as long as he implements the Wye accord.

Cuban government approves reopening of AP Havana bureau

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ The Cuban government has approved the reopening of
the Associated Press bureau in Havana.
	   Approval came from the Foreign Ministry on Thursday during a
visit here by a delegation of senior AP officials.
	   The office will be the news agency's 95th international bureau
and its 240th overall, including bureaus in the United States.
	   ``We are pleased that our long-standing request has been granted
and we look forward to the opportunity to cover this important
story with staff members regularly based here,'' said Louis D.
Boccardi, AP president and chief executive officer.
	   Boccardi said a bureau chief would be appointed shortly and that
the AP hoped to have the office open within weeks.
	   Cable News Network is the only U.S.-based news organization with
a permanent presence in Cuba. It opened a bureau in March 1997,
after it received approval from both the Cuban and U.S.
governments.
	   The AP was forced by the Cuban government to close its Havana
bureau in 1969 when its last permanent correspondent was expelled.
In recent years, it has been sending staff correspondents to Cuba
on a regular basis for brief reporting visits.
	   The Cuban government's approval was conveyed by Foreign Minister
Roberto Robaina to AP Board Chairman Donald E. Newhouse, publisher
and president of the Newark, New Jersey, Star-Ledger; Boccardi, and
Claude E. Erbsen, vice president and director of AP World Services.
	   The AP executives met with President Fidel Castro, as well as
Ricardo Alarcon, president of Cuba's parliament, and other senior

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's bickering political
parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a
coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime
minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.
	   In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly resulting
from disputed elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds
a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party dropped insistence on a joint
assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh and party boss Chea Sim,
the current speaker. It was one of the main stumbling blocks in
months of discord.
	   Instead, Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modified
to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head. Chea Sim will
still serve as acting head of state during the king's frequent
absences from the country.
	   ``The major political crisis in the country has been resolved
and the political deadlock facing the nation has also come to an
end,'' the king said in his statement.
	   The agreement came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's
return Thursday from Thailand, where he had been holed up with
other opposition figures for weeks amid fears for their safety if
they stayed in Cambodia.
	   The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between
the CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international
donors and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken
country, which is in desperate need of aid.
	   Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second
day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form
a coalition and made ``important concessions.''
	   The king, the sole force in Cambodian politics able to broker a
deal, pressured both sides to reach agreement before he leaves
Saturday for medical treatment in Beijing.
	   Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to a request
by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political
pardons.
	   All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that are
widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has powers to grant
pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically
sensitive cases.
	   Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been at
loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections in
July. The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed
Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a coup last
year.
	   The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy
held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud and
intimidation.
	   The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh seeking Hun
Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed. After the new
parliament was sworn in Sept. 24, opposition leaders and many
supporters left the country for Thailand, saying their safety was
endangered.
	   Sam Rainsy, under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his
role in the demonstrations, has remained abroad. His 15 seats in
the 122 seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working
government.

Britain again warns Iraq on compliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday
that it would be ``disastrous'' if the United States and Britain
backed down in the current confrontation with Iraq over U.N.
inspections.
	   Both nations have threatened military action if Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein does not resume cooperation with the inspection
teams.
	   ``If we do not act in those circumstances and he is allowed to
break the agreement without any comeback at all from the
international community, the consequences would be disastrous for
us,'' Blair said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.
Radio Scotland.
	   Blair added: ``But if we do not act, if we let Saddam Hussein
break his word and develop these weapons of chemical and biological
warfare, do it in breach of the agreement he has made with the UN,
the agreements he has made at the end of the Gulf war, then we will
pay a heavy price for that.''

Kosovo Albanians swapped for Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed Serb civilians swapped
hostages with ethnic Albanian guerrillas on Friday, after
international monitors intervened to defuse the crisis.
	   All three sides _ Kosovo Albanians, Serb officials and the
monitors _ confirmed that two Serb civilians held since Wednesday
by the separatist guerillas were released in exchange for the seven
remaining ethnic Albanians still held by the Serbs.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot
throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo, the
Albanian-majority Serbian province.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
	   The detentions, and emotional pledges of revenge at a funeral
for slain fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerillas,
reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian tensions even after an
Oct. 12 agreement to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists has left
hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
results from the October agreement were taking shape, ``but we have
a long way to go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet Walker, said he would
be going to Belgrade on Friday to talk with Serb authorities on
implementation of a plan that would give Kosovo Albanians wide
autonomy.
	   In the western village of Retimlje, about 100 uniformed KLA
guerrillas attended a memorial for two of five fighters killed last
week. Many cried openly during an emotional speech by Sebajdin
Cena, a KLA commander.
	   Gjelal Hajda, 31, and Selajdin Mullaabazi, 28, died when their
cars encountered a Serb police patrol. Police said the guerrillas
fired first.
	   ``Their deaths unite us even more, and their blood gives us more
strength,'' Cena said.
	   The dead guerrillas ``will constantly ask us ... `Have you
fulfilled our last wish, did you take revenge for us?' '' he said.
``We tell them ... that we continue to fight, we continue to spill
blood because we are the sons of Albanians.''

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Security forces fired tear gas and
warning shots at hundreds of rock-throwing students Friday when
they tried to march on Parliament.
	   Mobs burned tires nearby as baton-wielding soldiers and troops
dispersed the crowd, but there were no immediate reports of serious
injuries.
	   The clash on a major road about two kilometers (one mile) west
of the legislature followed two deaths in similar street battles in
Jakarta on Thursday night.
	   Students marched from at least three campuses in the capital on
Friday in defiance of military warnings.
	   The students attempted to march on Parliament where a special
government assembly was putting the final touches to a new
political blueprint for the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   A high school student and a police officer died in hospitals
after clashes between 20,000 students and security agents blocking
them from reaching Parliament on Thursday.
	   At that time troops and police also dispersed the crowds with
baton charges, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. More
than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested that people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
Thursday's protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt
to forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   Some 1,000 student protesters on Friday blocked the runway and
airplane parking lots at the airport in Ujungpandang, the capital
of South Sulawesi province, the privately-owned SCTV television
station reported.
	   Airport authorities canceled at least six flights because of the
demonstration.
	   At the University of Indonesia about 1,500 students gathered but
were split on whether to march again on Parliament or to protest on
campus.
	   ``If we go out there will be more victims and only the military
will benefit,'' said one student who failed to convince others not
to march.
	   There was no immediate sign of trouble, although many stores,
offices and schools were closed.
	   Thursday night's violence was the worst outbreak of unrest in
Jakarta since riots forced Indonesia's former President Suharto to
quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new political
system as Indonesia battles with it worst economic crisis in
decades. Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation
into past corruption.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.
	   Police spokesman Lt. Col. Edward Aritonang said no arrests were
made on Thursday.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Just one day after Japan's ruling party announced
plans for the nation's biggest ever economic recovery package,
speculation mounted Friday the government will sweeten the deal
with even more stimulus steps.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party unveiled a set of proposals
Thursday calling for a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in
spending on public works projects and tax cuts to put Japan back on
track for recovery.
	   But the plan failed to impress with many private economists and
stock market investors who say it will not provide the jolt needed
to resuscitate the world's second-largest economy.
	   ``It's not enough to prevent a significant contraction in GDP
next year,'' said Jeffrey Young, an economist in the Tokyo office
of Salomon Smith Barney.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government will release an
official stimulus package on Monday based largely on the ruling
party's plan. Yet the government will reportedly up the ante
considerably.
	   Most government officials kept quiet on the matter Friday.
	   The Economic Planning Agency said the final draft of the plan
would be compiled late Sunday and then released the next day
shortly after 9:00 a.m.
	   Questioned by reporters about the size of the package, Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa would say only that ``It will be rather
big.''
	   But Taichi Sakaiya, the outspoken director general of Japan's
Economic Planning Agency, hinted vaguely that the official plan
might include something extra to sate the demand for more stimulus.
	   ``I hope there will be a surprise,'' he told reporters without
elaborating.
	   Leading financial newspaper Nihon Keizai reported the official
package, which is likely to be passed in a special session of
Parliament convening Nov. 27, will exceed 20 trillion yen (dlrs 165
billion).
	   The Asahi newspaper said the plan would total 22 trillion yen
(dlrs 181 billion) _ an amount roughly equal to the size of the
entire economy of Austria.
	   Primer Minister Obuchi, facing growing pressure both at home and
abroad, sees the package as his best change to stop the economy
from contracting for a third consecutive year _ a key pledge made
after taking office in July.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton will likely urge Obuchi to kick
start the Japanese economy at a summit meeting this weekend in
Malaysia of leaders from members of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   Speculation the package will include more aggressive stimulus
measures bolstered Japanese stock prices on Friday, sparking a 1.37
percent gain in the benchmark index. That came after Thursday's
2.45 percent slide on disappointment with the ruling party's
economic policy proposals.
	   One wild card cited by investors involves a possible reduction
or suspension of an unpopular national sales tax instituted in
1993.
	   The government's decision to raise the consumption tax from 3
percent to 5 percent in 1997 was widely blamed for choking off a
growth spurt and tipping the economy back into recession.
	   ``A cut in the sales tax, even if only temporary, will have a
big impact on spending,'' said Setsuo Nagao, a manager in the
equity division at Tokyo Securities Co.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fearing U.S. air strikes, thousands of
Iraqis queued up outside gasoline stations Friday as Iraq's
official media ignored the evident loss of Arab support in its
confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Official newspapers published articles hailing President Saddam
Hussein's decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission, and claimed there was worldwide condemnation of
American threats.
	   The United States has beefed up its military strength in the
Gulf and is threatening to launch air strikes in a bid to force
Iraq to allow inspections by the Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The world calls for dialogue and peace and America seeks war
and aggression,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Baath party newspaper, said in a banner headline.
	   The newspapers made no mention of the warning issued to Iraq by
a group of Arab countries on Thursday
	   The countries called for ``wisdom and reason'' to end the
confrontation but said Saddam's government alone would be
``responsible for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The criticism by the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation
Council _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _ along with Syria and Egypt
was unusually strong for Arab countries who have repeatedly called
for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said if the Arab countries are sincere about resolving the crisis,
``they should blame the main block ... the United States.''
	   Hours later, Iraqi newspapers Friday claimed Iraq was capable of
defeating the Untied States.
	   The United States knows that ``any limited aggression will not
achieve its goals,'' al-Thawra said. ``A large-scale and sustained
aggression will shake the whole region and lead to explosions of
unspecified consequences.''
	   The feeling of an imminent strike was evident from the rush to
fill up gasoline. At one station, about 20 cars were queued up in
front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Iraqi minders accompanying journalists touring the city said it
was forbidden to take pictures or talk to the people.
	   A customer contacted later said he waited a half-hour to fill up
his car. ``I fear the Americans will hit refineries and there will
be a shortage of fuel,'' said the driver who did not wish to be
identified.
	   Markets in Baghdad were crammed, but the crowd comprised the
usual weekend shoppers.
	   At the Al-Shorja market, 40-year-old Naima Aidan said she was
buying coconut and sugar to make sweets for her four children. ``I
am not worried. I don't think anything will happen to us. Because
God will keep us safe,'' she said.
	   Since Wednesday, the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all
its weapons inspectors and one-third of the 450 people working on
the humanitarian programs.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler called it ``a very serious
confrontation.''
	   ``I don't see any diplomatic solution around as we speak
tonight. There's a growing sense that air strikes or enforcement is
becoming more and more likely,'' he told MSNBC television on
Thursday night.
	   Iraq says it is will cooperate with arms inspectors if the U.N.
Security Council guarantees that it will work to lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its
economy, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq
has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required under the
cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Aziz has said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the
best person'' to try to ease the current crisis. But Annan said
Thursday he has no plans to visit Baghdad as he did the last time
in February and resolved a previous crisis.

U.S., Japan call on Iraq to cooperate on weapons inspections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and her Japanese counterpart called on Iraq to resume
cooperation with the United Nations on weapons inspections.
	   Albright called Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura early
Friday, the Japanese foreign ministry said.
	   Komura is in the Malaysian capital, and Albright will join him
this weekend, for a summit of 21 leaders of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation forum.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton was due Monday for the leaders'
summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``Both officials agreed that Iraq must resume cooperation ...
completely and without any conditions as soon as possible,'' said a
statement from the Japanese foreign ministry. ``Japan and the
United States also agreed to cooperate closely on this issue.''
	   Washington has intensified its war preparations as U.S. Clinton
secured congressional approval to attack Iraq for refusing to
submit to U.N. weapons inspections.
	   White House officials have said Clinton still intended to attend
the APEC summit next week.

Kosovo Albanians swapped for Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Restores dropped first reference to Walker, 8th graf
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed Serb civilians swapped
hostages with ethnic Albanian guerrillas on Friday, after
international monitors intervened to defuse the crisis.
	   All three sides _ Kosovo Albanians, Serb officials and the
monitors _ confirmed that two Serb civilians held since Wednesday
by the separatist guerillas were released in exchange for the seven
remaining ethnic Albanians still held by the Serbs.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot
throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo, the
Albanian-majority Serbian province.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
	   The detentions, and emotional pledges of revenge at a funeral
for slain fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerillas,
reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian tensions even after an
Oct. 12 agreement to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists has left
hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
results from the October agreement were taking shape, ``but we have
a long way to go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet William Walker, the
American head of a still-forming team of 2,000 international
monitors, said he would be going to Belgrade on Friday to talk with
Serb authorities on implementation of a plan that would give Kosovo
Albanians wide autonomy.
	   In the western village of Retimlje, about 100 uniformed KLA
guerrillas attended a memorial for two of five fighters killed last
week. Many cried openly during an emotional speech by Sebajdin
Cena, a KLA commander.
	   Gjelal Hajda, 31, and Selajdin Mullaabazi, 28, died when their
cars encountered a Serb police patrol. Police said the guerrillas
fired first.
	   ``Their deaths unite us even more, and their blood gives us more
strength,'' Cena said.
	   The dead guerrillas ``will constantly ask us ... `Have you
fulfilled our last wish, did you take revenge for us?' '' he said.
``We tell them ... that we continue to fight, we continue to spill
blood because we are the sons of Albanians.''

Brazil nearing deal on IMF-led rescue package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. Lead prospects uncertain &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund neared
completion of a long-expected dlrs 42 billion rescue package for
Brazil as financiers sought to stop the economic upheaval in Russia
and Asia from spreading to Latin America.
	   ``This is not a done deal but we are close,'' an IMF official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said early Friday.
	   The official could not confirm the exact amount of the bailout
because negotiations were continuing. But he said dlrs 42 billion
was close to the total amount of the three-year package needed by
Latin America's largest economy.
	   An announcement could come as early as Friday, possibly in both
Washington and Brasilia, Brazil's capital.
	   The IMF was expected to contribute between dlrs 15 billion and
dlrs 18 billion to support Brazilian President Fernando Enrique
Cardoso's austerity plan of tax increases and spending cuts aimed
at saving dlrs 23.5 billion so he can avert a devaluation of the
country's currency, the real.
	   A devaluation could set off an economic meltdown in Latin
America and worsen turmoil in other world markets including the
United States.
	   While the IMF's estimated share was known since early last
month, the amount contributed by the United States and other
wealthy nations was the subject of lengthy talks in Washington and
Switzerland.
	   The United States was expected to contribute about dlrs 5
billion from a Treasury Department fund originally established to
protect the dollar. The United States used the fund to help Mexico
in 1995 and South Korea and Indonesia last year.
	   Contributions from the World Bank, the Inter-American
Development Bank and the other wealthy nations _ Japan, Canada and
11 European countries _ would bring the final total to an estimated
dlrs 42 billion.
	   Still apparently unresolved was a Brazilian request for a
credit, which would not require Brazil to use the full amount,
instead of a loan, said officials involved in the talks. The
conditions of a credit would give the IMF less control over
Brazil's spending.
	   For months, Brazil has been one of the most closely watched
patients on the emerging markets sick list.
	   After Asia's financial crisis last year and Russia's economic
upheaval this summer triggered panic in global markets,
international investors and bankers feared Brazil would be forced
to devalue.
	   The country's foreign exchange reserves have dropped from dlrs
65 billion to dlrs 47 billion as investors moved out their money.
In an attempt to stem the flow, Cardoso's government raised
interest rates to 50 percent.
	   Cardoso won re-election in early October and then presented his
belt-tightening proposals to parliament.
	   The Brazil package would be among largest put together by the
182-nation IMF.
	   Last year, in response to Asia's financial crisis, the
Washington-based lending agency arranged a dlrs 58 billion package
for South Korea, a dlrs 42 billion-plus deal for Indonesia and a
dlrs 17 billion loan arrangement for Thailand.
	   In August, the IMF established a dlrs 23 billion safety net for
Russia that later was suspended after the Kremlin devalued the
ruble and defaulted on government debt.

Thai survey finds oversupply of half-million housing units in
</HEADLINE>
capital &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A huge oversupply of housing units in
and around Bangkok will delay the recovery of the property sector
for the foreseeable future, housing experts say.
	   A survey by the Government Housing Bank has found that there are
more than half-a-million unoccupied residential units, local
newspapers reported Friday. Some 264,084 are unsold and 267,063 are
sold but unoccupied, the report said.
	   ``The housing market recovery will not be seen next year as many
developers expected, unless pressures of oversupply and
non-performing loans in the housing sector are eased,'' Siriwat
Phromburi, the bank's president was quoted saying by the Bangkok
Post.
	   A housing expert from the Thailand's central bank also cautioned
against prospects of a quick recovery.
	   ``A new upturn in the property business, particularly housing,
will not happen quickly as in the previous boom,'' said Deputy Bank
Governor Kitti Pat-pongpibul, according to the Post. ``At the same
time, though, we have seen some good signs in lower interest rates
and stabilization of the baht.'
	   However, Kitti also cited three negative indicators for
short-term optimism: a 39.9 percent decline in land transactions, a
68.8 percent fall in housing development permit approvals and a
57.2 percent drop in housing registrations for the first nine
months of this year, compared to the same period last year.
	   The report's findings were discussed at a forum on the
development of an official property market index, expected to be
launched next year.
	   ``We will update the figures quarterly to reflect real demand
and supply in the housing market, which will inform us about the
overall economic situation,'' Government housing bank chairman
Somchai Ruchupan.
	   Over-investment in the property sector played a major role in
turning problems in Thailand's financial sector into a full-blown
crisis after an economic downturn last year.

Kosovo Albanians swapped for Serbs

Indonesian assembly names Suharto in anti-corruption decree
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's highest legislative body
on Friday decided to name former President Suharto in a decree
demanding the government crack down on corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
	   The decision, announced by officials from all five factions
within the People's Consultative Assembly, follows three days of
intense debate.
	   However, it falls short of demands by thousands of protesting
students who want the former autocrat put on trial for enriching
himself and his family during his 32-year rule.
	   Suharto, 77, was forced to quit last May after riots and
protests. Since then he had protested his innocence.
	   A government anti-corruption investigation, rejected by critics
as a whitewash, has yet to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing by
him.
	   The decree is expected to be formally passed by the 1,000-member
assembly Friday night as part of an overall blueprint for a new
political future for the world's fourth most populous nation.
	   Decrees on the continuing role of the powerful military in
Indonesian politics as well as a date for parliamentary elections
are also expected to be announced late Friday.
	   Amien Rais, a leading opposition leader, hailed the decision
even though it did not fully meet the demands by protesting
students and critics.
	   The decree calls on Habibie's government to eradicate and
investigate corruption by ``former state officials, their families
or cronies and private businesses as well as conglomerates _
including former President Suharto.''
	   It added that such investigation should take into account the
presumption of innocence and human rights.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Just one day after Japan's ruling party announced
plans for the nation's biggest ever economic recovery package,
speculation mounted Friday the government will sweeten the deal
with even more stimulus steps.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party unveiled a set of proposals
Thursday calling for a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in
spending on public works projects and tax cuts to put Japan back on
track for recovery.
	   But the plan failed to impress with many private economists and
stock market investors who say it will not provide the jolt needed
to resuscitate the world's second-largest economy.
	   ``It's not enough to prevent a significant contraction in GDP
next year,'' said Jeffrey Young, an economist in the Tokyo office
of Salomon Smith Barney.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government will release an
official stimulus package on Monday based largely on the ruling
party's plan. Yet the government will reportedly up the ante
considerably.
	   Most government officials kept quiet on the matter Friday.
	   The Economic Planning Agency said the final draft of the plan
would be compiled late Sunday and then released the next day
shortly after 9:00 a.m.
	   Leading financial newspaper Nihon Keizai reported the official
package, which is likely to be passed in a special session of
Parliament convening Nov. 27, will exceed 20 trillion yen (dlrs 165
billion).
	   The Asahi newspaper said the plan would total 22 trillion yen
(dlrs 181 billion) _ an amount roughly equal to the size of the
entire economy of Austria.
	   ___
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Responding to falling productivity in the
building industry, Singapore will require all foreign construction
workers to pass a basic skills test before they can enter the
country to work, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   The government will progressively increase the proportion of
foreigners capable of passing the test, which verifies construction
skills such as reading basic drawings and understanding some
English, said The Straits Times.
	   Singapore imports most of its manual laborers from Malaysia,
Thailand, India and Bangladesh. About 450,000 people with basic
work passes _ including maids _ live in the country.
	   From April next year, 50 percent of all construction workers
from abroad will have to pass the test, up from the existing 20
percent level.
	   ``This proportion will be raised progressively at a practicable
rate until the entire construction work force has basic skills at
least,'' Minister for National Development Lim Hng Kiang was quoted
as saying.
	   In August, the government imposed a minimum requirement that 20
percent of foreigners imported for construction work pass the test.
Nine overseas testing centers were created, said the report, and
more will soon be set up.
	   Productivity in the construction sector contracted 5.7 percent
in 1997 compared to the previous year.
	   The decline is blamed primarily on an industry that is
``preoccupied with meeting the voluminous contracts filling its
order books'' by using larger numbers of unskilled workers, said
Lim.
	   ___
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Coming up with plans to battle the Asia's
financial crisis is a crucial test for a summit of Pacific Rim
leaders next week, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said Friday.
	   A failure to deliver at the summit in Malaysia could call into
question the role of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum
and its annual meetings, Kim said at a news conference midway
through a five-day China visit.
	   ``This is a measurement of APEC's existence,'' Kim said. ``I
expect this summit will focus on whether APEC is just an
organization to discuss things, or rather an organization with
strong supportive and executive power.''
	   Kim noted that APEC has been divided between developed countries
who stress trade and investment liberalization and developing
countries who want more access to technology and scientific
know-how.
	   To overcome the financial crisis, Kim said developed countries
need to provide more aid and greater market access. At the same
time, developing countries need to push ahead with economic
reforms, he said.
	   After visiting Shanghai, Kim will head to Kuala Lumpur on Sunday
to take part in the APEC summit.
	   In addition to economic matters, Kim said while at APEC his
aides would also take up with the Russians a possible visit to
Moscow next year.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine food concern Pure Foods
Corp. said Friday it would form a new company with longtime
partner, U.S.-based meat products company, Hormel Foods Corp.
	   Pure Foods, a member of the Ayala Group of Companies, said it
will spin off its processed meats division to form the new joint
venture company with Hormel. The new company will start operation
in January.
	   The processed meat division is the largest contributor to Pure
Foods' sales and profit. It is the market leader in hotdogs, hams,
bacons, and cold cuts, accounting 47 percent of the country's
refrigerated meats market.
	   The new company, to be called The Purefoods-HFC Co., will be 60
percent owned by Pure Foods and 40 percent by Hormel. It will
produce Pure Foods and Hormel brands of canned and refrigerated
meats.
	   Pure Foods said the joint venture will be capitalized with about
1 billion pesos (dlrs 25 million). Final valuation of the assets of
Pure Foods meat division won't be in until the end of the year.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A huge oversupply of housing units in
and around Bangkok will delay the recovery of the property sector
for the foreseeable future, housing experts say.
	   A survey by the Government Housing Bank has found that there are
more than half-a-million unoccupied residential units, local
newspapers reported Friday. Some 264,084 are unsold and 267,063 are
sold but unoccupied, the report said.
	   ``The housing market recovery will not be seen next year as many
developers expected, unless pressures of oversupply and
non-performing loans in the housing sector are eased,'' Siriwat
Phromburi, the bank's president was quoted saying by the Bangkok
Post.
	   A housing expert from the Thailand's central bank also cautioned
against prospects of a quick recovery.
	   ``A new upturn in the property business, particularly housing,
will not happen quickly as in the previous boom,'' said Deputy Bank
Governor Kitti Pat-pongpibul, according to the Post. ``At the same
time, though, we have seen some good signs in lower interest rates
and stabilization of the baht.'
	   However, Kitti also cited three negative indicators for
short-term optimism: a 39.9 percent decline in land transactions, a
68.8 percent fall in housing development permit approvals and a
57.2 percent drop in housing registrations for the first nine
months of this year, compared to the same period last year.

Economic downturn dims Thai sky for meteor shower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand may be one of the best places
in the world to see the Leonid meteor shower next week, but the
country's severe economic downturn killed plans to build a
top-notch observatory for scientists to get a better view.
	   Pairash Thajechayapong, director of the National Science and
Technology Development Agency, told a news conference Friday on the
impending space phenomenon that the observatory would have been the
first for the country's astronomers and scientists.
	   ``The plan had to be shelved after the economic bubble burst,''
said Pairash, referring to the financial crisis that engulfed
Thailand last year and spread to the rest of Asia and other
emerging markets.
	   But Pairash hoped that crowds of Thais and foreign tourists who
have booked out hotels in rural areas next week will get a good
show from the shower, using the naked eye or a pair of binoculars.
	   The Leonid meteors, which orbit the sun every 33 years, are
expected to cross the earth's orbit next week, with the best
viewing Tuesday and Wednesday. East Asia is the front-row seat and
thousands of people are expected to flock to Thailand's northern
mountains for a balcony view.
	   Pairash said that interest has been growing among Thai
stargazers ever since a 1995 solar eclipse and a lunar eclipse last
year when the wife of the then-prime minister, Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh, led crowds in making offering to the Hindu god of
darkness, Rahu, to ward off bad luck.
	   Folk belief also surrounds meteor showers. Saran Poshyachina, a
colleague of Pairash, said that traditionally Thais believed that
if they saw a meteor shower, they should remain silent, not point,
and make a quiet wish. Pointing is considered rude in Thailand.
	   ``If you pointed at it,'' Saran said, ``you might be born in the
stomach of a dog in your next life.''
	   Saran noted that no one has ever been able to predict when and
where viewing of Leonids will be best and cautioned people excited
by the hype surrounding the event that the view could be more of a
shower than the hoped-for light storm.
	   The Leonids shower, named after the Leo constellation because
the meteors appeared to radiate from there, comes from debris
shredded by the comet Tempel-Tuttle, a dirty snowball that heats up
as it approaches the sun, which melts away some of its particles in
the process.
	   The particles form a long, 35,000-kilometer (25,000-mile) wide
stream, traveling at 200 times the speed of sound.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fearing U.S. air strikes, thousands of
Iraqis queued up outside gasoline stations Friday as Iraq's
official media ignored the evident loss of Arab support in its
confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Official newspapers published articles hailing President Saddam
Hussein's decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission, and claimed there was worldwide condemnation of
American threats.
	   The United States has beefed up its military strength in the
Gulf and is threatening to launch air strikes in a bid to force
Iraq to allow inspections by the Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The world calls for dialogue and peace and America seeks war
and aggression,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Baath party newspaper, said in a banner headline.
	   The newspapers made no mention of the warning issued Thursday to
Iraq by a group of Arab countries.
	   The countries called for ``wisdom and reason'' to end the
confrontation but said Saddam's government alone would be
``responsible for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The criticism by the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation
Council _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _ along with Syria and Egypt
was unusually strong for Arab countries who have repeatedly called
for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said if the Arab countries are sincere about resolving the crisis,
``they should blame the main block ... the United States.''
	   Hours later, Iraqi newspapers Friday claimed Iraq was capable of
defeating the Untied States.
	   The United States knows that ``any limited aggression will not
achieve its goals,'' al-Thawra said. ``A large-scale and sustained
aggression will shake the whole region and lead to explosions of
unspecified consequences.''
	   The feeling of an imminent strike was evident from the rush to
fill up gasoline. At one station, about 20 cars were queued up in
front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Iraqi minders accompanying journalists touring the city said it
was forbidden to take pictures or talk to the people.
	   A customer contacted later said he waited a half-hour to fill up
his car. ``I fear the Americans will hit refineries and there will
be a shortage of fuel,'' said the driver who did not wish to be
identified.
	   Markets in Baghdad were crammed, but the crowd comprised the
usual weekend shoppers.
	   At the Al-Shorja market, 40-year-old Naima Aidan said she was
buying coconut and sugar to make sweets for her four children. ``I
am not worried. I don't think anything will happen to us. Because
God will keep us safe,'' she said.
	   Since Wednesday, the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all
its weapons inspectors and one-third of the 450 people working on
the humanitarian programs.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler called it ``a very serious
confrontation.''
	   ``I don't see any diplomatic solution around as we speak
tonight. There's a growing sense that air strikes or enforcement is
becoming more and more likely,'' he told MSNBC television on
Thursday night.
	   Iraq says it is will cooperate with arms inspectors if the U.N.
Security Council guarantees that it will work to lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its
economy, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq
has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required under the
cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Aziz has said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the
best person'' to try to ease the current crisis. But Annan said
Thursday he has no plans to visit Baghdad as he did the last time
in February and resolved a previous crisis.

Cambodian parties agree to coalition, prince gets key post

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's bickering political
parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a
coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime
minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.
	   In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly resulting
from disputed elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds
a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party dropped insistence on a joint
assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh and party boss Chea Sim,
the current speaker. It was one of the main stumbling blocks in
months of discord.
	   Instead, Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modified
to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head. Chea Sim will
still serve as acting head of state during the king's frequent
absences from the country.
	   ``The major political crisis in the country has been resolved
and the political deadlock facing the nation has also come to an
end,'' the king said in his statement.
	   The Senate will initially be appointed by the king. The
agreement did not say how many seats there would be, nor how they
would be divided. The parties will work out details later.
	   The senior Senate leaders will join those of the assembly, the
prime minister and the country's top two Buddhist monks in a
delicate balance of power on the council that will choose
Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.
	   The two parties said that the assembly would convene again Nov.
25.
	   The agreement came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's
return Thursday from Thailand, where he had been holed up with
other opposition figures for weeks amid fears for their safety if
they stayed in Cambodia.
	   The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between
the CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international
donors and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken
country, which is in desperate need of aid.
	   It could also hasten Cambodia's entry into the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last year after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup.
	   Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second
day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form
a coalition and made ``important concessions.''
	   The king, the sole force in Cambodian politics able to broker a
deal, pressured both sides to reach agreement before he leaves
Saturday for medical treatment in Beijing.
	   Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to a request
by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political
pardons.
	   All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that are
widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has powers to grant
pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically
sensitive cases.
	   Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been at
loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections in
July. The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed
last year's coup.
	   The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy
held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud and
intimidation.
	   The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh seeking Hun
Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed.
	   Sam Rainsy, under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his
role in the demonstrations, has remained abroad. His 15 seats in
the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working
government.

Belarus pledges to pay energy debt with Lithuania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEDININKAI, Lithuania (AP) - Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko promised his Lithuanian counterpart that Belarus would
pay an energy debt to Lithuania of some dlrs 66 million.
	   Lithuania exports electricity from a Soviet-era nuclear power
plant to Belarus, but said this week that it would soon cut regular
energy supplies to its eastern neighbor by two-thirds if Belarus
did not pay its debt.
	   The presidents met Thursday.
	   Lukashenko didn't specify when Belarus might pay or whether the
country would cover the debt in full. In the past, Belarus has paid
Lithuania partly in cash and partly by bartering consumer goods and
raw materials.
	   Since independence from the Soviet Union, Lithuania has
implemented free-market reforms, and its economy shows signs of
growth despite economic turmoil in nearby Russia.
	   Belarus, however, has been regarded as the reform slowpoke of
the ex-Soviet Union, and the country's economy, always sluggish,
has been laid low by the Russian economic crisis. Its state coffers
have begun drying up.
	   The two-hour meeting at a border post near Medininkai, some 25
kilometers south of the Lithuania's capital Vilnius, was the first
face-to-face meeting between Lukashenko and Lithuanian President

	   At a news conference after their talks, the two leaders said
they had also discussed bilateral trade and also how to stem the
flow of illegal refugees, mostly from Africa and the Middle East,
through Belarus to Lithuania.

Estrada to discuss Chinese `encroachment' with Jiang
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with presidential spokesman saying talks with Clinton
preliminary in new 9th-10th grafs; TRIMS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday he will discuss Chinese ``encroachment'' in
Manila-claimed areas in the South China Sea in a meeting next week
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Manila protested to Beijing last week after the Philippine
military discovered China was expanding structures it had built in
1995 on the disputed Mischief Reef in the Spratlys.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado described China's action as
``creeping invasion'' and accused Beijing of bullying the
Philippines because it has a weak military.
	   ``I will take this up with him and we will say that this area is
within our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,'' Estrada said in a
radio interview. ``We will explain to him that they are encroaching
and entering our territory.''
	   Oscar Valenzuela, spokesman for the Department of Foreign
Affairs, said Estrada and Jiang are scheduled to hold bilateral
talks on Nov. 17 on the first day of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia.
	   ``The agenda has been firmed up and one of the things to be
discussed is these developments at the Mischief Reef,'' Valenzuela
said without elaborating.
	   Estrada said he may also have an opportunity to talk with U.S.
President Bill Clinton to seek Washington's help ``to augment our
armed forces.''
	   ``We don't have enough military equipment and in our situation,
we may have to ask for help from the U.S.,'' he said.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said Estrada will explore
how the United States can help the Philippines modernize its armed
forces.
	   ``This is simply preliminary. This is going to be a meeting
where they'll simply explore these possibilities in very general
terms, nothing more than that,'' Barican said.
	   The Philippines says China violated a 1995 agreement, reached
after the first dispute over the Mischief Reef, not to increase
activities in the area for confidence building on both sides.
	   Earlier this week, armed forces chief of staff Maj. Gen. Joselin
Nazareno ordered military planes not to fly lower than 5,000 feet
(1,515 meters) over the reef after China warned that low-flying
reconnaissance flights by Philippine jets might trigger an
accidental confrontation.
	   China has said the structures at the reef were shelters for
Chinese fishermen. It said it was repairing the shelters and that
it has a sovereign right to undertake the repairs to ensure the
safety of its fishermen.
	   Mercado, however, said China was building massive barracks and
possibly a pier that could be used militarily.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys, believed to be rich in minerals, is claimed in
whole or in part by the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei
and Malaysia.

Rabbis call on religious party to quit Israeli government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Scores of rabbis from Jewish settlements and
Israeli cities moved Friday to bring down Israel's government and
stop the handover of West Bank land to the Palestinians.
	   Taking a stand in a dispute that has split the National
Religious Party, the rabbis called on the party to pull out of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government.
	   The rabbis' demand came after Netanyahu's Cabinet approved an
agreement with the Palestinians that calls for Israel to turn over
another 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Netanyahu has a one-seat majority in the parliament. The NRP has
nine seats in the legislature and two ministers in Netanyahu's
17-person Cabinet.
	   In an advertisement in Hatsofe, the NRP newspaper, 160 rabbis
declared that handing over territory in the biblical land of Israel
to ``gentiles'' is forbidden by the Torah, the Old Testament of the
Bible.
	   ``All of the Land of Israel belongs to the Jewish people,''
declared the ad. The biblical borders include the West Bank.
	   Referring to the Palestinians, the rabbis wrote that handing
over additional territory would ``strengthen the enemy'' and
endanger Israelis.
	   The NRP's central committee is to meet Sunday to consider
whether to remain in the Netanyahu government. The party is closely
identified with Jewish settlers in the West Bank who hotly oppose
the agreement negotiated last month at a marathon summit meeting at
Wye Plantation outside Washington.
	   Party leader Rabbi Yitzhak Levy, who serves as education
minister, is sharply critical of Netanyahu and has indicated he
favors leaving the coalition. But his party colleague,
Transportation Minister Shaul Yahalom, opposes a quick move out.
	   ``Let's see how the government behaves in the next month or
two,'' Yahalom told Israel radio. Israel is supposed to implement
its partial pullback in the West Bank within 12 weeks.
	   An NRP exit would remove Netanyahu's majority in parliament and
leave him vulnerable to no-confidence motions. But the moderate
opposition Labor Party, which supports concessions for peace with
the Palestinians, has pledged to give Netanyahu a ``safety net,''
keeping him in power as long as he implements the Wye accord.

 &UR; TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: Officials notify three killers they will be
hanged &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Officials in Trinidad and Tobago
have read execution orders to three convicted killers, meaning they
could be hanged as early as Tuesday.
	   The planned executions come amid a battle over the death penalty
between Britain and its former colonies in the Caribbean, who are
forming their own supreme court to bypass British restrictions on
hangings.
	   On Thursday prison officials read death warrants to Dole Chadee,
Joey Ramiah and Ramkhelawan Singh, who were all convicted in
September 1996 for the midnight murder of a family of four in
southern Williamsville.
	   Prosecutors claimed the killings were drug-related. Chadee was
not present during the shootings, but a jury decided he had ordered
the killings.
	   The death warrants set no dates for the executions, but hangings
are traditionally performed the following Tuesday.
	   The three convicts appealed their sentences unsuccessfully to
the British Privy Council, the U.N. Human Rights Commission and the
Interamerican Human Rights Commission.
	   Chadee had filed a second appeal claiming the government singled
him out for execution. That appeal was to be heard in Trinidad's
High Court on Nov. 26.
 &UR; GUYANA: Ex-customs chief storms office with crowd of protesters
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ Hundreds of protesters smashed through
chained gates and stormed Guyana's customs headquarters in the
latest of racially charged demonstrations in this South American
country.
	   The mostly black protesters on Thursday were demanding the
reinstatement of black customs comptroller Clarence Chue, who was
suspended on corruption charges when a government dominated by
Guyanese of East Indian descent took power in 1992. Courts cleared
him of all charges.
	   The two ethnic groups are bitterly divided, and the country
exploded in race riots and bombings earlier this year after
President Janet Jagan's mainly Indo-Guyanese party won the December
elections.
	   Chue's dismissal became a focal point for Afro-Guyanese public
workers who claim widespread discrimination within the government.
	   On Thursday, unarmed guards watched helplessly as Chue,
accompanied by leaders of the Guyana Public Service Union, pushed
into the office of his replacement, Lloyd Forde, and demanded his
resignation.
	   An appeals court ordered the government to reinstate Chue
earlier this month.
	   Forde refused to leave. ``I have received no instructions to
hand over office to Mr. Chue,'' he said.
	   After a private meeting between the two men, Chue left vowing to
return to work Friday.
 &UR; CUBA: Spanish foreign minister says king will visit
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In a sign of steadily improving relations,
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes says that King Juan Carlos
was due to visit Cuba in early 1999, though he said no date has yet
been set.
	   Matutes announced the planned visit Thursday at the end of a
three-day visit to the Cuban capital, Havana. There he met at least
twice with Cuban President Fidel Castro _ for a five-hour dinner
and a two-hour private session Wednesday night.
	   Matutes said the visit ``will be historic,'' noting that Cuba is
the only Latin American country never visited by Spanish monarchs.
	   He said details of the visit by Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia
would be worked out ``in the coming weeks.''
	   It would be, symbolically at least, the most important visit to
Cuba since Pope John Paul II visited in January.
	   The announcement was especially dramatic because relations
between Cuba and Spain hit a low point after conservative Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar took office in May 1996 and began to
sharply criticize Cuba's human rights situation.
	   In November 1996, Cuba rejected Spain's proposed ambassador,
setting off an exchange of insults between the two countries'
officials.
	   Matutes said relations between Spain and Cuba were entering ``a
new stage, which will experience a great impulse from the historic
visit of the king.''
 &UR; BARBADOS: Students shut down college
	   BRIDGETOWN, Barbados (AP) _ Students will go back to classes
today after a protest Thursday that shut down the University of the
West Indies campus in Cave Hill, Barbados.
	   They were demanding tougher security on the campus.
	   The demonstration was prompted by an attack Wednesday on a law
instructor by a burglar in her office. Police arrested the
17-year-old suspect but said he later escaped from officers.
	   About 300 students and some faculty members blocked gates and
doorways of the school, which has about 1,000 enrollees.
	   Students have previously complained of stalkers and burglars on
the grounds of the college, about four miles (six kilometers)
outside Bridgetown on the island's west coast.
	   Police spokesman Oral Reid said patrols had been increased
following the attack. ``We have instituted foot and mobile patrols
of the area and we are doing our best to bring this situation under
control,'' he said.
	   Students said they would return to classes Friday but would
resume protests next week if a meeting with school administrators
on Saturday does not prompt plans for tougher security.
 &UR; BAHAMAS: Coast Guard chases boat, catches suspected illegals
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ U.S. Coast Guard cutters chased
down and captured a boat in the Bahamas carrying 21 suspected
illegal immigrants, authorities say.
	   Another boat charged a cutter in an attempt to distract it, then
fled to a deserted beach in the Bahamas, the Coast Guard said.
	   Officials said the U.S. cutter Maui spotted the No Tuna Too, a
sport fishing boat, about 30 miles south of Freeport, Bahamas on a
course for Florida Wednesday night.
	   The cutter approached the boat and ordered it to stop.
International law allows maritime authorities to stop vessels in
international waters to question them about their next ports of
call, said Coast Guard spokesman Mark Woodring.
	   The vessel fled; and a second, 20-foot-long (6-meter-long) boat
appeared and began charging at the cutter in an apparent attempt to
distract it, Woodring said.
	   The No Tuna Too stopped after a second cutter joined the chase,
but one of the migrants tried to grab an officer's gun as the Coast
Guard boarded the boat, officials said.
	   The crew of the smaller boat fled to Grand Bahama Island pursued
by a Coast Guard helicopter, then beached the boat and ran into a
forest.
 &UR; HAITI: Cuba sending 200 doctors to Haiti in first accord in 36
years
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Cuba is sending 200 doctors to help
Haiti, in the first accord between the two countries since
diplomatic relations were severed 36 years ago.
	   An agreement on the doctors and for 100 Haitian medical school
graduates to get specialized training in Cuban hospitals was signed
in Havana on Wednesday, during a visit by Haitian President Rene
Preval.
	   The 10-point agreement also includes collaboration in education,
agriculture, tourism, and sports, Haitian Radio Metropole reported
from Havana on Thursday.
	   ``It's a historic moment in the relations between our two
countries,'' it quoted acting Health Minister Jean Moliere as
saying. ``To begin our cooperation with health can act as a motor
of development.''
	   The Haitian standard of life has been dropping steadily for
decades. This year, Haiti ranked 159th out of 174 countries in the
U.N. Human Development Index, which measures life expectancy,
education and income. Cuba was No. 85, also down from No. 79 in
1996. The index said only 60 percent of Haitians have access to
health care.
	   Preval, accompanied by about 60 government officials and public
figures, arrived in Cuba Monday for a weeklong visit, his first
since Haiti renewed relations with Cuba in 1996.
 &UR; TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: Media workers plan protest on Friday
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Newspaper, radio and television
reporters plan to march today to protest physical attacks by a
crowd they claim was incited to abuse them by Prime Minister Basdeo
Panday.
	   Members of the Trinidad and Tobago Media Association said
Thursday they decided on the ``March for Democracy'' on Friday over
proposals that included a boycott of reporting on government
matters, an open letter to Panday, a joint lawsuit and picketing of
Parliament.
	   During a political rally in the eastern town of Chaguanas
Sunday, Panday declared ``war'' on journalists and called them
enemies of his United National Congress Party. He called for an
advertising boycott of news organizations who ``attack our party
unfairly.''
	   Panday's supporters then doused journalists with beer and rum,
slugged a camera operator and shouted racial slurs at one reporter.
	   Panday's three years in office have been marked by clashes with
the news media. He has repeatedly accused reporters of racism
toward his party, which is dominated by Guyanese of East Indian
descent.
	   Trinidad and Tobago is racially divided between people of
African and East Indian descent.
	   The attacks infuriated journalists' organizations in the
Caribbean. On Thursday, some reporters said they might still pursue
lawsuits.
 &UR; JAMAICA: PM urges Clinton to ease opposition in banana battle
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's prime minister is joining
other leaders in the region in urging President Clinton to ease his
opposition to European trade perks given to banana producers.
	   Prime minister P.J. Patterson sent a letter to U.S. ambassador
Stanley McLelland Thursday calling the dispute a ``life and death''
matter for small Caribbean countries. The letter was addressed to
Clinton.
	   The United States and Central American banana producers won a
World Trade Organization case in 1997 claiming that trade
preferences granted to former European colonies by the European
Union violate free-trade agreements.
	   The European Union rewrote its banana import agreements, but the
United States has been unsatisfied with the changes. On Nov. 6,
U.S. trade representatives threatened economic sanctions.
	   ``The (Caribbean) governments find it incomprehensible that,
despite our repeated urgings, the United States appears determined
to pursue a course of trade confrontation,'' Patterson wrote.
	   The prime ministers of Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
St. Lucia, Grenada and Belize have sent similar letters to the
Clinton administration.
 &UR; TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO: Norsk Hydro signs aluminum plant project
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad and Norway's Norsk Hydro
have signed an agreement to build a dlrs 1.6 billion aluminum
smelter to supply the North American market.
	   It would be the largest single investment ever made in the
English-speaking Caribbean, eclipsing Trinidad's dlrs 1 billion
liquefied natural gas project.
	   Plans for the 237,000-ton smelter are subject to technical
studies and a final investment decision expected toward the end of
1999, said officials at the signing ceremony Thursday.
	   ``The project is market driven and gives us a competitive source
with a good location to serve our growing activities in North
America and even Europe,'' said Tormod Bjork, who head the
company's business sand project development unit. ``We are looking
at a large volume, low-cost aluminum plant in Trinidad.''
	   The island's Energy Minister, Finbar Gangar, said that the
project required ``considerable government support'' and had been
given a 10-year tax holiday and other fiscal incentives as well as
a competitive natural gas price.
	   Eivind Reiten, president of Hydro Aluminum, said that Norsk
Hydro had chosen Trinidad over Venezuela and Qatar because of the
incentives and the island's proximity to rapidly developing
aluminum markets in North America.

 &UR; Belarus pledges to pay energy debt with Lithuania &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MEDININKAI, Lithuania (AP) - Belarussian President Alexander
Lukashenko promised his Lithuanian counterpart that Belarus would
pay an energy debt to Lithuania of some dlrs 66 million.
	   Lithuania exports electricity from a Soviet-era nuclear power
plant to Belarus, but said this week that it would soon cut regular
energy supplies to its eastern neighbor by two-thirds if Belarus
did not pay its debt.
	   The presidents met Thursday.
	   Lukashenko didn't specify when Belarus might pay or whether the
country would cover the debt in full. In the past, Belarus has paid
Lithuania partly in cash and partly by bartering consumer goods and
raw materials.
	   Since independence from the Soviet Union, Lithuania has
implemented free-market reforms, and its economy shows signs of
growth despite economic turmoil in nearby Russia.
	   Belarus, however, has been regarded as the reform slowpoke of
the ex-Soviet Union, and the country's economy, always sluggish,
has been laid low by the Russian economic crisis. Its state coffers
have begun drying up.
	   The two-hour meeting at a border post near Medininkai, some 25
kilometers south of the Lithuania's capital Vilnius, was the first
face-to-face meeting between Lukashenko and Lithuanian President
Valdas Adamkus.
	   At a news conference after their talks, the two leaders said
they had also discussed bilateral trade and also how to stem the
flow of illegal refugees, mostly from Africa and the Middle East,
through Belarus to Lithuania.

Gov't hails job creation as sign policies work
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The number of new salaried jobs in France rose by
nearly one-half a percentage point in the third quarter of 1998 and
was 2.2 percent higher than a year ago, Labor Minister Martine
Aubry reported Friday.
	   Aubry said the 0.4 percent increase over second-quarter figures
was evidence that her leftist government's pro-growth policy is
paying dividends.
	   ``These good results confirm that, by making employment its
number one priority, by supporting households' purchasing power and
restoring confidence, the government's actions have placed France
in a ... circle of growth, job creation and lower unemployment,''
the minister said.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, in office since June 1997, has
made reducing France's high unemployment his goal.'' Unemployment
currently stands at 11.8 percent, dipping from above 12 percent.
	   Aubry said the purchasing power of workers continued to improve
at the same sustained rate witnessed since the beginning of the
year. The base hourly wage of French blue-collar workers rose 2
percent over the past 12 months, compared with a 0.4 percent rise
in the consumer price index.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian security forces opened fire
with plastic bullets, water cannons and tear gas on rock-throwing
students trying to march on Parliament on Friday. The number of
injured was not immediately known.
	   The renewed violence erupted at several points near the
legislature and followed similar street battles in Jakarta on
Thursday night that killed two people.
	   Mobs burned tires as baton-wielding soldiers and troops
dispersed an angry crowd on a major road about two kilometers (one
mile) west of the legislature.
	   Armored personnel carriers, meanwhile, rumbled along Jakarta's
main boulevard after more fighting and stone-throwing also broke
out. Troops fired warning shots and chased thousands of protesters
through Jakarta's downtown area where offices and shops were
closed.
	   Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and rubber
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several
students, some bleeding, were later taken out on stretches.
	   There were no immediate reports of deaths.
	   Trouble broke out soon after weekly Islamic prayers ended.
Students marched from several campuses in the capital in defiance
of military warnings.
	   The students were blocked from reaching Parliament where a
special government assembly was putting the final touches to a new
political blueprint for the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   On Thursday, a high school student and a police officer died in
hospitals after 20,000 students were blocked by security personnel
from reaching Parliament.
	   At that time troops and police also dispersed the crowds with
baton charges, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. More
than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
the protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt to
forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   Thursday night's violence was the worst outbreak of unrest in
Jakarta since riots forced Indonesia's former President Suharto to
quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new political
system as Indonesia battles with it worst economic crisis in
decades. Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation
into past corruption.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.

Russian envoy released in Chechnya after six months as hostage

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya was
released Friday after being held hostage for more than six months
in the breakaway southern region.
	   Valentin Vlasov, who was abducted in May after conducting
negotiations with Chechen officials, was freed by Russia's Interior
Ministry.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin greeted Vlasov at a Moscow
airport early Friday and said that no ransom was paid for his
release. But Chechen officials immediately countered that claim,
saying that Russian officials paid for Vlasov's freedom.
	   ``By doing that, they once again financed the Chechen criminal
groups,'' Nasrudi Bazhiyev, Chechnya's deputy security minister,
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Turpal Atgeriyev, Chechnya's deputy premier claimed that Vlasov
had been kept outside Chechnya.
	   Stepashin and other officials refused to give any details of how
Vlasov was released.
	   Ruslan Yeshugayev, the chief of the ministry's anti-organized
crime squad in the region, said Vlasov was brought from Chechnya to
neighboring region of Inghushetia early Friday and then flown to
Moscow, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Vlasov, dressed in a black raincoat, looked haggard and pale in
television footage of his arrival in Moscow.
	   ``What should have happened, did happen,'' he said in a brief
interview shown on the ORT television. ``The main thing is what
will happen next.''
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in and around Chechnya
following its 1994-96 war with Russia, and dozens remain in
captivity. Vlasov was the most prominent of those who had been held
hostage.
	   Interior Ministry spokesman Alexander Mikhailov said that an
estimated 150 people were still being held in captivity in
Chechnya.
	   Most of the kidnappings are carried out by criminal gangs
seeking ransom, and have no political motive. The Russian media
reported that Vlasov's kidnappers were seeking millions of dollars.
	   Chechen officials have said that ransoms have been paid in some
cases, though the parties involved in the negotiations rarely, if
ever, provide details.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew in the fall of 1996, but Moscow still considers it a part
of Russia and no country has recognized its independence.

Leading economist says U.S. rate cut inevitable by December
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ A quarter of a percentage point cut by the U.S.
Federal Reserve in the key Federal funds rate is inevitable by
year's end, a leading global economist said Friday.
	   ``Either they will ease (the rate on Tuesday) or they will be
forced to ease between then and the 22nd of December,'' George
Magnus, chief global economist for Warburg Dillon Read, was quoted
as saying by Dow Jones Newswires.
	   The Federal Open Market Committee next meets Nov. 17. Their last
meeting this year is scheduled for Dec. 22.
	   But Magnus warned that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and his
colleagues must move carefully as they act to ease a credit crunch,
or risk spurring an investment boom and a potential stock-market
bubble.
	   An easing Tuesday ``is hopeful rather than sure,'' conceded
Magnus, who believes that ``what Mr. Greenspan and the Federal
Reserve are concerned about is the credit market.''
	   But if the committee doesn't lower rates on Tuesday, U.S. credit
and equities markets will react adversely, he said. This would
trigger an inevitable rate cut by the end of the year.
	   Magnus noted that many of the small and medium-sized companies
in the United States, which create the bulk of new employment, were
closed off from credit in September. They were the businesses
hardest hit by the credit crunch, he said.
	   The U.S. Federal Reserve last reduced rates Oct. 15 in a
surprise move between scheduled meetings of the committee. The Fed
sliced a quarter of a percentage point off its funds and discount
rates, lowering them to 5 percent and 4.75 percent respectively.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Amid promises of foreign aid and
debt relief from around the globe, citizens and aid workers in
Central America shoveled mud, removed debris, distributed food and
disposed of the dead.
	   In a radio broadcast Thursday, Honduran President Carlos Flores
Facusse called on his countrymen to ``redouble your efforts and
your work to rebuild the country as rapidly as possible.''
	   ``The time has come for us to jointly face the apocalyptic
reality of our villages and cities ... and try to create a Honduras
that is renewed, vigorous, modern and better,'' Flores Facusse
said.
	   Officials put the Honduran death toll at 7,000, with another
11,000 people injured, 10,000 missing and 800,000 houses damaged or
destroyed. In Nicaragua, the toll was 2,362 dead, 287 injured, 970
missing and 36,000 houses destroyed or damaged.
	   Several hundred people also died in Guatemala and El Salvador.
	   Flores Facusse said repairs could cost four times Honduras' dlrs
1.2 billion annual budget. He urged the United States and other
countries to forgive Honduras' dlrs 4.3 billion in debt, grant it
free-trade status and help with ``a massive supply of fresh
resources to aid in rebuilding the country.''
	   The United States is part of the Paris Club of creditor nations,
which announced Thursday it would likely grant debt relief to
Honduras and Nicaragua when it meets in early December.
	   France on Tuesday canceled debts owed by Nicaragua and Honduras,
while dozens of other countries have sent help.
	   In the northern Honduran town of La Mesa, U.S. soldiers planned
to help open a key road buried by the hurricane. But U.S. Army
Capt. Mike Slocum in La Mesa told The Associated Press that the
situation in Iraq has slowed the delivery of equipment and aid to
Central America.
	   The Pentagon press office, contacted late Thursday, could not
comment on that suggestion. The United States on Wednesday ordered
more warships headed to the Gulf to ready for a possible attack on
Iraq.
	   The U.S. government has announced dlrs 80 million in emergency
aid to Central America. Yet in a region where U.S. influence in
local politics is taken for granted, many Central Americans have
criticized the United States for not doing more to help.
	   Frustration at the slow pace of relief efforts was felt
everywhere, with blocked roads meaning blocked food, less medicine
and more despair.
	   Hurricane Mitch hit hardest in Honduras and Nicaragua, the two
poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere after Haiti. Flooding
and mudslides destroyed so many roads and bridges that entire
communities might still be cut off from food, medicine and water.
	   Thursday in Nicaragua, a local Catholic bishop, the Rev. Bosco
Vivas Robelo, made a public plea for information about communities
where aid has not yet arrived.
	   In the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa, law students dug with
shovels Thursday alongside roaring earth-moving equipment, trying
to rid the city of thick layers of mud left by Mitch.
	   ``I had never seen my country like this,'' said Hector Duran, an
engineering student standing in 2-feet (0.61-meter)-deep mud. ``I
did not realize the damage was so bad. If we all make an effort, we
will come out ahead.''
	   The Rome-base U.N. World Food Program announced it would
distribute more than 100,000 tons (90,718 metric tons) of rice,
corn, fish and oil over the next six months in the hurricane-hit
countries.
	   ``With emergency assistance, these people are at extreme
nutritional risk _ in addition to facing the threat of cholera and
other diseases,'' said Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive
director.

Defunct regional bank sues ex-executives
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, a regional bank that
collapsed last year under massive debts, sued 11 former executives
Friday for mismanagement that contributed to the bank's failure,
the bank said.
	   Takushoku, based in Sapporo, 829 kilometers (518 miles)
northwest of Tokyo, is demanding 10.8 billion yen (89.1 million
yen) as compensation for irrecoverable loans made to four ailing
companies, the bank said in a statement.
	   The 11 named in the suit included former Hokkaido Takushoku
president Shigeru Suzuki.
	   The Sapporo District Court confirmed that the bank had filed a
lawsuit against the ex-executives, but would not provide details.
	   Hokkaido Takushoku's bankruptcy last November sent shockwaves
through Japan's financial world and heralded a wave of major
corporate failures that drove home the severity of Japan's economic
downturn.
	   Hokkaido Takushoku closed its doors Friday for the last time
after nearly a century in business. From Monday, its operations
will be transferred to Sapporo's North Pacific Bank and Tokyo's
Chuo Trust and Banking Co.

Australia backs Thailand's deputy premier for WTO chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Canada's candidate for WTO chair
saying he expects ``comprehensive'' global trade negations to begin
in 2000 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia announced Friday that it
will back Supachai Panitchpakdi, Thailand's deputy prime minister,
in the race to head the World Trade Organization.
	   Tim Fischer, Australia's deputy prime minister and trade
minister, made the announcement upon arrival in Kuala Lumpur for
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ministerial meeting.
	   Fischer said that the role of director-general of the world's
trade watchdog would be ``crucial'' in the international response
to present global economic difficulties.
	   ``Supachai has already attracted a wide spectrum of support from
WTO members and I am confident he would make an outstanding
director-general,'' Fischer said.
	   Fischer said key WTO activities next year would be to prepare
for a ministerial meeting to decide the shape of further
multilateral trade talks, plus resumption of negotiations on
agriculture and services.
	   ``The new director-general will have Australia's full support in
moving these important issues forward,'' Fischer said.
	   Fischer said he would be using the APEC meeting during an
upcoming tour of Latin America to push Supachai's candidacy.
	   Supachai, 52, who is also commerce minister and a former
president of Thai Military Bank, has the backing of Southeast Asian
and some Scandinavian countries in his bid to succeed outgoing WTO
boss Renato Ruggiero, an Italian who will step down by April.
	   Supachai has said that dealing with the Asian economic crisis _
triggered last year when the previous Thai government was forced to
float the baht under pressure from currency speculation _ has
provided valuable experience for leading the WTO.
	   Also running are former Moroccan trade minister Hassan Abouyoub;
Michael Moore, former prime minister of New Zealand; and former
Canadian trade minister Roy Maclaren.
	   The contest will be decided by consensus rather than a vote and
the WTO general council hopes to confirm the appointment by the end
of this year.
	   Maclaren, in Kuala Lumpur for the APEC summit, said Friday that
he expects ``comprehensive'' global trade negotiations to begin in
2000. He said scheduled talks on agriculture and services in 2000
would likely become broader trade negotiations.
	   ``The Europeans and Japan in particular have been urging that we
recognize now that in the year 2000 we should embark upon
comprehensive trade negotiations,'' he said in an interview with
Dow Jones Newswires.

hong Kong share prices close higher

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong closed higher in
lackluster trading Friday.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 49.81 points, or 0.5 percent,
closing at 9,997.99. On Thursday, the index slumped 189.14 points.
	   Turnover fell to 4.23 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 542
million), down from Thursday's 6.83 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 875 million).
	   Brokers said share prices rose in selective bargain-hunting
following Thursday's declines.
	   The Hong Kong market was also boosted by gains on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, where the Nikkei index rose 1.37 percent on
speculation the Japanese government may announce a
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package next week.
	   But trading was light as many investors stayed on the sidelines
to see if the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next
week.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 1.75 Hong Kong
dollars to 52.00, and Cheung Kong rose 25 cents to 55.75.
	   Banking shares were mixed. Hang Seng Bank rose 75 cents to
64.50, but HSBC Holdings fell 1.00 dollar to 178.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 75 cents to 53.75, and Swire
Pacific ``A'' rose 10 cents to 35.50.

JAL president outlines moves to cut labor costs, restore
</HEADLINE>
profitability
 &UR; By MARTIN FACKLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The president of Japan Airlines Co. said Friday he
will cut jobs, reduce wages and hire cheaper foreign workers to
restore the money-losing carrier to profitability.
	   ``Right now we are passing through a period of turbulence,''
Isao Kaneko told a press conference.
	   ``I'm confident we'll be in the black by the end of this fiscal
year.''
	   While foreigners accounted for only a small fraction of the
6,300 flight attendants at Japan's largest airline in 1991, Kaneko
said he hopes to increase that ratio to about one quarter by 2001.
	   He also said JAL will offer full benefits to fewer Japanese
hires, signing them instead to short-term contracts.
	   Doing that should pare labor costs by an average of 10 percent
per employee, he said.
	   JAL will also cut an additional 2,300 ground jobs over the next
three years, largely through early retirement, transferring
employees to subsidiaries and limiting the number of new hires.
	   Altogether, the steps are expected to lower JAL's labor costs by
40 percent by the end of this year.
	   Labor costs already are ``now lower than many foreign
competitors,'' Kaneko said.
	   Some of JAL's cost-cutting measures were already showing
results, he said. A cap on wage increases has brought the salaries
of Boeing 747 pilots down to the same level as U.S.-based United
Airlines, though they were still more expensive than European or
Asian competitors.
	   He added that he didn't see a threat to his company's bottom
line from new competition from foreign carriers and new cut-rate
domestic carriers because of recent deregulation.
	   Rather, the lower fares would attract more passengers, meaning
there'd be enough to go around for all airlines competing in Japan,
he said.
	   ``The total pie becomes bigger, so all can share,'' he said.
	   Last month, JAL forecast a 10 billion yen (dlrs 83 million) net
profit for this fiscal year, which ends March. Last year, JAL
posted a net loss of 94.2 billion yen (dlrs 785 million).

Reports: China considering fee cuts to spur home-buying
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China is planning sweeping cuts in fees
and taxes imposed on low-priced housing to stimulate private home
purchases, news reports said Friday.
	   China is encouraging families to buy homes after providing free
housing to most of the population for decades. The government hopes
the move will tap into huge personal bank savings and stimulate
consumption, which would help to make up for slowing export growth
amid a regional financial crisis.
	   Construction Minister Yu Zhengsheng said the Cabinet was
studying how to cut fees and taxes on developers, the Shenzhen
Securities Times reported. Yu didn't give any details of proposed
tax changes.
	   Tax and fee cuts under consideration by Shenzhen, a city near
Hong Kong, could cut sale prices by up to 20 percent, a local tax
official told Dow Jones Newswires. Developers would be required to
pass on savings to buyers.
	   Taxes on real estate sales and other fees levied on developers
in China throughout the building process have kept prices high,
even though the supply of private housing far outstrips demand.
	   Yu said the government also will introduce strict quality
guarantees for buyers.
	   ``The quality of housing is one of the biggest problems and
obstacles hindering market development,'' he said.
	   Among other recent measures, the Shanghai city government
announced last month that people who buy homes in Shanghai after
June 1 will be allowed to deduct the purchase price from their
income tax.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Hawaiian-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru
kept his perfect record to share a 6-0 lead with lower-ranked
Kotonishiki on Friday in the 15-day Kyushu Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   One victory behind at 5-1 were Yokozuna Wakanohana, komusubi
(junior champion second class) Musoyama, No. 1 maegashira (senior
wrestler) Kaio, No. 4 maegashira Tamakasuga and No. 9 maegashira
Tosanoumi.
	   Yokozuna Takanohana was another victory back at 4-2.
	   In Friday's match, Musashimaru grabbed Kaio from both sides,
then swiveled him out of the ring with hand thrusts.
	   Kotonishiki, who is a 12th-ranked maegashira, quickly stepped
forward and bulldozed No. 15 maegashira Asanowaka (2-4) out of the
ring.
	   Wakanohana slammed down winless No. 6 maegashira Tochinowaka,
who ended up on his belly.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 21st tournament title and third in a
row, was thrustsed to the ringside, where he suddenly twisted No. 3
maegashira Ganyu's arm and sent him out. Ganyu is 1-5.
	   Musoyama drove out sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai, who
slipped to 4-2.
	   Tamakasuga, despite a bleeding nose resulting from a slap, threw
down No. 6 maegashira Tochinonada (3-3). Tosanoumi pushed down No.
6 maegashira Wakanosato (3-3).
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was
shoved out by No. 8 maegashira Oginishiki (4-2) for his fourth
defeat against two victories.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
drove out No. 4-ranked Daishoho, leaving both 3-3.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
was forced out by No.7-ranked Daishi. Both are 3-3.
	   In makushita, the top junior division, No. 5-ranked Hoshiandesu,
or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez, was pushed out by No. 4-ranked
Daikiyama, slipping to 1-2. No. 8-ranked Kaishinzan, or American
Henry Armstrong Miller, threw down No. 7-ranked Towanoyama for a
perfect 3-0 record.
	   No. 11-ranked Wakaazuma, or Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, shoved
out No. 13-ranked Yutakafuji for 2-1. No. 56-ranked Kyokutenzan
(1-2), or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, was forced out by No.
59-ranked Chiyononada.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 47-ranked
Azumakaze, or Brazilian Tussato Guiuliano Kotinda, was driven out
by No. 49-ranked Fujitora.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

Despite strikes, Rome approves liberalization of cab hours and
</HEADLINE>
fees &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Undeterred by a national demonstration and days of
strikes, Rome's city council on Friday approved a plan forcing
cabbies to adopt more flexible hours and liberalize their tariffs.
	   On Thursday, thousands of cabbies from across Italy joined their
colleagues in down town Rome to protest the new regulations. The
demonstration followed a four-day strike and weeks of sporadic
one-day strikes which snarled traffic and angered many residents
and tourists.
	   The city council approved the measures 35 to 18 following an
all-night session. Mayor Francesco Rutelli called the decision a
``responsible change.''
	   Cabbies returned to work Friday but new protests were expected.
	   The new rules proposed by Rutelli aim at putting more cabs on
the streets and giving passengers some bargaining power over fares.
	   Compared to other European cities, Rome has very few cabs per
inhabitant and finding a taxi during rush hour or at night is a
major feat.
	   According to the new regulations, cabs will have to circulate a
minimum of six hours a day, leaving owners or family members free
to work more if they want when there's demand. Under the old rules,
cabs were locked into maximum shifts of 7 1/2 hours during the day
and nine hours during the night.
	   Cabbies protest that with no limits on shifts they will be
forced to work longer hours to keep up with colleagues who have
more time or stamina.
	   The mayor moved to change the rules after Italy's Antitrust
Authority concluded that Rome's taxi situation had the makings of a
cartel.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Love her or loathe her, she is
impossible to ignore.
	   From taking on the tobacco industry to importing Cuban doctors,
Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, South Africa's first black Minister of Health,
is often at the center of government controversies.
	   On Thursday she notched her latest victory when the upper house
of Parliament gave final approval to one of the world's toughest
anti-smoking laws, which bans lighting up in public places and all
tobacco advertising. It awaits President Nelson Mandela's approval.
	   In some ways she typifies the leadership of the governing
African National Congress as it gears up for national elections
next year, which it likely will sweep.
	   Transformed from liberation fighter to government minister, Zuma
and her colleagues still display the combative political style that
marked the struggle for survival under the onslaught of apartheid.
	   Showing no fear of tackling huge global concerns, like the
prices charged for drugs by pharmaceutical firms, Zuma has pressed
on with her health reforms in spite of fierce criticism from her
opponents.
	   Zuma summed up her own attitude during a parliamentary debate
earlier this year when she lambasted opposition lawmakers for
demonizing her and insisted she would not ``somehow disappear.''
	   ``Forget about the person and look at the issues,'' she snapped.
	   To critics she is the ``nanny of the nation,'' an interfering,
power-hungry busybody who wants to ban smoking in public and whose
mistake prone department squanders millions of rand (dollars).
	   For her defenders, Zuma, 49, is the champion of the poor who
overhauled a racist health system and brought basic care to
millions of blacks ignored during apartheid.
	   Change has come quickly in her four years at the helm since
all-race elections in 1994 ended apartheid.
	   Within months of taking office, she made primary health care
free for pregnant women and children under six. By 1996 it was free
for all South Africans.
	   Shifting resources from wealthy hospitals mainly serving whites,
Zuma launched a campaign to build clinics in poor rural areas. By
the end of 1997 more than 350 had been built, compared to 17 in the
last year of white rule.
	   ``We have brought health care into parts of the country that
never had it before,'' said Zuma's spokesman Vincent Hlongwane.
	   Born in KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma was the oldest child in a family of
eight headed by a primary school teacher. She won a place at
medical school, but left the country to join the ANC in exile and
finished her degree in Britain.
	   From the start Zuma hit the headlines after sponsoring an AIDS
awareness musical that cost one-fifth of the government's AIDS
budget and was shut down due to mishandling the tender for the
lavish production.
	   Other scandals followed, including her backing of anti-AIDS drug
Virodene, which contains a potentially cancerous industrial
solvent.
	   Zuma accuses her detractors of defending elitism and past
privileges. The battlefields of the fight against white rule may
have shifted to the corridors of power, but the language is the
same.
	   ``If you protest her policies, she calls you a racist, or says
you oppose transformation,'' said David Morrell of the South
African Medical Association ``Every change she makes seems to carry
some threat.''
	   Recent criticism came from researchers who attacked her decision
to end funding for expensive AZT treatments for HIV-positive
pregnant women to reduce the risk of passing on the virus to their
children. Zuma said the money was better spent on prevention.
	   While often sympathizing with Zuma's aims, doctors agree she
appears dictatorial and refuses to listen to the other side.
	   ``Her ideals are wonderful,'' said Morrell ``But relations are
very strained. She seems to regard doctors as adversaries.''
	   But she has hung on with the full backing of Mandela, and likely
will stay on in the job after the elections.

Criminal case opened against Communist lawmaker
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prosecutors have opened a criminal investigation
against a Communist lawmaker who has stirred a controversy with a
series of anti-Semitic remarks, officials said Friday.
	   Albert Makashov, a member of parliament and a retired general,
has blamed the country's problems on ``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur
against Jews, and Moscow city prosecutors have officially launched
a probe, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Vladimir Putin, the chief of Russia's Federal Security Service,
said prosecutors were considering charging Makashov with calling
for the violent ouster of the government. He said the FSB would
also urge prosecutors to bring separate charges against Makashov
for his anti-Semitic statements.
	   Makashov enjoys immunity from prosecution as a lawmaker, but
Putin said prosecutors should request that parliament's lower
house, the State Duma, waive the immunity.
	   Communists, who dominate the Duma together with their hardline
allies, last week blocked a resolution condemning Makashov. They
could also block any attempt to lift his immunity.
	   Meanwhile, the Duma on Friday debated a vague measure that
criticizes unspecified lawmakers for ``inciting ethnic tension.''
The measure doesn't contain any specific reference to Makashov or
anti-Semitism.
	   ``This statement is a camouflage, it's simply an attempt to
shrug off the protests,'' said Iosif Kobzon, a popular singer who
is also a member of the Duma.
	   Some Communist officials defended Makashov in speeches last
weekend celebrating the 81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian
revolution, which brought the Communist Party to power.
	   Makashov's statements and the Communist refusal to censure him
have sparked protests in Russia and abroad.
	   Israel's ambassador to Russia said Thursday that Makashov's
attacks were an insult to the entire Israeli nation.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had been only
mildly critical of Makashov in recent days, made a more direct
denunciation on Thursday.
	   ``We consider Makashov's statements inappropriate, unrestrained
and incorrect,'' Zyuganov said.
	   Yelena Mizulina, a member of the liberal Yabloko faction urged
the house to openly condemn Makashov. ``Makashov's words reflect
the opinion of his party comrades,'' she said.
	   Several prominent Russian businessmen and politicians have
called for banning the Communist Party for failing to censure
Makashov.
	   President Boris Yeltsin condemned the Communist Party for its
stance on Makashov, but Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov strongly
opposed the calls for a ban on the party, saying it would
destabilize Russia.

Great Pyramid to acquire gold-encased apex on Millennium Day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Planned
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ For ages the Great Pyramid has been without
its apex, the pointy stone at the top that completes its triangular
shape.
	   Now, Egypt plans to make the Pharaonic structure whole again by
affixing a gold-encased capstone _ if only for one night _ to
celebrate the advent of the third millennium on Dec. 31, 1999, the
pyramid's custodian, Zahi Hawass, told reporters Thursday night.
	   At the same time, he proposed closing entry into the Great
Pyramid forever to prevent it from being damaged beyond repair by
the salty breath and curious fingers of 4,000 visitors a day.
	   Hawass said the millennium ceremony, to be telecast live to a
world audience, will mirror the pomp and revelry that must have
accompanied the installation of the capstone by the pyramid's
builder, Pharaoh Cheops, in a national celebration about 4,600
years ago.
	   ``You know it was built in third millennium B.C. We are
celebrating third millennium A.D. Therefore, we should have
something important to mark the occasion,'' Hawass said.
	   Cheops' pyramid has lost 9 meters (30 feet) of height. Missing
stones at the top give it a craggy flattened appearance like the
opening of a small volcano. This is not evident from the ground
because of the pyramid's size _ it is 137 meters (452 feet) high or
as tall as a 13-story building.
	   Hawass said engineers do not intend to fill all the missing
portion with stone. A steel frame will cover most of the empty area
and a small capstone wrapped in thin gold foil will complete the
top, he said.
	   The stone will be lowered by a helicopter and removed after the
ceremony, he said without elaborating.
	   Hawass said he got the idea from a relief stone carving from
another pyramid near Cairo. It depicted workers dragging a capstone
shining like gold.
	   Another relief showed people dancing and singing following the
setting of the capstone, indicating that the king installed the
last piece of masonry on the pyramid to mark the end of a national
project, he said.
	   Hawass said the Great Pyramid will be reopened to public on Feb.
15, 1999, after nearly one year of closure for restoration.
	   During this time, a new ventilation and lighting system has been
fixed inside the sepulchral chambers, deep inside the pyramid.
Graffiti has been erased from the tomb's walls, and workers also
are removing a layer of salt left by the breath of daily visitors,
he said.
	   But the best way to preserve the pyramid's interior, which
includes Cheops' tomb, would be to close it forever, Hawass said.
	   ``Why do you want to visit a tomb? The magic is from the
outside. Not from the inside,'' he said.
	   If the flood of visitors continues, ``in 10 years you will not
find the tomb exists,'' he warned.
	   However, the decision to close the pyramid can only be taken by
a 25-member committee, which, fearing loss of tourism revenue, does
not entirely agree with him.
	   The Great Pyramid and two other pyramids on the Giza Plateau are
among the world's most recognizable and most visited monuments. The
second pyramid of Chephren will be closed for restoration on Feb.
15, Hawass said.
	   Cheops' pyramid is estimated to contain 2.3 million stone blocks
each weighing an average 2.5 tons. Some weight as much as 15 tons.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Friday in the sixth such
attack in as many days, security officials said.
	   Four hours later, Israeli gunners fired a mortar into a nearby
village, wounding a teenager, the officials said. It was not clear
what prompted the shelling on Arab Saleem village.
	   The officials said two Israeli jets fired four missiles in two
sorties at the abandoned village of Aqmata in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a
Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave
in southern Lebanon.

Former finance official spared jail term in bribery trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to two-year sentence in lede, sted three &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former Finance Ministry official accused of
accepting fancy dinners and golf outings as bribes from financial
institutions was spared imprisonment Friday after receiving a
two-year suspended sentence.
	   Takashi Sakakibara, 39, was convicted of accepting bribes worth
some 3.4 million yen (dlrs 28,000) in dinners and golf outings from
1993 to 1997 from Nomura Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co.,
Daiwa Securities. Co., the now-defunct Yamaichi Securities Co., and
Sumitomo Bank.
	   In return, Sakakibara helped persuade the ministry to let the
brokerages offer new financial products and tipped off Sumitomo
about revisions in Japan's bank law, prosecutors say.
	   They had demanded a three-year jail term for Sakakibara. But the
Tokyo District Court handed down a two-year jail term suspended for
three years and a fine of 3.4 million yen (dlrs 28,000), a court
official said.
	   The sentence means that as long as Sakikibara stays out of
further trouble for the next three years he won't have to spend any
time in prison.
	   The allegations against Sakakibara _ the first senior
career-track bureaucrat to be arrested since the end of World War
II _ shook public faith in the almighty Finance Ministry.
	   Sakakibara and three other former Finance Ministry officials
were arrested earlier this year in a ground-breaking investigation
that cracked down on the lavish entertainment often used in
Japanese business dealings.
	   The other officials have already received suspended sentences.
	   The ministry fired Sakakibara in July. He is no relation to
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, known as ``Mr. Yen'' for his influence in global currency
markets.
	   The ministry has punished more than 100 officials for receiving
gifts and entertainment from financial institutions.
	   But there have been no further arrests, drawing concerns from
some that the investigation had been ended prematurely, possibly
because of political pressure.
	   Japan is trying to drag itself out of a recession, and speedy
action from the elite financial bureaucrats is seen as crucial to
bringing about a turnaround.

Taiwan shares rise after government seeks to bolster market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Shares soared Friday after the government
revealed a 200 million Taiwan dollar (U.S. dlrs 6.1 million) fund
to buy stocks and bolster confidence in the market, but analysts
said the real motivation may have been short-term political gain.
	   The Taiwan Stock Exchange's weighted index climbed 175 points to
close up 2 percent at 6,829.62, following a fall of almost 8
percent over the past two weeks.
	   Dealers said the government's measures announced late Thursday
could temporarily ease selling pressure and boost confidence in the
market.
	   But they questioned whether the measures could assuage concerns
over the long-term financial health of listed companies, warning
that gloomy export performance and other fundamental problems
remain unchanged.
	   The government was attempting to lessen the psychological
fallout from a liquidity crunch and shore up sentiment for the
ruling Nationalist Party ahead of national elections Dec. 5, said
Peter Tsao, Taiwan country manager for ING Barings Securities.
	   Tsao criticized the move, saying: ``Bankruptcy and government
intervention is worse than just bankruptcy alone.''
	   The government said it will buy ``good stocks when necessary,''
and allow troubled companies to suspend trading for up to two
months in order to stabilize falling share prices.
	   Dealers said government buying was detected Friday in the
financial sector, where it usually intervenes. Contributions to the
stabilization fund are coming from government pensions, postal
system savings deposits, insurance companies and public and private
banks.
	   Taiwan's government has lately announced a series of measures to
help shore up the economy _ as fallout from the Asian economic
crisis finally begins to affect the island. Banks have been asked
to continue lending to companies that are sound but suffering from
the business downturn.

McGuire keeps lead in terrible conditions

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand's Marnie McGuire said
she could lead all the way to the title after staying in front
through the second round of the women's Australian Open on Friday.
	   McGuire said she was experienced at protecting a lead and felt
comfortable despite dreadful conditions which cut short the second
round.
	   McGuire shot her second 1-under 72 at the Yarra Yarra course to
lead by two from Australia's Corinne Dibnah (74-72). Favorite
Liselotte Neumann, of Sweden, was a further shot behind after a
scratchy 74.
	   Local favorite Karrie Webb fought back from her opening 78 to
shoot the best round of the day, a 3-under 70, to stay in
contention in the Australian dlrs 350,000 (U.S. dlrs 222,250)
event.
	   Rain delayed the start Friday and 18 players will have to finish
their second rounds early Saturday.
	   McGuire, 29, said the rain and bitter temperatures had made her
feel like she was right at home.
	   ``I feel like I'm in Auckland _ very similar conditions and
similar golf courses,'' McGuire said. ``You've really got to hang
on and sometimes it gets a little hard because you're getting tired
and you've been out there for a long time, but everybody has to
battle that.''
	   Neumann had a difficult round and was in trouble early when she
had a triple-bogey at the par-4 1st hole.
	   Kelly Robbins, of the United States, improved on her opening 75
with a 74 to be five behind McGuire. Fellow American Christie Kerr
fell back with a 78 following her opening 74.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim on Friday filed a
legal challenge to his firing as Malaysia's No. 2 official, while
his wife prepared for a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright next week.
	   The former deputy prime minister's trial on abuse of power and
sexual misconduct charges was temporarily halted. Malaysian
officials want to prevent it from overshadowing the summit next
Tuesday and Wednesday of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
group in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Yet, the Anwar case will still compete for attention with the
summit hosted by Malaysia's strong-willed prime minister, Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Late Friday, attorneys filed a legal challenge to Anwar's
dismissal from the dual jobs as finance minister and deputy prime
minister in early September.
	   ``It's clearly an abuse of power,'' Anwar attorney Karpal Singh
told a crowd of reporters at the High Court. He said Mahathir had
brushed aside constitutional procedures for dismissing a Cabinet
minister.
	   Karpal said that other legal challenges were planned as well.
	   ``I have decided to contest Mahathir's decision to sack me as
deputy prime minister and finance minister,'' Anwar said in a
statement. ``I'm advised that the sacking isn't valid and goes
against the federal constitution.''
	   However, Anwar also made it clear he doesn't want to serve again
under Mahathir's leadership.
	   ``My move to challenge the decision isn't because I yearn to
return under Mahathir. He has lost his integrity, and is cruel and
corrupt,'' the statement said. It added the ouster showed
Mahathir's ``arrogance'' in allegedly trying to put himself above
the law.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, provided the statement to The
Associated Press.
	   Azizah plans to meet with Mrs. Albright, and possibly other
high-level officials, as the summit talks are taking place. U.S.
officials in Washington confirmed plans for the talks with
Albright.
	   ``I'm very, very happy about it and privileged,'' she said of
the meeting with Mrs. Albright.
	   Azizah said the U.S. support of her predicament ``has been very
positive.''
	   Azizah is an ophthalmologist who temporarily gave up her
practice to raise the couple's six children.
	   Her 51-year-old husband was driven back to prison at lunchtime
Friday, after his trial was recessed until Nov. 23. He denies the
charges against him and says he's the victim of a political
vendetta.
	   Before the trial recessed, assistant police commissioner Mazlan
Mohamed Din said he was wrong in forcing two key witnesses to
retract allegations of sexual misconduct against Anwar.
	   ``It was wrong and improper to do so,'' Mazlan said. ``I wasn't
thinking about whether what I was doing was right.''
	   Defense attorney Gurbachan Singh asked Mazlan: ``Do you agree
it's wrong and improper to force a person to tell a lie?''
	   ``Yes,'' Mazlan responded.
	   The prosecution says Anwar ordered police to obtain the
retractions, as part of a cover-up.

Report: Corruption widespread at two Thai ministries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Investigations into corruption scandals
at two government ministries have turned up the involvement of a
high number of officials at all levels, a local newspaper reported
Friday.
	   In the past few months both the health and agriculture
ministries have been rocked by scandals, with an unusual amount of
evidence coming to light. Corruption is a serious problem in
Thailand, but until recently has generally been covered up.
	   Recent changes in the country's political and social climate,
however, have led to greater transparency in government, along with
a more free and aggressive press.
	   The health ministry scandal saw an unprecedented number of
officials willing to testify publicly about a scam in which state
hospitals were forced to buy medicine and equipment at inflated
prices from selected vendors.
	   Since then, the minister and one of his deputies have been
forced to resign. Two other officials face criminal charges and
another has been demoted pending investigation.
	   A health ministry investigation found that officials from the
level of provincial chief and hospital director down were also
implicated in the scheme, the newspaper The Nation reported Friday.
	   ``We have found that the scam was carried out at all levels of
state hospitals in the five provinces and there were numerous
officials involved,'' the ministry's Chief Inspector Wallop Thainua
was quoted saying.
	   A separate investigation of the agriculture ministry case
implicated 29 officials in the procurement of vegetable seeds at
inflated prices, The Nation reported. It said the suspects included
two past and present department directors-general.
	   An investigation by Deputy Permanent Secretary Rungruang
Issarangkul na Ayutthaya found that the officials had set up the
procurement process for the seeds even though they knew it was in
violation of guidelines from the prime minister's office, The
Nation said.
	   In both case, the government may seek to punish high-ranking
officials rather than rank-and-file workers, the newspaper
reported.

Russia, Japan, sign declaration pledging quick end to Kuril

dispute &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with leaders signing declaration on Kurils
dispute &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and Japanese leaders signed a ``Moscow
Declaration'' on Friday in which they pledged to seek an end to
their 53-year-old dispute over the Kuril islands by the end of next
year.
	   If they succeed, it would mean that Russia and Japan could
formally end World War II before the end of the 20th century. The
dispute over ownership of the tiny islands has stopped the two
countries from ever signing a formal peace treaty.
	   The declaration signed by prime ministers Keizo Obuchi of Japan
and Yevgeny Primakov of Russia gives no hint of how the conflict
might be resolved, but sets up a new mechanism _ and a new resolve
_ for doing it.
	   The declaration was signed at the outset of talks between the
two premiers that were otherwise expected to focus on the details
of when and how Japan will hand over an dlrs 800 million
installment on a loan it promised last summer.
	   On Thursday, Obuchi and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
``exchanged views from broad and lofty perspectives,'' as Obuchi's
spokesman put it, in the first formal visit by a Japanese prime
minister to the Russian capital in 25 years.
	   The spokesman, Sadaaki Numata, observed that it was ``not the
sort of discussion that might take place between bankers.''
	   That sort of talk was reserved for Friday's meeting between
Obuchi and Primakov.
	   While the subject of the disputed islands loomed over the talks,
the leaders were also expected to work out the timing and logistics
of Japan's loan, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer. Both the
IMF and the World Bank put their loans on hold after Russia
effectively defaulted on foreign loans at the outset of its
economic crisis in August.
	   In addition to agreeing to free up the loan, Obuchi has offered
to give Russia dlrs 100 million to promote economic development on
the Kuril islands, dlrs 10 million to medical assistance and dlrs
20 million to support youth exchange programs.
	   The two prime ministers were expected to sign a spate of
agreements, including one on guarantees of capital investments that
is expected to pave the way for large-scale Japanese investment in
Russia, ITAR-Tass said.
	   They also were expected to sign memorandums on cooperation in
tourism, transport, mail and telecommunications, as well as support
for Russia's small- and medium-size companies.
	   Relations between the two countries have long been clouded by
the Kuril dispute.
	   Tokyo claimed title to the islands _ Etorofu, Kunashiri,
Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty with Russia in 1875.
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War
II, a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 poor and restive Russian
residents, many of whom would welcome Japanese administration. The
Kurils are important to both countries for symbolic reasons and
because they are surrounded by prime fishing waters.

Three dead as shots fired to block protest marches in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least three people were killed when
Indonesian security forces opened fire with plastic bullets, water
cannons and tear gas on rock-throwing protesters trying to march on
Parliament on Friday.
	   Student activists said more than 50 of their number had been
injured. At least two were hospitalized in critical condition.
	   It was the bloodiest day of protest in a week of student
demonstrations against a special government assembly.
	   Friday's violence erupted at several points near the legislature
and followed similar street battles in Jakarta on Thursday night
that killed another two people.
	   Mobs burned tires as baton-wielding soldiers and troops
dispersed an angry crowd on a major road about two kilometers (one
mile) west of the legislature.
	   Armored personnel carriers, meanwhile, rumbled along Jakarta's
main boulevard after more fighting and stone-throwing also broke
out. Troops fired warning shots and chased thousands of protesters
through Jakarta's downtown area where offices and shops were
closed.
	   Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and plastic
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several
students, some bleeding, were later taken out on stretches.
	   Tosik Sutina, a morgue official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital
said two bodies, both of male students, had been brought in from
the university. They had gunshot wounds to their chests.
	   Other hospitals reported a steady and bloody stream of injured.
	   In East Jakarta a rampaging mob beat a third man to death in a
street as soldiers looked on.
	   Trouble broke out soon after weekly Islamic prayers ended.
Students marched from several campuses in the capital in defiance
of military warnings.
	   The students were blocked from reaching Parliament where a
special government assembly was putting the final touches to a new
political blueprint for the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   On Thursday, a high school student and a police officer died in
hospitals after 20,000 students were blocked by security personnel
from reaching Parliament.
	   At that time, troops and police also dispersed the crowds with
baton charges, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. More
than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
the protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt to
forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   Thursday night's violence was the worst outbreak of unrest in
Jakarta since riots forced Indonesia's former President Suharto to
quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new political
system as Indonesia battles with it worst economic crisis in
decades. Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation
into past corruption.
	   The assembly continued its deliberations on Friday apparently
oblivious to the chaos nearby.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.

Drug company to challenge ban on controversial sterilization
</HEADLINE>
method &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's Vipor Chemicals Ltd., which
supplies pharmaceuticals to international drug companies, plans to
appeal an Indian ban on manufacturing quinacrine pellets used to
sterilize women, Dow Jones Newswires reported Friday.
	   Vipor, based in the western Indian city of Baroda, is believed
to be the world's only producer of quinacrine, which also is used
as a malaria treatment. Vipor sells 2.5 tons to 3 tons of
quinacrine a year, accounting for 10 percent to 15 percent of the
company's sales, Chairman P.S. Patel was quoted as telling Dow
Jones.
	   In August, following complaints that quinacrine as a
sterilization method was painful and possibly dangerous to a
woman's health, the Indian government outlawed the import,
manufacture, sale and distribution of contraceptive pellets of
quinacrine designed to be inserted directly into the uterus.
	   ``We plan to appeal to the Supreme Court,'' Patel was quoted as
saying. ``This is a one-sided judgment and needs to be studied
again.''
	   The World Health Organization opposes quinacrine sterilization,
which are irreversible, saying the drug may cause cancer. The U.S.
Food and Drug Administration recently asked two North
Carolina-based contraceptive researchers to halt all distribution
of quinacrine pellets and to destroy their existing stocks.
	   Though WHO and others have come out against quinacrine pellets,
the method still has its advocates _ including doctors in India _
who say it makes sterilization easy and cheap. Advocates also
question whether there's evidence of a cancer risk.
	   Vipor has received queries from abroad _ including the United
States _ asking about the possible supply of quinacrine pellets,
Patel told Dow Jones Newswires. He believes quinacrine is a safe,
affordable contraceptive for the developing world.
	   Patel said he plans to compile medical data and then ask the
Supreme Court to allow him to make the pellets for export. Seeking
permission to sell quinacrine pellets in India would follow.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Friday in the sixth such
attack in as many days, security officials said.
	   Four hours later, Israeli gunners fired a mortar into a nearby

U.S. commerce secretary promotes business on first Lebanon visit

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on
Friday urged American businesses to get more involved in the
multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction of Lebanon, a country
once synonymous with hijackings and hostage-taking.
	   ``The message I brought is that the United States is back and
wants to do more business in Lebanon,'' Daley said after a meeting
with President-elect Emile Lahoud.
	   ``I look forward to encourage U.S. businesses to participate in
a new and much improved Lebanon,'' he said.
	   Although the United States is Lebanon's second-biggest trading
partner, Daley is the first senior American trade official to visit
this small nation wedged between Israel, Syria and the
Mediterranean Sea.
	   But, as in the rare previous stops by senior U.S. government
officials in recent years, his visit was shrouded by tight security
measures _ an ironic counterpoint to a mission aimed at fostering a
positive atmosphere for American investors.
	   Instead of landing at Beirut's gleaming new international
airport, a U.S. military helicopter ferried Daley from the nearby
island of Cyprus to the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy compound
north of Beirut. This is the route taken by U.S. diplomats for more
than a decade because of terror attacks on Americans in the
mid-1980s.
	   Before leaving Washington, Daley said he'd seek a share of
Lebanon's dlrs 13 billion reconstruction program for American
companies.
	   Daley planned to see Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, chief
architect of the program.
	   U.S. companies have been shut out of major reconstruction
projects after the 1975-90 civil war because of a decade-old U.S.
government travel ban that was lifted last year. Most contracts

Ruth ball sold for record price of dlrs 126,500
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Seventy-five years after Babe Ruth hit the first
home run at Yankee Stadium, the ball soared again _ this time in
bidding at a sports memorabilia auction.
	   The ball, discovered in a New Jersey attic two years ago, was
sold for a record dlrs 126,500 early Friday.
	   Mike Heffner, managing director of Leland's Auctions, said the
buyer _ who made the winning bid by telephone _ did not want to be
identified.
	   ``Obviously, it was worth it,'' Heffner said. ``It's the best
baseball we've ever sold and the price showed it.''
	   The previous record for a baseball was dlrs 93,500 for the ball
that went through Bill Buckner's legs, allowing the New York Mets
to beat the Boston Red Sox in Game 6 of the 1986 World Series,
which they eventually won. That ball was bought by actor Charlie
Sheen in 1992.
	   Mark Scala, a graphic designer from Ramsey, New Jersey, found
the Ruth ball two years ago in the attic of his grandmother's house
in Irvington, New Jersey.
	   After Scala's son, Chris, dressed up as Ruth for a school
project on famous Americans, 87-year-old Viola Bevilacque
remembered the ball that was given to her husband as a prize in
1927 for making the New Jersey all-state high school team.
	   The ball, hit by Ruth on Yankee Stadium's opening day in 1923,
was kept in the attic of the house she has lived in since 1946.
	   Scala played in that attic as a youngster, among old clothes and
cartons, never realizing the treasure in one old box with some
other long-discarded baseballs.
	   When he found out about the ball, which was signed by Ruth and
carried an inscription identifying it as the first home run in
Yankee Stadium, Scala took it to the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown,
New York. There, he met Peter Clark, curator of collections for the
baseball shrine.
	   ``The only reason we went there was to get their opinion, not to
authenticate it,'' Scala said.
	   The first question he asked was whether Cooperstown had Ruth's
first Yankee Stadium home run ball. Clark confirmed that it was not
in the museum. He also told Scala that Ruth's signature on his ball
was consistent with the Babe's autograph.
	   That was good enough for Scala.
	   He took the ball to authenticators, who examined its red and
blue stitching, consistent with the technique used in 1923, and the
inscription. They confirmed that Scala did, indeed, have the first
Yankee Stadium homer, Ruth's exclamation point on the ballpark's
opening day.
	   When stories about the Ruth ball began circulating, Scala's
grandmother got a phone call.
	   ``It was from a man in his 90s, who said he knew my
grandfather,'' Scala said. ``He called just to say what a nice man
my grandfather was. It was wonderful for my grandmother to get a
call like that.''

Three students released from jail, protests expected
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOVANA GEC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Three of four students, arrested
last week for spraying antigovernment graffiti, were released
Friday, amid expanding plans to protest government control of their
university.
	   Teodora Tabacki, Marina Glisic and Dragana Milinkovic were
detained and sentenced to 10 days in prison after they were caught
spraying a clenched fist, the symbol of student resistance. The
fourth student's release was expected later Friday.
	   Belgrade university students are no stranger to protest. They
participated in three months of antigovernment demonstrations in
1996. Now they are calling for protests throughout the university
against a law that allows the government to name the dean and the
professors without any input from students or faculty.
	   Several prominent law and engineering professors have been
sacked in the past several weeks. Most belong to opposition parties
or have criticized President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   For the past decade of Milosevic's rule _ first over Serbia, a
Yugoslav republic, and then over Yugoslavia proper _ Belgrade
university has been the center of pro-democracy movement. During
the 1996 street demonstrations against annulment of an opposition
victory in Serbian cities, the students added most of the humor and
imagination to the movement.
	   After three months, Milosevic's autocratic government was forced
to back down and hand over power to opposition in many towns. But
the victory was temporary _ the political opposition crumbled,
leaving his government as a strong as ever. Authorities recently
moved against the university and independent media by passing two
restrictive laws aimed at curbing opponents at home.
	   Following dismissal of several professors, the students started
organizing protests and boycotts of lectures held by their
replacements.
	   On Thursday the student organization ``Otpor'' (Resistance),
called for a strike at the philology department after the new dean,
a member of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, suspended
several professors and closed down the world literature section.
The dean, Radmilo Marojevic, said there was no need to study world
literature.
	   Boris Karajicic, a student activist, said a general boycott of
the philology faculty would start Nov. 23 and last until Marojevic
is replaced and all his decisions are annulled. Similar actions can
be expected at other faculties.

Ballerina Svetlana Beriosova dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Svetlana Beriosova, who danced across many stages
in Britain, has died at age 66.
	   Beriosova died Tuesday at St. Charles's Hospital in London,
according to a death notice published Friday in The Daily
Telegraph. She died of cancer, according to an obituary published
Thursday in The Guardian.
	   Born in 1932 to the late ballet master Nicholas Berizoff in
Lithuania, Beriosova grew up around the stage, following her father
as he moved to ballet companies throughout Europe and the United
States, the newspaper said.
	   Her own dancing career began in New York in 1941 when she
appeared with Massine's Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo as Clara in
``The Nutcracker.'' Her professional debute as an adult came in
1947 in ``The Nutcracker'' and ``Les sylphides'' with Canada's
Ottawa Ballet.
	   She followed her father in joining the Cuevas Grand Ballet in
Monte Carlo that same year, then went with him to England in 1948
to join the Metropolitan Ballet. When that company folded in 1949,
Beriosova accepted an invitation from Ninette de Valois to join the
Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet, where she stayed until her
retirement in 1975.
	   She created the role of Princess Belle Rose in Cranko's ``The
Prince of the Pagodas'' and the title role in ``Antigone,'' and
George Balanchine created the leading role of ``Trumpet Concerto''
for her.
	   She was also the principal dancer in Kenneth MacMillan's
``Diversions'' where she undertook the spoken role, speaking in
French as well the dancing.
	   In 1959, she married the late Mohammed Masud Khan; their
marriage was dissolved 15 years later. She had no children.
	   A funeral service will be held at All Saints Russian Orthodox
Cathedral on Nov. 19, followed by private cremation.

Great Pyramid to acquire gold-encased apex on Millennium Day
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ For ages, the Great Pyramid has been without
its apex, the pointy stone top that completes its triangular shape.
	   Now, Egypt plans to make the Pharaonic structure whole again by
affixing a gold-encased capstone _ if only for one night _ to
celebrate the advent of the third millennium on Dec. 31, 1999, the
pyramid's custodian, Zahi Hawass, told reporters Thursday night.
	   At the same time, he proposed closing entry into the Great
Pyramid forever to prevent it from being damaged beyond repair by
the salty breath and curious fingers of 4,000 visitors a day.
	   Hawass said the millennium ceremony, to be telecast live to a
world audience, will mirror the pomp and revelry that must have
accompanied the installation of the capstone by the pyramid's
builder, Pharaoh Cheops, in a national celebration about 4,600
years ago.
	   ``You know it was built in third millennium B.C. We are
celebrating third millennium A.D. Therefore, we should have
something important to mark the occasion,'' Hawass said.
	   Cheops' pyramid has lost 9 meters (30 feet) of height. Missing
stones at the top give it a craggy flattened appearance like the
opening of a small volcano. This is not evident from the ground
because of the pyramid's size _ it is 137 meters (452 feet) high or
as tall as a 13-story building.
	   The stones are believed to have fallen off many centuries ago,
and there is no record how it happened. It could have been due to
erosion, vandals or grave robbers.
	   Hawass said engineers do not intend to fill all the missing
portion with stone. A steel frame will cover most of the empty area
and a small capstone wrapped in thin gold foil will complete the
top, he said.
	   The stone will be lowered by a helicopter and removed after the
ceremony, he said without elaborating.
	   Hawass said he got the idea from a relief stone carving from
another pyramid near Cairo. It depicted workers dragging a capstone
shining like gold.
	   Another relief showed people dancing and singing following the
setting of the capstone, indicating the king installed the last
piece of masonry on the pyramid to mark the end of a national
project, he said.
	   Hawass said the Great Pyramid will be reopened to public on Feb.
15, 1999, after nearly one year of closure for restoration.
	   During this time, a new ventilation and lighting system has been
fixed inside the sepulchral chambers, deep inside the pyramid.
Graffiti has been erased from the tomb's walls, and workers also
are removing a layer of salt left by the breath of daily visitors,
he said.
	   But the best way to preserve the pyramid's interior, which
includes Cheops' tomb, would be to close it forever, Hawass said.
	   ``Why do you want to visit a tomb? The magic is from the
outside. Not from the inside,'' he said.
	   If the flood of visitors continues, ``in 10 years you will not
find the tomb exists,'' he warned.
	   However, the decision to close the pyramid can only be taken by
a 25-member committee, which fears the loss of tourism revenue.
	   The Great Pyramid and two other pyramids on the Giza Plateau are
among the world's most recognizable and most visited monuments. The
second pyramid of Chephren will be closed for restoration on Feb.
15, Hawass said.
	   Cheops' pyramid is estimated to contain 2.3 million stone blocks
each weighing an average 2.5 tons. Some weight as much as 15 tons.

Grenade thrown into Hebron square, fails to explode
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with army saying only one grenade was thrown and
didn't explode, curfew on downtown Hebron &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A grenade was hurled Friday at an
Israeli military outpost in downtown Hebron, but failed to go off,
an army officer said.
	   In response, the army imposed a curfew on the downtown area of
Hebron, confining some 30,000 Palestinians to their homes. The 450
Jewish settlers in Hebron do not have to observe the curfew.
	   The incident occurred shortly after Friday noon prayers in Gross
Square which is heavily patrolled by Israeli soldiers. An assailant
threw a grenade at an Israeli checkpoint, but the device did not go
off. Israeli soldiers fired several shots in the air. They later
ordered bystanders to leave to allow sappers to detonate the hand
grenade.
	   In a similar incident in September, an activist in the Islamic
militant group Hamas threw two hand grenades at a group of Israeli
soldiers in Gross Square. A dozen soldiers and several Palestinian
civilians were injured. The assailant was later arrested by Israel.
	   Hebron is a divided city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers. Israel controls the downtown area. str-kl

Striking museum workers shut Orsay for fourth straight day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Orsay Museum of 19th century art remained
closed Friday for the fourth straight day, and personnel voted to
extend the strike for better working conditions, museum officials
said.
	   Museum employees are protesting what they call increasingly
difficult working conditions at the museum which houses France's
largest collection of Impressionist masterpieces.
	   The employees link worsening conditions to the huge crowds
visiting the popular temporary exhibition ``Millet-Van Gogh.''
	   The show, which opened in September to wide critical acclaim,
presents dozens of Van Gogh paintings side-by-side with the works
by Jean-Francois Millet which inspired them. It runs through Jan.
3.
	   The Orsay Museum, a renovated train station overlooking the
Seine, is one the city's most popular tourist attractions, drawing
some 3 million visitors annually.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's bickering political
parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a
coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime
minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced.
	   In a long-elusive compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh will become president of the National Assembly resulting
from disputed elections in July, even though Hun Sen's party holds
a majority of 64 seats in the 122-member chamber.
	   Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party dropped insistence on a joint
assembly chairmanship shared by Ranariddh and party boss Chea Sim,
the current speaker. It was one of the main stumbling blocks in
months of discord.
	   Instead, Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modified
to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head. Chea Sim will
still serve as acting head of state during the king's frequent
absences from the country.
	   ``The major political crisis in the country has been resolved
and the political deadlock facing the nation has also come to an
end,'' the king said in his statement.
	   The Senate will initially be appointed by the king. The
agreement did not say how many seats there would be, nor how they
would be divided. The parties will hammer out details later.
	   Pok Than, one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would
serve a mostly advisory role to the assembly.
	   The senior Senate leaders will join those of the assembly, the
prime minister and the country's top two Buddhist monks in a
delicate balance of power on the council that will choose
Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies.
	   The two parties said that the assembly would convene again Nov.
25.
	   The agreement came surprisingly quickly following Ranariddh's
return Thursday from Thailand, where he had been holed up with
other opposition figures for weeks amid fears for their safety if
they stayed in Cambodia.
	   The deal should allow rapid formation of a government between
the CPP and Ranariddh's royalist FUNCINPEC to allow international
donors and businesses to again operate in the poverty-stricken
country, which is in desperate need of aid.
	   It could also hasten Cambodia's entry into the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold last year after Hun Sen
deposed Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup.
	   Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second
day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form
a coalition and made ``important concessions.''
	   The king, the sole force in Cambodian politics able to broker a
deal, pressured both sides to reach agreement before he leaves
Saturday for medical treatment in Beijing.
	   Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to a request
by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political
pardons.
	   All five were convicted of political crimes by courts that are
widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has powers to grant
pardons, but has awaited agreement from Hun Sen in politically
sensitive cases.
	   Former battlefield enemies, the CPP and FUNCINPEC have been at
loggerheads since the CPP narrowly won parliamentary elections in
July. The vote failed to put an end to instability that followed
last year's coup.
	   The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a
government alone. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy
held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud and
intimidation.
	   The opposition organized protests in Phnom Penh seeking Hun
Sen's ouster that were violently dispersed.
	   Sam Rainsy, under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his
role in the demonstrations, has remained abroad. His 15 seats in
the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working
government.

Kosovo Albanians swapped for Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rugova comments
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed Serb civilians swapped
hostages with ethnic Albanian guerrillas on Friday, after
international monitors intervened to defuse the crisis.
	   All three sides _ Kosovo Albanians, Serb officials and the
monitors _ confirmed that two Serb civilians held since Wednesday
by the separatist guerillas were released in exchange for the seven
remaining ethnic Albanians still held by the Serbs.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot
throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo, the
Albanian-majority Serbian province.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
	   The detentions, and emotional pledges of revenge at a funeral
for slain fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerillas,
reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian tensions even after an
Oct. 12 agreement to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists has left
hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more.
	   In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told
Serbs _ a less than 10 percent minority in the province _ they had
nothing to fear from the October agreement, ultimately aimed at
restoring wide-ranging Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   ``All Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told
reporters.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on
Friday urged American businesses to get more involved in the
multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction of Lebanon, a country
once synonymous with hijackings and hostage-taking.
	   ``The message I brought is that the United States is back and
wants to do more business in Lebanon,'' Daley said after a meeting
with President-elect Emile Lahoud.
	   He said he looked forward to encouraging ``U.S. businesses to
participate in a new and much improved Lebanon.''

Asian stock markets close mixed

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week mixed
Friday, with prices rising in Tokyo on speculation the Japanese
government may announce a larger-than-expected economic stimulus
package next week.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average recovered from
a midday dip into negative territory, rising 193.15 points, or 1.37
percent, to close at 14,268.21. On Thursday, the average closed
down 352.96 points, or 2.45 percent.
	   The economic package was expected to meet or exceed a set of
proposals issued Thursday by the ruling party which called for a
record 18 trillion yen (dlrs 149 billion) in spending on public
works projects and tax cuts.
	   Major Japanese newspapers reported Friday that it would total
between 20 trillion yen (dlrs 165 billion) and 22 trillion yen
(dlrs 181 billion).
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.68 yen in late
afternoon trading, down 1.54 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and
also below its late New York level of 121.98 yen overnight.
	   Share prices in Taiwan also surged following the unveiling of
the Taiwanese government's latest stimulus package for the
beleaguered bourse.
	   Among the measures announced by Taiwan's Ministry of Finance
late Thursday was the setting up of a task force to buy stocks when
necessary, and to allow financially-troubled companies to apply for
a suspension of trading.
	   The Taipei's market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 174.83
points, or 2.6 percent, to 6,829.62.
	   Philippine shares closed lower on negative sentiment spawned by
the aborted announcement of the buy-in of Hong Kong's First Pacific
Co. into Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 22.17 points,
or 1.3 percent, to 1,711.98.
	   Elsewhere:
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The benchmark
NZSE-40 Capital Index fell 19.80 points, or 0.9 percent, to
1,994.91.
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed higher in lackluster trading. The
blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 49.81 points, or 0.5 percent,
closing at 9,997.99.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower. The All Ordinaries
Index fell 27.0 points, or 0.99 percent, to 2,681.3.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index edged up 0.78 point to 404.30.
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed. The Straits Times Index
rose 9.72 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,206.91.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher. The
Composite Index rose 4.31 points, or 0.9 percent, to 465.08.
	   JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed slightly lower in extremely
quiet trading with many investors absent amid fresh clashes between
security forces and students in the capital. The Composite Index
fell 2.436 points, or 0.6 percent, to 355.540.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed marginally higher in moderate
trading. The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index rose 0.53
points to 333.59.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix slug &QL; 
San Francisco &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Boston tried to figure out the next step
following Mo Vaughn's departure. Meanwhile, AL East rival Baltimore
began retooling by agreeing to a dlrs 16 million, four-year
contract with Mike Timlin.
	   As baseball's offseason marketplace remained busy, Seattle
plugged a hole in its beleaguered pitching staff by agreeing to a
two-year contract Thursday with closer Jose Mesa.
	   Outfielder Ellis Burks decided to re-sign with the San Francisco
Giants, getting a dlrs 10 million, two-year deal. And pitcher
Masato Yoshii, who had the option of becoming a free agent,
accepted a dlrs 5 million, two-year contract to stay with the New
York Mets.
	   Meanwhile, Cleveland was said to have made an offer to second
baseman Roberto Alomar, and San Diego was negotiating to retain
third baseman Ken Caminiti. The Padres also were trying to deal
reliever Randy Myers.
	   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette left the general managers'
meetings in Naples, Florida, to pursue other free agents, team
spokesman Kevin Shea said. After Vaughn rejected a dlrs 62.5
million, five-year offer that Boston said was its final proposal,
Duquette mentioned outfielders Albert Belle and Bernie Williams,
third basemen Robin Ventura and Ken Caminiti and first baseman
Rafael Palmeiro as players of interest.
	   ``The Red Sox are a team that Robin would want to play for,''
John Boggs, Ventura's agent, said Thursday. ``They're very close to
winning.''
	   Vaughn has been offered a dlrs 72 million, six-year contract by
the Anaheim Angels, but isn't close to deciding where he wants to
play.
	   Baltimore, after finishing with the highest payroll in baseball
and a losing record, didn't waste much time in starting to rebuild.
	   Timlin, who excelled after taking over the closer's job in
Seattle for the second half of the season, pitched in a career-high
70 games for the Mariners. The 32-year-old right-hander was 3-3
with a team-high 19 saves and 2.95 ERA.
	   ``This is the first of what we hope are many moves to improve
our ballclub,'' said Frank Wren, the Orioles' new general manager.
``It was very apparent that one of our primary needs was to get a
closer.''
	   The Orioles were a disappointing 79-83 last season and finished
fourth in the AL East, 35 games behind New York. Armando Benitez
was inconsistent as the closer, going 5-6 with 22 saves and a 3.82
ERA.
	   Timlin made dlrs 3,025,000 in 1998. With the Orioles, he gets a
dlrs 1 million signing bonus, a dlrs 2 million salary in 1999, dlrs
4 million each in 2000 and 2001 and dlrs 5 million in 2002.
	   Mesa, traded from Cleveland to San Francisco in July, takes over
as Seattle's closer. He was 3-4 with one save and a 5.17 ERA in 44
games as Mike Jackson's setup man in Cleveland, then went 5-3 with
a 3.52 ERA in 32 games with the Giants.
	   Burks, a 34-year-old outfielder, was acquired by San Francisco
from Colorado on July 31 for Darryl Hamilton. The two-time All-Star
hit .292 with 21 homers and 76 RBIs this season. With the Giants,
he batted .306 with five homers and 22 RBIs.
	   Coming off a dlrs 9.1 million, two-year contract, Burks gets
dlrs 4.5 million next season and dlrs 5.5 million in 2000.
	   ``Today's signing of Ellis Burks has significantly improved our
run-producing capabilities,'' Giants general manager Brian Sabean
said. ``As we all witnessed late last season, Ellis really changes
the look of our lineup.''
	   Yoshii, a 33-year-old right-hander, joined the Mets last January
following a successful career in Japan. He went 6-8 with a 3.93 ERA
in 29 starts.
	   ``Masato deserves a lot of credit,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``He easily could have stayed in Japan last season
and made more money, but he was determined to prove himself in the
United States. He did just that and more.''
	   Yoshii had a dlrs 200,000 base salary with the Mets this year,
but earned dlrs 875,000 more in performance bonuses to increase his
earnings to dlrs 1,075,000. His new deal calls for salaries of dlrs
2 million next year and dlrs 3 million in 2000.
	   ``I really enjoyed myself with the Mets last year,'' Yoshii said
in a statement. ``Bobby understands me and the type of pitcher I
am. I think I proved I can pitch in the major leagues last season,
and it is my goal this year to improve and help the Mets get to the
playoffs.''

Ugandan telecomms market to expand under privatization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ In a report on telephone expansion in
Uganda, the International Finance Corp. says the number of fixed
telephone connections in Uganda will more than double by 2002 to 1
for every 50 people.
	   The report by the commercial lending arm of the World Bank was
made available to the Associated Press Friday, a week before the
opening of private bids to purchase 51 percent of government-owned
Uganda Telecommunications Ltd.
	   Leonard Muganwa, head of the Public Enterprise Reform and
Divestiture office, said two consortia, one including WorldTel and
the German Detecon, and the other including Nostrad and Saskatel,
have qualified.
	   Two private cellular phone companies _ Celtel and Mobile
Telecommunications Network of South Africa _ are already operating
in the nation of 22.5 million.
	   MTN, which has invested half of an estimated dlrs 70 million in
Uganda, will introduce fixed telephone services early next year.
	   Privatization of the telecommunications sector is also moving
ahead in Tanzania, but it has not yet begun in Kenya, the third
member of the East African Cooperation.
	   In 1991, the state-owned Uganda Posts and Telecommunications
Corp. was split into Uganda Posts, UTL and Post Bank.
	   Muganwa said the government will temporarily retain the 49
percent of shares in UTL which it will eventually sell to private
investors. No one was willing to talk about the value of UTL.
	   The IFC said that prior to the split, UPTC had a revenue
equivalent to dlrs 20 million that rose to dlrs 59 million in 1997.
	   The report said 410 of UTL's 1,600 employees would be laid off
after privatization.
	   The demand for telephone lines is projected at 380,000 by 2006
from the current installed base of 51,829 lines, the report said.
	   International inbound traffic is expected to increase from 16
million minutes in 1997 to 176 million minutes in 2006.
	   During the same period, international outbound traffic will
increase from 6 million minutes in 1997 to 92 million minutes in
2006, the report said.

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court refused Friday
to block Bavaria's attempts to deport to Turkey a 14-year-old
Turkish juvenile delinquent born and raised in Germany.
	   The Constitutional Court ruled unanimously that arguments filed
by the boy, known as ``Mehmet,'' that his rights were being
violated were inadmissable, thus closing his case.
	   But it was not immediately clear when or if he could be
deported, since his parents have had his passport invalidated by
Turkish officials.
	   The Mehmet case made headlines this summer when Bavarian
officials sought to deport not only the boy, who was born and
raised in Munich, but also his parents, who have lived and worked
in Germany for 30 years.
	   Although the parents had never been in trouble with the law,
they were accused of endangering public safety by failing to raise
their son properly.
	   Courts have blocked the deportation of the parents. But the
entire case became an election-year issue, with liberals accusing
the ruling conservatives of using a family tragedy to score points
with voters who blame foreigners for rising crime.
	   Bavaria's highest court last month upheld the state's decision
to deny Mehmet a new residency permit because of a string of
violent offenses, thus clearing the way for a deportation. But his
lawyer had appealed to the Constitutional Court.
	   In the meantime, his parents have had Mehmet's Turkish passport
declared void and refuse to grant permission for a new one to be
issued. Without valid travel documents, the boy can not be
deported.
	   Bavarian officials have asked the Foreign Ministry to take the
issue up with Turkish officials in Ankara, but Foreign Ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said last month that his office would not
do so until all legal avenues in Germany are exhausted.
	   Although a passport for a minor can not be issued without the
parents' consent, Bavarian officials could ask a German court to
force the boy's parents to comply.

Jews gather in Jerusalem for assembly despite tension over Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish leaders from abroad are showing up in
full force for a series of conventions and gatherings this month,
despite a U.S. government recommendation to tourists to stay away
from the region, a Jewish Agency official said Friday.
	   The Israeli army operated extra gas mask distribution stations
in Israel on Friday for the second day in a row, as Israeli
officials expected a U.S. attack on Iraq in the coming days.
	   About 3,000 Jewish leaders are expected in Jerusalem for several
gatherings and conventions, said organizers. ``There have been no
cancellations,'' said Michael Jankelowitz, spokesman of the Jewish
Agency which raises funds and co-ordinates immigration of Jews to
Israel.
	   ``This is the third time (Iraqi ruler) Saddam Hussein has done
this, and people aren't getting scared,'' he said.
	   Jankelowitz said Jewish leaders abroad have been calling others
already here to check on the situation.
	   ``They hear that life is going on normally here,'' said
Jankelowitz. ``That is the reason there is no drop in
participation, despite the State Department travel advisory.''
	   Among the events scheduled for November is the first-ever
session in Israel of leaders from local Jewish federations and the
United Jewish Appeal fund-raising drive. The gathering, known as
the General Assembly, usually convenes in the United States.

Amid military threat, Iraq turns blind eye to loss of Arab support

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fearing U.S. air strikes, thousands of
Iraqis queued up outside gasoline stations Friday as Iraq's
official media ignored the evident loss of Arab support in its
confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Official newspapers published articles hailing President Saddam
Hussein's decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission, and claimed there was worldwide condemnation of
American threats.
	   The United States has beefed up its military strength in the
Gulf and is threatening to launch air strikes in a bid to force
Iraq to allow inspections by the Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The world calls for dialogue and peace and America seeks war
and aggression,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Baath party newspaper, said in a banner headline.
	   The newspapers made no mention of the warning issued to Iraq
Thursday by six Gulf Arab countries _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors
_along with Syria and Egypt.
	   They called for ``wisdom and reason'' to end the confrontation
but said Saddam's government alone would be ``responsible for any
consequences'' from its stopping the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The criticism was unusually strong for Arab countries who have
repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said if the Arab countries are sincere about resolving the crisis,
``they should blame the main block ... the United States.''
	   Hours later, Iraqi newspapers Friday claimed Iraq was capable of
defeating the United States.
	   At a Friday prayer sermon, a preacher urged Arabs and Muslis to
``declare war on America'' and rally behind Iraq. Friday sermons
are usually screened by the goverment.
	   ``I call upon you ... do not let their aeroplanes use your
airspace or bases. do not give them any facilities,'' said the
preacher, Abdullatif Humeim.
	   The feeling of an imminent strike was evident from the rush to
fill up gasoline. At one station, about 20 cars were queued up in
front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Iraqi officials escorting journalists said it was forbidden to
take pictures or talk to the people at the gas staiton.
	   A customer contacted later said he waited a half-hour to fill up
his car. ``I fear the Americans will hit refineries and there will
be a shortage of fuel,'' said the driver who did not wish to be
identified.
	   Markets in Baghdad were crammed, but the crowd comprised the
usual weekend shoppers.
	   At the Al-Shorja market, 40-year-old Naima Aidan said she was
buying coconut and sugar to make sweets for her four children. ``I
am not worried. I don't think anything will happen to us. Because
God will keep us safe,'' she said.
	   Since Wednesday, the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all
its weapons inspectors and one-third of the 450 people working on
the humanitarian programs.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler called it ``a very serious
confrontation'' and said diplomatic solutions seem remote.
	   ``There's a growing sense that air strikes or enforcement is
becoming more and more likely,'' he told MSNBC television on
Thursday night.
	   Iraq says it is will cooperate with arms inspectors only if the
U.N. Security Council guarantees that it will work to lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its
economy, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq
has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required under the
cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Aziz has said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the
best person'' to try to ease the current crisis. But Annan said
Thursday he has no plans to visit Baghdad as he did the last time
in February and resolved a previous crisis.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least three people were killed when
Indonesian security forces opened fire with plastic bullets, water
cannons and tear gas on rock-throwing protesters trying to march on
Parliament on Friday.
	   Student activists said more than 50 of their number had been
injured. At least two were hospitalized in critical condition.
	   It was the bloodiest day of protest in a week of student
demonstrations against a special government assembly and the worst
violence since May when former authoritarian President Suharto was
forced to quit after 32 years in power.
	   Friday's violence erupted at more than five points near the
legislature and followed similar street battles in Jakarta on
Thursday night that killed another two people and injured more than
100.
	   Two armored personnel carriers rumbled through downtown Jakarta
and three small tanks drove down a toll road taken over by marching
students.
	   Mobs burned tires as baton-wielding soldiers and troops
dispersed an angry crowd on a major road about two kilometers (one
mile) west of the legislature.
	   Troops fired warning shots and chased thousands of protesters
down Jakarta's main boulevard where offices and shops were closed.
	   Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and plastic
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several
students, some bleeding, were later taken out on stretches.
	   Tosik Sutina, a morgue official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital,
said two bodies, both male students, had been brought in from the
university. They had gunshots wound to their chests.
	   Students at the hospital identified the dead by the single
names, Ridwan and Teddi.
	   Other hospitals reported a steady and bloody stream of injured.
	   In East Jakarta, a rampaging mob beat a third man to death in a
street as soldiers looked on.
	   Trouble broke out soon after weekly Islamic prayers ended.
Students marched from several campuses in the capital in defiance
of military warnings.
	   The students were blocked from reaching Parliament where a
special government assembly was putting the final touches to a new
political blueprint for the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   On Thursday, a high school student and a police officer died in
hospitals after 20,000 students were blocked by security personnel
from reaching Parliament.
	   At that time troops and police also dispersed the crowds with
baton charges, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. More
than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
the protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt to
forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new
political system as Indonesia battles with it worst economic crisis
in decades. Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation
into past corruption.
	   The assembly continued its deliberations on Friday apparently
oblivious to the chaos nearby.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.

Pacific trade talks adjourn without broad tariff deal

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Senior officials from Pacific Rim
countries failed Friday to achieve the goal of a broad package of
tariff cuts aimed at expanding global trade, as various countries
led by Japan sought to carve out exceptions for politically
sensitive goods.
	   A frustrated U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky left
what she called an ``exceptionally blunt'' meeting with the
Japanese saying the United States was growing ``increasingly
impatient with Japan on this and a number of issues.''
	   A senior Japanese official quoted Barshefsky as saying,
``Clinton and I feel a strong sense of indignation that Japan is
not going along with the agreement'' reached last year at the
summit of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
in Vancouver, Canada, to lower trade barriers in nine areas.
	   The United States had hoped to achieve broad agreement on a
massive package of tariff cuts covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in traded
goods, ranging from chemicals to medical equipment, as a way of
demonstrating that during the current global financial crisis the
Pacific Rim nations were not turning protectionist.
	   However, Japan, the world's second largest economy, argued that
it could not participate in two key sectors _ forestry products and
fish _ because Japanese producers were already struggling with the
country's worst recession in 50 years.
	   Other countries also pushed to exempt specific products or draw
out the deadlines for cutting tariffs, arguing that with much of
Asia in recession it would be politically difficult to sell faster
removal of border tariffs.
	   Philippines Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said it ``would not
be the end of the world'' if the final agreement doesn't include
all nine sectors. He also credited Japan for the financial support
it has offered to its battered Asian neighbors.
	   ``People keep blaming Japan because it has difficulty with two
sectors, but you have to look at Japan's situation,'' he said.
	   During two days of closed-door talks, the senior APEC officials
discussed scaled-back options that will be taken up by their bosses
_ trade ministers and foreign ministers of the countries _ at
meetings in Kuala Lumpur on Saturday and Sunday.
	   The Japanese official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that Barshefsky at points became so irritated she beat her pen
against a pad and looked like she ``wanted to pound a table.''
	   ``She berated Japan for not taking a leadership role in Asia,''
the official said. ``She also accused Japan of trying to export its
way out of its economic problems.''
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is scheduled to leave
Washington on Saturday for the APEC leaders' meeting, and other
American officials have repeatedly said that the forum's 21 members
must move forward with tariff cuts to show nervous financial
markets that the Pacific region is not turning inward.
	   The impasse on trade issues cast a further cloud over an already
troubled APEC summit. With Clinton weighing the possibility of air
strikes against Iraq, his administration had been seriously
considering canceling the president's 10-day trip to Asia, which
will also include stops in Japan and South Korea.
	   The Clinton administration has been concerned about the
anti-free market positions taken by Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, the host for the gathering, and his handling of
the firing and jailing of Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim as well.
	   Hoping to reduce pressure to eliminate trade barriers and
demonstrate that it is doing its part to pull Asia out of a deep
slump, Japan on Thursday unveiled a proposed 18 trillion yen (dlrs
148 billion) economic stimulus package.
	   U.S. officials were also working behind the scenes to line up
support for proposals to help debt-ridden banks and companies in
countries leveled by the flight of frightened foreign investors. In
addition, Washington wants a bigger social safety net for millions
of people pushed back into poverty by the Asian crisis.
	   Malaysian government officials have made it clear that Mahathir
will use his prerogative as meeting chairman to push views directly
opposed to the free-market approach championed by the United States
and the International Monetary Fund.
	   In a speech Friday to an APEC trade fair, Mahathir called the
steps he has taken to insulate his economy from the global turmoil
the way to put Malaysia ``quickly on the path of recovery.''
	   He attacked international credit rating agencies, which have
downgraded Malaysia's credit rating, as ``negative and biased'' and
forecast that his economy, now in a deep recession, will resume
growth by next year.
	   This is the second APEC summit overshadowed by the Asian crisis,
which erupted in Thailand in 1997, and has since pushed several
Asian countries and Russia into steep nose dives. It also now
threatens Latin American nations.
	   U.S. officials argue there is no alternative to the IMF formula
of austerity measures to fix flawed economies and restore investor
confidence. But they have begun to stress the need to be sensitive
to the people and bankrupt companies harmed by economic downturns.
Already, 40 percent of the world is estimated to be in recession.
	   The United States fears that unless some way is found to help
the victims of free-market turmoil that their suffering will
trigger growing social unrest and embolden other countries to
follow Malaysia's lead and close their economies to U.S.
corporations seeking investment opportunities.
	   The United States wants to tap dlrs 30 billion that Japan is
offering as aid to its Asian neighbors to pay for Washington's debt
restructuring proposals. That has prompted Japanese officials to
complain that the United States wants to put up the ideas and have
Japan put up the money.

China opposed to force in Iraq crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China urged Iraq on Friday to comply with U.N.
weapons inspectors, but it reiterated its opposition to resorting
to military force in the crisis.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao said President Jiang
Zemin had exchanged letters with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
expressing China's deep concern over the issue, the state-run
Xinhua News Agency said.
	   Jiang had emphasized China's strong opposition to the use of
military strikes to break the impasse, Zhu was quoted as saying.
	   The international community must step up efforts to peacefully
resolve the crisis over weapons inspections in Iraq, the statement
said.
	   Iraq has said it will not cooperate with U.N. inspectors until
the Security Council begins to lift an embargo imposed after Iraqi
forces invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf War.
	   The United States has threatened airstrikes unless Iraq resumes
cooperation.

World Bank president in Russia for talks on economic conditions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ World Bank President James Wolfensohn was in
Moscow on Friday to talk with top Russian officials and get a first
hand view of the country's economic problems.
	   Wolfensohn was to meet with Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and
Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov and several other officials
during his brief visit.
	   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund put together
a dlrs 22.6 billion loan for Russia in July, but the installments
were put on hold after the country's economic crisis hit in August.
	   Russia is not expected to receive any additional money until it
comes up with a recovery program that meets with the approval of
the IMF and World Bank.

	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch public pledged 16.4
million guilders (dlrs 8.8 million) to survivors of hurricane Mitch
during a nationally televised appeal.
	   The government said it would double the sum raised during the
Thursday evening show, which mixed emotional appeals for help by
Dutch television personalities with grim reports from Central
American regions devastated by Mitch.
	   Prime Minister Wim Kok opened the show with an appeal to the
Dutch public to ``give the people there a helping hand.''
	   Meanwhile in Honduras, Dutch marines from the crew of the
frigate Willem van der Zaan are distributing 10,000 liters of
drinking water per day while the ship's technical staff help repair
the nation's La Mesa Airport.

Grenade thrown into Hebron square, fails to explode

<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A hand grenade hurled Friday at an
Israeli military outpost in downtown Hebron failed to explode, an
army officer said.
	   In response, the army imposed a curfew on the downtown area of
Hebron, confining some 30,000 Palestinians to their homes. The 450
Jewish settlers in Hebron do not have to observe the curfew.
	   The incident occurred shortly after Friday noon prayers in Gross
Square which is heavily patrolled by Israeli soldiers. An assailant
threw a grenade at an Israeli checkpoint, but the device did not go
off. Israeli soldiers fired several shots in the air. They later
ordered bystanders to leave so that sappers could detonate the
grenade.
	   In a similar incident in September, a militant of the Islamic
group Hamas threw two hand grenades at a group of Israeli soldiers
in Gross Square. A dozen soldiers and several Palestinian civilians
were injured. The assailant was later arrested by Israel.
	   Hebron is a divided city of 130,000 Palestinians and 450 Jewish
settlers. Israel controls the downtown area.

Canadian prime minister would support U.S. in strike against Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said he
would support the United States if it takes military action against
Iraq, but there are no plans for Canadian participation in such an
operation.
	   Chretien said he discussed Iraq with U.S. President Clinton
earlier this week, and expressed the two leaders' ``hope that there
will be a diplomatic solution'' to the standoff.
	   ``If a decision was made to attack or take reprisals against
Iraq, I would support the president of the United States,''
Chretien said during a visit to Singapore.
	   The Canadian leader added that the United States has made no
request for Canadian military participation in any action against
Iraq.
	   The United States has strengthened its military force in the
Persian Gulf and is threatening airstrikes in an attempt to force
Iraq to allow international inspections of its weapons sites.
	   Clinton telephoned world leaders on Thursday to gain broad
endorsement for a potential air strike, while U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright also sought support.
	   Chretien was visiting Singapore ahead of a summit of
Asia-Pacific leaders next week in neighboring Malaysia, which
Clinton will also attend.

 &UR; Milosevic sacks leading party official

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top official in Slobodan
Milosevic's ruling Socialist Party has been sacked, in a continuing
purge of aides to the Yugoslav president said to oppose some of his
moves, according to news reports Friday.
	   Milorad Vucelic was dismissed from the Socialists' main board
and his mandate in the Serbian parliament was taken away at a
session late Thursday, B-92 radio reported. An official statement
said he was replaced because of ``inappropriate behavior and
idleness.''
	   Vucelic's dismissal has been anticipated by Serbia's independent
media following the firing of Milosevic's state security chief,
Jovica Stanisic, earlier this month.
	   The purges came in the wake of an agreement between Milosevic
and U.S. negotiator Richard Holbrooke to end Serb-Albanian violence
in Serbia's Kosovo province.
	   Stanisic and Vucelic reportedly were opposed to excessive use of
force against ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo, as well as the
Socialists increasing cooperation with neo-Communists and
ultranationalist Radicals.

hostages with ethnic Albanian guerrillas on Friday, after

monitors _ confirmed that two Serb civilians held since Wednesday
by the separatist guerillas were released in exchange for the seven
ethnic Albanians still held by the Serbs.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot
throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo, the
Albanian-majority Serbian province.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
border with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
	   The detentions, and emotional pledges of revenge at a funeral
for slain fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerillas,
reflected the high level of tension even after an Oct. 12 agreement
to end the Kosovo crisis.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists has left
hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanian civilians, and made refugees
of hundreds of thousands more.
	   In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told
Serbs _ who make up less than 10 percent of the province _ that
they had nothing to fear from the October agreement, ultimately
aimed at restoring wide-ranging Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   ``All Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he said.

Philippines defends Japan on trade pact flap
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Philippines on Friday defended
Japan's stand against a free-trade pact that the United States is
pushing at a summit of Pacific Rim countries.
	   ``It's not the end of the world'' if the pact has become watered
down, Philippines Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon told reporters
after a meeting of senior Asia-Pacific officials.
	   The United States had hoped to achieve broad agreement on a
massive package of tariff cuts covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in traded
goods when leaders of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum meet here Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   The United States believes the pact -- which would lift trade
barriers on products ranging from chemicals to medical equipment --
would demonstrate that during the current global financial crisis,
the Pacific Rim nations were not turning protectionist.
	   But Japan, the world's second largest economy, has argued that
it could not participate in two key sectors -- forestry products
and fish -- because Japanese producers were already struggling with
the country's worst recession in 50 years.
	   This has infuriated U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky, who has called Japan's stance ``outrageous.''
	   Siazon said the trade pact could survive without the two
industries and that the bigger Western APEC members should stop
brow-beating Japan.
	   ``Seventy percent is better than zero,'' Siazon said, referring
to the other seven industries that still remain in the proposal to
be hashed out further when Cabinet minister from APEC countries
meet over the weekend.
	   ``Of course people would like to have 100, but I'll take 70
percent anytime,'' he said.
	   ``People keep blaming Japan because they have difficulty with
two sectors, but you have to look at Japan's situation,'' he said.
	   He noted that Japan has offered dlrs 30 billion in aide to its
crisis-ridden Asian neighbors.
	   ``What other country has put up so much money? None.''

Pilots blame air force command for military jet crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The air force commander could face
criminal charges if investigators find an order to fly in bad
weather led to the fatal crash during independence day
celebrations, a presidential aide said Friday.
	   An air force training jet crashed Wednesday about 30 kilometers
(18 miles) southeast of Warsaw, killing both men on board. The
Polish-built Iskra was checking weather conditions in advance of an
aerial ceremony for the 80th anniversary of Poland regaining its
independence.
	   Pilots of the same division as the ill-fated Iskra charged the
cloud base Wednesday was only 200 meters (656 feet), the same as
tall buildings in downtown Warsaw, but they were told to fly
anyway.
	   ``The climate conditions did not allow for aerobatics,
especially in the center of Warsaw. We flew in the fog, among the
apartment buildings,'' a pilot told the nationwide radio Zet. He
asked not to be identified.
	   If the commission confirms the pilots' allegations, the air
force commander could be dismissed and face criminal charges, said
Marek Siwiec, chief of the presidential National Security Council.
	   A special commission investigating the crash is to report in
several weeks.
	   The crash was the third this year of an Iskra, which was
designed in the 1960s. The Polish air force has about 150 planes of
that type and uses them as its main training jet.
	   The crash will probably speed up the decision to acquire modern
fighters to replace old jets, which has been delayed because of the
limited defense budget, according to a defense ministry spokesman,
Capt. Andrzej Adamczyk.
	   Poland is considering leasing or buying about a dozen fighter
planes to bring its air force up to NATO standards. The
U.S.-produced F-16 or F-18 are the most probable choices.

Tiny Pacific island to stage 2001 world championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHTI, Finland (AP) _ The tiny Pacific island of Nauru
(population 7,000) has won the right to stage a major international
sports event _ the 2001 World Weightlifting Championships.
	   Nauru was selected over Germany, Turkey and Bulgaria by the
International Weightlifting Federation during its annual meeting
this week in Lahti.
	   Nauru has a solid weightlifting tradition through an influx of
Australians, and the sport has strong backing in the political
spheres.
	   Nauru sent an 18-man delegation to the current World
Championships in Lahti, headed by the country's vice president,
Lawrence Stephen, sports minister Vinson Detenamo and the head of
the local national bank.
	   One factor behind Nauru's selection is that the island has
guaranteed a minimum of dlrs 150,000 as first-prize money, said
Matti Everi, secretary general of the Lahti championships.
	   Nauru has its own world-class lifter in Marcus Stephen, the son
of the republic's vice president. A three-time medalist at the
Commonwealth Games, he placed 11th in Lahti in the 62-kilo class
Wednesday.
	   The IWF awarded the 2002 World Championships to Poland.

Amid military threat, Iraq turns blind eye to loss of Arab support

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fearing U.S. airstrikes, thousands of
Iraqis queued up outside gasoline stations Friday as Iraq's
official media ignored the evident loss of Arab support in its
confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Official newspapers published articles hailing President Saddam
Hussein's decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission, and claimed there was worldwide condemnation of U.S.
threats.
	   The United States has beefed up its military strength in the
Gulf and is threatening to launch airstrikes in a bid to force Iraq
to allow inspections by the Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The world calls for dialogue and peace and America seeks war
and aggression,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Baath party newspaper, said in a banner headline.
	   The newspapers made no mention of the warning issued to Iraq
Thursday by six Gulf Arab countries _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _
along with Syria and Egypt.
	   They called for ``wisdom and reason'' to end the confrontation
but said Saddam's government alone would be ``responsible for any
consequences'' from its stopping the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   The criticism was unusually strong for Arab countries who have
repeatedly called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said if the Arab countries are sincere about resolving the crisis,
``they should blame the main block ... the United States.''
	   Hours later, Iraqi newspapers Friday claimed Iraq was capable of
defeating the United States.
	   At a Friday prayer sermon, a preacher urged Arabs and Muslims to
``declare war on America'' and rally behind Iraq. Friday sermons
are usually screened by the government.
	   ``I call upon you ... do not let their airplanes use your
airspace or bases. Do not give them any facilities,'' said the
preacher, Abdullatif Humeim.
	   The feeling of an imminent strike was evident from the rush to
fill up gasoline. At one station, about 20 cars were queued up in
front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Iraqi officials escorting journalists said it was forbidden to
take pictures or talk to the people at the gas station.
	   A customer contacted later said he waited a half-hour to fill up
his car. ``I fear the Americans will hit refineries and there will
be a shortage of fuel,'' said the driver who did not wish to be
identified.
	   Markets in Baghdad were crammed, but the crowd comprised the
usual weekend shoppers.
	   At the Al-Shorja market, 40-year-old Naima Aidan said she was
buying coconut and sugar to make sweets for her four children. ``I
am not worried. I don't think anything will happen to us. Because
God will keep us safe,'' she said.
	   Since Wednesday, the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all
its weapons inspectors and one-third of its 450 humanitarian
workers.
	   Chief inspector Richard Butler called it ``a very serious
confrontation'' and said diplomatic solutions seem remote.
	   ``There's a growing sense that airstrikes or enforcement is
becoming more and more likely,'' he told MSNBC television Thursday
night.
	   Iraq says it is will cooperate with arms inspectors only if the
U.N. Security Council guarantees that it will work to lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its
economy, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq
has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required under the
cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Aziz has said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the
best person'' to try to ease the current crisis. But Annan said
Thursday he has no plans to visit Baghdad as he did the last time
in February to resolve a prior crisis.

Second presidential candidate barred from race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Election officials in Kazakstan barred a
politician from running in the country's presidential campaign
because he was jailed nine months ago for organizing an illegal
meeting, a news report said Friday.
	   Asylbek Amantai, the leader of the Oton political movement, is
the second candidate who has been barred from running in the
election, which is set for January in the Central Asian nation.
	   President Nursultan Nazarbayev is the overwhelming favorite, and
critics say he will not allow oppostion candidates to mount
full-fledged campaigns against him.
	   Amantai cannot run for president because he broke a law on
``organizing or holding meetings, rallies, and street
processions,'' Central Election Commission Chairwoman Zagipa
Baliyeva said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Under the terms of a presidential decree, anyone penalized for
criminal offenses within the past 12 months cannot run for
president, Baliyeva said.
	   The report provided no other details about Amantai's crime.
	   It was the second time the decree has been used to block a
candidate from entering the election.
	   Former Prime Minister Akezhan Kazhegeldin was ousted Nov. 5
after he was fined for attending a meeting of an unregistered
political group.
	   Four other candidates, including Nazarbayev, are eligible, and
two more are still being considered, Baliyeva said.

Cocktail waitress sues Dennis Rodman for alleged assault, battery

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ In the latest lawsuit against basketball bad
boy Dennis Rodman, a cocktail waitress claims the Chicago Bulls
forward jammed a dlrs 100 bill down her blouse and grabbed her
breast.
	   Susan Patterson, who works in the Argyle Hotel in West
Hollywood, filed the Superior Court lawsuit late Tuesday, alleging
assault, battery, negligence, false imprisonment and emotional
distress in a confrontation with Rodman early Oct. 3.
	   Rodman, 37, a seven-time NBA rebounding champion, persisted
despite the woman's repeated protests, the lawsuit said.
	   ``Suddenly and without warning or provocation, Rodman abruptly
grabbed (her) bare breast by jamming a dlrs 100 bill and his hand
down the front of (her) blouse and holding on to her breast with
his cupped hand,'' according to the complaint.
	   Patterson said she was pulled back by Rodman, who forced her
into a corner. She folded into a fetal position, but he persisted
in lunging after her, the suit said. The woman finally crawled into
the kitchen area, it said.
	   ``Emotionally overwrought, humiliated and scared, (Patterson)
sat crying and shaking for over an hour,'' the suit said.
	   The suit seeks general, punitive and exemplary damages to be
determined at trial.
	   Patterson's lawsuit also said Rodman has a pattern of similar
assaults, citing suits filed in Nevada and Utah. Her lawyer sent a
letter Thursday to NBA commissioner David Stern asking him to
investigate the allegations by the four women.
	   ``Allegations of repeated assaults on working women while they
are performing their jobs are worthy of NBA sanctions,'' attorney
Gloria Allred said.
	   A receptionist at Stern's New York office referred calls to NBA
spokesman Chris Brienza, who said the commissioner wasn't aware of
the lawsuit and wouldn't be making any immediate comment.
	   ``He hasn't been served and it sounds to me like another attempt
to make money off somebody who has it,'' said Rodman's agent,
Dwight Manley. ``We have experience in dealing with frivolous
lawsuits against Dennis in the past and we have vigorously fought
them.''

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim on Friday filed a
legal challenge to his firing as Malaysia's No. 2 official, while
his wife prepared for a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright next week.
	   The former deputy prime minister's trial on abuse of power and
sexual misconduct charges was temporarily halted. Malaysian
officials want to prevent it from overshadowing the Nov. 17-18
summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Yet, the Anwar case will still compete for attention with the
summit hosted by Malaysia's strong-willed prime minister, Mahathir
Mohamad.
	   Late Friday, attorneys filed a legal challenge to Anwar's
dismissal from his dual jobs as finance minister and deputy prime
minister in early September.
	   ``It's clearly an abuse of power,'' Anwar attorney Karpal Singh
told a crowd of reporters near the red-bricked High Court. He said
Mahathir had brushed aside constitutional procedures for dismissing
a Cabinet minister.
	   Karpal said that other legal challenges were planned as well.
	   ``I have decided to contest Mahathir's decision to sack me as
deputy prime minister and finance minister,'' Anwar said in a
statement. ``I'm advised that the sacking isn't valid and goes
against the federal constitution.''
	   However, Anwar also made it clear he doesn't want to serve again
under Mahathir's leadership.
	   ``My move to challenge the decision isn't because I yearn to
return under Mahathir. He has lost his integrity, and is cruel and
corrupt,'' the statement said. It added the ouster showed
Mahathir's ``arrogance'' in allegedly trying to put himself above
the law.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, provided the statement to The
Associated Press.
	   Azizah plans to meet with Mrs. Albright, and possibly other
high-level officials, as the summit talks are taking place. U.S.
officials in Washington confirmed plans for the talks with
Albright.
	   ``I'm very, very happy about it and privileged,'' she said of
the meeting with Mrs. Albright.
	   Azizah said the U.S. support of her predicament ``has been very
positive.''
	   Azizah is an ophthalmologist who temporarily gave up her
practice to raise the couple's six children.
	   Her 51-year-old husband was driven back to prison at lunchtime
Friday, after his trial was recessed until Nov. 23. He denies the
charges against him and says he's the victim of a political
vendetta.
	   Before the trial recessed, assistant police commissioner Mazlan
Mohamed Din said he was wrong in forcing Azizan Abu Bakar, Anwar's
former driver and, another key witness to retract allegations of
sexual misconduct against Anwar.
	   ``It was wrong and improper to do so,'' Mazlan said. ``I wasn't
thinking about whether what I was doing was right.''
	   Defense attorney Gurbachan Singh asked Mazlan: ``Do you agree
it's wrong and improper to force a person to tell a lie?''
	   ``Yes,'' Mazlan responded.
	   He also admitted under cross-examination that he exceeded his
authority when his interrogation team used rough tactics to scare
Azizan into retracting his allegations that Anwar sodomized him 15
times.
	   The prosecution says Anwar ordered police to obtain the
retractions as part of a cover-up.
	   Mazlan's earlier testimony drew gasps from the packed public
gallery of journalists and human-rights activists when he said he
was convinced that what Azizan said was true even though he wasn't
a witness to the events.
	   ``I insist that my belief can't be wrong,'' said Mazlan, the
seventh of 52 prosecution witnesses who will be taking the stand.
``I don't see any difference between personal knowledge of the
matter and what one believes.''
	   Looking somewhat shocked, presiding judge Augustine Paul warned
Mazlan that ``Azizan might not be telling the truth.''
	   The police interrogator later demurred and said he didn't have
personal knowledge about the allegations.
	   After the 10th day of trial, court bailiffs swiftly ushered
reporters out of the wood-paneled courtroom to prevent Anwar,
dressed in a cream-colored shirt and dark pants, from speaking to
the press.
	   For several days, he has been taking potshots at Mahathir from
the dock, calling his former boss ``recalcitrant'' and accusing him
of buying a pricey executive jet and building a ``glittering
palace'' for himself.
	   Mahathir fired Anwar as deputy prime minister Sept. 2, saying he
was morally unfit to lead Malaysia.
	   The hearing of the 10 charges against Anwar could last well into
the middle of next year.

Nigerian youths take oil workers hostage
</HEADLINE>

official. ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By FRANK AIGBOGUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A boatload of armed Nigerian youths who
stormed an offshore oil rig used by Texaco Inc. are holding eight
people hostage and demanding ransom payments before the seven
foreigners and one Nigerian are set free, officials said.
	   The hostages _ three Americans, a Briton, a South African, an
Italian, a Croatian and a Nigerian _ are being held in an unknown
location after being forced off the rig, a Texaco statement said.
	   ``The company has informed the American Embassy and is working
with appropriate Nigerian government officials to address this
situation,'' Yusuf N'jie, an assistant managing director for
Texaco, said in the statement.
	   Paul Weeditz, a spokesman for the White Plains, N.Y., company,
said officials knew of no injuries or damage to the rig.
	   The Texaco statement did not say whether the youths were
demanding a ransom for the release of the hostages. However, a
Texaco official in Nigeria, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said ransom demands had been issued. The official said the youths
were also demanding improved infrastructure facilities for their
communities in the poverty-stricken Niger River delta region.
	   Oil companies are frequently the targets of protests and
occasionally hostage-takings as local communities vent their anger
over what they see as government and the oil company neglect for
their plight.
	   Although Nigeria is one of the world's largest oil producers,
the people who live in the oil-rich delta often live in desperate
poverty, struggling by without paved roads, electricity or running
water.
	   Texaco says the workers taken on Wednesday were contract
employees working for other oil service companies hired to conduct
exploratory drilling in the region.
	   U.S. Embassy officials in Lagos were unavailable for comment.
	   Belinda Doyle of Glenmora, Louisiana, said her husband, Robby, a
rig manager employed by Noble Drilling US Inc., was one of the
Americans taken hostage. Mrs. Doyle has been handling a stream of
calls by worried family and friends, and searching for hope.
	   ``The whole town knows about it because everybody's been praying
for us,'' she told the Alexandria (Louisiana) Town Talk newspaper.
``It's wonderful, the support, but I have my faith in God. He's
going to see us through this.''
	   Houston-based Noble Drilling declined comment.

Turkish Police: Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Abdullah Ocalan, leader of a Kurdish rebel
group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast, has been
detained in Rome, the head of Turkey's police said Friday.
	   Necati Bilican said Ocalan was detained by police late Thursday
and was taken to a hospital in Rome, where he is being held.
	   Speaking to independent television NTV from Germany, Bilican
said Turkey would do whatever necessary to extradite the rebel
leader.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.

Report: Lawmaker backs statue of infamous secret police chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A lawmaker wants a statue of a dreaded Soviet
secret police chief resurrected in the center of Moscow to boost
the confidence of ordinary Russians, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   Nikolai Karitonov, head of the pro-Communist Agrarian faction in
the State Duma, or lower chamber of parliament, wants the statue of
Felix Dzerzhinsky returned to the spot it occupied for decades
before the old KGB headquarters.
	   The towering bronze statue of ``Iron Felix,'' head of the Cheka,
the first Soviet secret police, was a landmark during the Soviet
era. It was toppled by pro-democracy protesters in 1991 and has
since languished with other Soviet-era statues in a city park.
	   ``Dzerzhinsky was a man with an ardent heart, cold mind and
clean hands,'' Karitonov was quoted as saying. ``Nobody can say
anything bad about this man, symbolizing exceptional honesty.''
	   He said resurrecting the statue would win the government
confidence by showing ordinary Russians that it was working to
suppress crime and corruption.
	   However, Karitonov can expect to face an uphill battle.
	   The proposal was denounced by human rights activists, who said
Dzerzhinsky was a symbol of murderous repression during the Soviet
era. Dzerzhinsky headed the secret police after the Bolshevik
Revolution and was ruthless in killing and imprisoning opponents of
the regime.
	   Lubyanka Square, where the statue stood, is used by human rights
groups for vigils to honor the millions of victims of the Soviet
regime.
	   ``A lot of people don't even know where their relatives were
buried. They consider this place the grave of their beloved,'' said
Yelena Zhilkova, executive director of Memorial, a group that
exposes the abuses of the Soviet era.
	   ``They will be insulted and outraged if the statue returns to
where it once was,'' she said.

Four Russian officers on trial for beatings, killing of soldier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four military officers in Russia's far northeast
went on trial Friday for allegedly carrying out systematic beatings
of their subordinates and causing the death of one man, a news
report said.
	   The officers from Diomede Island, which is in the Bering Strait,
are accused of inflicting serious injuries on soldiers through
repeated beatings during the second half of 1997, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported.
	   Sixteen border guards who had served at the base were to testify
as witnesses for the prosecution during the trial in the Far
Eastern city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, the report said.
	   Hazings and beatings have become endemic in the Russian armed
forces, and dozens of servicemen are killed each year by their own
comrades, according to official figures.

Three dead as shots fired to block protest marches in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In the worst violence since riots
toppled President Suharto in May, three people were killed Friday
when Indonesian security forces battled rock-throwing protesters
and street mobs attacked suspected police informers.
	   Student activists said more than 50 of their number had been
injured in clashes with police, who used plastic bullets, tear gas
and water cannon on the protesters. At least two were hospitalized
in critical condition.
	   It was the bloodiest day of protest in a week of student
demonstrations against a special assembly meant to reform the
government left behind by Suharto's authoritarian 32 years in
power.
	   Friday's violence erupted at more than five points near the
legislature and followed similar street battles in Jakarta on
Thursday night that killed another two people and injured more than
100. In both cases, agents were blocking protesters from converging
on the Parliament.
	   Two armored personnel carriers rumbled by office blocks and
three small tanks drove down a toll road taken over by marching
students. Mobs burned tires as baton-wielding soldiers and troops
dispersed an angry crowd on a major road about two kilometers (one
mile) west of the legislature.
	   Troops fired warning shots and chased thousands of protesters
down Jakarta's main boulevard where offices and shops were closed.
	   Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and plastic
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several
students, some bleeding, were later taken out on stretches.
	   Tosik Sutina, a morgue official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital,
said two bodies, both male students, had been brought from the
university. They had gunshot wounds to their chests.
	   Students at the hospital identified the dead by the single
names, Ridwan and Teddi.
	   Other hospitals reported a steady and bloody stream of injured.
	   In East Jakarta a rampaging mob beat a third man to death in a
street as soldiers looked on. Witnesses reported dozens of other
mobs attacks against individuals accused of being police informers.
	   Thousands protesters and security personnel remained in the
streets after dark.
	   Trouble broke out soon after weekly Islamic prayers ended.
Students marched from several campuses in the capital in defiance
of military warnings.
	   The students were blocked from reaching Parliament where a
special government assembly was putting the final touches to a new
political blueprint for the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   On Thursday, a high school student and a police officer died in
hospitals after 20,000 students were blocked by security personnel
from reaching Parliament.
	   At that time troops and police also dispersed the crowds with
baton charges, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. More
than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
the protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt to
forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new
political system as Indonesia battles with it worst economic crisis
in decades. Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   ``Suharto's whole regime should be brought to trial for their
crimes,'' said one student activist Martin Sirat.
	   In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation
into past corruption.
	   The assembly continued its deliberations on Friday apparently
oblivious to the chaos nearby.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.

Report: Syria will not hand over Kurds to Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Syria will not hand over to Turkey rebels of
the banned Kurdistan Workers Party because they are considered
Syrian citizens, Al-Hayat newspaper reported Friday.
	   The dispute over Kurdish rebels in Syria inflamed tension last
month between Syria and neighboring Turkey, sparking fears of a
regional war. Turkey has demanded that Damascus end its support for
the rebels and extradite their leaders.
	   The two sides later reached an agreement, however, in which
Turkey said that Syria agreed to shut down rebel camps on Syrian
territory and in the Syrian-controlled Bekaa Valley of Lebanon.
Syria also agreed to consider the party a banned organization.
	   The report in the London-based newspaper said that Syria would
try any rebels belonging to the group in Syria.
	   `It is impossible for Syria to hand over its citizens to another
country. They will stand trial according to Syrian laws,'' an
unidentified Syrian official was quoted as saying.
	   The official said Syria never planned to extradite the rebels.
	   The Kurdistan Workers Party is fighting for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey, and Turkey says it stages attacks from Syria.
The war has claimed an estimated 37,000 lives since 1984.

Suu Kyi, military regime trade barbs on National Day
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and
her top rival, the head of Myanmar's military regime, traded barbs
Friday as each marked National Day.
	   The holiday commemorates the first boycott by university
students 78 years ago against British colonial rule, a watershed in
the independence struggle of Myanmar, also known as Burma.
	   Sen. Gen. Than Shwe, chairman of the ruling State Peace and
Development Council, gave a message published by official
newspapers accusing Suu Kyi and her party of trying to undermine
the country.
	   ``Neo-colonialists and the internal ax-handle group subservient
to their dictates are transgressing and interfering in Myanmar's
internal affairs in devious ways,'' Than Shwe said.
	   ``It will be seen that, organizing on the pretexts of democracy
and human rights, they are violating numerous laws and perpetrating
instigations to create anarchy,'' Than Shwe said.
	   Suu Kyi, leader of the opposition National League for Democracy,
told about 300 supporters at party headquarters that the past 36
years of military rule had lowered educational standards far below
what they were during the British period.
	   Party members cited her as saying that only the emergence of a
democratic system would guarantee a modern and advanced educational
system in the country.
	   Universities have been closed for two years following unrest by
students demanding more civil liberties. Students have
traditionally been a driving force for political change in the
country.
	   They formed a large number of the estimated 3,000 people killed
nationwide when the military cracked down on months of protests in
1988.
	   Suu Kyi, 52, daughter of independence hero Aung San, was
propelled to the forefront of Myanmar's pro-democracy struggle by
the unrest. She has been under house arrest or other restrictions
for the past decade.

Congolese rebels say they captured southern town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebels, backed by Rwanda and
Uganda, said they have captured an important town in southern,
mineral-rich Katanga Province where they have consolidated their
positions, rebel radio, monitored in Rwanda, said Friday.
	   Radio Goma in the rebel's stronghold in the eastern Congolese
town of Goma said the rebels took Kongolo, which is on the railway
line that carries copper from mines in southern Katanga northward
to the Congo River port of Kisangani.
	   Kongolo is 400 kilometers (250 miles) southwest of Goma.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report, and the
radio did not say when rebels captured the town.
	   Reports from the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, said
reinforcements from the Congolese army and troops from President
Laurent Kabila's allies, Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, were being
sent to eastern Congo to bolster the counter-offensive.
	   Rwandan officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
pro-Kabila forces had so far made no progress. They attempted four
times in last month to take Kabalo, 50 kilometers (30 miles) south
of Kongolo, but were repelled and suffered losses, the Rwandan
officials said.
	   Rebel commander Jean-Pierre Ondekande told Radio Goma Kabila's
allies were relying too much on aerial bombings, which he said were
ineffective because they were being carried out from high
altitudes.
	   Furthermore, Ondekane said, the rebels were acquiring additional
surface-to-air missles they could use against air attacks.
	   He also said the rebels were preparing for a new offensive,
``but only after careful planning because we no longer want to
rush.''
	   The rebels have said they are moving toward Mbuji-Mayi, the
capital of diamond-rich Eastern Kasai Province, 300 kilometers (187
miles) west of Kabalo. But they say their advance through difficult
forested terrain and across rivers was being further slowed by
seasonal rains.
	   In northern Congo, rebels assisted by troops and equipment
airlifted from Rwanda and Uganda said they were moving toward the
Congo River port of Bumba after last week's defeat of government
troops and their Chadian allies at Aketi, 200 kilometers (125
miles) to the east.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to negotiate with the rebels and
demands that Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their troops first. Both
countries, which have recently acknowledged their participation in
the rebellion, say they have legitimate security interests in Congo
where Kinshasa-backed rebels have bases from which to attack them
and will stay as long as solution to a three-month war is not
found.
	   On Thursday, Rwandan military spokesman Maj. Emmanuel Ndahiro
would not say many Rwandan troops were in Congo, but he did allow
that there were ``enough troops in tactical and strategic towns.''

Authorities meet with immigrants who occupied Bologna basilica
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Police and city officials met Friday with
a group of about 100 immigrants who occupied a basilica in central
Bologna and have refused to leave until the city provides them with
housing.
	   The immigrants, mostly North Africans legally in Italy, moved
into the Basilica of San Petronio Thursday after they were evicted
from an empty building belonging to the public housing authority.
	   The local archbishop allowed the immigrants to spend the night
in the church, located in one of the city's main squares.
	   Italian news reports said Bologna's police chief and city
officials were negotiating with the immigrants to convince them to
move out of the basilica. The immigrants are reportedly threatening
to go on a hunger strike if their demand for housing is not met.
	   The Catholic relief agency Caritas and several residents have
been delivering food to the immigrants, the reports said.

Investigators theorize gas leak caused fatal explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A combination of gasoline fumes and a
natural-gas leak may have caused the explosion that killed five
people and destroyed an apartment building in the Swiss capital of
Bern earlier this month, an official said Friday.
	   Nothing has so far come to light that would indicate a bomb set
off the Nov. 5 blast that also injured 18 people, said city Prefect
Sebastian Bentz.
	   A leak has been found in the natural-gas main under the street
in the vicinity of the building, Bentz said. Investigators are
trying to determine whether gas seeped into the building itself.
	   They are also theorizing that it may have mixed with gasoline
vapors in two old storage tanks under the building, Bentz said. The
ground floor of the building contained a car showroom and garage.
	   The investigators expect to be able to determine the cause when
they can enter the basement after the remains of the five-story
structure above are dismantled, Bentz said.

Scuffles between Hamas followers, Palestinian police in Nablus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Hamas activists marching in the
West Bank town of Nablus on Friday scuffled with Palestinian riot
police who fired in the air and formed a human chain to block them.
	   About 2,000 marchers, most of them supporters of the Islamic
militant group Hamas, had set off after Friday noon prayers from
the Nasr Mosque to the center of town. They demanded the release of
some 400 Hamas supporters rounded up in the past two weeks as part
of a new crackdown ordered by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The marchers also voiced their opposition to the new peace
agreement in which Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for a tougher Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants, under the supervision of the CIA. ``No to the
American intelligence agency,'' one banner read.
	   When the marchers approached the center of town, riot police
tried to stop them, and scuffles ensued. Policemen briefly fired in
the air, then formed a cordon. Hundreds of marchers sat down on the
pavement in protest and eventually dispersed peacefully.
	   Plainclothes security agents seized the film of three news
photographers. Mohammed Daraghmeh, on assignment for The Associated
Press, was reporting on the protest from his cellular phone when a
security agent ordered him to end the conversation.
	   Despite the ongoing crackdown, the Palestinian Authority is
negotiating with Hamas to halt attacks on Israelis, at least
temporarily, officials from both sides said Friday.
	   In exchange, the Palestinian Authority would release those among
the Hamas followers who have no link to violence against Israel.
	   However, such an arrangement would require the approval of Hamas
leaders who live in Syria and Amman. The exiled Hamas leaders have
in the past refused to compromise and it appeared unlikely they
would give their blessing to such an arrangement now.
	   Hamas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip cannot cut off its ties
with the leaders abroad, in part because they are the conduit for
millions of dollars in funding from Iran and other countries.
	   Arafat, on the other hand, is under tremendous pressure to have
Hamas attacks stop. With the peace agreement finally approved by
Israel's Cabinet, he is on the verge of receiving another chunk of
the West Bank and knows that new violence could stop the process.
	   On Thursday evening, Arafat permitted three senior Hamas figures
_ Ismail Hanieh, Mahmoud Zahar and Ismail Abu Shanab _ to meet with
the founder of the group, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who has been under
house arrest since a Hamas suicide bombing in Gaza on Oct. 29.
	   The three apparently were trying to get Yassin's blessing for a
limited cease-fire.
	   ``The sheik is interested in cooling the situation and ... to
remove the tension between Hamas and the Authority,'' Abu Shanab
told AP.
	   Asked whether Hamas would agree to stop attacks, Abu Shanab said
the group reserved the right, in principle, to resist Israeli
occupation. ``At the same time, we have an understanding that
nothing should be done to put the Authority in a bad situation,
regarding its commitment'' in the peace agreement.
	   A senior Palestinian Authority official who is negotiating with
Hamas said he told leaders of the group that Arafat had not plans
to crush a ``healthy opposition,'' but that he would not tolerate
any actions that could jeopardize the Israeli troop pullback.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In the worst violence since riots
toppled President Suharto in May, at least five people were killed
Friday when Indonesian security forces battled rock-throwing
protesters and street mobs attacked suspected police informers.
	   Student activists said more than 50 of their number had been
injured in clashes with police, who used plastic bullets, tear gas
and water cannon on the protesters. At least two were hospitalized
in critical condition.
	   It was the bloodiest day of protest in a week of student
demonstrations against a special assembly meant to reform the
government left behind by Suharto's authoritarian 32 years in
power.
	   Clashes continued after dark as security personnel fired
reaperted volleys of warning shots in to the air. Thousands
students and others ran for cover and threw rocks and bottles at
riot police and troops.
	   Friday's violence erupted at more than five points near the
legislature and followed similar street battles in Jakarta on
Thursday night that killed another two people and injured more than
100. In both cases, agents were blocking protesters from converging
on the Parliament.
	   Two armored personnel carriers rumbled by office blocks and
three small tanks drove down a toll road taken over by marching
students. Mobs burned tires as baton-wielding soldiers and troops
dispersed an angry crowd on a major road about two kilometers (one
mile) west of the legislature.
	   Troops fired warning shots and chased thousands of protesters
down Jakarta's main boulevard where offices and shops were closed.
	   Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and plastic
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several
students, some bleeding, were later taken out on stretches.
	   Tosik Sutina, a morgue official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital,
said two bodies, both male students, had been brought from the
university. They had gunshot wounds to their chests.
	   Students at the hospital identified the dead by the single
names, Ridwan and Teddi.
	   In East Jakarta a rampaging mob beat a third man to death in a
street as soldiers looked on. Witnesses reported dozens of other
mobs attacks against individuals accused of being police informers.
	   Syaiful, a morgue attendant at Cipto Mungunkusomo Hospital, said
it had received the bodies of one male student and civilian
security guard. Both had gunshot chest wounds.
	   Other hospitals reported a steady and bloody stream of injured.
	   Trouble broke out soon after weekly Islamic prayers ended.
Students marched from several campuses in the capital in defiance
of military warnings.
	   The students were blocked from reaching Parliament where a
special government assembly was putting the final touches to a new
political blueprint for the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   On Thursday, a high school student and a police officer died in
hospitals after 20,000 students were blocked by security personnel
from reaching Parliament.
	   At that time troops and police also dispersed the crowds with
baton charges, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. More
than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
the protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt to
forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new
political system as Indonesia battles with it worst economic crisis
in decades. Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   ``Suharto's whole regime should be brought to trial for their
crimes,'' said one student activist Martin Sirat.
	   In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation
into past corruption.
	   The assembly continued its deliberations on Friday apparently
oblivious to the chaos nearby.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.

Striking museum workers shut Orsay for fourth straight day

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Orsay Museum of 19th century art remained
closed Friday for the fourth straight day, and personnel voted to
extend the strike for better working conditions, museum officials
said.
	   Museum employees are demanding a bonus of 1,600 francs (dlrs
290) for ``inconveniences'' at the museum which houses France's
largest collection of Impressionist masterpieces.
	   Felix Guyon-Firmin, a spokesman for the so-called
Intersyndicale, grouping museum labor unions, linked deteriorating
working conditions to the huge crowds drawn to the ``Millet-Van
Gogh'' blockbuster exhibition.
	   ``People are currently waiting in line up to three hours before
getting in, and the line is inside the museum itself, blocking
access to the main collections,'' he said in a telephone interview.
	   Guyon-Firmin said employees are taking the brunt of bad behavior
from impatient crowds, and museum officials have refused to take
steps to improve security for both employees and visitors.
	   ``The show has outgrown the space. With 500 people there at a
time, it's like a country fair,'' Guyon-Firmin said. ``Conditions
for enjoying the paintings are disastrous.''
	   The show, which opened in September to wide critical acclaim,
presents dozens of Van Gogh paintings side-by-side with the works
by Jean-Francois Millet which inspired them. It runs through Jan.
3.
	   Guyon-Firmin said a similar human traffic jam was caused by the
tremendous success of a show of urban scenes by Monet and Manet.
	   The Orsay Museum, a renovated train station overlooking the
Seine, is one the city's most popular tourist attractions, drawing
some 3 million visitors annually.
	   The strike is the latest in a wave of social protests which have
shut the doors of prime attractions this fall.
	   The Eiffel Tower was closed for a week earlier this month
because of striking employees demanding a larger staff.
	   Workers at the National Library manned picket lines, keeping
scholars out for more than three weeks to protest computer glitches
in the automated delivery of books. They went back to work last
week.

carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fearing U.S. airstrikes, thousands of
Iraqis queued up outside gasoline stations Friday as Iraq's
official media ignored the evident loss of Arab support in its
confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections. Official newspapers
published articles hailing President Saddam Hussein's decision to
end all cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, and claimed
there was worldwide condemnation of U.S. threats. The United States
has beefed up its military strength in the Gulf and is threatening
to launch airstrikes to force Iraq to allow inspections by the
Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction. Despite Iraqi prodding, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan says he has no plans to mediate the
latest crisis over international arms inspections. (IRAQ-UN,

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Scores of rabbis from Jewish settlements and
Israeli cities moved Friday to bring down Israel's government and
stop the handover of West Bank land to the Palestinians. Taking a
stand in a dispute that has split the National Religious Party, the
rabbis urged the party to pull out of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government. The rabbis' demand came after Netanyahu's
Cabinet approved an agreement with the Palestinians that calls for
Israel to turn over another 13 percent of the West Bank. Netanyahu
has a one-seat majority in the parliament. In an advertisement in
the party newspaper, 160 rabbis declared that handing over
territory in the biblical land of Israel to ``gentiles'' is
forbidden by the Torah, the Old Testament of the Bible.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya was
released Friday after being held hostage for more than six months
in the breakaway southern region. Valentin Vlasov, who was abducted
in May after conducting negotiations with Chechen officials, was
freed by Russia's Interior Ministry. Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin greeted Vlasov at a Moscow airport early Friday and said
that no ransom was paid for his release. But Chechen officials
immediately countered that claim, saying that Russian officials
paid for Vlasov's freedom. (CHECHNYA-HOSTAGE RELEASED)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's bickering political
parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a
coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime
minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. In a long-elusive
compromise, opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh will become
president of the National Assembly based on disputed July
elections, even though Hun Sen's party holds a majority of 64 seats
in the 122-member chamber. Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party
dropped insistence on a joint assembly chairmanship shared by
Ranariddh and party boss Chea Sim, the current speaker. It was one
of the main stumbling blocks in months of discord. Instead,
Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modified to create a
new Senate, which Chea Sim will head. Chea Sim will still serve as
acting head of state during the king's frequent absences from the
country. (CAMBODIA-POLITICAL DEADLOCK)

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two days of local and Senate
elections began Friday in the Czech Republic, testing the nation's
political stability after a leftward shift in the government
earlier this year.
	   No dramatic changes are expected, but the voting for the upper
chamber of parliament are a test of support for Prime Minister
Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats led by Zeman. His Cabinet survived in
Parliament thanks to a stability pact struck with its archrival and
the runnerup, the center-right Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   The deal was criticized as an attempt to introduce a bipartisan
model of politics obliterating smaller parties.
	   Voters Friday and Saturday are electing more than 60,000 local
officials and 27 senators in the 81-seat upper chamber of the Czech
legislature. Pollsters expect a 50 percent turnout in an electorate
of 8 million.
	   Independent candidates are expected to dominate local elections,
which have little bearing on the balance of political power in the
country but provide some intriguing matchups.
	   In Prague, a duel for mayor pits the pro-Klaus incumbent, Jan
Koukal, against the favored Jan Ruml, the former minister under
Klaus who has now turned against him.
	   Final results from the local races are expected Tuesday.
	   Favored candidates in the 27 Senate races come from the two
biggest parties, who are expected to maintain their constitutional
three-fifths majority.
	   They would lose that key advantage only if they drop 16 of the
contests to their main challengers, the four-party ad hoc coalition
led by Christian Democrats and the center-right Freedom Union
favored by President Vaclav Havel.
	   The Senate races will see few if any outright winners in the
first round, with none of the 136 candidates expected to receive
the required 50 percent majority. The two top vote-getters from any
undecided race will advance to a second-round showdown next Friday
and Saturday, with a simple majority required.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1200 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Asian stock markets ended the week mixed
Friday, with prices rising in Tokyo on speculation the Japanese
government may announce a larger-than-expected economic stimulus
package next week. Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
recovered from a midday dip into negative territory, rising 193.15
points, or 1.37 percent, to close at 14,268.21. The economic
package was expected to meet or exceed a set of proposals issued
Thursday by the ruling party which called for a record 18 trillion
yen (dlrs 149 billion) in spending on public works projects and tax
cuts. Major Japanese newspapers reported Friday that it would total
between 20 trillion yen (dlrs 165 billion) and 22 trillion yen
(dlrs 181 billion). Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 121.68
yen in late afternoon trading, down 1.54 yen from late Thursday in
Tokyo. Share prices in Taiwan also surged after the unveiling of
the Taiwanese government's latest stimulus package. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Senior officials from Pacific Rim
countries failed Friday to achieve the goal of a broad package of
tariff cuts aimed at expanding global trade, as various countries
led by Japan sought to carve out exceptions for politically
sensitive goods. A frustrated U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky left what she called an ``exceptionally blunt'' meeting
with the Japanese saying the United States was growing
``increasingly impatient with Japan on this and a number of
issues.'' The United States had hoped to achieve broad agreement on
a massive package of tariff cuts covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in
traded goods, ranging from chemicals to medical equipment, as a way
of demonstrating that during the current global financial crisis
the Pacific Rim nations were not turning protectionist. (APEC)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund neared
completion of a long-expected dlrs 42 billion rescue package for
Brazil as financiers sought to stop the economic upheaval in Russia
and Asia from spreading to Latin America. ``This is not a done deal
but we are close,'' an IMF official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said early Friday. The official could not confirm the
exact amount of the bailout because negotiations were continuing.
But he said dlrs 42 billion was close to the total amount of the
three-year package needed by Latin America's largest economy. An
announcement could come as early as Friday, possibly in both
Washington and Brasilia, Brazil's capital. The IMF was expected to
contribute between dlrs 15 billion and dlrs 18 billion to support
Brazilian President Fernando Enrique Cardoso's austerity plan of
tax increases and spending cuts. (IMF-BRAZIL)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The president of Japan Airlines Co. said Friday he
will cut jobs, reduce wages and hire cheaper foreign workers to
restore the money-losing carrier to profitability. While foreigners
accounted for only a small fraction of the 6,300 flight attendants
at Japan's largest airline in 1991, Isao Kaneko said he hopes to
increase that ratio to about one-quarter by 2001. He also said JAL
will offer full benefits to fewer Japanese hires, signing them
instead to short-term contracts. Doing that should pare labor costs
by an average of 10 percent per employee, he said. JAL will also
cut an additional 2,300 ground jobs over the next three years,
largely through early retirement, transferring employees to
subsidiaries and limiting the number of new hires. (JAPAN-AIRLINES)
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ China is planning sweeping cuts in fees
and taxes imposed on low-priced housing to stimulate private home
purchases, news reports said Friday. China is encouraging families
to buy homes after providing free housing to most of the population
for decades. The government hopes the move will tap into huge
personal bank savings and stimulate consumption, which would help
to make up for slowing export growth amid a regional financial
crisis. Construction Minister Yu Zhengsheng said the Cabinet was
studying how to cut fees and taxes on developers, the Shenzhen
Securities Times reported. Yu didn't give any details of proposed
tax changes. Tax and fee cuts under consideration by Shenzhen, a
city near Hong Kong, could cut sale prices by up to 20 percent, a
local tax official told Dow Jones Newswires. Developers would be
required to pass on savings to buyers. (CHINA-HOUSING COSTS)

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Abdullah Ocalan, leader of a Kurdish rebel
group fighting for autonomy in Turkey's southeast, has been
detained in Rome, the head of Turkey's police said Friday.
	   Necati Bilican said Ocalan was detained by police late Thursday
and was taken to a hospital in Rome, where he is being held.
	   Speaking to the the Turkish language independent television NTV
from Germany, Bilican said Turkey would do whatever necessary to
extradite the rebel leader.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.
	   The Italian Interior Ministry in Rome confirmed he had been
picked up in Rome, on arrival Thursday night at Leonardo da Vinci
airport, but released no other details.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   Ocalan, was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus
following Turkey's threats to strike Syria if they did not end
their alleged support to the rebels.
	   According to Turkish officials, Ocalan fled to Russia and sought
political asylum from Moscow.

Former Philippine rebel asks for more time on kidnapping talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBONAGA, Philippines (AP) _ A former Muslim rebel leader urged
the government on Friday to give negotiators two more weeks to
peacefully free captives held by guerrillas before attempting a
military rescue.
	   Nur Misuari, founder of the Moro National Liberation Front and
governor of an autonomous region of Muslims, said he has asked
President Joseph Estrada for the extension.
	   Misuari said he is confident that the kidnappers, who were
mostly disgruntled former members of his rebel group, will free
their captives _ including five foreigners _ during that time.
	   A government deadline came Tuesday but the military delayed a
rescue attempt on three abducted foreigners to give civilian
negotiators a final chance, officials said.
	   The captives include two people from Hong Kong, a Malaysian, an
Italian missionary priest and a Taiwanese woman.
	   Misuari's MNLF, the biggest Muslim rebel faction, signed a peace
agreement with the government in 1996 but two other smaller
factions, including the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the
extremist Abu Sayyaf Group continue to fight the government.

picked up in Rome, on arrival Thursday night at Leonardo da Vinci
airport, but released no other details.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   Ocalan, was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus
following Turkey's threats to strike Syria if they did not end
their alleged support to the rebels.
	   According to Turkish officials, Ocalan fled to Russia and sought
political asylum from Moscow.

Serizawa takes second-round lead in Taiheiyo Masters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEMBA, Japan (AP) _ Japan's Nobuo Serizawa shot a four-under
68 to take a three-stroke lead after the second round Friday in the
150 million yen (dlrs 1.2 million) Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters.
	   Serizawa shot six birdies, including four in the final six
holes, against two bogeys on the 7,072-yard, par-72 Taiheiyo
Masters Gotemba course, posting a 36-hole total of nine-under 135.
	   Serizawa is seeking his fifth career victory on the Japan PGA
tour.
	   Frankie Minoza of the Philippines shot a two-under 70 to sit in
a tie for a 138-stroke second place with Tateo ``Jet'' Ozaki, who
also had a 70.
	   Minoza, seeking his second victory this season, sank three
birdies and bogeys each before chipping in for an eagle on the
final hole.
	   Two-time defending champion Lee Westwood of Britain had the
day's best score of 67 to share third place at 139 with first-round
leader Eduardo Herrera of Colombia and Japan's Ryoken Kawagishi.
	   Westwood carded six birdies against one bogey.
	   Herrera shot a two-over 74 and Kawagishi shot a par 72.
	   Mark O'Meara, this year's Masters and British Open champion,
shot a 72 for a 145 two-day total, sharing an unimpressive 41st
place with Stewart Ginn of Australia, Todd Hamilton of the United
States, Jose-Maria Olazabal of Spain and eight Japanese players.
	   A total of 81 players teed off in clear weather, and 63 of them
made the cut of three-over 147.
	   The winner will collect 27 million yen (dlrs 221,000).

Czech local and Senate elections test political waters

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two days of local and Senate
elections began Friday in the Czech Republic, testing the nation's
political stability after a leftward shift in the government
earlier this year.
	   No dramatic changes are expected, but the voting for the upper
chamber of parliament are a test of support for Prime Minister
Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats led by Zeman. His Cabinet survived in
Parliament thanks to a stability pact struck with its archrival and
the runnerup, the center-right Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   The deal was criticized as an attempt to introduce a bipartisan
model of politics obliterating smaller parties.
	   Voters Friday and Saturday are electing more than 60,000 local
officials and 27 senators in the 81-seat upper chamber of the Czech
legislature. Pollsters expect a 50 percent turnout in an electorate
of 8 million.
	   Independent candidates are expected to dominate local elections,
which have little bearing on the balance of political power in the
country. Final results from the local races are expected Tuesday.
	   Favored candidates in the 27 Senate races come from the two
biggest parties, who are expected to maintain their constitutional
three-fifths majority.
	   They would lose that key advantage only if they drop 16 of the
contests to their main challengers, the four-party ad hoc coalition
led by Christian Democrats and the center-right Freedom Union
favored by President Vaclav Havel.
	   The Senate races will see few if any outright winners in the
first round, with none of the 136 candidates expected to receive
the required 50 percent majority. The two top vote-getters from any
undecided race will advance to a second-round showdown next Friday
and Saturday, with a simple majority required.

Cambodian strongman Hun Sen asks king to pardon five rivals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Cambodia-Political Deadlock

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Five exiled rivals of strongman Hun
Sen received pardons Friday under negotiations that led to the
formation of a new coalition government.
	   For opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun Sen's green
light for the pardons appeared to sweeten the deal, which broke a
deadlock paralyzing Cambodia since disputed elections in July.
	   The pardons were granted by King Norodom Sihanouk, the prince's
father and Cambodia's constitutional monarch. Sihanouk often defers
to Hun Sen on politically sensitive amnesties.
	   The order lifted lengthy prison sentences for princes Norodom
Chakrapong and Norodom Sirivudh, top resistance generals Nhek
Bunchhay and Serey Kosal, and former interior minister Sin Song.
	   All five fled the country in recent years to escape capture and
prosecution from Cambodian courts widely seen as controlled by Hun
Sen's Cambodian People's Party.
	   Nhek Bunchhay and Serey Kosal led a retreat of military forces
loyal to Ranariddh from Phnom Penh after being routed in Hun Sen's
bloody coup last year to oust Ranariddh as co-prime minister.
	   The royalist forces were pushed back to the mountainous
Thai-Cambodian border, where they dug in and fought the government
army to a stalemate.
	   The commanders were sentenced in March to prison by a military
court for ``threatening national security,'' disobeying orders and
forming an illegal armed insurgency.
	   Ranariddh was also convicted by the court, but was pardoned as
part of a Japanese-brokered deal that brought him back to Cambodia
for the parliamentary elections.
	   Nhek Bunchhay said by telephone Friday from Bangkok that he
would wait until the final touches were put on the deal before
considering a return to Cambodia.
	   ``It's nothing special for me, because I never recognized the
verdicts,'' the general said. ``But I'd like to pay my high
respects to his majesty the king for what he did to solve the
political crisis.''
	   Sirivudh, a half-brother of Sihanouk and former foreign
minister, was accused of plotting an assassination attempt against
Hun Sen in December 1995. He fled the country and was convicted in
absentia.
	   Chakrapong, a son of the king's formerly loyal to Hun Sen, was
convicted of plotting a coup against Hun Sen in 1994 along with Sin
Song. They fled the country before being convicted.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Passenger bus service between uneasy
neighbors India and Pakistan will begin in a matter of weeks,
Pakistani and Indian officials said Friday after emerging from the
most successful talks so far on normalizing relations.
	   The bus service was a rare point of agreement to emerge from six
days of talks that ended with Friday's meetings between Indian
Culture Secretary R.V.V. Ayyar and his Pakistani counterpart Syed
Roshan Zamir at the National Museum, an opulent British-era red
sandstone building in the heart of New Delhi.
	   ``We cannot allow this vicious cycle of mistrust to continue,''
Ayyar said at the end of the talks.
	   For the most part, issues ranging from cultural ties to military
exchanges on a Himalayan glacier revealed the wide and treacherous
gap between India and Pakistan, which both tested nuclear weapons
in May. Their main dispute is rival claims to the Himalayan
province of Kashmir, over which the two countries have fought two
of their three wars.
	   Talks Thursday ended with the two sides accusing each other of
supporting terrorism.
	   But Friday, Pakistani foreign office spokesman Tariq Altaf said
broad agreement had been reached on the bus service, which will
make it easier for ordinary citizens of both countries to visit
each other. All that's needed is for technical experts to thrash
out points such as security and taxes, he said, predicting trips
would start by the end of the month.
	   Indian officials also said the private service would begin soon,
but would give a date.
	   The two sides also agreed to consider granting more visas and
arranging sports and cultural exchanges.
	   India and Pakistan were one British colony before independence
in 1947, and the creation of the two countries divided families.
Opportunities for relatives to visit each other, business people to
meet and other exchanges have been restricted by visa refusals and
the fact that most trips have to be made by air, too expensive for
many.

Yeltsin urges Iraq to cooperate with United Nations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has written to Saddam
Hussein and urged the Iraqi leader to cooperate with United Nations
weapons inspectors rather than risk a military confrontation, a
spokesman said Friday.
	   The Russian president ``expressed a deep concern about the
situation around Iraq,'' Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin told a
news conference.
	   ``The situation now is such that the threat of using force may
become a reality unless an urgent political solution is found,''
Yakushkin said, quoting from Yeltsin's letter, which was sent
Thursday.
	   Russia ``is categorically against the use of force,'' the letter
said, but Moscow stands ``for the continuation of Iraqi cooperation
with the U.N. Security Council and the U.N. secretary general.''
	   Iraq has cut off cooperation with arms inspectors and has said
it will not change its position unless the U.N. Security Council
guarantees that it will work to lift economic sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The Russian government has called for the early lifting of
international sanctions against Iraq, but has not moved to act
unilaterally.
	   Russia has helped defuse previous showdown between Iraq and the
United Nations, but has not yet sent any government officials to
try to mediate in the latest standoff.

Environmentalists slam free-trade plan supported by the U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Environmentalists from Pacific Rim
nations criticized the United States on Friday for promoting a
free-trade agreement involving wood products, saying it could
further damage the region's forests.
	   Their complaint came as more than 700 delegates from a whole
array of social action groups were meeting in Kuala Lumpur in a
``People's Summit'' ahead of next week's summit of the 21-member
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group.
	   ``We strongly condemn the U.S. move to push other APEC countries
to buy into their plan,'' said Paige Fischer, of the U.S.-based
Pacific Environment and Resources Center.
	   The United States, Canada and Australia are seeking APEC
leaders' endorsement of a pact involving a massive package of
tariff cuts covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in traded goods in nine
sectors, ranging from chemicals to medical equipment.
	   A key obstacle has been Japan's refusal to include the forest
products and fishing industries in the agreement.
	   APEC officials are trying to prepare the tariff-reduction
agreement for the group's 21 leaders to approve when they meet in
the Malaysian capital on Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   ``We feel that APEC should not be dealing only with the
financial crisis,'' said Fischer, who is among the human rights and
environmental groups asking APEC leaders to consider the risks of
knocking down some global trade barriers. ``There is a crisis in
the Pacific Rim forest.''
	   Environmentalists from 12 countries, including the United
States, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia, condemned the U.S. and
Canadian governments for supporting the free-trade pact, saying it
would open the region's depleting forests to further destruction.
	   The activists said they were concerned with deforestation
throughout the Pacific Rim, but accused the United States of using
its leverage to force APEC's poorest countries into approving the
agreement.
	   ``It's in the U.S.'s best interest,'' said Fischer of the
Pacific Environment and Resources Center. She said that lifting
trade barriers would enable the United States to import and export
more from its own companies around the Pacific Rim. ``As soon as
that happens, the U.S. will have plantations in all these
countries,'' she said.
	   Indonesia's rain forests, in particular, were ravaged last year
by wild fires that wiped out huge swaths of virgin rain forest and
threatened the extinction of animals such as orangutans.
	   Fischer and other activists said they met privately Friday with
a team of senior officials from the U.S. delegation to APEC.
	   The response was ``not as much as we would like,'' said Pat
Rasmussen of the U.S.-based Washington State Environmental Board.
	   The environmentalists called for a halt to trade talks in the
forest sector until more research is done on the environmental and
social impact of opening that market. The officials said they were
confident a consensus with Japan would be reached, she said.

European politicians line up for EU's top job
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The finishing line is still a year
away, but already some of the Europe's best-known politicians are
jockeying for position in the race for the European Union's top
job.
	   Former Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, NATO Secretary
General Javier Solana and now Germany's Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine are among those tipped to succeed Jacques Santer as
president of the EU Commission.
	   Santer's five-year term as head of the EU executive body expires
at the end of 1999. The one-time Luxembourg prime minister has
hinted he may seek a second mandate, but he faces tough competition
for the high-profile position.
	   To get the job, candidates need approval from leaders of all 15
EU nations and a majority in the 626-seat European Parliament.
	   The appointment is supposed to be decided on merit without
reference to nationality or political affiliation, but there are
some unwritten rules.
	   Santer is a center-right Christian Democrat and from the EU's
smallest member. His successor is therefore likely to be a
center-left politician from one of the larger EU nations.
	   British candidates are excluded because Britain is opting out,
for now, of the EU single currency, the euro. France won't likely
fill the job, because Santer's predecessor _ from 1985 to 1994 _
was a Frenchman, Jacques Delors.
	   That appears to narrow the field to left-leaning Spaniards,
Italians and Germans.
	   The early favorite was Spain's former-Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez. Remembered as a youthful, dynamic leader, he was seen my
many as a welcome contrast to the more discreet style of Santer,
whose motto has been ``Do less, but better.''
	   However Gonzalez has been linked to scandals back home and has
decided to revive his old career as a lawyer to help two
ex-ministers appeal a jail sentence. Conventional wisdom here has
it that that has ruled him out of the running.
	   Solana's suave diplomatic skills pushed him into the frame. But
the Spanish former foreign minister appears reluctant to move
across town from NATO's Brussels headquarters to the EU head
office.
	   As an Iberian alternative, Portugal's widely respected Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres emerged as a front-runner. But Portugal
is a small country and after five years with a Luxembourger in
charge, many feel it's time for a leader from one of the EU's big
hitters.
	   A likely solution emerged last month when the Italian government
fell, making Prodi jobless. The statesmanlike Italian is a leader
who knows the global stage and was the driving force behind Italy's
successful against-the-odds bid to join the euro currency.
	   Until this week, he looked like a shoo-in.
	   Then on Thursday, former European Parliament President Klaus
Haensch announced that ``it's Germany's turn to occupy this post.''
	   Haensch, a veteran German Social Democrat, had a particular
German in mind _ Lafontaine, freshly installed as the powerful
finance minister in the new Social Democratic government of
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder.
	   Lafontaine rejected the idea as ``nonsense.'' But German
newspapers report the new government is seeking backing for a
German candidate. The daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung suggested Friday
that packing his long-time party rival off to the EU would
strengthen Schroeder's own position in the government.
	   ``If Lafontaine was going to Brussels ... the troublesome
secondary chancellor would be eliminated in an elegant way,'' the
paper said in a editorial.
	   EU nations will all be lobbying in coming months for their
preferred candidate, but the contest will probably go to the wire,
as it did in 1994 amid much bloodletting.
	   Then, it appeared a two-horse race between Belgian Premier
Jean-Luc Dehaene and former Dutch Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. But
Germany blocked Lubbers and Britain imposed an 11th-hour veto
against Dehaene. From the impasse Santer, a rank outsider, arose as
the only palatable alternative.

U.N. survey highlights damage to villages

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. assessment of the level of destruction in
Serbia's Kosovo province has found that 60 percent of houses in
villages surveyed have been either destroyed or heavily damaged.
	   Initial results of the survey released Friday by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees said an estimated 100,000 people are now
displaced within Kosovo and a further 125,000 outside its borders.
	   Some 65,000 have returned home since an Oct. 12 agreement meant
to end the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists, it said.
	   ``The situation is still very, very precarious,'' said UNHCR
spokesman Kris Janowski.
	   He said Yugoslav troops earlier this week entered a village near
the town of Prizren searching for weapons. The village, Ljubizda,
is near the Albanian border and is a suspected entry point for arms
smuggled to ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo.
	   The soldiers held 400 village men at a store and 2,000 women and
children in a school for more than 24 hours. Older boys and girls
were questioned through the night. All were denied food, although
the women were allowed water and use of a toilet, according to
accounts received by U.N. staff.
	   Villagers said 16 men were taken to Prizren for questioning.
Some were beaten and then lined up against a wall with guns aimed
at their backs.
	   One gun was found during a search of houses and two more were
handed over voluntarily. The army commander said his troops would
return next Tuesday and burn the place unless all arms were
surrendered.
	   Villagers told U.N. staff they would flee unless international
monitors came to their aid.
	   The October agreement provides for international observers to
try to reduce tensions and encourage refugees and displaced to
return home.
	   However, the U.N. survey showed up how difficult this is likely
to be in practice.
	   The survey, carried out early November, looked at 240 of the
estimated 350 villages in Kosovo. The remaining villages and larger
towns will be studied later.
	   Of the 240 villages, 90 had escaped unscathed while 150 were
damaged. Some 41 percent of houses surveyed could be lived in. But
30 percent were destroyed and 29 percent were in need of major
repair before they could be habitable.
	   Janowski said the survey results would help UNHCR to target its
winter shelter supplies at the areas most in need.
	   ``UNHCR won't rebuild destroyed villages. This is the
responsibility of the Yugoslav government,'' he said. ``But we will
be able to help people with basic shelter material and ... to
survive the winter.''
	   Janowski said even though 100,000 people are still displaced in
Kosovo, only a handful are without shelter in the open.
	   Before the agreement, aid workers feared a humanitarian disaster
this winter if tens of thousands of displaced were forced to stay
in the open.
	   ``Everyone will have a roof over their head this winter,'' said
Janowski. ``But it won't necessarily be their own.''

Ukrainian government denies charges of provoking AIDS epidemic
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARINA SYSOYEVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian health officials denied Friday
that they risked increasing the spread of AIDS by banning imports
of HIV-testing equipment.
	   The ban is intended to support domestic industry _ and cut costs
_ by forcing doctors to use cheaper, Ukrainian-made equipment. But
critics say the domestic testers are inferior and give a false
picture of the spread of the disease.
	   Anatoliy Padchenko of the Health Ministry's Epidemiologic
Department argued that Ukraine's economic crisis has made it too
expensive to import HIV-testing systems.
	   ``The decision was made purely for economic reasons,'' he said.
	   Padchenko spoke after a former top government official for
combating AIDS accused the Health Ministry of acting improperly by
giving an effective monopoly to the sole Ukrainian manufacturer of
the testing equipment, Diaprof-Med.
	   Valeriy Ivasiuk, the former chairman of the state committee for
AIDS prevention, told the Kyiv Post newspaper that the ban on
imported products was designed to benefit the Health Ministry,
which could profit by fully controlling production and distribution
of blood-screening equipment.
	   ``(The ministry) allows Diaprof-Med to create a super-monopoly
in the Ukrainian diagnostic market,'' Ivasiuk told the Kyiv Post.
	   The ban on imports of HIV-testers came just as Ukraine
experienced a sharp rise in the number of registered HIV infections
in the past several years. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS.
	   While only 44 Ukrainians tested HIV-positive in 1994, there were
8,934 in 1997, according to government health statistics.
	   Ivasiuk warned that the ban on imported HIV-testing equipment
could cause even a larger AIDS epidemic, because the Ukrainian-made
machines frequently produced false results.
	   He cited a recent examination of Diaprof-Med's equipment by
German researchers, which showed that it produced false results in
up to a third of cases.
	   However, Olga Selnikova, the director of the State Institute for
Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases, said the Ukrainian company's
equipment met Health Ministry standards.
	   ``All medical testing systems produced in Ukraine are controlled
by state agencies, and we constantly improve their quality in
accordance with the requirements of the World Health
Organization,'' she said.
	   Selnikova added that the Health Ministry was ready to license
more Ukrainian companies to produce HIV-testing systems as soon as
they appear.
	   She said the replacement of imported HIV-testers fully agrees
with a recently launched government-led campaign to encourage
domestic industry.
	   ``The case of Diaprof-Med only shows that we should have more
state manufactures of blood screening equipment,'' Selnikova said.

German high court refuses to block Turkish boy's deportation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RESTORES dropped overline; UPDATES with details from ruling,
boy's name &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court refused Friday
to block Bavaria's attempts to deport to Turkey a 14-year-old
Turkish juvenile delinquent born and raised in Germany.
	   The Constitutional Court ruled unanimously that arguments that
the boy's rights were being violated were inadmissible. It said his
lawyer should have challenged the immediate implementation of the
deportation order in a lower court.
	   But it was not immediately clear when or if Muhlis Ari, known as
``Mehmet'' in the German media, could be deported, since his
parents have had his passport invalidated by Turkish officials.
	   The case made headlines this summer when Bavarian officials
sought to deport not only the boy, but also his parents, who have
lived and worked in Munich for 30 years.
	   Although the parents had never been in trouble with the law,
they were accused of endangering public safety by failing to raise
their son properly.
	   Courts have blocked the deportation of the parents. But the
entire case became an election-year issue, with liberals accusing
the ruling conservatives of using a family tragedy to show they
were cracking down on ``criminal foreigners.''
	   Bavaria's highest court last month upheld the state's decision
to deny Ari a new residency permit because of a string of violent
offenses, thus clearing the way for a deportation. But his lawyer
had asked the Constitutional Court to block it.
	   In the meantime, his parents have had his Turkish passport
declared void and refuse to grant permission for a new one to be
issued. Without valid travel documents, Ari cannot be deported.
	   Bavarian officials have asked the Foreign Ministry to take the
issue up with Turkish officials in Ankara, but Foreign Ministry
spokesman Martin Erdmann said last month that his office would not
do so until all legal avenues in Germany are exhausted.
	   Although a passport for a minor can not be issued without the
parents' consent, Bavarian officials could ask a German court to
force the boy's parents to comply.

Thailand pushing economic stimulus measures
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister
said Friday he hopes members of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum will agree to a package of economic stimulus
measures at next week's summit.
	   Supachai Panitchpakdi, who is also commerce minister, said he
welcomed a plan by the United States to help restructure distressed
Asian debt, saying it would complement a dlrs 30 billion aid
package that Japan plans for the region.
	   The United States has said it is working to establish a
mechanism to help debt-ridden Asian banks and corporations to
stabilize. The plan would involve guarantees of Asian sovereign and
government bonds, primarily using Japanese money.
	   ``I think that was a good proposal, and I particularly emphasize
that,'' Supachai said. ``For us, it's the private sector that's
most troublesome. So if that could be seriously addressed, it would
be a help.''
	   Supachai also welcomed recent proposals from Group of Seven
nations to help grapple with recent financial market volatility.
The proposals include a new lending mechanism from the
International Monetary Fund, and the study of ways to regulate
hedge funds.
	   ``I said they should have done this around a year ago,''
Supachai said. ``We could have done something at the beginning of
the year and the contagion could have been limited. But at least
this is better than nothing.''
	   Supachai conceded that Asian officials gathered here have been
preoccupied with ironing out differences over a nine-sector trade
pact, known as early voluntary sectoral liberalization. But he said
he hoped APEC would still take up proposals to stimulate member
economies.
	   ``Most of us are preoccupied with EVSL, but I hope we should
arrive at certain collective plans for a package of stimulus
measures,'' he said.
	   He added, however, that specific proposals haven't yet been put
forward for consideration.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the U.S.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya was
freed Friday, more than six months after he was taken hostage in
the breakaway southern region.
	   Looking haggard and pale, Valentin Vlasov, arrived in Moscow on
Friday morning following successful negotiations carried out by
Russia's Interior Ministry.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin greeted Vlasov at a Moscow
airport and said that no ransom was paid for his release. But
Chechen officials immediately countered that claim, saying that
Russian officials had paid.
	   ``By doing that, they once again financed the Chechen criminal
groups,'' Nasrudi Bazhiyev, Chechnya's deputy security minister,
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The Chechen officials also said that Vlasov had been kept
outside Chechnya, though he was abducted in Chechnya in May after
holding talks with Chechen officials. Russian officials refused to
give details of how Vlasov was released.
	   Ruslan Yeshugayev, the chief of Russia's anti-organized crime
squad in the region, said Vlasov was brought from Chechnya to
neighboring region of Ingushetia early Friday and then flown to
Moscow, the Interfax news agency said.
	   ``What should have happened, did happen,'' Vlasov, dressed in a
black raincoat, said in a brief interview shown on the ORT
television. ``The main thing is what will happen next.''
	   Vlasov lost 15 kilograms (33 pounds) while in captivity, but was
``in a vigorous and constructive mood,'' said Russian presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. Vlasov will spend a week recovering at
Russia's Central Clinical Hospital, officials said.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in and around Chechnya
following its 1994-96 war with Russia, and dozens remain in
captivity. Vlasov was the most prominent of those who had been held
hostage.
	   An estimated 150 people were still being held in captivity in
Chechnya, according to Russia's Interior Ministry.
	   Most kidnappings are carried out by criminal gangs seeking
ransom, and have no political motive. The Russian media reported
that Vlasov's kidnappers were seeking millions of dollars.
	   Chechen officials have said that ransoms have been paid in some
cases, though the parties involved in the negotiations rarely, if
ever, provide details.
	   Meanwhile, five residents of a village in the nearby republic of
North Ossetia were kidnapped late Thursday, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Friday.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew in the fall of 1996, but Moscow still considers it a part
of Russia and no country has recognized its independence.

Report: corruption rampant in the Kenyan judiciary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenya's judicial system is rife with
corruption, incompetence and sexual harassment, according to the
head of the Committee on the Administration of Justice, news
reports said Friday.
	   ``We came across all manner of problems in the judiciary,''
Court of Appeals Judge Richard Kwach said at the presentation
Thursday of the committee's findings to Chief Justice Zaccheaus
Chesoni.
	   ``We found evidence of corruption, incompetence, neglect of
duty, theft, drunkenness, racketeering involving magistrates, the
police, advocates and employees of the judiciary,'' Kwach was
quoted as saying in front-page stories in Kenya's three national
English-language dailies.
	   Chesoni appointed the committee in January to look into the
administration of justice in Kenya, a country of 30 million whose
government has been taken to task by international agencies for
corruption.
	   According to the newspaper reports, Kwach told Chesoni the
findings of his committee should serve as a blueprint for radical
reforms of Kenya's judiciary.
	   Among the report's recommendations were:
	   _ a constitutional amendment to make incompetence grounds for
removing a judge from office;
	   _ hiring more staff to supplement the 39 judges and 257
magistrates currently serving;
	   _ establishment of 24-hour courts at Jomo Kenyatta and Moi
international airports in Nairobi and Mombasa to deal with petty
crimes involving foreign travelers.

EU says Russia formally requesting food aid; accepts delivery
</HEADLINE>
terms &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Friday
Russia has formally asked for European Union food aid of almost
half a billion dollars and accepts EU-set delivery terms to ensure
it reaches the needy.
	   Anticipating a formal request, the EU head office last Monday
proposed food sales worth 400 million European currency units (dlr
480 million) to help Russians cope with a slumping economy and
disappointing harvests.
	   ``We got the letter (requesting food aid) this morning,'' said
EU spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan. ``Russia accepts the EU
conditions for the distribution of the food.''
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic and financial problems and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years. Russian officials have said
emergency reserve will last only two to three weeks.
	   Last week, the United States announced it would provide Russia
with food aid worth dlrs 600 million.
	   The EU aid will include scores of thousands of tons of cereals,
meat and milk powder to be sold in Russia at market prices with the
proceeds going into a fund to finance social projects. The EU would
pay its farmers for the food delivered to Russia.
	   Russia will be held to strict conditions: it must provide
anti-fraud guarantees, it cannot re-export EU food and must ensure
the food reaches the needy.
	   The EU package will be finalized in the weeks. The first
shipments will not likely reach Russia until the new year when food
shortages are expected to become visible.
	   The EU stock of surplus grain is currently about 10 million
tons. In addition it has some 500,000 tons of beef and 400,000 tons
of rice in surplus stocks.

Juventus coach sought by Inter, Lazio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Struggling Milan soccer powerhouse
Internazionale may sign Marcello Lippi next season to add a
successful coach to a star-studded roster.
	   Inter's president Massimo Moratti on Friday was quoted by
Milan's sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport as saying that he was
considering the possibility to have Lippi suceeding Gigi Simoni at
the helm of Inter in the 1999-2000 soccer campaign.
	   ``Lippi is one possibility,'' Moratti, an oil industrialist,
said.
	   Lippi, the current coach of league champion Juventus of Turin,
is also sought by Lazio of Rome and other clubs as his contract
with La Juve is going to expire next June.
	   Moratti's remarks were likely to hand another blow to Simoni,
who has been repeatedly criticized by the club president and by
Italian media for the lackluster play and mixed results of the
Milan team so far this season.
	   Inter, including such stars as Ronaldo, Roberto Baggio, Ivan
Zamorano, Youri Djorkaeef and Diego Simeone on its lineup, is only
seventh in the league standings, seven points behind leader
Fiorentina, after starting the season as a title favorite.
	   The team has been also struggling in the Champions League and in
the Italian Cup.
	   Lippi has been one of the most successful Italian coaches in
recent years as he led Juventus to consecutive league titles and to
three Champions Cup finals in a row.
	   Simoni is coaching Inter for the second consecutive season.

Scuffles between Hamas followers, Palestinian police in Nablus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KARIN LAUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Hundreds of Hamas activists marching Friday in
the West Bank town of Nablus scuffled with Palestinian riot police
who fired in the air and formed a human chain to block them.
	   About 2,000 marchers, most of them supporters of the Islamic
militant group Hamas, had set off after Friday noon prayers from
the Nasr Mosque to the center of town. They demanded the release of
some 400 Hamas supporters rounded up in the past two weeks as part
of a new crackdown ordered by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   The marchers also voiced their opposition to the new peace
agreement in which Israel is to hand over 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for a tougher Palestinian campaign against
Islamic militants, under the supervision of the CIA. ``No to the
American Intelligence Agency'' one banner read.
	   When the marchers approached the center of Nablus, riot police
tried to stop them, and scuffles ensued. Policemen briefly fired in
the air, then formed a cordon. Hundreds of marchers sat down on the
pavement in protest and eventually dispersed peacefully.
	   Plainclothes security agents seized the film of three news
photographers. Mohammed Daraghmeh, on assignment for The Associated
Press, was ordered to stop his reporting from a cellular phone.
	   Despite the crackdown, the Palestinian Authority is negotiating
with Hamas to halt attacks on Israelis, at least temporarily,
officials from both sides said Friday.
	   In exchange, the Palestinian Authority would release those among
the Hamas followers who have no link to violence against Israel.
	   However, such an arrangement would require the approval of Hamas
leaders who live in Syria and Jordan. The exiled Hamas leaders have
in the past refused to compromise and it appeared unlikely they
would give their blessing to such an arrangement now.
	   Hamas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip cannot cut off its ties
with the leaders abroad, in part because they are the conduit for
millions of dollars in funding from Iran and other countries.
	   Arafat, on the other hand, is under tremendous pressure to have
Hamas attacks stop. With the peace agreement finally approved by
Israel's Cabinet, he is on the verge of receiving another chunk of
the West Bank and knows that new violence could stop the process.
	   On Thursday evening, Arafat permitted three senior Hamas figures
_ Ismail Hanieh, Mahmoud Zahar and Ismail Abu Shanab _ to meet with
the founder of the group, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, who has been under
house arrest since a Hamas suicide bombing in Gaza on Oct. 29.
	   The three apparently were trying to get Yassin's blessing for a
limited cease-fire.
	   A senior Palestinian Authority official who is negotiating with
Hamas said he told leaders of the group that Arafat had not plans
to crush a ``healthy opposition,'' but that he would not tolerate
any actions that could jeopardize the Israeli troop pullback.

 &UR; Turkish Police: Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: CHANGES dateline, UPDATES with further details of detention,
Ocalan under international warrant, background on rebel group &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Abdullah Ocalan, leader of Kurdish insurgents who
has been sought for years by Turkey, has been detained in Rome
after stepping off a plane from Moscow, Turkish and Italian
officials said Friday.
	   Necati Bilican, Turkey's police chief, said his country would do
whatever necessary to extradite the rebel leader.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict. Turkey considers
the group a terrorist organization.
	   Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival Thursday
night at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome.
	   Ocalan is wanted under an international arrest warrant,
according to Turkish authorities.
	   Luca Cosson, an official of Rome police, said that Ocalan flew
to Rome from Moscow and was carrying a false passport. They then
made further checks and discovered his identity, Cosson said.
	   Claiming he was not feeling well, Ocalan asked to be taken to a
hospital, the Italian official said.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   Ocalan, was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus
following Turkey's threats to strike Syria. Ankara claims Syria has
long supported the rebels, offering them arms and refuge.
	   According to Turkish officials, Ocalan had fled to Russia and
sought political asylum from Moscow.
	   Of Marxist inspiration, the PKK was founded by Ocalan, a
political science dropout from Ankara university in 1978. Ocalan
turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.

Ireland rips FIFA over release of players
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Irish soccer officials have blasted FIFA
for making an exception to the five-day rule and allowing Ireland
internationals to play for their English clubs this weekend.
	   Ireland manager Mick McCarthy had invoked the five-day rule so
his players could assemble in Dublin on Saturday in preparation for
next week's European Championship Group 8 qualifier against
Yugoslavia in Belgrade.
	   But FIFA relaxed its rule and instructed Ireland and Yugoslavia
to permit players to turn out for their Premier League and First
Division sides.
	   Premier League side Charlton was eager to have Irish midfielder
Mark Kinsella and Yugoslav goalkeeper Sasa Ilic available for
Saturday's game against Middlesbrough.
	   ``It's a joke,'' McCarthy said Thursday night. ``But I've no axe
to grind with those English bosses who were protecting their club's
interest, their own jobs and their supporters.
	   ``The people I am really angry with are FIFA. You either have a
five-day release rule or not. It certainly hasn't helped me in my
preparations for Belgrade.''
	   Football Association of Ireland chief executive Bernard O'Byrne
expressed ``utter disbelief'' at FIFA's decision.
	   ``It is clear FIFA will not apply their own rules in this
situation,'' he said. ``They have not cited any reason for this
decision and have suggested that while the FAI wanted FIFA to apply
the five-day release rule, the Yugoslav FA were agreeable to clubs
retaining their players this weekend.
	   ``It is clear that FIFA have sided with the Yugoslavs and the
various clubs that have contacted them. No attention was made to
our request to apply the current rules. Despite this blatant
discriminatory decision against the FAI, we must even at this late
stage abide by the decision.''
	   ``The confidence of the FAI in FIFA treating all its
Associations equally and fairly has been seriously damaged,''
O'Byrne added.
	   The Yugoslavia-Ireland game was orginally scheduled for Oct. 10
but was postponed due to the crisis in Kosovo and threats of NATO
air strikes.
	   McCarthy announced that Liverpool defender Phil Babb, among the
original 20 players named to the squad, will not make the trip.
Babb has not fully recovered from the back injury sustained when he
collided with an upright in a league game against Chelsea five
weeks ago.
	   McCarthy said no replacement would be named for Babb.

Taiwan Says U.S., Australia Support WTO Entry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ In a boost to its bid to join the
World Trade Organization ahead of China, Taiwan's economics
minister said Friday that top officials from the United States and
Australia had strongly supported its membership.
	   Wang Chih-kang, an official in Taiwan's delegation at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, said he received the
support during meetings Friday with U.S. Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky and Australia Trade Minister Tim Fischer.
	   Barshefsky said Taiwan's entry to the WTO should be based on
market, rather than political, considerations, Wang told reporters.
He said Fischer told him the WTO wouldn't be a ``complete
organization'' without Taiwan.
	   China considers Taiwan a renegade province and has long asserted
sovereignty over the island. Taiwan and China have remained divided
since the Communists took over the mainland in 1949, forcing the
Nationalist government to flee to Taiwan.
	   Since then, Taipei has engaged in an aggressive campaign to gain
privileges enjoyed by independent nations, such as membership in
the United Nations and other world bodies.
	   China insists that Taiwan mustn't be allowed into WTO before its
own entry, but Beijing's efforts to achieve that have made little
progress in recent months.
	   Wang didn't speculate when WTO membership might be possible for
Taiwan, but said it was ``very pleased'' that another top U.S.
official had offered support for its bid without political strings
attached. Earlier this week, U.S. Energy Minister Bill Richardson
visited Taipei and said its entry into the WTO would make sense.
	   The United States is Taiwan's second largest investor. Trade
between the two sides is valued at dlrs 50 billion.
	   Although Taiwan is one of APEC's 21 members, it must refer to
itself as ``Chinese Taipei'' during the group's summits and is the
only country that isn't allowed to send its leaders to the
meetings. Those steps are taken to meet the demands of China.

Academie Francaise pulls prize from Egyptian editor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The Academie Francaise, France's guardian of the
French language, has withdrawn a literary prize from an Egyptian
newspaper editor, saying he supports negationist views undermining
the Holocaust.
	   ``It was a tempest in a tea cup,'' spokesman Laurent Personne
said Friday about the Academie's decision to pull a literary award
from Mohammed Salmawi, editor-in-chief of Al-Ahram Hebdo, the
weekly French-language edition of the Arabic-language daily Al
Ahram.
	   Personne, speaking in a telephone interview, said the Academie
had simply wanted to honor a Middle Eastern French-language weekly
with a big circulation, but changed its mind after learning that
Salmawi had written an ``unacceptable'' editorial defending the
views of controversial French political philosopher Roger Garaudy.
	   Garaudy, a Roman Catholic convert to Islam, was convicted and
fined dlrs 20,000 by a French court for contesting crimes against
humanity in his 1996 book ``The Founding Myths of the state of
Israel.''
	   He minimized the number of Jews killed by the Nazis during World
War II and denounced this ``Shoah business.''
	   Last month, the Representative Council of French Jewish Groups,
known as CRIF, angrily contested the Academie's decision to honor
Salmawi, an author widely known for ``blatant anti-Semitism and
ardent support of Garaudy.''
	   ``The CRIF denounces this blow to Francophony, which besides
promoting the French language, is supposed to promote a legacy of
humanist values,'' it said in a statement.
	   Personne said the prize was to be awarded to the newspaper, not
Salmawi himself.
	   ``Up until that time, the paper had never published anything
odious,'' he said.

Hattori takes first-round lead at 7-under 65
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHONAN, Japan (AP) _ Michiko Hattori shot a bogey-free 7-under
65 Friday to take a two-stroke lead in the first round in the 60
million yen (dlrs 491,800) Itoen Ladies golf tournament.
	   Hattori, who won four Japanese tour titles this year, carded
seven birdies on the 6,364-yard, par-72 Great Island Club course
just outside Tokyo.
	   Two strokes behind was Suzuko Maeda, who shot six birdies
against one bogey for a 67, standing alone in second place.
	   Han Hee-won of South Korea, who earned her Japan tour membership
in August, shot a 3-under 69 to share third place with seven other
players, including Sweden's Helen Alfredsson, who also shot a 69.
	   Both Han and Alfredsson sank four birdies against one bogey.
	   Two-time money rankings champion Akiko Fukushima was another
stroke back at 2-under 70, sharing 11th place with Tseng Hsiu-feng
of Taiwan and South Koreans Kim Man-soo and Won Jai-sook.
	   A total of 108 players teed off for the 54-hole event in clear
weather. The winner will collect 10.8 million yen (dlrs 88,500).

Indian parliament speaker calls for closer ties with Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The speaker of India's parliament called for
increased economic ties and closer relations with Russia in a
speech to Russian lawmakers on Friday, a news report said.
	   G.M.C. Balayogi also proposed a joint commission of Russian and
Indian lawmakers, saying they could examine the constitutions of
both countries and seek ways to improve them, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   Under Russia's constitution, the president wields enormous
power, while parliament has much less clout.
	   During a meeting with the speaker of Russia's upper house, Yegor
Stroyev, Balayogi said India's regions wanted direct cooperation
and trade with Russia's regions, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Balayogi spoke to the lower house of Russia's parliament, the
State Duma, where he called for more cooperation in trade and
economic fields.
	   India is a leading buyer of Russian arms, and is building two
nuclear reactors purchased from Russia in a dlrs 2.6 billion
contract. Both sides say the reactors cannot be used for military
means.

Kosovo Albanians swapped for Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with reports of Albanian killed in Mlecane
village, edits to conform, trims old material.
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed Serb civilians swapped
hostages with ethnic Albanian guerrillas on Friday, amid reports
that Serb police shot and killed an ethnic Albanian in the village
of Mlecane.
	   All three sides _ Kosovo Albanians, Serb officials and
international monitors who intervened to defuse the crisis _
confirmed that two Serb civilians held since Wednesday by the
separatist guerillas were released in exchange for the seven
remaining ethnic Albanians still held by the Serbs.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot
throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo, the
Albanian-majority Serbian province.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
	   Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness
said Serb police opened fire on a group of ethnic Albanian men and
children, killing one of the men and injuring another. The Kosovo
Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, also carried
the report.
	   According to Tafil Kryeziu, 19, six police pulled up in an
unmarked car Thursday and opened fire on the group. The children
fled unharmed, but Xhafer Gashi, 40, who was paralyzed on one side
was killed. Rexhep Shala, 32, was wounded in the arm.
	   Journalists visiting Mlecane Friday saw two pools of blood amid
15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident reportedly
took place. Male villagers, who only recently returned to the homes
they left earlier, said all the women and children had fled again.
	   ``We aren't normal folks anymore. Whenever we see a car, we run
away because we're afraid,'' said Ismajl Gashi, 40. He said the men
were also considering leaving.
	   The detentions and continued shootings have chipped away at
hopes for a solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and
Albanians, ushered in by an Oct. 12 agreement.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province has left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made
refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told
Serbs _ a less than 10 percent minority in the province _ they had
nothing to fear from the October agreement, ultimately aimed at
restoring wide-ranging Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   ``All Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told
reporters.

	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Police squad cars were damaged
Friday when two apparent hand grenades exploded outside this city's
main police station. No one was injured.
	   The explosives were believed to have been thrown over the
parking lot wall from railroad tracks running alongside the station
in Eindhoven, about 150 kilometers (90 miles) southeast of
Amsterdam.
	   Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for the attack and
police said they had no idea of a possible motive.
	   Police began investigating the incident while explosives experts
tried to determine exactly what caused the two explosions, which
shattered car windows in the parking lot.

U.N. survey highlights damage to villages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARE NULLIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ A U.N. assessment of the level of destruction in
Serbia's Kosovo province has found that 60 percent of houses in
villages surveyed have been either destroyed or heavily damaged.
	   Initial results of the survey released Friday by the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees said an estimated 100,000 people are now
displaced within Kosovo and a further 125,000 outside its borders.
	   Some 65,000 have returned home since an Oct. 12 agreement meant
to end the Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists, it said.
	   ``The situation is still very, very precarious,'' said UNHCR
spokesman Kris Janowski.
	   The October agreement provides for international observers to
try to reduce tensions and encourage refugees and displaced to
return home.
	   ``UNHCR won't rebuild destroyed villages. This is the
responsibility of the Yugoslav government,'' he said. ``But we will
be able to help people with basic shelter material and ... to
survive the winter.''
	   Janowski said even though 100,000 people are still displaced in
Kosovo, only a handful are without shelter in the open.
	   Before the agreement, aid workers feared a humanitarian disaster
this winter if tens of thousands of displaced were forced to stay
in the open.
	   ``Everyone will have a roof over their head this winter,'' said
Janowski. ``But it won't necessarily be their own.''
	   In continuing tension, Yugoslav troops earlier this week entered
a village near the town of Prizren searching for weapons. The
village, Ljubizda, is near the Albanian border and is a suspected
entry point for arms smuggled to ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo.
	   The soldiers held 400 village men at a store and 2,000 women and
children in a school for more than 24 hours. Older boys and girls
were questioned through the night. All were denied food, although
the women were allowed water and use of a toilet, according to
accounts received by U.N. staff.
	   Villagers said 16 men were taken to Prizren for questioning.
Some were beaten and then lined up against a wall with guns aimed
at their backs.
	   One gun was found during a search of houses and two more were
handed over voluntarily. The army commander said his troops would
return next Tuesday and burn the place unless all arms were
surrendered.
	   Villagers told U.N. staff they would flee unless international
monitors came to their aid.

Government confirms decision to pave bypass roads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES BC-Israel-Hebron &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's government confirmed Friday that it
has authorized the paving of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, including one that will reportedly require the
expropriation of thousands of acres of Palestinian-owned land.
	   The Palestinians sharply protested the decision.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and is a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' said Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   U.S. officials were also critical of Israel's decision.
	   The latest dispute came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was en
route to the region to oversee implementation of the new
land-for-security agreement. Ross was to meet separately with
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel is to gradually withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January. The pullback
will turn several Jewish settlements into isolated enclaves in
Palestinian-controlled areas and Israel has said it needs to pave
new roads to ensure safe passage to all settlers.
	   On Thursday, Netanyahu and senior Cabinet ministers authorized
the paving of bypass roads, although initial reports were unclear
on how many and which projects had been approved.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Friday that in all, 13
roads would be paved, including one that will stretch from near the
West Bank town of Hebron and past the Palestinian refugee camp of
Al Aroub to Jerusalem and is known as the ``Al Aroub bypass.''
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and the armed forces
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, reportedly oppose the Al
Aroub project, arguing the road work could lead to Palestinian
riots because so much land will have to be expropriated.
	   Bar-Illan said the government would try to minimize the
expropriation, but that without the new roads there could not be a
troop pullback. ``They are a vital element of the agreement,'' he
said.
	   Asked to comment on the road plans, U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz referred to comments by U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin on Thursday on Israel's decision to start construction
of a Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Rubin said the building plan was a ``bad decision that harms the
peace process'' and Schwartz said Friday that that comment also
applied to the paving of the bypass roads.
	   Israel's Cabinet ratified the peace accord on Wednesday, after
two weeks of delay, and implementation is to begin next week.
	   Netanyahu has said he would permit the opening of the
Palestinian airport and begin releasing Palestinian prisoners,
though he has not set dates. Later in the week, Israel was to
withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank.
	   In other developments Friday, the army clamped a curfew on
downtown Hebron after an assailant hurled a hand grenade at an army
outpost. The grenade did not go off and there were no injuries.
	   In a similar incident in September, an activist in the Islamic
militant group Hamas threw two hand grenades at a group of Israeli
soldiers, wounding a dozen troops and several Palestinians. The
assailant was later arrested by Israel.

	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla hideouts in southern Lebanon on Friday in the sixth such
attack in as many days, security officials said.
	   Four hours later, Israeli gunners fired a mortar into a nearby
village, wounding a teenager, the officials said. It was not clear
what prompted the shelling on Arab Saleem village.
	   The officials said two Israeli jets fired four missiles in two
sorties at the abandoned village of Aqmata in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a
Hezbollah stronghold that faces an Israeli-occupied border enclave
in southern Lebanon.

Slovakia soon may be on the track for EU enlargement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Two of three political issues that
prevented Slovakia from being a front-runner for European Union
membership have been fixed under the country's new leadership, an
EU official involved with the enlargement process said Friday.
	   Opposition politicians now hold leadership positions in
parliament and are included in all parliamentary committees,
something that did not occur under the previous regime, said
Herbert Boesch, chairman of a joint EU-Slovak parliamentary panel.
The new government of Prime Minister Mikulas Dzurinda took power
Oct. 30.
	   The only issue yet to be addressed is reconsideration of a law
requiring official business to be conducted in Slovak. The country
has a sizable ethnic Hungarian community.
	   ``Once these deficits are fixed, neither I or the European
Parliament see a reason why Slovakia should not be with the
countries in the first wave of enlargement,'' Boesch said.
	   The EU rejected Slovakia's bid to be included in the first round
of expansion because the country had not made necessary democratic
reforms.
	   Boesch refused to speculate on when Slovakia might become an EU
member, but said the first countries would probably join in 2006.
	   Peter Weiss, chairman of Slovakia's Foreign Affairs Committee,
said the country hoped to become a front-runner in June.
	   Expansion talks have begun with Poland, Hungary, the Czech
Republic, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Passenger bus service between uneasy
neighbors India and Pakistan will begin in a matter of weeks,
Pakistani and Indian officials said Friday after emerging from the
most successful talks so far on normalizing relations.
	   The bus service was a rare point of agreement to emerge from six
days of talks that ended with Friday's meetings between Indian
Culture Secretary R.V.V. Ayyar and his Pakistani counterpart Syed
Roshan Zamir at the National Museum, an opulent British-era red
sandstone building in the heart of New Delhi.
	   ``We cannot allow this vicious cycle of mistrust to continue,''
Ayyar said at the end of the talks.
	   For the most part, issues ranging from improving cultural ties
to military exchanges on a Himalayan glacier revealed the wide and
treacherous gap between India and Pakistan, which each tested
nuclear weapons in May. Their main dispute is rival claims to the
Himalayan province of Kashmir, over which the two countries have
fought two of their three wars.
	   Talks Thursday ended with the two sides accusing each other of
supporting terrorism. India accused officially Islamic Pakistan of
supporting Muslim insurgents in Indian-held Kashmir, the
predominately Hindu country's only Muslim-majority state. Pakistan
accused India of carrying out a bombing campaign in its southern
Sindh province that has spread north in retaliation for Pakistan's
support for Kashmir insurgents.
	   Militants in Indian-held Kashmir clashed Friday with security
troops in Srinagar, the state's capital. Three security force
members and at least one militant were killed, police said.
	   In New Delhi, Pakistani foreign office spokesman Tariq Altaf
said Friday that broad agreement had been reached on the bus
service, which will make it easier for ordinary citizens of both
countries to visit each other. All that's needed is for technical
experts to thrash out points such as security and taxes, he said,
predicting trips would start by the end of the month.

Central Bank figures on bank loans.
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economy is forecast to shrink anywhere
from 3 to 9 percent next year in addition to a 5 percent drop this
year, the Finance Ministry said Friday.
	   The predictions by Finance Ministry analysts indicated that
Russia's latest economic crisis is likely to last through most of
all of next year. The Russian economy has been shrinking throughout
the 1990s in one of the most painful and prolonged recessions ever
suffered by an industrialized nation.
	   Even in the best case scenario, the economy will probably
contract by 3 percent next year, the ministry said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   Under this forecast, the government will meet its revenue
targets, the country will receive foreign loans that have been
promised, and inflation will stay relatively tame at 30 percent.
	   But the government would still need to borrow 60 billion rubles
(dlrs 3.6 billion) from the Central Bank to cover its budget
deficit.
	   The Finance Ministry acknowledged that events were unlikely to
be so rosy.
	   Under the gloomier scenario, the economy would shrink 9 percent
and the cash-strapped government would have to print 320 billion
rubles (dlrs 19.3 billion), pushing inflation up to around 130
percent.
	   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund put together
a dlrs 22.6 billion loan for Russia in July, but the installments
were put on hold after the country's economic crisis hit in August.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn was in Moscow on Friday to
get a first-hand view of the country's economic problems. But
Russia is not expected to receive any additional money until it
comes up with a recovery program that meets with the approval of
the IMF and World Bank.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's Central Bank said it plans to give the
country's failing banks 19 billion rubles (dlrs 1.1 billion) in
credits for the rest of this year, and another 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.5 billion) next year, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   To get a share of the credit, banks must meet minimal
requirements for hard currency reserves, have no arrears to the
Central Bank, and agree on a restructuring program, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The Central Bank has said it would need 141 billion rubles (dlrs
8.5 billion) to properly bail out the banking sector, money it
admits it doesn't have.

Two small explosions in two days
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ A small devise exploded early Friday in a
Social Security office causing material damage only, police said.
	   The incident was a near repetition of a similar explosion at a
temporary employment agency the night before, police spokesman
Jesus Sanchez said.
	   No warning was received prior to either the first explosion in
northern Madrid or the second further to the east, and no group has
since claimed responsibility, Sanchez added.
	   In the past similar small scale blasts have been attributed to
the armed group known as GRAPO that is blamed for killing 60 people
in infrequent bombing and shooting attacks since first appearing in
the early 1970s.
	   So far this year GRAPO - whose name stands for October First
Antifascist Resistance Group _ has claimed responsibility for minor
explosions at an insurance company and two government tax offices.
	   GRAPO's precise aims have never been clear, although according
to leading daily El Pais, an underground congress of the group in
September decided to concentrate on low intensity attacks on
capitalist targets.

Japanese politicians lobby for trade protection at APEC
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In an unusual private initiative, a group of
Japanese politicians traveled to the Pacific Rim trade summit to
try to persuade leaders to retain protective tariffs for some
goods.
	   The four members of Japan's ruling political party, led by
parlimentarian Yoichi Tani, met Friday with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad, the APEC host, to seek his understanding
for Japan's refusal to drop protective tariffs on fisheries and
forestry products.
	   Their presence also appeared to put pressure on the Japanese
delegation, given how politically sensitive those industries are
back home, especially to the ruling party, which gathers much of
its support from rural and farm votes.
	   The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum agreed in Vancouver,
Canada, last year to lower trade barriers in nine areas, including
those two. But Japan has argued that member nations are free to not
comply with some parts of the agreement.
	   ``APEC's liberalization measures should be done within the scope
of voluntary needs. I understand that Japan's farm sectors have
various sensitive issues,'' Mahathir was quoted as saying by one of
the visiting politicians.
	   Mahathir also told the politicians that Japan should proceed
with a dlrs 30 billion plan to aid Asian economies ``without
interference of the United States.''
	   The aid plan, recently announced by the Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa, is designed to halt the Asian economic slide by ensuring
a steady supply of capital to companies in the region.
	   The legislators, who appeared to leave Kuala Lumpur on Friday
evening, weren't part of the Japanese delegation and didn't hold
news conferences or release statements to the foreign media.

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ New Zealand's Marnie McGuire said
she could lead all the way to the title after staying in front
through the second round of the women's Australian Open on Friday.
	   McGuire said she was experienced at protecting a lead and felt
comfortable despite dreadful conditions which cut short the second
round.
	   McGuire shot her second 1-under 72 at the Yarra Yarra course to
lead by two from Australia's Jan Stephenson and Corinne Dibnah who
have both shot 74-72. Favorite Liselotte Neumann, of Sweden, was a
further shot behind after a scratchy 74.
	   Local favorite Karrie Webb fought back from her opening 78 to
shoot the best round of the day, a 3-under 70, to stay in
contention in the Australian dlrs 350,000 (U.S. dlrs 222,250)
event.
	   Rain delayed the start Friday and 18 players will have to finish
their second rounds early Saturday.
	   McGuire, 29, said the rain and bitter temperatures had made her
feel like she was right at home.
	   ``I feel like I'm in Auckland _ very similar conditions and
similar golf courses,'' McGuire said. ``You've really got to hang
on and sometimes it gets a little hard because you're getting tired
and you've been out there for a long time, but everybody has to
battle that.''
	   Neumann had a difficult round and was in trouble early when she
had a triple-bogey at the par-4 1st hole.
	   Kelly Robbins, of the United States, improved on her opening 75
with a 74 to be five behind McGuire. Fellow American Christie Kerr
fell back with a 78 following her opening 74.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and Japanese leaders issued a ``Moscow
Declaration'' on Friday in which they pledged to seek an end to
their 53-year-old dispute over the Kuril islands by the end of next
year.
	   If they succeed, it would mean that Russia and Japan could
formally end World War II before the end of the 20th century. The
dispute over ownership of the tiny islands has stopped the two
countries from ever signing a formal peace treaty.
	   The declaration, signed Thursday by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
of Japan and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, gives no hint of
how the conflict might be resolved, but sets up a new mechanism _
and a new resolve _ for doing it.
	   ``All of us gained something,'' said Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   The declaration was issued at the outset of talks between Obuchi
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia. The two had been
expected to focus on the details of when and how Japan will hand
over an dlrs 800 million installment on a loan it promised last
summer.
	   There was no immediate indication that the loan details had been
resolved in their talks.
	   On Thursday, Obuchi and Yeltsin ``exchanged views from broad and
lofty perspectives,'' as Obuchi's spokesman put it, in the first
formal visit by a Japanese prime minister to the Russian capital in
25 years.
	   While the subject of the disputed islands loomed over the talks,
the leaders were also expected to work out the timing and logistics
of Japan's loan, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer. Both the
IMF and the World Bank put their loans on hold after Russia
effectively defaulted on foreign loans at the outset of its
economic crisis in August.
	   In addition to agreeing to free up the loan, Obuchi has offered
to give Russia dlrs 100 million to promote economic development on
the Kuril islands, dlrs 10 million to medical assistance and dlrs
20 million to support youth exchange programs.
	   The two prime ministers signed a spate of agreements, including
one on guarantees of capital investments that is expected to pave
the way for large-scale Japanese investment in Russia, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   The two also agreed on the concept of a Russian-Japanese
investment company that would promote direct investments in Russia
by Japanese companies.
	   They signed memorandums on cooperation in tourism, transport,
mail and telecommunications, as well as support for Russia's small-
and medium-size companies.
	   Relations between the two countries have long been clouded by
the Kuril dispute.
	   Tokyo claimed title to the islands _ Etorofu, Kunashiri,
Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty with Russia in 1875.
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War
II, a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 poor and restive Russian
residents, many of whom would welcome Japanese administration. The
Kurils are important to both countries for symbolic reasons and
because they are surrounded by prime fishing waters.

Turkey disputes cost of pipeline for Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Weeks before an international consortium
decides on the route of a pipeline to carry Caspian oil, the
Turkish government Friday challenged the consortium's report that
the construction of a pipeline through Turkey was an expensive
option.
	   Energy Ministry Undersecretary Yurdakul Yigitguden said a
pipeline from Azerbaijan's capital Baku to Turkey's southern port
Ceyhan would cost dlrs 2.3 billion according to a feasibility study
prepared by Germany's PLE Engineering.
	   The consortium forecast the cost of the 1,730-kilometer (1,081-
mile) pipeline at dlrs 3.7 billion.
	   Yigitguden claimed the consortium's study was based on the
possibility of high construction costs and other contingencies.
	   ``They are even calculating the length of the pipeline 240
kilometers (150 miles) longer than ours,'' he said.
	   The consortium was reportedly opting for a shorter and cheaper
pipeline running through the Georgian Black Sea port of Supsa.
	   But Turkey has also declared that it will not allow its Bosporus
strait, the sole maritime outlet from the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean, to be used for the transport of oil because of the
danger of collisions and oil spills in the narrow waterway.
	   Referring to differences in estimates, Yigitguden said ``the
political support of the United States and Turkey in this unstable
region cannot be compared with money.''
	   The United States is actively lobbying for Turkey in an apparent
effort to keep Russia's influence over former Soviet republics at
bay.
	   The Baku-Ceyhan pipeline will bypass both Russia and Iran and
bring the Caspian region closer to the West.

Japan dispatches military jets on Honduras relief mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Six Japan Self-Defense Force planes left Friday on
a relief mission to hurricane-devastated Honduras in Tokyo's first
dispatch of military units for disaster aid abroad, the Foreign
Ministry said.
	   The C-130 transport planes loaded with medical supplies and
carrying 185 Self-Defense Force personnel will reach Honduras on
Monday and conduct relief work for about two weeks in
disaster-stricken areas.
	   On Saturday, an 80-member Self-Defense Force medical team will
leave on a commercial flight to Honduras.
	   Japan in 1992 enacted a law allowing military personnel to be
sent on relief operations to foreign countries, and the mission to
Honduras is the country's first under the law.
	   Japan's constitution forbids it from engaging in military
activity abroad, but its Self-Defense Forces have recently started
carving a niche on the international front in U.N. peacekeeping
missions.
	   Mitch killed an estimated 10,000 people and left hundreds of
thousands homeless as it cut a path of destruction through Central
America.

German prosecutors investigate three tenors in tax case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANNHEIM, Germany (AP) _ Prosecutors said Friday they were
investigating whether the three tenors _ Jose Carreras, Luciano
Pavarotti and Placido Domingo _ and star soprano Montserrat Caballe
helped a German concert promoter evade taxes.
	   Mannheim prosecutor Hubert Jobski said there were signs that the
four may have been involved in the case against Matthias Hoffmann,
but that the investigation had only just started and could take
months.
	   Hoffmann went on trial on fraud and tax evasion charges last
month. He is accused of using unreported payments and shell
companies in Ireland, London and elsewhere to evade almost 24
million marks (dlrs 15 million) in German taxes.
	   Hoffmann, who has been in investigative custody since July 30,
1997, has organized concerts with the three tenors and Caballe.
	   Carreras' attorney, Gerhard Rau, called the investigation
against the singer ``nothing special'' and said prosecutors were
obliged to look into any charge Hoffmann made.
	   Rau is also representing Carreras in a civil lawsuit against
Hoffmann that opened in Mannheim Friday. Carreras charges he never
received 400,000 marks (dlrs 250,000) in fees for two 1997 concerts
in Germany. A decision in the civil case is expected Dec. 4.

Airport ready for operation; Palestinians await word from Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The new Palestinian airport, a powerful symbol
of fledgling independence, is ready to open, the head of the
Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority said Friday after an
operations drill with Israeli officials.
	   Yasser Arafat International Airport in the southern Gaza Strip
was to have opened last week as part of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement. However, Israel fell behind schedule when it held
up Cabinet ratification of the accord by two weeks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the airport would
start operating next week, but has not set a date.
	   On Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian officials staged a
four-hour drill, said Fayez Zeidan, head of the Palestinian Civil
Aviation Authority.
	   About 100 Palestinian airport employees and 50 Israelis who will
share security duties played the roles of passengers and airport
personnel. For lack of a plane, the ``passengers'' arrived by bus.
	   Zeidan said the exercise covered arrival and departure
procedures, including passport checks as well as customs and
luggage inspection.
	   He said the airport was ready for operation. ``We just need to
hear from the Israelis,'' Zeidan said.

German-French diplomacy, key to Europe, picks up
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German and French leaders, the key partners
in building a stronger European Union, will meet next month for
their first summit since the center-left took power in Germany, a
government spokesman said Friday.
	   One controversial topic reportedly under discussion between the
two governments is proposing a German as next European Commission
president, possibly Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine.
	   But Schroeder's spokesman, Uwe-Karsten Heye, said he had no
indication so far that the debate would be discussed by the
leaders.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, whose Social Democrats won
September elections, will make his debut at the biannual summit set
for Nov. 30-Dec. 1 in Potsdam near Berlin.
	   President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who
falls politically to the left of Schroeder, will represent France.
Schroeder and Chirac will meet in Bonn on Nov. 23 to prepare the
meeting.
	   Lafontaine on Thursday denied German media reports that he was a
candidate for the European Union post.
	   Since Germany's Social Democrats won September elections, he has
become the new government's most controversial figure with calls
for lower European interest rates, global cooperation to control
exchange rate swings and pumping up the German economy by boosting
people's spending power.
	   He has substantial influence, occupying both the party's top
post and running the Finance Ministry as Germany joins 10 other
European countries in the monetary union launching Jan. 1.
	   Lafontaine comes from Saarland, a western German region on the
French border. Unlike Schroeder, he speaks French.
	   The European Commission has declined comment on the reports that
Lafontaine would succeed Jacques Santer of Luxembourg, whose
five-year term expires at the end of 1999.
	   France's finance minister, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, on Thursday
called the debate about the top EU post premature, though he said
``of course'' there were candidates.
	   On Monday, both countries' finance ministers and central bank
chiefs of both countries meet in Bonn. Topics will include closer
cooperation on finance policy, finance ministry spokesman Torsten
Albig said.
	   Schroeder made his first foreign trip as chancellor-elect to
Paris to dampen French fears that his desire for closer ties with
Britain will mean neglecting France as a key force behind European
unification.
	   The French-German axis was critical to building a stronger
European Union, including the single currency, the euro. The two
countries are also each other's largest trading partners.

Insurance giant Aetna hopes to expand in Malaysia

 &UR; With BC-APEC

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) - The U.S. insurance giant Aetna
said Friday it hoped to expand into Malaysia's health insurance
market, a news report said.
	   ``Aetna is optimistic with Malaysia and we plan to remain
bullish here,'' said Michael Stephens, the chairman of Aetna
International Inc., which already offers certain insurance services
in the Southeast Asian country.
	   ``We would like to expand into other areas if the Malaysian
government allows us,'' Stephens was quoted as saying by the state
news agency, Bernama, after meeting with Malaysia's Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Stephens said he felt Malaysia's recession-hit economy was
showing signs of recovery that made it a good time to invest.
	   Aetna is one of seven companies that has contributed dlrs
200,000 to Malaysia to help it host the ongoing Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit.
	   ``With good leadership and the economic getting stronger, things
are definitely getting better now,'' Stephens said.

Criminal case opened against Communist lawmaker, official says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with prosecutors denying they opened a new criminal
case against Makashov, comments from lawmakers, others. &QL; 
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's security chief said Friday that a
criminal case was opened against a Communist lawmaker who has made
a series of anti-Semitic remarks. But prosecutors denied that,
saying they haven't yet found incriminating evidence.
	   Albert Makashov, a member of parliament and a retired general,
has ignited controversy by blaming the country's problems on
``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews. Russian law forbids
speeches that ``incite ethnic strife.''
	   Vladimir Putin, the chief of Russia's Federal Security Service,
said on Friday that Moscow city prosecutors had officially launched
a probe against Makashov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But prosecutors said that a month ago they only started a
general investigation into the calls for the government's ouster
made by several politicians at public rallies, but hasn't launched
a probe against Makashov.
	   Putin said the FSB would urge prosecutors to bring separate
charges against Makashov for his anti-Semitic statements and
request that parliament's lower house, the State Duma, waive the
immunity he enjoys as a lawmaker.
	   Prosecutors said they were still checking whether Makashov made
any remarks punishable by law.
	   President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday criticized prosecutors and
other law-enforcement officials for their ``indecision'' in
combating political and ethnic extremism. He didn't specifically
refer to Makashov's case.
	   Communists, who dominate the Duma together with their hardline
allies, last week blocked a resolution condemning Makashov. They
could also block any attempt to lift his immunity.
	   Meanwhile, the Duma on Friday debated a vague measure that
criticizes unspecified lawmakers for ``inciting ethnic tension.''
The measure doesn't contain any specific reference to Makashov or
anti-Semitism.
	   ``This statement is a camouflage, it's simply an attempt to
shrug off the protests,'' said Iosif Kobzon, a popular singer who
is also a member of the Duma.
	   ``I face anti-Semitic attacks myself every day I enter the State
Duma building,'' he said.
	   Some Communist officials defended Makashov in speeches last
weekend celebrating the 81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian
revolution, which brought the Communist Party to power.
	   Makashov's statements and the Communist refusal to censure him
have sparked protests in Russia and abroad. Israel's ambassador to
Russia said Thursday that Makashov's attacks were an insult to the
entire Israeli nation.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had been only
mildly critical of Makashov in recent days, made a more direct
denunciation on Thursday.
	   ``We consider Makashov's statements inappropriate, unrestrained
and incorrect,'' Zyuganov said.
	   But Yelena Mizulina, a member of the liberal Yabloko faction
urged the entire house to openly condemn Makashov. ``Makashov's
words reflect the opinion of his party comrades,'' she said.

Yugoslav official warns Kosovo deal in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Yugoslav government official
accused ethnic Albanians of undermining an agreement to end the
violence in Kosovo and warned the deal could fail.
	   Zoran Lilic, a deputy premier, declared the Yugoslav side in
full compliance with the Oct. 12 agreement between President
Slobodan Milosevic and U.S. mediator Richard Holbrooke.
	   At talks with European envoy Wolfgang Petrisch, Lilic said,
``the EU must energetically prevent any new attempt of terrorist
acts by extreme Albanian nationalists who are trying to take
advantage of the situation with one aim only _ to provoke clashes
and thus prevent implementation of the agreement.''
	   Lilic said a solution for Kosovo can only be found through talks
and called for resumption of dialogue with ethnic Albanian
political leaders.
	   A statement issued by Lilic and carried by Tanjug news agency
ruled out participation of the militant Kosovo Liberation Army in
the talks, saying, ``in that process there is no place for
extremists, terrorism, abductions, killings, armed attacks.''
	   Lilic warned that ``all responsible for implementation of the
agreement, the whole international community, must start from the
fact that an agreement respected only by one side stands no
chance.''

Real Madrid chairman says club closer to deal with Liverpool's
</HEADLINE>
McManaman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chairman of reigning European champion
Real Madrid said the club was closer to clinching attacking
Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman for a four-season contract,
the leading Spanish daily El Pais said Friday.
	   ``Our positions have come closer, so much so that a satisfactory
resolution to the matter looks likely,'' Lorenzo Sanz told the
paper after talks with McManaman's agent Colin Gordon on Thursday.
	   Previous negotiations this month had stumbled over Real Madrid's
opinion that the 26-year-old player was asking for too much, El
Pais said. The paper added that the latest talks indicated such
problems had been ironed out.
	   Sanz said Real was looking to sign McManaman for four seasons
with an option on a fifth. There were no details available
regarding the financial side of the contract.
	   McManaman's contract with Liverpool expires in June 1999. The
club is expected to offer him an attractive renewal deal. But Real
Madrid officials say the chances of the midfielder leaving have
increased because of difficulties at the struggling Premier league
side, exemplified Thursday by the resignation of co-manager Roy
Evans.
	   In addition, Madrid believes McManaman would favor a move to the
Spanish club as he has a bone to pick with Real's eternal rival FC
Barcelona who, in the last minute, pulled out of negotiations to
sign him two seasons ago preferring to do a deal with Brazilian
Rivaldo.

international monitors who intervened to defuse the crisis _
confirmed that two Serb civilians held since Wednesday by the
separatist guerillas were released in exchange for the seven ethnic
Albanians remaining in Serb custody.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, Serbia's much smaller partner in the Yugoslav republic.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
missing from the central Drenica region, a trouble spot throughout
much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces on
guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo, the Albanian-majority
Serbian province.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
border with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
	   Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness
said Serb police opened fire on a group of ethnic Albanian men and
children, killing one of the men and injuring another. The Kosovo
Information Center, close to the ethnic Albanian leadership, also
carried the report.
	   According to a witness, six police pulled up in an unmarked car
Thursday and opened fire on the group. The children fled unharmed,
but the gunfire killed a 40-year-old man who was paralyzed on one
side. Another man was wounded in the arm.
	   Journalists visiting Mlecane on Friday saw two pools of blood
amid 15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident
reportedly took place. Male villagers, who only recently returned
to the homes they left earlier, said all the women and children had
fled again.
	   ``We aren't normal folks anymore. Whenever we see a car, we run
away because we're afraid,'' said Ismajl Gashi, 40. He said the men
were also considering leaving.
	   The detentions and continued shootings have chipped away at
hopes for a solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and ethnic
Albanians, ushered in by an Oct. 12 agreement.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province has left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians civilians,
and made refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told
Serbs _ who make up less than 10 percent of the province _ that
they had nothing to fear from the October agreement, ultimately
aimed at restoring wide-ranging Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   ``All Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told
reporters.

Belgium seizes hundreds of kilos of cocaine, hashish, XTC pills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HASSELT, Belgium (AP) _ Police said Friday they have seized
hundreds of kilos of cocaine from Colombia, hashish from Morocco
and locally made XTC pills with a combined street value of some
dlrs 30 million.
	   Three Belgians and five Dutch nationals appeared in court in
this northeastern Belgian town charged with drug trafficking after
justice officials held a press conference showing off their catch.
	   Eight others, including several British nationals and a
Norwegian, still await to be formally charged.
	   Karel Cleeren, a spokesman for the Hasselt prosecutor's office,
said police seized 180 kilos of Colombian cocaine stuffed in
containers that arrived at the port of Antwerp.
	   The first such shipment was discovered Aug. 21. Police have also
seized 950 kilos of hashish from Morocco and 100,000 amphetamine
pills produced in Belgium.
	   Cleeren put the street value of the drugs at about 1 billion
Belgian francs (dlrs 28.6 million).
	   The cocaine alone was of such good quality, he told reporters
that its value alone was almost 600 million francs (dlrs 17
million).

Amid military threat, Iraq turns blind eye to loss of Arab support

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Fearing U.S. airstrikes, thousands of
Iraqis queued up outside gasoline stations Friday as Iraq's
official media ignored the evident loss of Arab support in its
confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Official newspapers published articles hailing President Saddam
Hussein's decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission, and claimed there was worldwide condemnation of
American threats.
	   The United States has beefed up its military strength in the
Gulf and is threatening to launch airstrikes in a bid to force Iraq
to allow inspections by the Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The world calls for dialogue and peace and America seeks war
and aggression,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Baath party newspaper, said in a banner headline.
	   The newspapers made no mention of the warning issued to Iraq
Thursday by six Gulf Arab countries _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _
along with Syria and Egypt.
	   They called for ``wisdom and reason'' to end the confrontation
but said Saddam's government alone would be ``responsible for any
consequences'' from its stopping the weapons inspectors' work.
	   At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said if the Arab countries are sincere about resolving the crisis,
``they should blame the main block ... the United States.''
	   Hours later, Iraqi newspapers Friday claimed Iraq was capable of
defeating the United States.
	   During a Friday prayer sermon at a Baghdad mosque, a cleric
urged Arabs and Muslims to ``declare war on America'' and rally
behind Iraq. Friday sermons are usually screened by the government.
	   ``I call upon you ... do not let their aeroplanes use your
airspace or bases. Do not give them any facilities,'' said the
preacher, Abdullatif Humeim.
	   An opposition party in exile said in a statement received in
Cairo, Egypt that Iraqi security forces have fanned out in various
cities and are taking control of major roads. Night patrols have
intensified, said the statement by the Iraqi Communist Party. The
report could not be independently verified in Baghdad.
	   The feeling of an imminent strike was evident from the rush to
fill up gasoline. At one station, about 20 cars were queued up in
front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Iraqi officials escorting journalists said it was forbidden to
take pictures or talk to the people at the gas station.
	   A customer contacted later said he waited a half-hour to fill up
his car. ``I fear the Americans will hit refineries and there will
be a shortage of fuel,'' said the driver who did not wish to be
identified.
	   Markets in Baghdad were crammed, but the crowd comprised the
usual weekend shoppers.
	   At the Al-Shorja market, 40-year-old Naima Aidan said she was
buying coconut and sugar to make sweets for her four children. ``I
am not worried. I don't think anything will happen to us. Because
God will keep us safe,'' she said.
	   Since Wednesday, the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all
its weapons inspectors and one-third of the 450 people working on
the humanitarian programs.
	   UNSCOM chief Richard Butler called it ``a very serious
confrontation'' and said diplomatic solutions seem remote.
	   ``There's a growing sense that airstrikes or enforcement is
becoming more and more likely,'' he told MSNBC television on
Thursday night.
	   Iraq says it is will cooperate with arms inspectors only if the
U.N. Security Council guarantees that it will work to lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that
Iraq has destroyed its illegal weapons.
	   Aziz has said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the
best person'' to try to ease the current crisis. But Annan says he
has no plans to visit Baghdad as he did in February when he
resolved the last crisis.

First unit to receive Russia's new nuclear missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A regiment of Russia's strategic nuclear forces
will be equipped with the new Topol-M ballistic missile before the
end of the year, according to a news report Friday.
	   Col. Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, commander of the Strategic Rocket
Troops, told a meeting of his command that the regiment will be
equipped with 10 of the new missiles, the Interfax news agency
reported. He said six missiles have been tested by the force.
	   The Topol-M is the first new ballistic nuclear missile to be
deployed by Russia in several years and it is intended to form the
country's main nuclear deterrent. It is a relatively small, rugged
missile designed to be fired from trucks or other vehicles, making
it difficult for potential enemies to succeed with a first strike
in a nuclear confrontation.
	   The missile force has been struggling to maintain its
effectiveness at a time when the military lacks funds and equipment
because of the country's economic crisis. The force's older
missiles are wearing out rapidly and only a few Topols have been
built as replacements.
	   Russian military commanders have devoted much of their limited
funding to maintaining the nuclear forces, one of the few factors
that boosts Moscow's claim to be a global power. Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's government insists more money must be found to
modernize the nuclear forces despite the economic crisis.
	   Yakovlev said the rocket troops are still a reliable force and
had made progress in prolonging the service life of older
generation missiles.
	   ``The strategic rocket troops are maintaining full defense
capacity and are ready to implement any military tasks at any time
and to any extent,'' he was quoted as saying.

German government's jobs alliance to meet Dec. 7
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will open
roundtable talks Dec. 7 with industry and labor on ways to put the
country's nearly 4 million unemployed back to work, the government
said Friday.
	   ``This will be a first sizing-up,'' of the so-called Alliance
for Jobs, said Uwe-Karsten Heye, the chancellor's spokesman.
	   The alliance is a key project of Schroeder's government, which
was elected largely on promises to cut unemployment, now at 10.1
percent.
	   Along with Schroeder, government ministers attending would
include Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine, Economics Minister
Werner Mueller and Labor Minister Walter Riester, Heye said.
	   Four of Germany's biggest employer's associations and several
major unions also would attend the talks, which are to continue
through the administration's entire four-year term, he said.
	   Preliminary talks next Thursday would focus on drawing up an
agenda, he said.
	   One idea touted recently by Schroeder is lowering the official
retirement age to 60 to open up jobs for younger people.
	   Labor Minister Riester backed the idea Friday.
	   ``It's a very interesting point of view that should be discussed
by the alliance,'' Riester said on Suedwestfunk radio.
	   A federal research institute has drawn up a jobs creation plan
which includes increasing public investment, lowering taxes,
creating more part-time jobs and getting rid of overtime.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In the worst violence since riots
toppled President Suharto in May, at least five people were killed
Friday when Indonesian security forces battled rock-throwing
protesters and street mobs attacked suspected police informers.
	   Student activists said more than 50 of their number had been
injured in clashes with police, who used plastic bullets, tear gas
and water cannon on the protesters. At least two were hospitalized
in critical condition.
	   It was the bloodiest day of protest in a week of student
demonstrations against a special assembly meant to reform the
government left behind by Suharto's authoritarian 32 years in
power.
	   Clashes continued after dark as security personnel fired
repeated volleys of warning shots into the air. Thousands of
students and others ran for cover and threw rocks and bottles at
riot police and troops.
	   Friday's violence erupted at more than five points near the
legislature and followed similar street battles in Jakarta on
Thursday night that killed another two people and injured more than
100. In both cases, agents were blocking protesters from converging
on the Parliament.
	   Two armored personnel carriers rumbled by office blocks and
three small tanks drove down a toll road taken over by marching
students. Mobs burned tires as baton-wielding soldiers and troops
dispersed an angry crowd on a major road about two kilometers (one
mile) west of the legislature.
	   Troops fired warning shots and chased thousands of protesters
down Jakarta's main boulevard where offices and shops were closed.
	   Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and plastic
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several
students, some bleeding, were later taken out on stretches.
	   Tosik Sutina, a morgue official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital,
said two bodies, both male students, had been brought from the
university. They had gunshot wounds to their chests.
	   Students at the hospital identified the dead by the single
names, Ridwan and Teddi.
	   In East Jakarta a rampaging mob beat a third man to death in a
street as soldiers looked on. Witnesses reported dozens of other
mobs attacks against individuals accused of being police informers.
	   Syaiful, a morgue attendant at Cipto Mungunkusomo Hospital, said
it had received the bodies of one male student and civilian
security guard. Both had gunshot chest wounds.
	   Other hospitals reported a steady and bloody stream of injured.
	   Trouble broke out soon after weekly Islamic prayers ended.
Students marched from several campuses in the capital in defiance
of military warnings.
	   The students were blocked from reaching Parliament where a
special government assembly was putting the final touches to a new
political blueprint for the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   On Thursday, a high school student and a police officer died in
hospitals after 20,000 students were blocked by security personnel
from reaching Parliament.
	   At that time troops and police also dispersed the crowds with
baton charges, tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons. More
than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious injuries.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm Friday and
warned that an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across
the capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests got out of control again.
	   In an interview with private radio station Trijaya, Wiranto
suggested people stay at home and that offices not open.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men to put down
the protests, which he said had been an ``unlawful attempt to
forcibly occupy the parliament by mobs.''
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of the
likelihood of more unrest.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
Suharto's successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new
political system as Indonesia battles with it worst economic crisis
in decades. Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change, including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   ``Suharto's whole regime should be brought to trial for their
crimes,'' said one student activist Martin Sirat.
	   In concession to student demands, factions in the assembly have
agreed to name Suharto in a decree calling for an investigation
into past corruption.
	   The assembly continued its deliberations on Friday apparently
oblivious to the chaos nearby.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a male
18-year-old high school student, died before dawn Friday after
being beaten around the head. He had initially been treated at a
navy hospital.
	   Earlier, the military said an officer, identified as Pvt.
Prayitno, died after falling from a truck.

Nearly half of Greeks have serious reading problems

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nearly half of Greeks need help to fill
out a form or understand simple written instructions, according to
a nationwide survey reported Friday.
	   These levels are ``much higher'' than most other European
countries, said Gerasimos Tsiokos, head of the education ministry's
illiteracy department, which co-sponsored the study.
	   ``They were given simple tests like adding two figures or
understanding an electricity bill, and they could not do this they
are functionally illiterate,'' Tsiokos said.
	   The study found that while about 4 percent of Greeks were
totally illiterate, about 45 percent were functionally illiterate.
Most left school before completing the mandatory nine years of
attendance.
	   The need to go out to work was the reason most commonly given
for failing to finish basic schooling.
	   The survey was conducted this summer by a polling company and
involved more than 5,000 Greeks aged 15 and over who said Greek was
their mother tongue. No margin of error was given.

	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ Despite near self sufficiency in grain
production this year, Mozambique needs to import 188,000 tons of
maize, wheat and rice in the coming three months, a government
publication said.
	   Part of the shortage stems from a thriving _ and legitimate _
export of maize, or corn, from the north, the most recent edition
of the government's grain trade bulletin.
	   In the south, where the harvest has been poor, maize is being
imported from neighboring South Africa at a lower cost than
domestic grain.
	   Mozambique's 16 years of civil war nearly destroyed the
agricultural infrastructure, and the country relied heavily on
imports and foreign aid for food until the war ended in 1992.
	   But grain production has recovered to the extent that the
government now allows maize exports _ estimated at 14,000 tons in
1998 that went to Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
	   But the bulletin said exports in rice and wheat would not be
allowed because of shortages.
	   ----
	   Accra, Ghana (AP) _ Ghana's Central Bank has announced a five
percentage point reduction in its discount rate, dropping it from
42 to 37 percent.
	   In a statement issued Thursday, the Bank of Ghana said the
reduction, the second in seven weeks, had been made in response to
the declining rate of inflation and relative stability of the
exchange rate.
	   According to the statement, the bank was encouraged by the
steady decline in the rate of inflation, which stood at about 17
per cent at the end of September.
	   ``These developments reflect continuing improvements in the
macro-economic situation of the country. The Central Bank will
continue to pursue tight monetary policies to ensure the
achievement of financial stability of the economy, '' the statement
said.
	   The discount rate is the interest rate the central bank charges
in loans to commercial banks.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Representatives of Guinea-Bissau's
government and rebels met Friday in the capital Bissau to discuss
the implementation of their Nov. 2 peace agreement which ended a
five-month civil war in the small West African nation, according to
news reports.
	   The first meeting between the two sides since they signed the
pact was expected to center on the creation of a government of
national unity, the Portuguese news agency reported.
	   Other issues on the agenda were the withdrawal of foreign troops
and the deployment of a buffer force of West African peacekeepers
in the former Portuguese colony, Lusa said.
	   Neighboring Senegal and Republic of Guinea sent troops to
support President Joao Bernardo Vieira against the disgruntled
military veterans who launched a rebellion in June.
	   About half of the former Portuguese colony's 1 million people
were displaced by the fighting. No one knows how many people were
killed and wounded.
	   The country's international airport recently reopened, allowing
aid agencies to provide urgent supplies of food and medicine.
	   ----
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ A prisoners' rights
organization said Friday it would stage a nationwide hunger strike
in the country's jails if officials start removing television sets
from cells next week as planned.
	   In a legal protest expected to be heard on Tuesday, several
prisoners are trying to block the television ban and the withdrawal
of other privileges, according to Golden Miles Bhudu, director of
the South African Prisoners' Organization for Human Rights.
	   The Department of Corrections in June cut back on the number of
visits and the amounts of food allowed prisoners to control the
quantities of drugs and guns being smuggled into jails.
	   Minister of Correctional Services Ben Skosana recently announced
the removal of television sets to reduce high electricity bills and
destroy the impression that prisons were like hotels.
	   Bhudu criticised the department for failing to rehabilitate
prisoners, saying that watching television gave them something to
do other than smoking dope and having sex.

Russian weapons may retreat from breakaway region of

Trans-Dniester &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Negotiations later this month could
lead to a Russian withdrawal from the Moldovan breakaway region of
Trans-Dniester, the Moldovan president said Friday.
	   The new retreat plan could be settled soon, Petru Lucinschi
said, speaking at a news conference in the Moldovan capital.
	   The main problem facing negotiators is the military equipment
left behind by the 14th Russian Army after some of the personnel
went back to Russia.
	   ``In the past three years, Russia retreated 3,900 soldiers but
only two tanks from Trans-Dniester,'' said Lucinschi.
	   Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma and Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov are to mediate a meeting between Lucinschi and
Trans-Dniester leader Igor Smirnov in Kiev at the end of November
to settle the final details.
	   ``We are ready to negotiate a new status of Trans-Dniester but
only as a part of the Moldovan state. Its autonomy can then be
discussed,'' said Lucinschi.
	   Trans-Dniester, a mostly Russian-speaking region in eastern
Moldova, sought independence out of fear that Moldova would unite
with Romania.
	   Seven-hundred people died in 1992 in a war in Trans-Dniester
before Russian forces intervened. Efforts to reach a settlement
have failed so far.

Dutch government bans sale of violent computer game to youths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government said Friday
it will prosecute retailers who sell the violent computer game
Carmageddon II to children under age 16.
	   Justice Minister Benk Korthals said Dutch law did not empower
him to totally ban the controversial game, which simulates a car
rampaging through city streets. Points are awarded for running over
pedestrians _ including children and the elderly _ and mowing down
animals.
	   Christian Democrat lawmakers in parliament had asked Korthals to
investigate if he could ban the game, which went on sale Friday for
the first time in the Netherlands.
	   The game's packaging already clearly advises retailers that the
game should not be sold to under-16s, the Justice Ministry said.
The government's prosecution threat is intended to reinforce that
message.
	   Carmageddon II retails for 99.95 guilders (dlrs 53) in Dutch
stores.

Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: INSERTS charges against him in Turkey and Germany, possibile
difficulties with extradition request &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Abdullah Ocalan, leader of Kurdish insurgents who
has been sought for years by Turkey, has been detained in Rome
after stepping off a plane from Moscow, Turkish and Italian
officials said Friday.
	   Necati Bilican, Turkey's police chief, said his country would do
whatever necessary to extradite the rebel leader.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict. Turkey considers
the group a terrorist organization.
	   Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival Thursday
night at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome.
	   Ocalan is wanted under an international arrest warrant,
according to Turkish authorities.
	   He is on trial in Turkey in absentia on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings, charges than can bring the death
penalty.
	   Germany also issued an arrest warrant in January 1990 that
accuses Ocalan of ordering the killing of PKK deserters and being
the head of a terrorist organization.
	   Turkey's Anatolia news agency said its envoy in Rome was making
an immediate extradition request, but it could run into
difficulties. Although there have been no executions in Turkey
since 1984, Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if
there was even a risk of capital punishment.
	   Luca Cosson, an official of Rome police, said that Ocalan flew
to Rome from Moscow and was carrying a false passport. They then
made further checks and discovered his identity, Cosson said.
	   Claiming he was not feeling well, Ocalan asked to be taken to a
hospital, the Italian official said.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   A Kurdish news agency said he would ask for political asylum in
Italy.
	   Ocalan, was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus
following Turkey's threats to strike Syria. Ankara claims Syria has
long supported the rebels, offering them arms and refuge.
	   According to Turkish officials, Ocalan had fled to Russia and
sought political asylum from Moscow.
	   Of Marxist inspiration, the PKK was founded by Ocalan, a
political science dropout from Ankara university in 1978. Ocalan
turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.

International officials call for economic recovery of ex-Serb area
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ International officials on Friday warned
that the failed economic recovery and persistent harassment of
local Serbs in a formerly Serb-held region of Croatia as obstacles
to peace and reconciliation there.
	   The group of foreign ambassadors and other diplomats visited the
region known as Eastern Slavonia on Thursday as part of an ongoing
progress report its status since peacefully returning to Croatian
rule last January.
	   Once a rich agricultural area, Eastern Slavonia remains largely
devastated; thousands of Serbs have left, fearing or already facing
evictions by returning Croats, who were expelled from there by
Serbs in 1991. Croats are also reluctant to come back to the ruins.
	   In their statement, the officials said Eastern Slavonia
``remains economically moribund and severely handicapped in
sustaining ethnic Serb and Croat returns alike.''
	   ``The poor state of the local economy must also be seen as a
major factor contributing to the troubling, continuous exodus of
Serbs from the region,'' it said.
	   Croatia argues it cannot revive the region without help from
abroad. Western governments, however, say they have already
invested substantial resources in Eastern Slavonia.
	   Hoping to gather some of the estimated dlrs 2.5 billion needed
to reconstruct the region, Croatia is organizing a donors
conference to be held in Zagreb on Dec. 4-5.
	   But international officials warned money alone will not bring
prosperity back. They said economic development must be void of
ethnic discrimination, and hiring practices favoring Croats must
cease to exist.
	   The report said security in the region was ``relatively good,''
although reports of harassment of Serbs ``continue to be
numerous,'' increasing the feeling of insecurity among the local
Serbs.
	   The officials protested against the practice of local
authorities to force the eviction of Serbs who live in the houses
of Croat returnees, while they are not as swift to evict Croats who
live in Serb houses elsewhere in Croatia.
	   They also noted that both Serbs and Croats have been using
national symbols ``for divisive, political purposes,'' and insisted
that should stop.

Officer accused in death of 10 Belgian peace keepers pleads
</HEADLINE>
innocent

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ A former Rwandan military officer
pleaded innocent Friday to charges he was responsible for the
killings of 10 Belgian peace keepers and Prime Minister Agathe
Uwilingiyimana at the outset of the Rwandan genocide in April 1994.
	   In his first appearance at the U.N. International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda, Maj. Bernard Ntuyahaga said he was innocent of
the charges that allege he gave the orders to disarm and arrest the
10 Belgians escorting the Hutu prime minister, leaving her open to
assault by those leading the genocide.
	   The charges said special Rwandan military units then proceeded
to ``track down, arrest, sexually assault and kill the Prime
Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana.''
	   Ntuyahaga is also alleged to have been present when the 10
peacekeepers, there under the auspices of the United Nations
Assistance Mission in Rwanda, were later beaten and killed at a
Rwandan army base in the capital Kigali.
	   Orchestrated by an extremist Hutu government, the genocide of
minority Rwandan Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus began April
7, 1994, a day after Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana died when
his plane was shot down by unidentified assailants.
	   Over the next three months, more than 500,000 Tutsis were
slaughtered, many by their Hutu neighbors incited by a
government-sponsored hate campaign.
	   The charges allege that Ntuyahaga's actions ``were part of a
systematic attack against a civilian population on political or
national grounds and thereby constituted a Crime Against
Humanity,'' the court said in a statement released Friday.
	   The U.N. tribunal was established in the northern Tanzanian town
of Arusha in November 1994 to bring the leaders of Rwanda's
genocide to justice.
	   The tribunal has 32 suspects in custody and has convicted one
defendant and sentenced him to life imprisonment. He is appealing.
	   Another defendant pleaded guilty and was also sentenced to life
in prison, the maximum sentence the tribunal can impose.
	   Ntuyahaga was born in 1952 in Kibuye in western Rwanda. He
assumed command of the Rwandan Armed Forces 74th Battalion in the
Kigali sector in May 1994. He surrendered to the tribunal on June
8.
	   No trial date has been set.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund neared
completion of a long-expected dlrs 42 billion rescue package for
Brazil as financiers sought to stop the economic upheaval in Russia
and Asia from spreading to Latin America.
	   ``This is not a done deal but we are close,'' an IMF official,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said early Friday.
	   The official could not confirm the exact amount of the bailout
because negotiations were continuing. But he said dlrs 42 billion
was close to the total amount of the three-year package needed by
Latin America's largest economy.
	   An announcement could come as early as Friday, possibly in both
Washington and Brasilia, Brazil's capital.
	   The IMF was expected to contribute between dlrs 15 billion and
dlrs 18 billion to support Brazilian President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's austerity plan of tax increases and spending cuts aimed
at saving dlrs 23.5 billion so he can avert a devaluation of the
country's currency, the real.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The European Under-18 Championships qualifying
tournament scheduled to take place in Israel next week has been
canceled because of security concerns, the Jerusalem Post reported
Friday.
	   UEFA canceled the events Thursday after the English team said it
would not attend because of the tense situation in the Gulf, the
paper reported.
	   The U.S. has been stepping up preparations for a military strike
against Iraq. During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles
with conventional warheads at Israeli cities.
	   England, Israel, Andorra and Spain were to compete in the
tournament.
	   A new date and venue have not yet been announced. The finals are
scheduled to be played in Sweden next summer.

Belgium seizes hundreds of kilos of cocaine, hashish, XTC pills
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HASSELT, Belgium (AP) _ Belgian police on Friday announced they
had seized hundreds of kilos (pounds) of cocaine from Colombia,
hashish from Morocco and locally made XTC pills with a combined
street value of some dlrs 30 million.
	   Three Belgians and five Dutch nationals appeared in court in
this northeastern Belgian town charged with drug trafficking after
justice officials held a press conference showing off their catch.
	   Eight others, including several British nationals and a
Norwegian, still await to be formally charged.
	   Karel Cleeren, a spokesman for the Hasselt prosecutor's office,
said police seized 180 kilos (400 pounds) of Colombian cocaine
stuffed in shipping containers at the port of Antwerp.
	   The first such shipment was discovered Aug. 21. Since then,
police have also seized 950 kilos (2,100 pounds) of hashish from
Morocco and 100,000 amphetamine pills produced in Belgium.
	   Cleeren put the street value of the drugs at about 1 billion
Belgian francs (dlrs 28.6 million). The cocaine alone was worth
almost 600 million francs (dlrs 17 million).

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Todd Martin stopped Takao Suzuki's run
in the Stockholm Open Friday, beating the Japanese qualifier 6-3,
6-4 in the first quarterfinal.
	   Martin broke Suzuki twice in game seven and nine to win the
first set. After trading service breaks early in the second set,
Martin broke Suzuki again in the last game.
	   Suzuki fell behind 15-40 after two superb crosscourt returns by
Martin. The American clinched the match with a perfect lob.
	   ``The key point of the game came at 15 all in the last game,
when I hit a passing shot for a winner,'' Martin said. ``That gave
me a boost and took the wind out of him.''
	   ``I feel I'm playing great, better than a few years ago. That's
more than I can ask for. I just hope it continues for the rest of
the week and that it doesn't vanish come 1999.''
	   Martin, who reached the 1996 Stockholm final but lost to Thomas
Enqvist, will play the winner between third-seed Tim Henman and
Magnus Gustafsson in Saturday's semifinal.
	   Suzuki, ranked 122nd on the ATP Tour coming into the tournament,
reached the main draw by winning three qualifying matches last
weekend.
	   He upset Enqvist, who was the No. 8 seed, in three sets in the
first round and then beat Kenneth Carlsen in two straight to gain
his first quarterfinal on the ATP Tour.
	   Before Stockholm, Suzuki had only won two matches on the tour
since 1996. He won three Challenger tournaments this year in the
United States.
	   ``He's a very talented player,'' Martin said. ``He's got a good
serve and an incredible volley. He just neds to improve his seve a
bit to become a great player.''
	   Fourth-seed Greg Rusedski played Daniel Nestor and Jason
Stoltenberg, who upset top-ranked Pete Sampras in the first round,
faced Thomas Johansson in the other quarterfinals later Friday.

Government confirms decision to pave bypass roads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Palestinian negotiator &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's government confirmed Friday that it
has authorized the paving of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, including one that will reportedly require the
expropriation of thousands of acres of Palestinian-owned land.
	   The Palestinians sharply protested the decision.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and is a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' said Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that while the
Palestinians had expected that some roads would be built, they were
taken aback by the large number of projects authorized.
	   U.S. officials were also critical of Israel's decision.
	   The latest dispute came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was en
route to the region to oversee implementation of the new
land-for-security agreement. Ross was to meet separately with
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel is to gradually withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January. The pullback
will turn several Jewish settlements into isolated enclaves in
Palestinian-controlled areas and Israel has said it needs to pave
new roads to ensure safe passage to all settlers.
	   On Thursday, Netanyahu and senior Cabinet ministers authorized
the paving of bypass roads, although initial reports were unclear
on how many and which projects had been approved.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Friday that in all, 13
roads would be paved, including one that will stretch from near the
West Bank town of Hebron and past the Palestinian refugee camp of
Al Aroub to Jerusalem and is known as the ``Al Aroub bypass.''
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and the armed forces
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, reportedly oppose the Al
Aroub project, arguing the road work could lead to Palestinian
riots because so much land will have to be expropriated.
	   Asfour, the Palestinian negotiator, said that for the paving of
the Al Aroub bypass, Israel would have to expropriate land in areas
already under Palestinian control.

Czech local and Senate elections test political waters

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two days of local and Senate
elections began Friday in the Czech Republic, testing the nation's
political stability after this year's leftward shift in the
government.
	   No dramatic changes are expected, but the voting for the upper
chamber of parliament are a test of support for Prime Minister
Milos Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's June
general election produced a one-party minority government of Social
Democrats. Zeman's Cabinet survived in parliament thanks to a
stability pact struck with the runner-up, the center-right Civic
Democratic Party of former Premier Vaclav Klaus.
	   The deal with its former rival was criticized as an attempt to
install a two-party system and obliterate smaller parties.
	   Voters Friday and Saturday are electing more than 60,000 local
officials and 27 senators in the 81-seat upper chamber of the Czech
legislature. Pollsters expect 50 percent of the 8 million
registered voters to turn out.
	   Independent candidates are expected to dominate local elections,
which have little bearing on the balance of political power in the
country. Final results from the local races are expected Tuesday.
	   Favored candidates in the 27 Senate races come from the two
biggest parties, who are expected to maintain their constitutional
three-fifths majority.
	   They would lose that key advantage only if they drop 16 of the
contests to their main challengers, the four-party ad hoc coalition
led by Christian Democrats and the center-right Freedom Union
favored by President Vaclav Havel.
	   The Senate races will see few if any outright winners in the
first round, with none of the 136 candidates expected to receive
the required 50 percent majority. The two top vote-getters from any
undecided race will advance to a second-round showdown next Friday
and Saturday, with a simple majority required.

Criminal case opened against Communist lawmaker, official says

anti-Semitism. &QL;

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's security chief said Friday that a
criminal case was opened against a Communist lawmaker for calling
for the government's ouster, and urged a separate probe into his
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   But prosecutors denied that they had opened a case against
Albert Makashov, a retired general who has ignited controversy by
blaming the country's problems on ``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur
against Jews. Russian law forbids speeches that ``incite ethnic
strife.''
	   Vladimir Putin, the chief of Russia's Federal Security Service,
said on Friday that Moscow city prosecutors had officially launched
a probe against Makashov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But prosecutors said that a month ago they only started a
general investigation into the calls for the government's ouster
made by several politicians at public rallies, but hasn't launched
a probe specifically against Makashov.
	   Putin said the FSB would urge prosecutors to bring separate
charges against Makashov for his anti-Semitic statements and
request that parliament's lower house, the State Duma, waive the
immunity he enjoys as a lawmaker.
	   Prosecutors said they were still checking whether Makashov made
any remarks punishable by law.
	   President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday criticized prosecutors and
other law-enforcement officials for their ``indecision'' in
combating political and ethnic extremism. He didn't specifically
refer to Makashov's case.
	   Communists, who dominate the Duma together with their hardline
allies, last week blocked a resolution condemning Makashov. They
could also block any attempt to lift his immunity.
	   Meanwhile, the Duma on Friday debated a vague measure that
criticizes unspecified lawmakers for ``inciting ethnic tension.''
The measure doesn't contain any specific reference to Makashov or
anti-Semitism.
	   ``This statement is a camouflage, it's simply an attempt to
shrug off the protests,'' said Iosif Kobzon, a popular singer who
is also a member of the Duma.
	   ``I face anti-Semitic attacks myself every day I enter the State
Duma building,'' he said.
	   Some Communist officials defended Makashov in speeches last
weekend celebrating the 81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian
revolution, which brought the Communist Party to power.
	   Makashov's statements and the Communist refusal to censure him
have sparked protests in Russia and abroad. Israel's ambassador to
Russia said Thursday that Makashov's attacks were an insult to the
entire Israeli nation.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had been only
mildly critical of Makashov in recent days, made a more direct
denunciation on Thursday.
	   ``We consider Makashov's statements inappropriate, unrestrained
and incorrect,'' Zyuganov said.
	   But Yelena Mizulina, a member of the liberal Yabloko faction
urged the entire house to openly condemn Makashov. ``Makashov's
words reflect the opinion of his party comrades,'' she said.

UN agencies say North Korea must import food to avert
</HEADLINE>
malnourishment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Facing another winter of food shortages, North
Koreans risk malnourishment unless the government imports at least
a million tons of food in the coming months, a U.N report said
Friday.
	   ``Despite favorable weather this year, food production has not
recovered sufficiently enough to avert serious food shortages,''
said Saeed Malik, a senior World Food Program official . ``The food
crisis has been compounded by a complete run-down of the country's
economy.''
	   WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization, both Rome-based
U.N. agencies, issued the report following a mission to North Korea
last month.
	   The report estimates North Korea needs 1.35 million tons of
extra food to meet the population's ``minimal nutritional
requirements.'' It recommends allotting about half the food to
children, hospital patients, and pregnant women, who are considered
most at risk of malnourishment.
	   Several years of flooding and droughts coupled with an economic
downturn have heavily damaged North Korea's crop production and
capacity to import food. The report said agricultural production
was further hampered by a major shortage of fertilizer.
	   North Korea's cereal production increased by approximately 30
percent this year, the report said. But it estimated the crops
would cover the people's minimum requirements for only eight
months.
	   The report called on nations to assist North Korea with economic
reform and agricultural development. ``In the absence of these,
even without natural hazards, the food supply situation will remain
highly precarious,'' the report said.
	   The closed, communist nation turned to the international
community for help for the first time in 1995.

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Offering new hope of peace in
Cambodia, the country's warring political parties broke a
three-month impasse Friday by agreeing to form a coalition
government led by strongman Hun Sen.
	   Under the plan, Hun Sen will be the sole prime minister.
Opposition leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh will become president of
the National Assembly, even though Hun Sen's party won a narrow
majority in elections in July.
	   King Norodom Sihanouk announced the deal at the close of a
two-day summit hastily convened at the monarch's palace after
Ranariddh agreed to return to Cambodia from self-exile and resume
negotiations with Hun Sen.
	   ``The major political crisis in the country has been resolved
and the political deadlock facing the nation has also come to an
end,'' the king said in a statement.
	   The two sides have been at fierce odds since Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup d'etat last
year. The two had ruled together in a tense coalition since
U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993.
	   The new coalition government will have a clear claim to
legitimacy, which should clear the way for international aid donors
and foreign investors to again operate in the poverty-stricken
country.
	   Sihanouk pressured both sides to reach agreement before he
leaves Saturday for medical treatment in Beijing.
	   Ranariddh and allied party leader Sam Rainsy _ fearing for their
security after they led massive street protests denouncing Hun
Sen's election victory _ led an exodus of opposition lawmakers to
neighboring Thailand following the ceremonial opening of the
National Assembly in September.
	   The opposition, claiming that Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party
used fraud and intimidation to win the polls, had blocked Hun Sen
by refusing to give him the two-thirds vote in parliament necessary
to form new government.
	   An agreement by Hun Sen's party to drop its claim to the
assembly presidency removed the major stumbling block of the
negotiation process.
	   Instead, the CPP will claim the presidency of a new Senate to be
created by a constitutional amendment after the National Assembly
reconvenes on Nov. 25.
	   The Senate, described by summit insiders as mostly an advisory
chamber similar to the British House of Lords, will initially be
appointed by the king.
	   The three senior leaders of the Senate will join three top
officers of the assembly, along with the prime minister and the
country's top two Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on
the council that will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk
dies.
	   The agreement did not say how many seats the Senate would have,
nor how they would be divided. Details are to be worked out later
by the parties.
	   Formation of a coalition government could hasten Cambodia's
entry into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, put on hold
last year after Hun Sen's coup.
	   Friday's comprehensive deal also led to pardons for five of Hun
Sen's political enemies, including two top generals of Ranariddh's
armed resistance force, which has remained lodged along the
northern border with Thailand since Hun Sen's superior forces
chased them out of the capital in last year's coup.
	   All five of those pardoned were convicted of political crimes by
courts that are widely seen as loyal to Hun Sen. The king has broad
powers to grant pardons, but has usually insisted on Hun Sen's
agreement in politically sensitive cases.
	   Left out of the coalition deal was Ranariddh's ally Sam Rainsy,
a former finance minister whose small political party placed a
distant third in the election.
	   Sam Rainsy, under investigation by a Phnom Penh court for his
role in the demonstrations, has remained abroad. His 15 seats in
the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working
government.

Owen, Gazza, Ince missing for friendly against Czechs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Michael Owen, Paul Gascoigne and Paul Ince were
among the big names missing Friday when England coach Glenn Hoddle
announced his squad for next week's friendly against the Czech
Republic.
	   Three under-21 stars _ Leicester striker Emile Heskey, Aston
Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie and Ipswich goalkeeper Richard Wright
_ earned their first international call-ups for Wednesday's game at
Wembley.
	   With 18-year-old star striker Owen sidelined with a hamstring
injury sustained in Liverpool's 3-1 defeat to Tottenham on Tuesday,
Reds teammate Robbie Fowler was recalled by Hoddle.
	   Gascoigne, who was axed from England's World Cup squad last
summer, has been receiving treatment for stress and alcohol
problems.
	   Gazza has been in sparkling form in recent games for
Middlesbrough, prompting speculation he might be recalled by
Hoddle. But 'Boro manager Bryan Robson urged Hoddle not to rush
Gazza back into international duty.
	   Ince, the Liverpool midfielder and captain, was available for
selection for friendly matches, despite the fact he is banned from
England's next two European Championship qualifiers following his
sending-off in the 2-1 defeat in Sweden in September.
	   But Hoddle apparently believes Ince needs a rest.
	   West Ham striker Ian Wright made the squad, as did Aston Villa
forward Paul Merson, who has hinted he may retire from
international soccer in the near future.
	   Tim Flowers, Phil Neville and Ray Parlour were dropped from the
squad. Also out with injuries are defender Tony Adams and forward
Teddy Sheringham.
	   The squad:
	   David Seaman (Arsenal), Richard Wright (Ipswich), Nigel Martyn
(Leeds), Martin Keown (Arsenal), Andy Hinchcliffe (Sheffield
Wednesday), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea), Nicky Butt (Manchester
United), Lee Hendrie (Aston Villa), David Batty (Newcastle), Alan
Shearer (Newcastle), Ian Wright (West Ham), Robbie Fowler
(Liverpool), Gary Neville (Manchester United), Rio Ferdinand (West
Ham), Darren Anderton (Tottenham), David Beckham (Manchester
United), Paul Merson (Aston Villa), Jamie Redknapp (Liverpool),
Paul Scholes (Manchester United), Dion Dublin (Aston Villa), Emile
Heskey (Leicester).

Spain warns against travel to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry on Friday warned
Spaniards against nonessential travel to Iraq due to the latest
crisis over weapons inspections, the state-owned news agency EFE
reported.
	   Those who could not avoid the journey were advised to consult
with the Spanish Embassy in Baghdad, the agency said.
	   The warning followed a statement issued late Thursday calling
for a peaceful solution to the present crisis, but adding that the
Iraqi government would be responsible if force was required to
ensure compliance with United Nations directives, EFE reported.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military strikes
in retaliation for Iraq's decision to halt work by the U.N. Special
Commission overseeing the dismantling of Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons program and long-range missiles.

Moldova is hit by electricity crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KISHINEV, Moldova (AP) _ Moldova's economic crisis has forced
the government to severely cut budget expenses and to declare an
energy emergency, president Petru Lucinschi said Friday.
	   Up to 40 percent of the country's electricity is stolen and not
paid for, the president said at a news conference.
	   Industrial and domestic consumers owe some 1.8 billion lei (dlrs
300 million) to the state-run Moldenergo company. The company owes
even more to the state budget. In the capital, Kishinev,
electricity is being cut off for several hours a day, as it was in
the communist era.
	   ``We shall cut expenses drastically. The next year's budget is
one of poverty,'' said Lucinschi.
	   Moldova is due to pay dlrs 215 million to international debtors
by the end of this year, and 235 million in 1999. Its total debt is
dlrs 1.2 billion.
	   The Moldovan central bank has a reserve of dlrs 180 million. The
state intends to negotiate with debtors to postpone payment.
	   In the past few months, Moldova has lost half its dollar
reserves trying to stave off the effects of the economic crisis in
Russia.

Shell gives up potential investment in Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ The international oil company Shell
announced Friday it was pulling out of Slovenia, where it had
planned to invest dlrs 50 million.
	   The company said the move was prompted by Slovenia's national
laws, which favor local oil companies, Shell's office in Ljubljana
said in a statement.
	   Shell entered Slovenia shortly after its independence in 1991,
with hopes of opening a chain of gas stations throughout the
country. In 1996, a state-run company in charge of roads refused
Shell's bid to open a stations along a Slovene highway, saying only
oil companies already established on other highways could compete.
	   After appealing the decision to the constitutional court, only
to be turned down, Shell decided Thursday to sell the land it had
already purchased in Slovenia and pull out.
	   Some analysts in the former Yugoslav republic cited the incident
as an example of Slovenia's unwillingness to become more open to
foreign investments.
	   The country of two million, which proclaimed independence in
1991, is one of 10 East European countries being considered for
admission to the European Union in its first step of enlargement.
	   But last week, the EU leaders criticized Slovenia for being too
slow in adjusting their laws to European standards. The Slovene
government said the criticism was ``appropriate.''
	   While their government is eager to join the West, many Slovenes
fear that the young country could lose much of its national
identity once it is integrated into larger institutions.

Prosecutor seek harsher punishment for artifact vandals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Scribbling on Greece's cultural treasures
is just as bad as stealing them, says a prosecutor seeking stiffer
penalties for anyone who defaces monuments, busts or statues.
	   Panagiotis Dimopoulos, a prosecutor at the Athens Supreme Court
of Appeals, is seeking to double the maximum penalty for marking or
vandalizing a cultural object to 10 years _ the same as stealing
ancient artifacts.
	   The prosecutor, who made his recommendation to Justice Minister
Evangelos Giannopoulos on Thursday, said he considers defacing to
be even more serious.
	   If something is stolen there is a chance it could be recovered,
but defacing can be permanent, he said.

Dutch government bans sale of violent computer game to youths
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ The Dutch government said Friday
it will prosecute retailers who sell the violent computer game
Carmageddon II to children under age 16.
	   Justice Minister Benk Korthals said Dutch law did not empower
him to totally ban the controversial game, which simulates a car
rampaging through city streets. Points are awarded for running over
pedestrians _ including children and the elderly _ and mowing down
animals.
	   Christian Democrat lawmakers in parliament had asked Korthals to
investigate if he could ban the game, which went on sale Friday for
the first time in the Netherlands.
	   The game's packaging already clearly advises retailers that the
game should not be sold to under-16s, the Justice Ministry said.
The government's prosecution threat is intended to reinforce that
message.
	   Carmageddon II retails for 99.95 guilders (dlrs 53) in Dutch
stores.

	   Press Writer &QC; 
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Thousands of Iraqis worried about U.S.
airstrikes lined up outside gasoline stations Friday, while the
official media ignored the evident loss of Arab support in Iraq's
confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   Official newspapers published articles hailing President Saddam
Hussein's decision to end all cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission and claiming there was worldwide condemnation of
American threats.
	   The United States has beefed up its military strength in the
Gulf and is threatening airstrikes to force Iraq to allow
inspections by U.N. inspectors, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The world calls for dialogue and peace, and America seeks war
and aggression,'' the official al-Iraq newspaper said.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' al-Thawra, the mouthpiece of the ruling
Baath party newspaper, said in a banner headline.
	   The newspapers made no mention of Thursday's warning to Iraq by
several Arab countries. The countries urged ``wisdom and reason''
to end the confrontation but said Saddam's government alone would
be ``responsible for any consequences'' from stopping the work of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The criticism by the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation
Council, Iraq's vulnerable neighbors, along with Syria and Egypt,
was unusually strong for Arab countries, which repeatedly have
called for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   At a news conference Thursday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
said if the Arab countries were sincere about resolving the crisis,
``they should blame the main block ... the United States.''
	   On Friday, Iraqi newspapers claimed Iraq was capable of
defeating the United States.
	   America knows that ``any limited aggression will not achieve its
goals,'' al-Thawra said. ``A large-scale and sustained aggression
will shake the whole region and lead to explosions of unspecified
consequences.''
	   The feeling of an imminent strike was evident from the rush to
fill up with gasoline. At one station, about 20 cars were lined up
in front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Iraqi government escorts accompanying journalists touring the
city said the media were forbidden to take pictures or talk to the
people.
	   A customer contacted later said he waited a half-hour to fill up
his car. ``I fear the Americans will hit refineries, and there will
be a shortage of fuel,'' said the driver, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   Markets in Baghdad were crammed with the usual weekend shoppers.
	   At the Al-Shorja market, 40-year-old Naima Aidan said she was
buying coconut and sugar to make sweets for her four children. ``I
am not worried. I don't think anything will happen to us because
God will keep us safe,'' she said.
	   At a prayer sermon Friday in Baghdad, a preacher urged Arabs and
Muslims to ``declare war on America'' and rally behind Iraq.
	   ``I call upon you ... do not let their airplanes use your
airspace or bases. Do not give them any facilities,'' the preacher,
Abdullatif Humeim, said in the sermon. Sermons usually are screened
by the government.
	   Since Wednesday, the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all
its weapons inspectors and a third of its 450 humanitarian workers.
UNSCOM chief Richard Butler called it ``a very serious
confrontation.''
	   ``There's a growing sense that airstrikes or enforcement is
becoming more and more likely,'' he said Thursday night on U.S.
television.
	   Iraq says it will cooperate with arms inspectors if the U.N.
Security Council guarantees that it will work to lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its
economy, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq
has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required under the
cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Aziz has said that U.N. chief Kofi Annan was ``the best person''
to try to ease the current crisis. But Annan says he has no plans
to visit Baghdad as he did in February to resolve the last crisis.
	   In addition to the United States, Britain also has threatened
military action, and Prime Minister Tony Blair said Friday neither
country could back down in the confrontation with Saddam.
	   ``If we do not act in those circumstances and he is allowed to
break the agreement without any comeback at all from the
international community, the consequences would be disastrous for
us,'' Blair said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.
Radio Scotland.
	   Canada pledged support Friday for U.S. military action but said
it did not plan to participate in such an operation. Russia and
China continued to oppose the use of force, while urging Iraq to
comply with U.N. inspectors.

Yeltsin wraps up vacation, returns to work at his country
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin has ended his vacation and
is in ``normal'' health back at work at his country residence just
outside Moscow, his spokesman said Friday.
	   Spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin refused to say why Yeltsin abruptly
canceled a dinner with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on
Thursday.
	   ``The president and Obuchi agreed on that during their morning
meeting,'' Yakushkin said at a news conference.
	   He said the two leaders met one-on-one and he was unaware of the
conversation. ``Let people keep their secrets,'' he said.
	   The summit with Obuchi was Yeltsin's first high-level meeting
since a respiratory virus infection sidelined him a month ago. He
was shown on Russian television greeting the Japanese leader with a
smile and handshake, appearing somewhat steadier than he has in
public recently.
	   Yeltsin had just spent a week on vacation at the Black Sea
resort of Sochi to recover from what aides described as fatigue and
high blood pressure. The ailments, coming on top of the infection,
have led to renewed speculations about his ability to govern.
	   When he returned from Sochi on Sunday, the Kremlin would not say
whether he would return to the vacation after meeting Obuchi. But
Yakushkin said Friday the vacation was over.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would meet with German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder in the Kremlin next Tuesday and host a breakfast after
their meeting.
	   On Friday, Yeltsin was working with documents at his Gorki-9
residence just west of Moscow, Yakushkin said. ``Gorki-9 is the
working residence,'' he said. ``Whether in the Kremlin, or in
Gorki, he is working.''
	   ``The president's condition is normal,'' Yakushkin said without
elaboration.
	   Yeltsin has shrugged off control over the economy, leaving Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov to deal with the crisis. Yakushkin said
the president frequently talks with the premier and they have warm
personal relations, but refused to assess the government's
performance in combating the crisis.
	   Yakushkin wouldn't give a specific date for Yeltsin's meeting
with Chinese President Jiang Zemin who is scheduled to arrive in
Russia on Nov. 22 for a four-day visit.
	   The 67-year-old Russian leader has suffered from various health
troubles in the past, including a quintuple heart bypass surgery
two years ago. But he insists he has no crippling illness and
intends to serve out his term, which runs until mid-2000.
	   Yeltsin has canceled several foreign trips this fall because of
health problems, and Russian media have quoted unidentified Kremlin
aides as saying that the president's ailments rule out any more
visits abroad during the remainder of his term.
	   Asked whether Yeltsin would visit India in December as earlier
scheduled, Yakushkin said the president's schedule for next month
hasn't been finalized yet.

German finance chief keeps up pressure on Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's left-leaning finance minister
kept up the pressure on central bankers Friday to lower interest
rates to spur the economy, rejecting critics' charges of political
meddling.
	   Oskar Lafontaine, speaking during a tax debate in parliament,
said that keeping inflation down should remain ``a priority goal''
as Germany and 10 other European countries move toward adopting a
single currency, the euro, on Jan. 1.
	   But he demanded that the Bundesbank, Germany's staunchly
independent national bank, and the European Central Bank taking
over next year ``also support growth and jobs to the degree that
price stability is secure.''
	   With the German economy slowing down, the new Social
Democrat-led government is looking hard for ways to bring down
unemployment, which is stuck above 10 percent.
	   Lafontaine has led the way with calls for lower interest rates,
pumping up the German economy by boosting consumers' spending
power, and global cooperation to control exchange rate swings.
	   The Bundesbank snubbed Lafontaine last week by refusing to lower
rates.
	   Lafontaine's plans for a 15 billion mark (dlrs 8.9 billion) tax
cut, debated by lawmakers for the first time Friday, have come
under fire from business leaders and many economists, who have also
decried his attempts to strong-arm the Bundesbank.
	   Critics, including the conservative opposition, say the tax plan
doesn't offer relief for business needed to create jobs and focuses
too much on putting more money in average earners' pockets.
	   Lafontaine defended the plan Friday, accusing former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's government of a skewed pro-business approach that
encouraged companies to replace workers with machines.
	   German taxes were not too high, just wrongly distributed, he
said.
	   ``Also wrong is the notion that foreign companies will be
especially put off by this reform,'' he said. Businesses, he said,
should ``garner decent returns for shareholders as well as
providing enough and well-paid work.''

Negotiating team readies for talks with hostage-takers

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ A negotiating team composed of oil company
officials and military officers will be sent to talk with the
Nigerian youths who have taken eight oil workers, including seven
foreigners, hostage, officials said Friday.
	   Yusuf N'jie, an assistant managing director for Texaco Inc.,
said the company had prepared a helicopter to chopper the team to
the area in the Niger River delta where the hostages are being
held, some 250 kilometers (150 miles) southeast of Lagos. He said
he hoped the team would begin their talks later Friday.
	   The move comes two days after a boatload of armed Nigerian
youths stormed an offshore oil rig used by Texaco and left with
eight hostages; three Americans, a Briton, a South African, an
Italian, a Croatian and a Nigerian.
	   Similar incidents in the past have been resolved peacefully.
	   No one was believed to have been injured in the Wednesday
incident and no damage was done to the rig, Texaco officials say.
U.S. Embassy officials in Lagos declined to comment.
	   A Texaco statement did not say whether the youths were demanding
a ransom for the release of the hostages. However, a Texaco
official in Nigeria, speaking on condition of anonymity, earlier
said ransom demands had been issued. The official said the youths
were also demanding improved infrastructure facilities for their
communities in the poverty-stricken Niger River delta region.
	   N'jie said the families and the embassies of the oil workers had
been notified.
	   Oil companies are frequent targets of protests and occasionally
hostage-takings as local communities vent their anger over what
they see as government and oil company neglect for their plight.
	   Although Nigeria is the world's sixth-largest oil producer, the
people of the oil-rich delta often live in desperate poverty,
struggling by without paved roads, electricity or running water.
	   In the past few years, however, oil companies have begun
large-scale aid programs in the delta, supplying millions of
dollars for such things as schools and clinics.
	   But with the government unresponsive to their needs, the people
of the delta still regularly target the oil companies.
	   The hostage-takers in the latest incident even made use of some
Texaco aid, N'jie said.
	   ``The irony is that the boat in which the youths came and in
which they took away the hostages was donated by us to the
community,'' he said. ``They were wearing life jackets which we
also donated to the community.
	   Texaco says the workers taken hostage were contract employees
working for other oil service companies hired to conduct
exploratory drilling in the region.

Jackson urges government, rebels in Sierra Leone to talk peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ U.S. Special Envoy to Africa Jesse
Jackson on Friday urged Sierra Leone's government and warring
rebels to set aside their weapons and seek a peaceful end to their
brutal conflict.
	   The rebels, Jackson told reporters, ``must make a decision to
disarm, stop the killing and maiming of people and come to the
bargaining table to talk it out and not fight it out.''
	   Rebel fighters from Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front
along with their allies from the country's former military regime
have been waging a brutal war in the countryside for months.
	   Thousands of civilians have been raped, disfigured by torture
and killed by the rebels, aid workers and independent observers
say.
	   Despite the rebels' horrific record, Jackson called on the
government to make concessions to bring the insurgents to peace
talks.
	   ``The government must reach out to these RUF in the bush
battlefield, they are also Sierra Leoneans so they are a necessary
component to the peace process,'' Jackson said during a joint press
conference with Sierra Leone's President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
	   Kabbah was deposed during a military coup in May 1997, but was
returned to power earlier this year after a West African coalition
ousted the military junta.
	   Kabbah and the intervention force, known as ECOMOG, have been
struggling to curb rebel attacks in the countryside, where peace
remains elusive.
	   Jackson says the U.S. government supports Kabbah's government,
but also wants to see a peaceful end to Sierra Leone's conflict.
	   ``Give some pride and dignity and reach out to all Sierra
Leoneans, including those in the bush,'' Jackson urged Kabbah's
government.
	   Sierra Leone was the third leg of Jackson's African tour, where
he has also visited with senior Nigerian officials in that country
and attended a sub-regional mini-summit in Guinea.
	   Leaders from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea met with Jackson
on Thursday in Guinea's capital of Conakry to discuss closer ties
and efforts to rejuvenate a cooperative three-nation union.
	   Jackson took part in the meeting to underscore Washington's
interest in stability and peace in a part of West Africa wracked
for years by conflict.
	   In addition to Jackson and Kabbah, Guinea's President Lansana
Conte and Liberian President Charles Taylor also took part in the
meeting.
	   Jackson left Sierra Leone later Friday and was headed for Ghana
to meet with that country's president, Jerry Rawlings.

Indonesian assembly endorses political blueprint as protests rage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with decrees passed &QL; 
 &UR; By ALI KOTARUMALOS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Pressed by bloody protests raging
outside, Indonesia's highest legislative body on Friday endorsed a
blueprint for a new government after a push to ban the military
from politics was defeated.
	   The 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly also named
former President Suharto, driven from power in May, in a decree
demanding the government investigate corruption under his 32-year
rule.
	   The grouping, protected by thousands of troops and police, ended
four days of debate among five factions when it passed 11 of 12
reform decrees unanimously. A 12th decree was also passed on a rare
formal vote.
	   The group backed a plan by President B.J. Habibie to hold
parliamentary elections in either May or June and to open the
ballot to a wide range of new political parties. But it did not set
a date for the poll.
	   Assembly members, many of them holdovers from the authoritarian
Suharto era, hailed the decrees as major reforms, pointing to their
demands for greater human rights and economic restructuring.
	   But students and other critics said they did not represent major
democratic change and only entrenched the power of the status quo,
including Habibie, the military and the ruling Golkar Party.
	   As riot police fired tear gas and plastic bullets at protesters
in downtown Jakarta, Parliament's Speaker, Harmoko, a former
Suharto Cabinet minister who chaired the assembly's meeting,
congratulated its members for carrying out their ``constitutional
duty.''
	   The assembly's aim for total consensus stumbled when the
Islamic-oriented United Development Party refused to put its name
to a decree calling only for the gradual reduction of a current
75-seat military representation in the 500-seat Parliament. Most
members had agreed to this being cut to 55 seats.
	   United Development Party members staged an unprecedented protest
walkout when the issue was debated. They backed student demands for
the immediate end to the military's political role altogether.
	   Under Suharto, the assembly was infamous for being a rubber
stamp grouping.
	   It was the first time in about three decades that the assembly
was forced to stage a formal vote and failed to reach total
agreement on any issue. Still, the decree was passed 784 to 123.
	   After a protracted debate the assembly named Suharto in a decree
demanding the government crack down on corruption, collusion and
nepotism.
	   However, this fell short of demands by thousands of protesting
students who want the former autocrat put on trial for enriching
himself and his family during his 32-year rule.
	   Suharto, 77, was forced to quit last May after riots and
protests. Since then he had protested his innocence.
	   A government anti-corruption investigation, rejected by critics
as a whitewash, has yet to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing by
him.
	   The decree calls on Habibie's government to eradicate and
investigate corruption by ``former state officials, their families
or cronies and private businesses as well as conglomerates _
including former President Suharto.''
	   It added that such investigation should take into account the
presumption of innocence and human rights.

Fearing attack, some Iraqis line up at gas stations, prices up

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations
and shoppers found some prices up in Baghdad's crowded markets
Friday amid widening fears that a U.S. military strike is imminent.
	   Still, the mood seemed defiant, reflecting the Iraqi
government's efforts to forge a united front against U.N. sanctions
imposed eight years ago after it invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her
four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   Preachers at Friday prayers in the nation's mosques called on
Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss of
support in its confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   ``Do not be claws in the hands of Jews and Americans,'' he
added.
	   The United States and Britain have beefed up their military
strength in the Gulf and are threatening to attack Iraq to force it
to allow inspections by the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed those
weapons before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sanctions,
which have devastated the Iraqi economy by limiting the sale of oil
and other trade dealings.
	   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of six Gulf governments,
Iraq's most vulnerable neighbors, along with Egypt and Syria called
for a diplomatic settlement. But they also warned in an unusually
strong statement that ``the Iraqi government is held responsible
for any consequences'' if it doesn't back down from its Aug. 5
decision.
	   Iraqi newspapers, however, ignored the statement, presenting a
far different picture to their readers.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' read the banner headline of Al-Thawra, the
paper published by President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party.
	   Despite such rhetoric, there were scattered signs Friday that
the Iraqi people were beginning to take the threat of attack
seriously.
	   Long queues formed at gasoline stations as Iraqis filled their
tanks _ and jerrycans _ with fuel. At one station in the capital,
about 20 cars were lined up in front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Taxi drivers said they didn't want to be caught short if the
government imposes rationing, as it did during the last standoff
over weapons inspections in January and February. There also were
fears that the Americans might bomb refineries, reducing the
supply.
	   Western television crews and photographers were barred by
government ``minders'' from the gas stations, and reporters were
told they could not interview people in the queues.
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   At Baghdad's downtown Shorja market, merchants said some prices
had increased _ a barometer of anxiety here _ but that they mainly
for perishable goods such as eggs and fresh milk.
	   Merchants and shoppers said an attack was not their first
concern.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, as he
sold vegetables at Shorja. ``But it's not about any kind of
aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money to buy
food.''
	   Haidar Saad, 18, a soldier shopping for his family, said he
didn't expect any panic buying.
	   ``The markets have stayed open during past crises,'' he said.
``Anyway, most people live on their (government) rations and don't
have the money to stockpile food.''
	   The rations are distributed under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy
food, medicine and other necessities for its 22 million people.
	   U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said Friday that oil was being exported

Record routs predicted in British internationals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Record routs are forecast as British Isles rugby
union teams meet extremes in international opposition on Saturday.
	   England is expected to run up a huge score (possibly 100 or more
points) against a team of amateurs from the Netherlands in a World
Cup qualifer at Huddersfield, while Wales is expected to suffer
another big loss to South Africa at Wembley.
	   In other international matches Saturday, Ireland plays Georgia
at Dublin in what looms as another lop-sided World Cup qualifier,
while Scotland starts as underdog against the powerful New Zealand
Maoris at Murrayfield.
	   France, defending Five Nations champions, will play a test
against Argentina in Paris.
	   The major interest Saturday will focus on Wembley, where former
Auckland Blues coach Graham Henry faces his first examination as
Welsh coach in a test against the reigning world champions.
	   The New Zealander was appointed Welsh coach after Wales' record
96-13 loss to South Africa at Pretoria in June.
	   But he has the weight of history against him. Wales has not
beaten South Africa in 11 tests _ its best result was a draw in
1970.
	   And to add to his difficulties, the Springboks will be kicking
off a Grand Slam bid _ aiming for victories over England, Ireland,
Scotland and Wales _ and to secure a world record of 18 consecutive
test wins.
	   Springboks coach Nick Mallett, who has guided South Africa to 13
of its 14 successive wins since taking the helm, has the side
primed to win after a Tri-Nations series victory over New Zealand
and Australia.
	   Mallet has retained the nucleas of the side which thrashed
Wales, and also notched wins over England and Ireland over the
summer, for the Wembley match.
	   He was critical of the Welsh performance in Pretoria, rating the
side as the weakest international team he'd ever seen on tour, but
said he was expecting a tougher contest Saturday.
	   ``This is a completely different Welsh team in a different
situation,'' he said. ``Graham Henry has had tremendous success at
Auckland and I'm sure that in the short time he's been with Wales,
he has made an impact.''
	   Henry, who coached Auckland to back-to-back Super 12 titles and
had been widely tipped as John Hart's successor as All Blacks
coach, has retained only three players involved in the ill-fated
Pretoria test.
	   He has selected former All Black Shane Howarth at fullback, the
only new cap in the team, but has restructured the side.
	   British Lions backrower Scott Quinnell will be joined by his
brother Craig in the forward pack for the first time.
	   Henry conceded his first task as national coach could not have
been harder.
	   ``They're strong favorites, which is fair enough when you
consider Wales has never beaten them,'' he said. ``I'm positive
about the game. I'm always optimistic, otherwise I wouldn't be
here.''
	   How many points can England notch against the Netherlands?
	   Some British pundits are predicting a 100-point mauling, while
the British media has seized on the potential health hazards to the
Dutch and is billing the game as a mis-match of epic proportions.
	   The Daily Mail quoted leading spinal experts saying the Dutch
amateurs could be severely and permanently hurt against England's
bigger and more seasoned pros.
	   Former All Black Geoff Old is in charge of a Dutch team
comprised mainly of students, plus a carpenter, a radiographer, and
two New Zealand-based professionals.
	   He said he was under no misconceptions about the game.
	   ``My players are being sent in at the deep end and will sink or
swim,'' he said. ``I hope they end up being able to doggy-paddle.''
	   The new-look England team will be too strong for the
Netherlands, which scored a 9-0 win over Morocco in Amsterdam last
week.
	   English players are aiming to break the England record total of
60 points, set against Japan, Canada and Wales respectively.
	   Martin Johnson, who assumed the England captaincy when Lawrence
Dallaglio was ruled out with injury, said he wouldn't take it easy
against the Dutch.
	   ``The first thing you do, in any international match, is
establish dominance in every area you can,'' he said.
	   At Murrayfield, Scotland faces a New Zealand Maori side which
beat England 62-14 in June and is rated by many as equal to the All
Blacks.
	   Scottish coach Jim Telfer conceded favoritism to the highly
rated Maori team after its 69-3 defeat of Edinburgh Reivers on
Wednesday.
	   ``One of the reasons why New Zealand is such a force in world
rugby is because of the Maori nation,'' he said.
	   Maoris coach Matt Te Pou made four changes to the side which
beat Edinburgh, including relegating All Black winger Glen Osborne
to the reserves to make way for fellow All Black Caleb Ralph.
	   In Dublin, Ireland hosts rugby minnow Georgia in a World Cup
qualifier.
	   Irish coach Warren Gatland said the two sides had never played
and that Georgia was an unknown quantity.
	   ``I know very little about Georgia, apart from the fact that
they have a big physical pack of forwards, that they've played a
couple of games and got mixed results,'' he said.
	   French selectors have been forced to make several changes due to
injury, while Argentina has dropped six players from the side which
lost 23-19 to Italy last week.
	   Argentina coach Jose-Luis Imhoff made wholesale changes to the
Pumas' pack, bringing in number eight Pablo Camerlinck, and
flankers Miguel Ruiz and Pablo Durand.
	   France is favorite to win the Stade de France clash. Next
Saturday, the French meet Australia in Paris.

Rosset beats Kroslak to reach Kremlin Cup semifinal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ It took the hard-hitting Marc Rosset of
Switzerland only 49 minutes to down qualifier Jan Kroslak 6-2, 6-4
to reach the semifinals of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup on
Friday.
	   Sixth-seeded Rosset, two-time Kremlin Cup champion, blitzed
Kroslak off the court with 14 aces in all. He fired four aces to
close out the first set 6-2, and hit two more on his first serve in
the secont set.
	   ``Today I served very good and I felt I could make almost every
single serve _ almost as if I could close my eyes,'' Rosset said.
	   Kroslak held his own until he was broken in the fifth, losing at
deuce after Rosset sent two crushing backhands down the line. The
Slovak lost serve in the seventh set as well, going down on
unforced errors.
	   The second set saw ten quick games, none of which went to deuce.
Kroslak kept up the unforced errors, and the single break in the
fifth game was all Rosset needed to take the match.
	   In a later match, Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, seeded second,
will play Guillaume Raoux of France.

Spain warns against travel to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Foreign Ministry on Friday warned
Spaniards against nonessential travel to Iraq due to the latest
crisis over weapons inspections, the state-owned news agency EFE
reported.
	   Those who could not avoid the journey were advised to consult
with the Spanish Embassy in Baghdad, the agency said.
	   The warning followed a statement issued late Thursday calling
for a peaceful solution to the present crisis, but adding that the
Iraqi government would be responsible if force was required to
ensure compliance with United Nations directives, EFE reported.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military strikes
in retaliation for Iraq's decision to halt work by the U.N. Special
Commission overseeing the dismantling of Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons program and long-range missiles.

Hindu holy men accused of killing four low-caste Hindus in fight
</HEADLINE>
over land &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Five Hindu holy men were under arrest
Friday, accused of shooting and killing four low-caste Hindus,
including an eight-year-old girl, during an argument over land.
	   Uttar Pradesh state officials said the shooting erupted late
Thursday in Faizabad, 550 kilometers (341 miles) southeast of New
Delhi, following a long-running dispute over a patch of land
considered a holy bathing spot along the Sarya River.
	   The holy men living in a nearby ashram, or religious retreat,
resented the presence at the site of a settlement of Nishas, a
low-caste group that traditionally makes it living by fishing. Holy
men, or sadhus, are Brahmin, the highest Hindu caste.
	   Thursday, witnesses told police, Ramagya Nishad began
constructing a fence around his hut, enraging the five holy men who
apparently saw the move as a declaration of ownership. The five,
armed with shot guns and homemade pistols, emerged from their
ashram and began shouting at Ramagya Nishad, breaking their
religious vow of silence.
	   A crowd gathered and the argument intensified. Then the holy men
fired and retreated into their ashram.
	   Police arrived and engaged in a 30-minute gun battle with the
holy men during which no one was hurt. The five were arrested when
they tried to flee the ashram and were jailed in Faizabad.
	   Bhawani Bheek Pathak, the investigating police officer, said the
holy men refused to speak after their arrest.
	   ``Their vow of silence will not save them,'' he told The
Associated Press by telephone. ``There are enough eyewitnesses and
material evidence to nail the accused.''
	   Hindus _ 84 percent of Indians _ believe one's caste is
determined by how well one lived in previous lives, and there is no
hope of achieving better status in this one. The Indian
constitution bans discrimination based on caste, but modern laws
have not erased centuries of tradition. In rural India
particularly, high caste Hindus shun those from low castes, saying
their very presence is defiling.

Foreign minister says Israel knows how to defend itself
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Friday that
Israel ``will know how to defend its people'' against a possible
Iraqi attack but that the Jewish state does not consider itself a
player in the confrontation between Iraq and the United States.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he hoped for a
``peaceful solution through the terms of Kofi Annan,'' the U.N.
secretary general who cut short a trip to Africa to deal with the
crisis. Arafat has said that a U.S. strike against Iraq could
hinder the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, gas mask distribution centers shut down
for the Jewish Sabbath. The centers had opened Thursday to provide
gas masks to about 25 percent of Israelis who don't have the
protective gear.
	   Israeli began distributing gas masks to its citizens in the
months leading to the 1991 Gulf War when Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein threatened to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
	   During the war, Saddam fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional
warheads at Israel in an attempt to draw Israel into the fighting
and break up the Arab coalition against him.
	   Meeting a request by the United States, Israel did not retaliate
at the time.
	   Asked Friday whether Israel would strike back this time, if
attacked by Iraq, Sharon said: ``I think it's well-known in the
Middle East, that Israel will know how to defend its people,''
Sharon said.
	   He downplayed the threat to Israel.
	   ``I think we have have to continue to lead our normal lives. I
would like to encourage tourists to come. As you will see, it is
beautiful here, wonderful weather. Life is normal,'' Sharon said.
	   However, some did not take Sharon's word.
	   The European Under-18 Championships qualifying soccer tournament
scheduled to take place in Israel next week was canceled because of
security concerns. England, Israel, Andorra and Spain were to
compete in the tournament.
	   UEFA canceled the events Thursday after the English team said it
would not attend because of the tense situation in the Gulf,
Jerusalem Post said.

Stung by sour reception of economic package, Japan mulls sweetening

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Stung by criticism that a new 18 trillion yen (dlrs
149 billion) economic stimulus plan is too weak, Japanese leaders
on Friday hinted they'll come up with what critics were clamoring
for: more money.
	   ``I hope there will be a surprise,'' Economic Planning Agency
Director General Taichi Sakaiya told reporters _ without
elaborating _ when asked what form the package will take when the
details are announced on Monday.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party released the bare bones of
the stimulus package _ already a record amount _ on Thursday as its
much-heralded plan for Japan to spend its way out of its deepest
recession in decades.
	   But the deal was received tepidly by experts who said it was too
weak to resuscitate the economy, fueling hopes that the government
would come up with more yen in the final version next week.
	   Japan's leading financial newspaper, Nihon Keizai, reported the
official package, which is expected to pass later this month in a
special session of Parliament, will exceed 20 trillion yen (dlrs
165 billion).
	   And the Asahi national newspaper said the plan would total 22
trillion yen (dlrs 181 billion) _ an amount roughly equal to the
size of the entire economy of Austria.
	   Those reports helped trigger a 1.37 percent gain in Tokyo's
benchmark stock index, after Thursday's 2.45 percent tumble on
disappointment with the ruling party package.
	   Many investors were also hoping the government package would
include a suspension of an unpopular national sales tax implemented
in 1993. The government's decision to raise the consumption tax
from 3 percent to 5 percent in 1997 was largely blamed for having a
devastating effect on consumer confidence and precipitating Japan's
recession.
	   ``A cut in the sales tax, even if only temporary, will have a
big impact on spending,'' said Setsuo Nagao, a manager in the
equity division at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   The Economic Planning Agency said the final draft of the plan
would be compiled late Sunday and then released by Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi's government the next day shortly after 9:00 a.m.
	   Officials were being coy Friday about the final numbers.
	   Questioned by reporters about the size of the package, Finance
Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said only that ``It will be rather big.''
	   Obuchi, facing growing pressure both at home and abroad, sees
the package as his best change to stop the economy from contracting
for a third consecutive year _ a key pledge made after taking
office in July.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton will likely urge Obuchi to kick
start the Japanese economy at a summit meeting this weekend in
Malaysia of leaders from members of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.

	   Three under-21 stars _ Leicester striker Emile Heskey, Aston
Villa midfielder Lee Hendrie and Ipswich goalkeeper Richard Wright
_ earned their first international call-ups for Wednesday's game at
Wembley.
	   With 18-year-old star striker Owen sidelined with a hamstring
injury sustained in Liverpool's 3-1 defeat to Tottenham on Tuesday,
Reds teammate Robbie Fowler was recalled by Hoddle.
	   Gascoigne, who was axed from England's World Cup squad last
summer, has been receiving treatment for stress and alcohol
problems.
	   Gazza has been in sparkling form in recent games for
Middlesbrough, prompting speculation he might be recalled by
Hoddle. But 'Boro manager Bryan Robson urged Hoddle not to rush
Gazza back into international duty.
	   Hoddle said he had been impressed with Gascoigne's performances
for Middlesbrough but felt it was too early to bring the troubled
star back into the England squad.
	   ``He's still short of fitness and next week has come just a bit
quick for him,'' Hoddle said. ``In February (against France) he
will be in much better shape to be brought back in if he has done
it on the pitch.''
	   Ince, the Liverpool midfielder and captain, was available for
selection for friendly matches, despite the fact he is banned from
England's next two European Championship qualifiers following his
sending-off in the 2-1 defeat in Sweden in September.
	   But Hoddle said Ince needs a rest.
	   ``Paul has had a hard World Cup and probably played every game
for Liverpool and it's a good time for him to have a rest,'' Hoddle
said. ``He is not available for the next Euro 2000 qualifier
against Poland but that doesn't mean he might not be brought in for
the friendly against France.''
	   West Ham striker Ian Wright made the squad, as did Aston Villa
forward Paul Merson, who has hinted he may retire from
international soccer in the near future.
	   Tim Flowers, Phil Neville and Ray Parlour were dropped from the
squad. Also out with injuries are defender Tony Adams and forward
Teddy Sheringham.
	   The squad:
	   David Seaman (Arsenal), Richard Wright (Ipswich), Nigel Martyn
(Leeds), Martin Keown (Arsenal), Andy Hinchcliffe (Sheffield
Wednesday), Graeme Le Saux (Chelsea), Nicky Butt (Manchester
United), Lee Hendrie (Aston Villa), David Batty (Newcastle), Alan
Shearer (Newcastle), Ian Wright (West Ham), Robbie Fowler
(Liverpool), Gary Neville (Manchester United), Rio Ferdinand (West
Ham), Darren Anderton (Tottenham), David Beckham (Manchester
United), Paul Merson (Aston Villa), Jamie Redknapp (Liverpool),
Paul Scholes (Manchester United), Dion Dublin (Aston Villa), Emile
Heskey (Leicester).

Turkey denies death of German terrorist suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Turkey has denied reports that Turkish
troops killed a captured German terrorist suspect who had been
fighting alongside Kurdish guerrillas, the German foreign ministry
said Friday.
	   Dismissing the reports as Kurdish propaganda, the Turkish
government told Germany its soldiers had not captured Andrea Wolf,
33, and that it did not know her whereabouts, ministry spokesman
Martin Erdmann said.
	   The Kurdish Information Center in Cologne said Tuesday that
Turkish troops killed Wolf on Oct. 22 after she was caught with a
group of 39 Kurdish rebels.
	   Two German magazines, Der Spiegel and Focus, carried similar
reports earlier.
	   German police have sought Wolf as a suspect in the 1993 bombing
of a prison by the left-wing Red Army Faction.
	   Erdmann said the foreign ministry would continue its probe into
reports of her death, but said its means were extremely limited. If
Turkey's version of events were to be disproved, that could have
``serious consequences,'' Erdmann said. He refused to elaborate.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Pope John Paul II on Friday met with
Argentine President Carlos Menem, who earlier this month was
honored by the Vatican for work in favor of families and peace.
	   The Vatican announcement of the private meeting gave no details
except to say that the pontiff also welcomed Menem's entourage,
which included daughter Zulema Maria Eva.
	   Menem was scheduled to attend a prayer service led by the pope
early Friday evening in the Argentine national church in Rome. The
service was to be televised live to Argentina.

 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with immigrants leaving church &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ The 100 or so immigrants who occupied a
basilica in Bologna agreed Friday to move to an abandoned school
building while city authorities search for alternative housing.
	   The immigrants, mostly North Africans legally in Italy, moved
into Basilica of San Petronio Thursday after they were evicted from
an empty building belonging to the public housing authority. They
demanded housing from the city and threatened to go on a hunger
strike if their demands were not met.
	   After meeting with police and city officials early Friday, the
immigrants agreed to move into a former school in downtown Bologna.
Local police officials quoted by the Italian news agency ANSA
called the solution ``temporary'' and pledged to find them suitable
housing.
	   The immigrants reportedly left the church without putting up
resistance and boarded buses which took them to the school.
	   Bologna's archbishop allowed the immigrants to spend the night
in the basilica, in one of the city's main squares.

Fearing attack, some Iraqis line up at gas stations, prices up

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations
and shoppers found higher prices in Baghdad's crowded markets
Friday amid widening fears that a U.S. military strike is imminent.
	   Still, the mood seemed defiant, reflecting the Iraqi
government's efforts to forge a united front against U.N. sanctions
imposed eight years ago after it invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her
four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   Preachers at Friday prayers in the nation's mosques called on
Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss of
support in its confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   ``Do not be claws in the hands of Jews and Americans,'' he
added.
	   The United States and Britain have beefed up their military
strength in the Gulf and are threatening to attack Iraq to force it
to allow inspections by the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed those
weapons before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sanctions,
which have devastated the Iraqi economy by limiting the sale of oil
and other trade.
	   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of six Gulf governments,
Iraq's most vulnerable neighbors, along with Egypt and Syria called
for a diplomatic settlement. But they also warned in an unusually
strong statement that ``the Iraqi government is held responsible
for any consequences'' if it doesn't back down from its Aug. 5
decision.
	   Iraqi newspapers, however, ignored the statement, presenting a
far different picture to their readers.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' read the banner headline of Al-Thawra, the
paper published by President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party.
	   Despite such rhetoric, there were scattered signs Friday that
the Iraqi people were beginning to take the threat of attack
seriously.
	   Long queues formed at gasoline stations as Iraqis filled their
tanks _ and jerrycans _ with fuel. At one station in the capital,
about 20 cars were lined up in front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Taxi drivers said they didn't want to be caught short if the
government imposes rationing, as it did during the last standoff
over weapons inspections in January and February. There also were
fears that the Americans might bomb refineries, reducing the
supply.
	   Western television crews and photographers were barred by
government ``minders'' from the gas stations, and reporters were
told they could not interview people in the queues.
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   At Baghdad's downtown Shorja market, merchants said some prices
had increased _ a barometer of anxiety here _ but that they mainly
for perishable goods such as eggs and fresh milk.
	   Merchants and shoppers said an attack was not their first
concern.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, as he
sold vegetables at Shorja. ``But it's not about any kind of
aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money to buy
food.''
	   Haidar Saad, 18, a soldier shopping for his family, said he
didn't expect any panic buying.
	   ``The markets have stayed open during past crises,'' he said.
``Anyway, most people live on their (government) rations and don't
have the money to stockpile food.''
	   The rations are distributed under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy
food, medicine and other necessities for its 22 million people.
	   U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said Friday that oil was being exported
normally and that ships carrying Vietnamese rice and Australian
wheat were being unloaded at the southern Iraqi port of Mina
al-Bakr.
	   Since Wednesday, the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all
its weapons inspectors and a third of the 450 people working on
U.N. relief programs because of the threatened military strikes.

Report: Former Azerbaijani president charged with insulting
</HEADLINE>
incumbent &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A former president of Azerbaijan faces criminal
charges of insulting the incumbent president, Geidar Aliev, news
agencies reported Friday.
	   The Azerbaijani Justice Ministry announced the charges, saying
Abulfaz Elchibey had broken the law by accusing Aliev of being
involved in the creation of the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK,
according to accounts by Interfax and the Turan News Agency.
	   Turkey has outlawed the party, which is fighting for autonomy in
Turkey's southeast, and considers it a terrorist organization.
	   Elchibey was Azerbaijan's first president after the 1991 breakup
of the Soviet Union. He was forced from office in June 1993 by
Aliev, who took over after a military mutiny.
	   Elchibey now is chairman of the main opposition group, National
Front. Last week, he was beaten by a gang of unidentified men
following an opposition rally in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku.

New Zealand aiming for historic 3-0 clean-sweep
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WATFORD, England (AP) _ New Zealand is playing for its first
ever series clean-sweep on British soil in the third rugby league
Test Saturday, while the Lions are playing for pride.
	   The Kiwis' come-from-behind 36-16 win over Britain at Bolton
last week guaranteed New Zealand its first series win in Britain
since 1971 and set up the historic chance.
	   New Zealand emerged with a 22-16 win in the first Test in
Huddersfield but trailed 16-8 at halftime in the second Test before
clinching the series with a five-try second-half blitz.
	   New Zealand captain Quentin Pongia, who replaced injured captain
Matthew Ridge two weeks before the series started, said he was
confident of winning at Watford on Saturday and making it 3-0.
	   ``No one's ever done it, so we'd like to be the first,'' Pongia
said. ``Each year, we're getting better. We'd like to be No. 1 in
the world but we'll get this Test out of the road first.''
	   New Zealand coach Frank Endacott has made one change to the team
which won the first two tests, bringing uncapped Queensland player
Craig Smith into the forward pack to replace veteran Tony Iro.
	   Four British players were undergoing medicals Friday in a bid to
play in the third and final Test.
	   Star forward Adrian Morely is still in doubt with an ankle
injury, while centre Paul Newlove has a calf injury. Hooker Keiron
Cunningham and flyhalf Iestyn Harris have been restricted to
limited training.
	   Britain coach Andy Goodway delayed naming his starting team to
give the players time to prove their fitness.
	   ``I think the guys are aware of the implications of being beaten
3-0,'' Goodway said Friday.
	   ``It weighs heavily on them. They don't want to be involved in a
side that is beaten 3-0 in a home Test series.
	   ``The onus of the responsibility is on their shoulders, and I
think they accept that.''

Israel confirms decision to pave roads to Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INCORPORATES Israel-Hebron &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has authorized the paving of 13 roads to
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including one that will
require the expropriation of huge tracts of land owned by
Palestinians.
	   The Palestinians sharply protested the decision, which Israel
confirmed Friday.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and is a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' said Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   There is no mention of bypass roads in the Mideast peace
agreement struck last month at the Wye summit in Maryland.
Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that while the
Palestinians had expected that some roads would be built, they were
taken aback by the large number of projects authorized.
	   The Palestinians consider the paving of those roads a unilateral
Israeli act, especially since they involve seizing
Palestinian-owned lands.
	   As part of the land-for-security agreement, Israel is to
gradually withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank
by the end of January. The pullback will turn several Jewish
settlements into isolated enclaves in Palestinian-controlled areas
and Israel has said it needs to pave new roads to ensure safe
passage to all settlers.
	   U.S. officials were critical of Israel's decision, which came as
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was en route to the region to
oversee implementation of the deal.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior Cabinet
ministers authorized the paving of bypass roads Thursday, although
initial reports were unclear on how many and which projects had
been approved.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Friday that in all, 13
roads would be paved, including one that will stretch from near the
West Bank town of Hebron and past the Palestinian refugee camp of
Al Aroub to Jerusalem.
	   Bar-Illan said the government would try to minimize the
expropriation, but that without the new roads there could not be a
troop pullback.
	   ``They are a vital element of the agreement,'' he said.
	   U.S. officials were also critical of the decision, saying it
might harm the peace process.
	   The peace agreement is to be implemented beginning next week,
beginning with the opening of the new Palestinian airport, a
powerful symbol of fledgling independence. After an operations
drill with Israeli officials, the Palestinian aviation authorities
said Friday that the airport was ready for operations.
	   Also Friday, the Israeli army imposed a curfew in the West Bank
town of Hebron after an assailant hurled a hand grenade at an army
outpost. The grenade did not go off and there were no injuries.

German high court refuses to block Turkish boy's deportation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with boy to be deported Saturday, passport problem
resolved; reax &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court refused Friday
to block Bavaria's attempts to deport a 14-year-old Turkish
juvenile delinquent born and raised in Germany.
	   Bavarian officials said they would put Muhlis Ari, known in the
German media as ``Mehmet,'' on a plane to Turkey on Saturday.
	   ``We'll now act without delay and prepare the deportation of
Mehmet,'' said Bavarian Interior Minister Gunther Beckstein. He
said problems with the boy's lack of a valid passport had been
resolved.
	   Critics, meanwhile, renewed their attacks on Bavaria's ruling
conservatives, accusing them of shirking their responsibility to
the boy by deporting him rather than helping him.
	   ``The judges' decision ... may be legally correct, but it is
regrettable as far as promoting a policy of integration'' of
foreigners,'' said Cem Ozdemir, domestic policy spokesman for the
Greens party.
	   ``It will be the new (federal) government's task to solve the
problems of youth crime where they develop _ in our society _ and
not to export them through deportations.''
	   The Mehmet case made headlines this summer when Bavarian
officials sought to deport not only the boy, but also his parents,
who have lived and worked in Munich for 30 years.
	   Although the parents had never been in trouble with the law,
they were accused of endangering public safety by failing to raise
their son properly.
	   Courts have blocked the deportation of the parents. But the
entire case became an election-year issue, with liberals accusing
the ruling conservatives of using a family tragedy to show they
were cracking down on ``criminal foreigners.''
	   Bavaria's highest court last month upheld the state's decision
to deny Ari a new residency permit because of a string of violent
offenses, thus clearing the way for a deportation. His lawyer had
asked the Constitutional Court to block it.
	   But the high court ruled unanimously Friday that arguments that
the boy's rights were being violated were inadmissible. It said his
lawyer should have challenged the immediate implementation of the
deportation order in a lower court.

	   VALLAURIS, France (AP) _ Some 2,000 mourners turned out Friday
to bid farewell to Jean Marais, one of France's most beloved
actors, buried in the simple cemetery of this Riviera village.
	   Even in death, the smooth baritone voice of Marais, who died
Sunday at age 84, resounded through St. Anne church, where village
friends and actors paid tribute: ``Give up! Let go! Life is dead!
Long live life!''
	   Spoken by Marais in the prime of his long career, the words were
penned by his longtime companion, the surrealist artist and poet
Jean Cocteau who died in 1963, and replayed at the service.
	   ``Having entered into the realm of poets, heroes and sacred
monsters, (Marais) gave more than 60 years of his life to the
theater and the cinema,'' French Culture Minister Catherine
Trautmann said in a tribute to a man she described as ``inspired,
passionate and rigorous.''
	   The service was a testament to Marais' talent and simplicity,
drawing actors like Jean-Paul Belmondo and Michele Morgan, and
local artists and friends.
	   Marais was buried in the cemetery of Vallauris, where he spent
the last years of his life learning sculpture and ceramics.
	   ``You never would have known that he was a great actor,'' said
one local. ``He was simple, like us.''
	   Marais began his career as Cocteau's protege and went on to
become a pillar of the French cinema.
	   He was best known for his role as the beast in Cocteau's 1946
classic, ``The Beauty and the Beast.''
	   Other roles included ``Orphee'' in 1949, ``The Hunchback'' and
the ``Fantomas'' series with Louis de Funes.
	   Marais worked with top directors including Jean Renoir, Luchino
Visconti and Abel Gance. In the mid-1990s, he starred at the famed
Paris cabaret Les Folies Bergeres and played Prospero in
Shakespeare's ``The Tempest.''

Lawmakers criticized for spending dlrs 500,000 on cars
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Free-spending Romanian lawmakers came
under fire Friday for splashing out a half-million dollars on
pricey cars, which critics say the ailing economy can't afford.
	   When reformist parties came to power two years ago, they
promised to curb extravagant spending, but have often been
criticized for spending public money with abandon.
	   ``This proves that power has gone to their heads,'' said
journalist Valentin Neagu. ``While the government is ... cutting
the budget, they are spending money as if it is their last
chance.''
	   In recent weeks, the government purchased 11 new cars with a
total price of a half-million dollars.
	   In impoverished Romania, where the average monthly salary is 1.2
million lei (dlrs 120), most people don't own cars. The sum of 5
billion lei (dlrs 500,000) is what someone on the average salary
would earn in 347 years.
	   ``You can build a canteen for 5,000 people or you can give
dozens of grants for talented students, you can equip a maternity
hospital with top equipment, or you can build part of a national
highway,'' wrote Ingrid Susu of the daily Romania Libera on Friday.
	   The daily Libertatea ran the story over three pages, complete
with photographs of the cars purchased by parliament's upper
chamber, the Senate _ the latest BMW and 11 Volkswagen Passats.
	   A month ago, parliament's lower house of deputies approved a
budget for itself that is three times larger than this year's
budget, prompting criticism.
	   The deputies did not say where they would get money to fund the
budget increase. Inflation stands at 45 percent this year.

Three arrested in German train accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Police arrested three teen-agers Friday suspected
of causing a high-speed ICE train accident by laying flat concrete
blocks on the tracks, apparently as a prank.
	   No one was injured Thursday night when the train from Berlin to
Hanover hit the small plates at 250 kph (155 mpg), triggering the
emergency brakes. The train did not derail, but rail officials
estimated damage to the front at 13,500 marks (dlrs 8,400).
	   Authorities arrested three teens _ 15, 16 and 18 _ from
Rathenow, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Berlin, on Friday.
They said there was no evidence the youths had any political or
other motive for their prank.
	   The newly opened stretch of high-speed track was closed for more
than two hours Thursday night, delaying 13 trains.
	   The damaged train returned a short distance to the Rathenow
train station, where passengers were transferred to another train.

Effectiveness of experimental cancer drugs questioned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ The National Cancer Institute says it has been
unable to reproduce a Harvard researcher's widely hailed findings
that he had eliminated malignant tumors in mice by choking off the
tumors' blood supply.
	   Dr. Judah Folkman of Harvard Medical School and Children's
Hospital reported last year that he and his colleagues had achieved
complete regression of malignant tumors in mice with two drugs he
pioneered, angiostatin and endostatin. He said Thursday the
problems others are reporting are only a minor glitch in the
process.
	   Since his report, the cancer institute has been testing
endostatin in laboratory mice, trying to replicate Folkman's
results before beginning human tests.
	   After The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that a number of
experts say they haven't been able to verify Folkman's findings,
the cancer institute issued a statement saying it would continue to
study the compounds but had so far been unsuccessful.
	   ``Studies using either the mouse or human forms of endostatin
have not produced the marked regression of these tumors in mice
that Folkman's laboratory has reported,'' the institute said.
	   Human trials were to begin next year, but the institute said it
does not know when they can begin.
	   Folkman, whose team pioneered the concept of attacking cancer by
blocking its ability to grow new blood vessels, called the problem
an unsurprising ``bump in the road.''
	   The drugs are extremely complex to make and properly administer,
he said in an interview Thursday with The Boston Globe.
	   ``There are often many problems which have to be overcome in
transferring a new technique from one lab to another, which mainly
involve a learning period,'' Folkman told the Globe.
	   Folkman said it usually takes two years for other scientists to
repeat the experiments and publish the results. Scientists from his
laboratory and the National Cancer Institute's will visit each
other's facilities in the next two months to try to resolve
problems, he said.
	   When the research was published last year, cancer experts warned
that while the approach was promising, treatments that look
spectacular in lab animals almost never work so well in people.
	   But a page-one article in May in The New York Times triggered a
new round of enthusiasm, and the resulting publicity had a stunning
effect on the stock of Entremed Inc., the Rockville, Maryland,
company founded to develop angiostatin and endostatin.
	   Nobel laureate James D. Watson was quoted in the Times story in
May as saying that Folkman ``is going to cure cancer in two
years.'' But Watson later said he was misquoted, and cautioned that
``the history of cancer research is littered with promised
treatments that raised people's hopes, only for them to be dashed
when the treatments were put to the test in humans.''
	   This week, EntreMed said it ``stands solidly behind the data''
showing the compounds to be potent against tumors. The company's
stock lost 24 percent of its value Thursday and was traded at 10
times normal volume.

Angolan troops find corpses of foreigners believed abducted in mine

attack &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan troops tracking gunmen who raided
a Canadian-owned mine and abducted four foreign staff have found
three corpses believed to be the expatriate workers, an army
spokesman said Friday.
	   ``We found three white men floating in a river,'' Brig. Jose
Joao Manuel said by phone.
	   ``It seems that they drowned, but we don't know the specific
cause of death yet,'' he added.
	   The identities of the three men had not yet been ascertained,
but they were believed to be from the group of four workers _ two
Filipinos, a Briton and a South African _ who were abducted during
last Sunday's attack on the Yetwene mine, he said.
	   The bodies were awaiting identification by officials from the
mine, owned by Vancouver-based DiamondWorks Ltd..
	   Gunmen attacked the mine at Yetwene, a remote mining village
about 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the capital Luanda, before
dawn Sunday, killing eight employees and wounding 18 others.
	   Two Britons and a South African were among those killed.
	   Brig. Manuel said troops found the corpses on Thursday in a
river ``dozens of kilometers (miles)'' from the mine, but he could
not give an exact location.
	   Troops were still pursuing the gunmen, estimated to number about
200, towards the northern border with Congo, he said.
	   However, the gunmen had split up into smaller groups, making it
difficult to catch them all, he said.
	   Officials have blamed the former rebel group UNITA for the raid,
claiming it wanted to destabilize the country as part of its
continuing hostility towards the government despite signing a 1994
peace pact to end a two-decade civil war.
	   However, gangs of armed bandits, mostly demobilized soldiers,
roam the countryside of the vast southwest African nation and
regularly have pillaged outlying towns in recent months.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Enlarging the European Union to include
former communist countries should be done in a way that will bring
benefits to original EU states, as well as future members,
Austria's Chancellor Viktor Klima said after talks in Poland
Friday.
	   ``The expansion should be carried out in such a way that people
in EU member countries and candidate countries should not suffer,
but feel advantages,'' Klima said.
	   Klima, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating
presidency, spent half a day in Warsaw talking to Polish leaders,
three days after Poland and four other former communist nations _
Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia _ as well as
Cyprus, began membership negotiations.
	   Expanding the EU was necessary to ensure stability and peace in
Europe, Klima told reporters after talks with his Polish host,
Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.
	   Klima warned however, that ``certain transition periods are
needed in particular sectors'' among the states aspiring to EU
membership, singling out the issue of coordinating social security
systems, where differences currently inhibited the ability of
employees to move country.
	   Negotiations with prospective members would have to solve other
tricky issues in a similar fashion to avoid stirring fears in the
richer West, Klima said, in apparent reference to eastern Europe's
big farm economies and cheaper labor.
	   The Austrian chancellor praised Poland's economic and political
performance, and suggested it could be viewed as an example for
others who aspire to EU membership.
	   Prime Minister Buzek said the leaders discussed European issues,
where Poland and Austria show almost ``identical positions,'' and
bilateral relations, which were ``very good.''
	   Buzek said Poland hoped to boost trade between the two countries
and wanted to encourage Austrian capital to participate in the
privatization of Poland industries.
	   Later Friday, Klima was due to meet President Aleksander
Kwasniewski.

North American pretax income rise boosts Aegon net profit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ A strong pretax income rise in
North America helped Dutch insurer Aegon NV to a 33 percent net
profit rise in the first nine months of 1998, the company announced
Friday.
	   Nine-month net profit rose to 1.99 billion guilders (dlrs 1.05
billion) from 1.5 billion guilders (dlrs 797.8 million) in the
first nine months of last year while total revenues grew to 28.77
billion guilders (dlrs 15.3 billion) from 22.83 billion guilders
(dlrs 12.1 billion).
	   Better than expected operational results in the period partially
offset the negative effect of the weaker dollar, Aegon said.
	   In the Americas, mainly in the United States, Aegon's income
before tax rose a sharp 68 percent to dlrs 731 million, mainly due
to of last year's acquisition of U.S.'s Providian Corp.
	   Income before tax in the Netherlands rose 8 percent to 1.16
billion guilders (dlrs 617 million).
	   The company said that the current low interest rate ``is not a
major concern relative to our capital position, earnings, or the
security of policyholders'' and added that 1998 net profit should
rise by 25 percent.

Government confirms decision to pave bypass roads
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ross arriving, Ross-Arafat meeting postponed
until Saturday, Israel informing Palestinians of make-up of
negotiating committees &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel's government confirmed Friday that it
has authorized the paving of 13 roads to Jewish settlements in the
West Bank, including one that will reportedly require the
expropriation of thousands of acres of Palestinian-owned land.
	   The Palestinians sharply protested the decision.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and are a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' said Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that while the
Palestinians had expected that some roads would be built, they were
taken aback by the large number of projects authorized.
	   U.S. officials were also critical of Israel's decision.
	   The latest dispute came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross
arrived in Jerusalem to oversee implementation of the new
land-for-security agreement.
	   Ross was to meet separately with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat on Friday evening.
A Friday night meeting between Ross and Arafat was moved up to
Saturday morning.
	   As part of the agreement, Israel is to gradually withdraw from
13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January. The pullback
will turn several Jewish settlements into isolated enclaves in
Palestinian-controlled areas and Israel has said it needs to pave
new roads to ensure safe passage to all settlers.
	   On Thursday, Netanyahu and senior Cabinet ministers authorized
the paving of bypass roads, although initial reports were unclear
on how many and which projects had been approved.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Friday that in all, 13
roads would be paved, including one that will stretch from near the
West Bank town of Hebron and past the Palestinian refugee camp of
Al Aroub to Jerusalem and is known as the ``Al Aroub bypass.''
	   Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and the armed forces
chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, reportedly oppose the Al
Aroub project, arguing the road work could lead to Palestinian
riots because so much land will have to be expropriated.
	   Asfour, the Palestinian negotiator, said that for the paving of
the Al Aroub bypass, Israel would have to expropriate land in areas
already under Palestinian control.
	   Bar-Illan said the government would try to minimize the
expropriation, but that without the new roads there could not be a
troop pullback. ``They are a vital element of the agreement,'' he
said.
	   Asked to comment on the road plans, U.S. Embassy spokesman Larry
Schwartz referred to comments by U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin on Thursday on Israel's decision to start construction
of a Jewish neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
	   Rubin said the building plan was a ``bad decision that harms the
peace process'' and Schwartz said Friday that that comment also
applied to the paving of the bypass roads.
	   Israel's Cabinet ratified the peace accord on Wednesday, after
two weeks of delay, and implementation is to begin next week.
	   Netanyahu has said he would permit the opening of the
Palestinian airport and begin releasing Palestinian prisoners,
though he has not set dates. Later in the week, Israel was to
withdraw from 2 percent of the West Bank.
	   Moving a small step forward, Israel on Friday gave the
Palestinians the names of Israeli negotiators in various committees
that are to deal with implementation of the accord or finalize some
issues, such as the opening of a Palestinian harbor.
	   In other developments Friday, the army clamped a curfew on
downtown Hebron after an assailant hurled a hand grenade at an army
outpost. The grenade did not go off and there were no injuries.
	   In a similar incident in September, an activist in the Islamic
militant group Hamas threw two hand grenades at a group of Israeli
soldiers, wounding a dozen troops and several Palestinians. The
assailant was later arrested by Israel.

Criminal case opened against Communist lawmaker, official says

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 9th graf with Duma approving measure against
inciting ethnic tension, rejecting measure targeting Makashov in
new grafs 12-13. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's security chief said Friday that a
criminal case was opened against a Communist lawmaker for calling
for the government's ouster, and urged a separate probe into his
anti-Semitic remarks.
	   But prosecutors denied that they had opened a case against
Albert Makashov, a retired general who has ignited controversy by
blaming the country's problems on ``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur
against Jews. Russian law forbids speeches that ``incite ethnic
strife.''
	   Vladimir Putin, the chief of Russia's Federal Security Service,
said on Friday that Moscow city prosecutors had officially launched
a probe against Makashov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   But prosecutors said that a month ago they only started a
general investigation into the calls for the government's ouster
made by several politicians at public rallies, but hasn't launched
a probe specifically against Makashov.
	   Putin said the FSB would urge prosecutors to bring separate
charges against Makashov for his anti-Semitic statements and
request that parliament's lower house, the State Duma, waive the
immunity he enjoys as a lawmaker.
	   Prosecutors said they were still checking whether Makashov made
any remarks punishable by law.
	   President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday criticized prosecutors and
other law-enforcement officials for their ``indecision'' in
combating political and ethnic extremism. He didn't specifically
refer to Makashov's case.
	   Communists, who dominate the Duma together with their hardline
allies, last week blocked a resolution condemning Makashov. They
could also block any attempt to lift his immunity.
	   Meanwhile, the Duma on Friday approved a vague measure that
criticizes unspecified lawmakers for ``inciting ethnic tension.''
The measure, which passed 303-34, doesn't contain any specific
reference to Makashov or anti-Semitism.
	   ``This statement is a camouflage, it's simply an attempt to
shrug off the protests,'' said Iosif Kobzon, a popular singer who
is also a member of the Duma.
	   ``I face anti-Semitic attacks myself every day I enter the State
Duma building,'' he said.
	   A liberal lawmaker proposed another measure openly condemning
Makashov, but it was rejected 148-132.
	   ``Makashov's words reflect the opinion of his party comrades,''
said Yelena Mizulina of the liberal Yabloko faction, who proposed
that measure.
	   Some Communist officials defended Makashov in speeches last
weekend celebrating the 81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian
revolution, which brought the Communist Party to power.
	   Makashov's statements and the Communist refusal to censure him
have sparked protests in Russia and abroad. Israel's ambassador to
Russia said Thursday that Makashov's attacks were an insult to the
entire Israeli nation.
	   Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov, who had been only
mildly critical of Makashov in recent days, made a more direct
denunciation on Thursday.
	   ``We consider Makashov's statements inappropriate, unrestrained
and incorrect,'' Zyuganov said.

NATO approves plan for Kosovo extraction force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO ambassadors approved plans Friday
for a French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand ready
to rescue unarmed civilian ``ground verifiers'' in Kosovo should
they come under threat.
	   The political approval of the military's operations plans means
Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe, can begin
calling up troops from nations who have volunteered to participate
in the 1,200-1,800-strong all-European force, which will be based
in neighboring Macedonia.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is in
the process of putting 2,000 civilian verifiers into Kosovo. These
observers will insure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic lives
up to the agreement he made with American negotiator Richard
Holbrooke Oct. 12.
	   Hundreds of people have died and hundreds of thousands have been
displaced in a conflict between ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of Kosovo's population, and Serb police and military
forces. Kosovo is the southern province of Serbia, largest of the
two republics in Yugoslavia.
	   The cease-fire declared in Kosovo last month is shaky at best,
with low level of violence continuing nearly every day. NATO
ambassadors discussed the compliance issue again on Friday and once
again expressed concern that the simmering violence could flare
into a major conflict, officials said.
	   The NATO ``extraction force,'' called Joint Guarantor, will be
on standby in Macedonia and prepared to rescue any of the civilian
verifiers that might find themselves under attack or in a
threatening situation.
	   The force will be in the normal NATO chain of command under the
headquarters for Allied Forces in Southern Europe, in Naples,
Italy, and under Clark's overall authority.
	   France has not been a part of NATO's integrated military command
since President Charles de Gaulle withdrew his forces from it in
1966.
	   However, the French are expected to make up about half the
force. Germany, Britain and the Netherlands also have volunteered
troops, and NATO officials said the force also would be open to
non-NATO members, including Russia.
	   Officials said they expected the NATO ``activation order'' to
come sometime next week, which would begin actually putting Joint
Guarantor into place.

Investigators theorize gas leak caused fatal explosion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ A combination of gasoline fumes and a
natural-gas leak may have caused the explosion that killed five
people and destroyed an apartment building in the Swiss capital of
Bern earlier this month, an official said Friday.
	   Nothing has so far come to light that would indicate a bomb set
off the Nov. 5 blast that also injured 18 people, said city Prefect
Sebastian Bentz.
	   A leak has been found in the natural-gas main under the street
in the vicinity of the building, Bentz said. Investigators are
trying to determine whether gas seeped into the building itself.
	   They are also theorizing that it may have mixed with gasoline
vapors in two old storage tanks under the building, Bentz said. The
ground floor of the building contained a car showroom and garage.
	   The investigators expect to be able to determine the cause when
they can enter the basement after the remains of the five-story
structure above are dismantled, Bentz said.

Prosecutor seek harsher punishment for artifact vandals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Scribbling on Greece's cultural treasures
is just as bad as stealing them, says a prosecutor seeking stiffer
penalties for anyone who defaces monuments, busts or statues.
	   Panagiotis Dimopoulos, a prosecutor at the Athens Supreme Court
of Appeals, is seeking to double the maximum penalty for marking or
vandalizing a cultural object to 10 years _ the same as stealing
ancient artifacts.
	   The prosecutor, who made his recommendation to Justice Minister
Evangelos Giannopoulos on Thursday, said he considers defacing to
be even more serious.
	   If something is stolen there is a chance it could be recovered,
but defacing can be permanent, he said.

Nearly half of Greeks have serious reading problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Nearly half of Greeks need help to fill
out a form or understand simple written instructions, according to
a nationwide survey reported Friday.
	   These levels are ``much higher'' than most other European
countries, said Gerasimos Tsiokos, head of the education ministry's
illiteracy department, which co-sponsored the study.
	   ``They were given simple tests like adding two figures or
understanding an electricity bill, and they could not do this. They
are functionally illiterate,'' Tsiokos said.
	   The study found that while about 4 percent of Greeks were
totally illiterate, about 45 percent were functionally illiterate.
Most left school before completing the mandatory nine years of
attendance.
	   The need to go out to work was the reason most commonly given
for failing to finish basic schooling.
	   The survey was conducted this summer by a polling company and
involved more than 5,000 Greeks aged 15 and over who said Greek was
their mother tongue. No margin of error was given.

U.N. director says food distribution continuing normally
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-UN
 &UR; By WAIEL FALEH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Food distribution under an exemption to
U.N. sanctions has continued despite the evacuation of some aid
workers, the director of U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq said
Friday.
	   ``We here, with limited capacity, are trying to continue to
react to the need for the supply of humanitarian goods in Iraq,''
the director, Hans von Sponeck, told a news conference.
	   Von Sponeck, 59, of Freiburg, Germany, arrived in Iraq to take
up his post last Monday. On Wednesday and Thursday, the 30-year
U.N. veteran supervised the evacuation of 150 U.N. relief workers
amid concerns over possible U.S. military attacks.
	   He said that 57 U.N. humanitarian workers remain in Baghdad _
and that all have taken up residence in the U.N. headquarters
building. An additional 230 U.N. relief staffers are in northern
provinces overseeing food distribution to the Iraqi Kurds.
	   He said no further evacuations were planned ``unless the
situation deteriorates significantly.''
	   Asked what would happen if there is a military strike, von
Sponeck said: ``Everything would be more complicated. But what I
want you to know is that the United Nations isn't easily giving up.
We are here. We are remaining here.''
	   The U.N. workers supervise the oil-for-food program, which was
launched in December 1996 as an exemption to U.N. trade sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   It allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy needed
food and medicine. The food is distributed in monthly rations to
Iraq's 22 million people.
	   Von Sponeck said food continues to arrive. On Friday, a
Brazilian ship was unloading 14,000 tons of sugar, he said.
	   Earlier Friday, U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said a million barrels
of oil were exported to Turkey on Thursday and that two ships _ the
Moss King and British Reliant _ each loaded 2 million barrels of
oil at the southern Iraqi port of al-Bakr.
	   Falt also said that cargo ships this week unloaded 13,000 tons
of Vietnamese rice and 42,000 tons of Australian wheat.
	   Von Sponeck said the United Nations had not restricted the
movement of its staff during daylight hours but had asked that they
be back at the U.N. headquarters building by 8 p.m. (1700 gmt).
	   He also said U.N. officials were holding regular meetings with
Iraqi government representatives.
	   ``We are trying in a very politically volatile environment to do
work that has nothing to do with politics but has to do with
meeting basic needs of people,'' he said.

Shimon Perez to head VW fund for former slave laborers
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Former Israeli prime minister Shimon Peres was
named Friday to head a council overseeing Volkswagen's 20 million
mark (dlrs 12 million) fund to compensate former slave laborers
used by the carmaker during the Nazi era.
	   The group, which met in Berlin, also includes former chancellor
Franz Vranitzky of Austria and former German president Richard von
Weizsaecker, a statement from Volkswagen said.
	   The three discussed guidelines for administration of the fund as
well as the distribution of payments, the statement said.
	   The statement made no mention of when payments would start or
how much they would be. When announcing the fund last September, VW
said it hoped to begin distribution this year.
	   The fund is to be administered by the accounting firm KPMG.
	   VW estimates 17,000 forced laborers worked in its factories
between 1941 and the end of the war, although others charge the
number was much higher.
	   Facing lawsuits in the United States and threats of more at
home, VW became the first major German firm to say it would
establish a fund to give ``humanitarian aid'' directly to
survivors.
	   The German automaker said it was ``morally called upon'' to aid
former forced laborers, while stressing it believed it was under no
legal obligation to do so.
	   Following Volkswagen, electronics giant Siemens also announced
setting up a fund of 20 million marks.
	   Both companies are also involved in talks with newly elected
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to set up an industry-wide fund,
administered by the government, to settle all slave labor claims
and resolve all legal action.

Airport ready for operation; Palestinians await word from Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The new Palestinian airport, a powerful symbol
of fledgling independence, is ready to open, the head of the
Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority said Friday after an
operations drill with Israeli officials.
	   Yasser Arafat International Airport in the southern Gaza Strip
was to have opened last week as part of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace agreement. However, Israel fell behind schedule when it held
up Cabinet ratification of the accord by two weeks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said the airport would
start operating next week, but has not set a date.
	   On Thursday, Israeli and Palestinian officials staged a
four-hour drill, said Fayez Zeidan, head of the Palestinian Civil
Aviation Authority.
	   About 100 Palestinian airport employees and 50 Israelis who will
share security duties played the roles of passengers and airport
personnel. For lack of a plane, the ``passengers'' arrived by bus.
	   Zeidan said the exercise covered arrival and departure
procedures, including passport checks as well as customs and
luggage inspection.
	   He said the airport was ready for operation. ``We just need to
hear from the Israelis,'' Zeidan said.

India restricts Zimbabwe to 196 for 9 in Coca Cup final

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ India's bowlers reduced
Zimababwe to 196 for 9 in 50 overs Friday, giving their team a
modest score to beat in the final of the three-nation Coca Cola
Trophy.
	   Opting to field after winning the toss, Indian bowlers wreaked
havoc with Zimbabwe's pacemen. Ajit Agarkar and Javagal Srinath
sent back to the clubhouse Alistair Campbell (2), Grant Flower (18)
and Murray Goodwin (2) for only 44 by the 11th over.
	   The Indian spin trio of Anil Kumble, Nikhil Chopra and Sunil
Joshi then tightened the noose to leave Zimbabwe at 81 for 6.
	   Kumble dismissed Andy Flower for 19. Off-spinner Chopra bowled
Neil Johnson after he had made a neat 34 off 46 balls.
	   Eddo Brandes (33 off 46 balls) and Paul Strang (46 off 91 balls)
rescued Zimbabwe from complete collapse. The pair put on 58 in 83
balls for the eighth wicket, taking the score to 174.
	   Brandes hit a straight six off Kumble and two boundaries before
he miscalculated a delivery from part-time bowler Sachin Tendulkar
that shattered his stumps.
	   Strang, who hit three boundaries, was given leg before to
Srinath in the final over.
	   Kumble had superb figures of 2 for 29 from 10 overs, while
Srinath took 3 for 40 in equal number of overs.
	   India needs an average of four runs per over to win the final of
the dlrs 85,000 tournament.
	   The winner will bag the dlrs 40,000 first prize, while the
runner up will get dlrs 30,000. Sri Lanka, which failed to qualify
for the finals, will go home with the remainder.

Albanian premier: we're no criminals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Challenging a Greek trend to blame
foreigners for rising crime, Albania's prime minister urged Greeks
on Friday not to view his countrymen as a nation of criminals.
	   ``The (Greek) people should not identify the Albanians here with
the criminal elements among them,'' said Pandeli Majko during a
visit to Apostolos Kaklamanis, speaker of Greece's parliament.
	   Reports from local media also said Majko had apologized for the
crimes committed by Albanians, which include drug and weapons
smuggling.
	   Money sent home by Albanian immigrants is a vital source of
income from Albania, which emerged from decades of Communism in
1991 and where the economy and infrastructure have been further
battered by unrest.
	   Albanians make up the vast majority of the migrants who have
entered Greece illegally this decade. They have been implicated in
a range of crimes, but are also commonly used as scapegoats for
rising general and organized crime in Greece.
	   Crime statistics show that Greeks comprise the vast majority of
lawbreakers.
	   ``It is tragic that instead of providing effective solutions,
public debate has been obsessed with the role of foreigners in the
rising crime wave,'' said an editorial in the respected daily
newspaper Kathimerini. ``They idea that foreigners are responsible
for all crimes is just as arbitrary, stupid and bigoted as to
declare them innocent from the outset.''
	   The 30-year-old Majko, who became prime minister last month, was
in Greece to sign economic aid agreements. He also discussed the
problem of illegal immigration.
	   ``Albanians in Greece want to do honest work,'' Majko told a
news conference Thursday after talks with Premier Costas Simitis.
``Many are the same age as me _ though their hair is not as gray as
mine _ and they represent the same heritage that I do.''

German role in Kosovo air surveillance approved
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Parliament cleared the way Friday for 350
German soldiers and 16 unmanned spy planes to take part in NATO air
surveillance over Yugoslavia's Kosovo province.
	   The operation, to be based in neighboring Macedonia, is designed
to monitor an Oct. 12 peace agreement between Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian rebels.
	   Lawmakers gave their approval by 540 votes to 30, with 12
abstentions. The former East German communists and some members of
the Greens, the junior partner in Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
coalition, refused to back Germany's participation.
	   Schroeder's Cabinet had committed the German troops and
so-called drones last week.
	   NATO's aim is to monitor the withdrawal of Serb forces from
Kosovo and the safety of some 2,000 unarmed international observers
monitoring the pullout.
	   Germany says it will also take a leading role in a NATO rapid
intervention force being set up to get observers out of trouble if
they are hindered or taken hostage.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and Japanese leaders issued a declaration
Friday in which they pledged to seek an end to their 53-year-old
dispute over the Kuril islands by the end of next year.
	   If they succeed, it would mean that Russia and Japan could
formally end World War II before the end of the 20th century. The
dispute over ownership of the tiny islands has stopped the two
countries from ever signing a formal peace treaty.
	   The declaration, signed Thursday by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
of Japan and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, gives no hint of
how the conflict might be resolved, but sets up a new mechanism _
and a new resolve _ for doing it.
	   ``All of us gained something,'' said Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   The declaration was issued at the outset of talks between Obuchi
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov of Russia. The two had been
expected to focus on the details of when and how Japan will hand
over an dlrs 800 million installment of a loan it promised last
summer.
	   ``I think we have made significant progress at this meeting,''
Obuchi said Friday. ``We have decided to speed up the negotiations
toward concluding a peace treaty.''
	   ``It is necessary to expand cooperation, while creating
conditions for concluding a peace treaty and resolving the
territorial question,'' he told reporters after his talks with
Primakov.
	   There was no immediate indication that the loan details had been
resolved.
	   On Thursday, Obuchi and Yeltsin ``exchanged views from broad and
lofty perspectives,'' as Obuchi's spokesman put it, in the first
formal visit by a Japanese prime minister to the Russian capital in
25 years.
	   The Japanese loan is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer. Both the
IMF and the World Bank put their loans on hold after Russia
effectively defaulted on foreign loans at the outset of its
economic crisis in August.
	   In addition to agreeing to free up the loan, Obuchi has offered
to give Russia dlrs 100 million to promote economic development on
the Kuril islands, dlrs 10 million to medical assistance and dlrs
20 million to support youth exchange programs.
	   The two prime ministers signed an agreement on guarantees of
capital investments and on the concept of a joint investment
company that would promote direct investments in Russia by Japanese
companies.
	   They signed memorandums on cooperation in tourism, transport,
mail and telecommunications, as well as support for Russia's small-
and medium-size companies.
	   Relations between the two countries have long been clouded by
the Kuril dispute.
	   Tokyo claimed title to the islands _ Etorofu, Kunashiri,
Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty with Russia in 1875.
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War
II, a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal.
	   ``As for our position regarding the ownership of these four
islands, nothing has changed,'' Obuchi said Friday.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 poor and restive Russian
residents, many of whom would welcome Japanese administration. The
Kurils are important to both countries for symbolic reasons and
because they are surrounded by prime fishing waters.

Queen visits revamped galleries at Tower of London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II met one of the legendary ravens
that protects the Tower of London during a visit Friday to mark the
completion of an eight-year renovation project at the Royal
Armouries Museum.
	   Fortunately, this meeting had a happier ending than the queen's
last visit in 1996, when one of the tower's seven ravens was killed
by a dog working for her security officers.
	   According to legend, the monarchy will collapse if the ravens
leave the tower.
	   The Royal Armouries have been one of the tower's greatest
attractions for 500 years.
	   The revamping means that, for the first time, the museum will
contain galleries devoted solely to exhibits related to the tower
itself. Among the new displays is the Line of Kings _ 10 carved
wooden horses that have not been seen in public for a century.
	   After touring the galleries, the queen and her husband, Prince
Philip, joined tourists to listen to a Yeoman Warder describing
some of the bloody executions that have taken place at the tower.
	   As Britain's head of state, the queen is the official owner of
the tower, which is the oldest of the royal palaces.

Leave Estonia wreckage in peace, many say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A new controversy over the Estonia
ferry disaster swelled Friday with wide opposition from Finns and
Estonians to a Swedish proposal to recover bodies from the
wreckage.
	   The proposal may end up prolonging the agony of victims'
relatives rather than assuaging their pain, the critics say.
	   The criticisms came in the wake of a Swedish
government-appointed panel's recommendation Thursday that divers
bring up as many bodies as possible from the wreck of the ferry,
which sank Sept. 28, 1994, killing 852 people.
	   Only 95 bodies were recovered, and many victims' relatives had
bitterly criticized Sweden's plan to cover the wreckage with
hundreds of tons of sand and rocks, saying they could not complete
their mourning if the bodies were not brought to land; that plan
was put on hold in 1996.
	   Shortly after the sinking _ which occurred when heavy Baltic
seas ripped off the ferry's bow door en route from Tallinn,
Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden _ Swedish officials had promised the
bodies would be recovered, but that decision was reversed, to the
dismay and anger of many relatives.
	   Despite the Swedish panel's recommendation, the Finnish
government said in a statement Friday that there is ``no need to
change the agreement ... to protect the shipwreck. The Estonia and
the surrounding seabed should, in the future as well, be respected
as the final resting place of the victims.''
	   Estonia has not taken an official position on the proposal, but
President Lennart Meri was clearly resistant to the idea.
	   ``The place where a person has had his life taken by the sea is
just as sacred as any graveyard next to a church,'' he said
Thursday. That view was echoed in newspaper commentary on Friday.
	   ``The sacredness of sea graves has been part of the seafaring
traditions of Estonians and also Swedes for centuries and there is
no reason to change these traditions now,'' Estonia's Postimees
daily said in an editorial. ``There is no urgent need to now rip
open the wounds of the victims' families who have only recently
dried their tears of mourning.''
	   The Swedish government has not yet said whether it will go along
with the panel's recommendation. That decision is expected to take
about two months, and even if Sweden wants to begin recovering the
bodies, Finland and Estonia also would have to approve the project.
	   The aftermath of the sinking, which only 137 people survived,
has tormented Sweden, Finland and Estonia for years. The three
countries formed a joint commission to investigate the cause of the
disaster, but its work was widely criticized and public trust was
undermined by the resignations of several commission members.
	   The commission's final report last year said the bow door's
locks were too weak, citing that flaw as a main factor in the
sinking. But a report commissioned by the ship's German builder,
the Meyer shipyards, concluded the locks were adequate but had been
poorly maintained.

Nationalists criticize government for severance of ties with
</HEADLINE>
Yugoslavia &QL; 
 &UR; By IRENA GAJIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Serb nationalists
demanded Friday that the moderate government resign, blaming it for
severance of financial ties with neighboring Yugoslavia.
	   The Bosnian Serb government earlier this month introduced a
higher exchange rate for the Yugoslav dinar than the official rate
in Yugoslavia, and the Belgrade government responded Thursday by
stopping all money circulation with Bosnian Serbs in Yugoslav
dinars.
	   The Serb Democratic Party said Yugoslavia's decision to halt the
flow of money to or from the Bonsian Serb republic would have
``unforeseeable consequences'' and lead to a complete halt in trade
between Yugoslavia and the Serb-run half of Bosnia.
	   The Bosnian Serb republic and Yugoslavia basically have
functioned as one market so far.
	   The Serb party said that the Bosnian Serb market relies more
than 90 percent on Yugoslavia. It predicted that many Bosnian Serb
companies trading with Serbia would go bankrupt, and shortages of
consumer goods also could be expected.
	   In the Yugoslav capital Belgrade, Dusan Vlatkovic, the National
Bank chief, dismissed reports that severance of financial ties with
the Bosnian Serbs was politically motivated. He also denied reports
of a looming devaluation of the Yugoslav dinar.
	   In Yugoslavia, one German mark is worth six dinars, while the
Bosnian Serb government recently decided that one convertible mark
_ their official currency _ was worth 7.5 dinars, lowering the
value of the Yugoslav currency. The 7.5 dinar rate about equals the
exchange rate of the dinar on the black market in Yugoslavia.
	   The Yugoslav government halted the money flow in dinars at a
session Thursday.
	   Independent economists in Belgrade criticized the move Friday,
saying it denied Yugoslavia access to the only market in the world
where it actually made a profit.
	   Mladjan Dinkic, a fierce critic of the government's economic
policies, accused the state of printing of money to pay out
pensions and salaries. Dinkic predicted that one German Mark will
be worth nine dinars by the end of the year.
	   The Yugoslav government said Thursday the Bosnian Serb decision
to change the dinar exchange rate led to recent fall of the dinar
value on the black market in Serbia. But Dinkic refuted that,
saying the Yugoslav government was seeking to blame someone else
for its own poor economy.
	   In Bosnia, the nationalist SDS party accused the moderate
Bosnian Serb government of changing the dinar rate under orders
from international officials so that the Serb entity would move
away from Yugoslavia in the crucial financial sphere and return to
centralized Bosnia.
	   Earlier this year, Bosnian Serbs introduced a new Bosnian
currency, the convertible mark, but also kept the Yugoslav dinar in
circulation. However, the latest move in Belgrade most likely would
lead to disappearance of the Yugoslav dinar from the Bosnian Serb
market.
	   At elections last September, Bosnian Serb moderates and
nationalists both gained an equal number of seats in parliament,
which led to a deadlock in forming the new government. President
Nikola Poplasen is expected to name premier-designate soon.

Pilots blame air force command for military jet crash
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with military prosecutors launching investigation

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ The air force commander could face
criminal charges if investigators find an order to fly in bad
weather led to the fatal crash during independence day
celebrations, a presidential aide said Friday.
	   An air force training jet crashed Wednesday about 30 kilometers
(18 miles) southeast of Warsaw, killing both men on board. The
Polish-built Iskra was checking weather conditions in advance of an
aerial ceremony for the 80th anniversary of Poland regaining its
independence.
	   Pilots of the same division as the ill-fated Iskra charged the
cloud base Wednesday was only 200 meters (656 feet), the same as
tall buildings in downtown Warsaw, but they were told to fly
anyway.
	   ``The climate conditions did not allow for aerobatics,
especially in the center of Warsaw. We flew in the fog, among the
apartment buildings,'' a pilot told the nationwide radio Zet. He
asked not to be identified.
	   If the commission confirms the pilots' allegations, the air
force commander could be dismissed and face criminal charges, said
Marek Siwiec, chief of the presidential National Security Council.
	   A special commission investigating the crash is to report in
several weeks.
	   The Warsaw Military Prosecutor's Office also has launched its
own probe into the cause of the accident. Its chief, Col. Tadeusz
Krysicki, said Friday that another aircraft had made an earlier
reconnaissance flight Wednesday, but its pilot did not indicate
that conditions for the next weather check flight were impossible.
	   The crash was the third this year of an Iskra, which was
designed in the 1960s. The Polish air force has about 150 planes of
that type and uses them as its main training jet.
	   The crash will probably speed up the decision to acquire modern
fighters to replace old jets, which has been delayed because of the
limited defense budget, according to a defense ministry spokesman,
Capt. Andrzej Adamczyk.
	   Poland is considering leasing or buying about a dozen fighter
planes to bring its air force up to NATO standards. The
U.S.-produced F-16 or F-18 are the most probable choices.

Prosecutor charges news agency with libel over doping allegation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A prosecutor on Friday charged the
Finnish news agency STT with libel for reporting that top Finnish
skier Jari Rasanen had bought illegal growth hormones.
	   On Jan. 21, STT said that Rasanen had bought growth hormones
that are banned for competing athletes. The hormones had been
stolen from a hospital in Sweden, the report said.
	   STT also claimed that Finnish Ski Federation officials had been
planning to buy large amounts of the performance-enhancing
substances.
	   However, after investigations in Finland and Sweden, Finnish
police said they found no evidence of either Rasanen or Finnish ski
officials being involved in, or planning, the purchase of hormones.
	   STT has not given sources for its report. In January, it said it
would reveal the names of the ski federation officials and details
of Rasanen's alleged purchase, but so far has not done so.
	   Helsinki District Prosecutor Maarit Loimukoski charged the
writer of the STT report, Johann Aatsalo-Sallinen, and
editor-in-chief Kari Vaisanen with libel.
	   Neither would immediately comment on the charge.
	   Rasanen, who was a relay silver medallist in World Chamionships
last year, has vehemently denied he has been involved in the use,
purchase or planned purchase of growth hormones.
	   Rasanen has threatened to sue STT for up to 2 million markkaa
(dlrs 390,000). The Finnish Ski Federation has also said it will
take the news agency to court.
	   Since publishing the allegations, STT has come under fire from
other media, politicians and its owners, Finland's leading
newspapers.
	   Ski Federation chairman and former Prime Minister Esko Aho said
he had lost confidence in the news agency which has a semi-official
position in Finland, and often is the government's main channel for
the dissemination of information.

Yugoslav official rules out talks with Kosovo guerrillas

 &UR; Eds: AMs: UPDATES with Yugoslav deputy premier ruling out talks
with Albanian guerrillas; recasts and trims.
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Yugoslav official on Friday
ruled out involving separatist Albanian guerrillas in peace plans
for Kosovo but urged the resumption of talks with more moderate
ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   A statement issued by Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic and carried by
the Tanjug news agency ruled out participation of the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army in the peace process, saying ``there is no
place for extremists, terrorism, abductions, killings, armed
attacks.''
	   Alluding to the Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb
police forces from Kosovo, he said: ``An agreement respected only
by one side stands no chance.''
	   At talks in Belgrade with European Union envoy Wolfgang
Petrisch, Lilic said authorities are abiding by the agreement,
meant to set up a deal designed to restore autonomy to Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy to the October
agreement, it says it is respecting a de-facto cease fire it
created and responding only when attacked. Authorities claim the
guerrillas are provoking fights, hoping for a massive response
which will revive the threat of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav
targets.
	   Armed Serb civilians swapped hostages with ethnic Albanian
guerrillas on Friday, defusing a standoff. But tensions were fed by
reports that Serb police shot and killed an ethnic Albanian.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot
throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
	   Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness
said Serb police opened fire on a group of ethnic Albanian men and
children, killing one of the men and injuring another. The Kosovo
Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, also carried
the report.
	   According to Tafil Kryeziu, six police pulled up in an unmarked
car Thursday and opened fire on the group. The children fled
unharmed, but one man was killed and another wounded in the arm,
said the witnesses, identifying both victims by name.
	   Journalists visiting Mlecane Friday saw two pools of blood amid
15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident reportedly
took place. Male villagers, who only recently returned to the homes
they left earlier, said all the women and children had fled again.
	   ``We aren't normal folks anymore. Whenever we see a car, we run
away because we're afraid,'' said Ismajl Gashi, 40.
	   The detentions and continued shootings have chipped away at
hopes for a solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and
Albanians, ushered in by an Oct. 12 agreement.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province has left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made
refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told
Serbs _ a less than 10 percent minority in the province _ they had
nothing to fear from the October agreement,
	   ``All Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told
reporters.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ At least five people were killed
Friday when Indonesian security forces fired plastic bullets, water
cannons and tear gas into a crowd of thousands of rock-throwing
protesters trying to march on Parliament.
	   Local radio said more than 100 people had been badly injured.
Many were in critical condition with gunshot wounds.
	   Hospitals said their emergency rooms were full of bleeding
students as street battles continued through the night.
	   It was the bloodiest day of protest in a week of student
demonstrations against a special government assembly reforming the
government left behind by Suharto's authoritarian 32 years in
power. Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers
intent on preserving their political privileges.
	   It was the worst violence since deadly riots in May helped force
Suharto out of office.
	   A high school student and a police officer died Thursday after
20,000 students were blocked by security personnel from reaching
Parliament.
	   On Friday, security personnel fired repeated volleys of warning
shots into the air and plastic bullets directly at students.
Protesters ran for cover and threw rocks and bottles back.
	   Police helicopters used searchlights to pinpoint troublemakers.
	   The students were blocked from reaching Parliament where the
People's Consultative Assembly passed a new political blueprint for
the troubled Southeast Asian nation.
	   Students believe the assembly does not support true democratic
reform but has only passed decrees that entrench Suharto's
successor President B.J. Habibie, the military and the ruling
Golkar party.
	   Late Friday night a smiling Habibie was whisked past the
protests in a heavy guarded motorcade to the Parliament where he
closed the four-day assembly.
	   He expressed his condolences for the deaths of the student
protesters saying they were the ``victims of the process of
reform'' that would bring Indonesian a better future.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, convened the assembly to
pave the way for free elections next year.
	   The assembly unanimously passed 11 decrees designed to reshape
Indonesia's political system through parliamentary elections in May
or June next year.
	   After a long debate it also voted in a decree calling for the
gradual reduction in representation of the military in Parliament.
Students and assembly delegates from an Islamic party had demanded
that the military be banned from politics altogether.
	   The assembly agreed to name Suharto in a decree authorizing an
investigation into past corruption, but it failed to try him for
alleged corruption and human rights abuses, as protesters have
demanded.
	   Suharto has denied allegations that he used his power to stash
billions of dollars in foreign banks. But many blame him for
rampant inflation, unemployment and poverty that fuels widespread
discontent during the worst economic crisis in decades.
	   Violence erupted Friday at more than five points near the
legislature.
	   Mobs burned tires as baton-wielding soldiers and troops
dispersed an angry crowd on a major road.
	   Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and plastic
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several
students, some bleeding, were later taken out on stretches.
	   A morgue official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital, said two
bodies, both male students, had been brought from the university.
They had gunshot wounds to their chests.
	   In East Jakarta a rampaging mob beat a third man to death in a
street as soldiers looked on. Witnesses reported dozens of other
mobs attacks against individuals accused of being police informers.
	   Cipto Mungunkusomo Hospital received the bodies of one male
student and civilian security guard. Both had gunshot chest wounds,
a morgue attendant said.
	   Other hospitals reported a steady and bloody stream of injured.
	   Trouble broke out soon after weekly Islamic prayers ended.
Students marched from several campuses in the capital in defiance
of military warnings.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto called for calm and warned that
an estimated 30,000 police and troops deployed across the capital
would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student protests got
out of control again.
	   Foreign embassies in Indonesia warned their citizens of further
unrest.

Months later, World Cup glory still giving soccer a boost
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREAS EVAGORA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ For French soccer, the World Cup party isn't over.
	   Four months after France's stunning 3-0 victory over Brazil in
the World Cup final, soccer's popularity in France is at an
all-time high.
	   Figures released Friday by the French National League showed
that attendance for the first 13 rounds of the current French
season reached more than 2.3 million, compared to about 1.9 million
for the same period last season.
	   That represents an average attendance of 19,944 -- more than 23
percent higher than last season.
	   ``The main reason for the increase is the World Cup,'' Guy
Mislin, a French National League spokesman told The Associated
Press. ``A lot of people went to soccer for the first time during
the World Cup. They experienced a good atmosphere and comfort and
wanted to come back for more.''
	   ``Construction work on stadiums was also completed for the World
Cup, which increased the capacity for many teams,'' Mislin added.
	   Though it has long been France's No. 1 sport, soccer has never
attracted the passionate following that it does in many other
European countries.
	   But France's World Cup win sparked the sport's popularity.
	   Rising attendance has most benefited big-city clubs like
Bordeaux, Lyon and Marseille.
	   At Lyon -- host to six World Cup matches -- the early season
average attendance has been around 32,000, compared to 24,000 last
season.
	   ``France's success at the World Cup certainly generated more
interest in soccer and created a more convivial atmosphere in the
stadium,'' said Olivier Blanc, Lyon's director of communications.
	   ``Probably the most noticeable increase has been among women,''
Blanc said.
	   Indeed, many credit the World Cup with attracting women into
French soccer stadiums for the first time.
	   More than 9,000 exuberant women filled a specially-reserved
section of the Stade de France for the national team's match
against Andorra in October.
	   Mid-sized clubs that didn't host World Cup matches also say they
are continuing to benefit from extra interest.
	   ``The World Cup has helped improve all parts of the club, such
as attendance and merchandising,'' said Gerard Levaux, commercial
director at Nancy. ``Last year, we had 2,500 season ticket holders,
this season 4,300,'' he said.
	   The World Cup, Levaux believes, did much more to attract new
supporters than the club's promotion from the second division.
	   The optimistic mood in French soccer has been reflected on the
pitch as well as in the stands, with clubs showing their best
international form for many seasons.
	   Bordeaux, Lyon, Marseille and Monaco all qualified for the third
round of this season's UEFA Cup -- the first time that four French
teams have made it to that stage of a European tournament.
	   French soccer badly needs a boost.
	   Financially, French clubs remain the poor cousins of their
rivals in England, Germany, Italy and Spain.
	   A report by financial analysts Deloitte and Touche shows that
France's biggest club, Paris Saint-Germain, with revenues of around
300 million francs (dlrs 55 million), ranks only 22 on the list of
European clubs.
	   And since the landmark Bosman ruling, which introduced free
transfers for out-of-contract players, French clubs have found it
even tougher to prevent players from leaving the country to earn
bigger salaries abroad.
	   Still, rising attendance will solve only part of the financial
problem.
	   Increasingly, broadcasting rights, sponsorship and merchandising
revenues make up the major part of clubs' revenues, and in these
areas French clubs are well behind European rivals.
	   Last season, French first division clubs earned only dlrs 97
million from broadcast rights, according to Baskerville
Communications Ltd. a market research company in London.
	   That compares to dlrs 146 million in Germany, dlrs 180 million
in Spain, dlrs 233 million in Italy and dlrs 238 million in
England.

IMF announces Brazil economic package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with announcement &QL; 
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund announced
approval Friday of a long-expected dlrs 42 billion rescue package
for Brazil designed to stop global financial turmoil from spreading
to Latin America.
	   ``The Brazilian authorities and an IMF team have successfully
concluded negotiations on a strong three-year program of economic
and financial reform,'' IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus
said.
	   Camdessus said that as part of the agreement, Brazil committed
itself to reducing its dlrs 65 billion budget deficit.
	   ``The way is now open for the international community to provide
financial support to Brazil that will enhance market confidence in
the government's economic policies and help ensure the success of
the country's program,'' Camdessus said.
	   Camdessus said more than dlrs 41 billion would be available to
Brazil over the next three years, with dlrs 37 billion ready if
needed in the next three months. Camdessus said as part of the
package the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
would provide dlrs 4.5 billion each.
	   He said Brazil also would obtain funds from a large number of
industrial countries in North America, Europe and Asia totaling
about dlrs 14.5 billion. The largest contribution, dlrs 5 billion,
is expected to come from the United States.

EU says Russia formally requesting food aid; accepts delivery
</HEADLINE>
terms &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission said Friday
Russia has formally asked for European Union food aid of almost
half a billion dollars and accepts EU-set delivery terms to ensure
it reaches the needy.
	   Anticipating a formal request, the EU head office last Monday
proposed food sales worth 400 million European currency units (dlrs
480 million) to help Russians cope with a slumping economy and
disappointing harvests.
	   ``We got the letter (requesting food aid) this morning,'' said
EU spokeswoman Lousewies van der Laan. ``Russia accepts the EU
conditions for the distribution of the food.''
	   Russia has been hit hard by economic and financial problems and
the worst grain harvest in 40 years. Russian officials have said
emergency reserves will last only two to three weeks.
	   Last week, the United States announced it would provide Russia
with food aid worth dlrs 600 million.
	   The EU aid will include scores of thousands of tons of cereals,
meat and milk powder to be sold in Russia at market prices with the
proceeds going into a fund to finance social projects. The EU would
pay its farmers for the food delivered to Russia.
	   Russia will be held to strict conditions: it must provide
anti-fraud guarantees, it cannot re-export EU food and must ensure
the food reaches the needy.
	   The EU package will be finalized in the weeks. The first
shipments will not likely reach Russia until the new year when food
shortages are expected to become visible.
	   The EU stock of surplus grain is currently about 10 million
tons. In addition, it has some 500,000 tons of beef and 400,000
tons of rice in surplus stocks.

India restricts Zimbabwe to 196 for nine in Coca Cola final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Javagal Srinath took three
wickets including opener Grant Flower for 18 and India limited
Zimbabwe to 196 for nine in its 50 overs Friday in the final of the
Coca-Cola Trophy.
	   Opting to field after winning the toss, Indian bowlers wreaked
havoc with the top of Zimbabwe's order. Ajit Agarkar erased
Alistair Campbell for two on the seventh ball and Srinath claimed
Flower and Murray Goodwin (2) to drop Zimbabwe to 44 for three by
the 11th over.
	   The Indian spin trio of Anil Kumble, Nikhil Chopra and Sunil
Joshi then joined to leave Zimbabwe at 81 for six.
	   Kumble dismissed Andy Flower for 19. Off-spinner Chopra bowled
Neil Johnson after he had made 34 off 46 balls.
	   Eddo Brandes (33 off 46 balls) and Paul Strang (46 off 91 balls)
rescued Zimbabwe from complete collapse. The pair put on 58 in 83
balls for the eighth wicket, taking the score to 174.
	   Brandes hit a straight six off Kumble and two boundaries before
he miscalculated a delivery from part-time bowler Sachin Tendulkar
that shattered his stumps.
	   Strang, who hit three boundaries, was given leg before to
Srinath in the final over.
	   Kumble took two for 29 from 10 overs, while Srinath took three
for 40 in 10 overs.
	   India needed an average of four runs per over to win the final
of the dlrs 85,000 tournament.
	   The winner will earn the dlrs 40,000 first prize, while the
runner-up will get dlrs 30,000. Sri Lanka, which failed to qualify
for the finals, will go home with the remainder.

Polish national airline not ready for EU for at least four years
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish skies will not open for European
Union airlines until at least the beginning of 2003, which is when
Poland hopes to enter the common market, local media reported
Friday.
	   In EU membership talks that formally opened Tuesday, Poland will
have to ask for transition periods regarding the EU laws on air
carrier permits and allowing EU airlines to fly on domestic routes,
said the Gazeta Wyborcza daily citing Andrzej Grzelakowski, deputy
transport minister.
	   According to EU rules, an air carrier that has a permit to
operate in one EU country can operate in all member states.
	   But Polish national airline LOT finds it hard to fight the
competition of western airlines even on its home market. It badly
needs money to buy more planes to stay competitive.
	   LOT, the last central European carrier to remain entirely in
state hands, is slated for privatization in the first quarter of
1999. A sizable stake is to be sold to a strategic investor.
	   According to daily Rzeczpospolita, the government hopes to get a
better deal if it can get a long protection period for LOT. LOT
representatives want a five-year period beyond 2003, Rzeczpospolita
said.
	   Last year LOT carried 2.3 million passengers, but it was in the
red with losses of 110 million zlotys (about dlrs 31.4 million)
mainly due to payments for its new Boeing planes which replaced the
old Soviet-made IL and TU planes it has been using until the early
1990s.

ABB warns managers to obey laws worldwide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ In the wake of two legal mishaps, the
chief executive of Swiss-Swedish electronics giant Asea Brown
Boveri has warned managers to obey the law in business dealings, a
spokesman confirmed Friday.
	   ``Serious problems of compliance with group directives and trade
legislation have recently surfaced in our group, particularly in
the areas of insider trading and antitrust violations,'' chief
executive Goeran Lindahl said in an internal memorandum.
	   ABB is appealing a fine of some dlrs 84 million in a European
Union case against it and other companies who allegedly conspired
to maintain a cartel in district heating pipes.
	   Two ABB employees left the company in connection with an insider
trading case involving its announcement last month of a dlrs 1.5
billion takeover of the Netherlands' Elsag Bailey Process
Automation.
	   ``These cases take a toll on our worldwide image and brand name,
and on the loyalty of our customers and employees,'' Lindahl said.
	   He warned his managers to strictly enforce compliance with
company rules against violating laws ``wherever ABB is conducting
its business.''
	   The company has renamed its corporate staff legal affairs office
to include the word compliance, Lindahl added in the memo, which
was also signed by the ABB's legal chief.
	   ABB employs some 216,000 people worldwide

Prime minister: Danes to vote on EU currency at earliest in 2001
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Prime Minister Poul Nyrup Rasmussen
says Denmark likely won't put the question of joining the European
Union's joint currency system to a referendum until at least 2001,
a report said Friday.
	   The unified currency, the euro, is to be launched Jan. 1, but
Denmark is one of four countries staying out of the system.
	   After Danish voters in 1992 turned down the Maastricht treaty
that established the system, Denmark won several opt-out clauses
from the treaty, after which voters approved it.
	   Danish voters traditionally have been only lukewarm supporters
of the EU and although most politicians support the unified
currency, they have been wary about bringing the issue to voters
again.
	   Boersens Nyhedsmagasin, a leading economic publication, reported
Friday that Nyrup Rasmussen was asked whether it was fair to
conclude that a referendum on the unified currency would not take
place before 2001 and said ``Yes.''
	   ``I don't believe you can get the Danes to commit themselves to
a (monetary) construction which we, in advance, don't known the
practical side of,'' Nyrup Rasmussen was quoted as saying.
	   Nyrup Rasmussen could not be reached for comment on Friday.

U.S. commerce secretary promotes business on first Lebanon visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new Daley quotes, signing of deal; ADDS photo

 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on
Friday urged American businesses to get more involved in the
multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction of Lebanon, a country
once synonymous with hijackings and hostage-taking.
	   ``The message I brought is that the United States is back and
wants to do more business in Lebanon,'' Daley said after a meeting
with President-elect Emile Lahoud on his one-day visit.
	   U.S. companies have been virtually shut out of major
reconstruction projects after the 1975-90 civil war because of a
decade-old U.S. government travel ban that was lifted last year.
Most contracts went to European and Asian companies.
	   But private American business involvement in the Lebanese
free-market economy has surged in the last few years. The United
States is Lebanon's second-biggest trading partner, selling goods
worth dlrs 550 million and importing dlrs 80 million worth of
merchandise.
	   In a speech to U.S. and Lebanese business executives, Daley
delivered a veiled criticism of the way contracts have been awarded
in the dlrs 13 billion program of reconstruction.
	   ``When American companies bid on projects, whether they win or
lose, they expect the bidding process to be transparent and to be
fair and open,'' he said.
	   Lebanese politicians have frequently leveled charges of
kickbacks and underhand tactics in the awarding of contracts.
	   Daley is the first senior American trade official to visit
Lebanon. As with previous trips by senior U.S. government
officials, security was tight. Instead of landing at Beirut's
gleaming new international airport, Daley took a U.S. military
helicopter from Cyprus to the fortified U.S. Embassy compound north
of Beirut.
	   This is the route taken by U.S. diplomats for more than a
decade. The United States banned travel to Lebanon after a series
of bombings of military and diplomatic compounds in the 1980s that
killed about 270 Americans, including 241 troops. Seventeen
Americans were kidnapped and held hostage during that period.
	   The State Department replaced the ban in July 1997 with an
advisory warning Americans to stay away from Lebanon as it remains
dangerous. American aircraft have been forbidden to land at Beirut
airport since the TWA hijacking in 1985.
	   Asked whether the embargo of Beirut airport was not giving a
negative signal to potential American investors, Daley told The
Associated Press: ``We are trying to give a positive signal. At the
same time, there are difficulties and they have to be acknowledged
and we have to be frank about them.''
	   He said there had been a ``tremendous improvement'' in security
in Lebanon.
	   Among the immediate fruits of Daley's visit was a dlrs 7.5
million deal signed Friday between Continental Electronics Corp. of
Dallas, Texas, and the Lebanese government to build a new radio
station. The U.S. Export-Import Bank will finance the contract.
	   Daley welcomed a parliamentary committee's approval Thursday of
an intellectual property bill on piracy of computer software. The
bill, long demanded by the United States, now goes to the full
legislature for a vote.
	   Daley was scheduled to fly to Egypt late Friday. He will be
visiting Israel and the Palestinian areas on his tour, which aims
to promote regional economic cooperation. He has already been to
Jordan.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Delivery of American Patriot missiles to
Israel, for defense against a possible Iraqi missile attack, is
being delayed, a senior Israeli official said Friday.
	   The United States and Israel decided on the delay to avoid
involving Israel in the current crisis between Washington and
Baghdad, said David Ivri, an adviser to the Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
	   ``If Patriots are brought here, it means we are once again a
little more involved in the conflict, when one of our aims is not
to be involved in the conflict,'' Ivri told Channel 2 television.
	   Ivri said if the situation deteriorates the Patriots may be
brought.
	   President Clinton informed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Thursday that in intended to send some Patriot batteries
to Israel, Israeli media reported.
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Friday that Israel ``will
know how to defend its people'' against a possible Iraqi attack but
that the Jewish state does not consider itself a player in the
confrontation between Iraq and the United States.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he hoped for a
``peaceful solution through the terms of Kofi Annan,'' the U.N.
secretary general who cut short a trip to Africa to deal with the
crisis. Arafat has said that a U.S. strike against Iraq could
hinder the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, gas mask distribution centers shut down
Friday afternoon for the Jewish Sabbath. The centers had opened
Thursday to provide gas masks to about 25 percent of Israelis who
don't have the protective gear.
	   Israeli began distributing gas masks to its citizens in the
months leading to the 1991 Gulf War when Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein threatened to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
	   During the war, Saddam fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional
warheads at Israel in an attempt to draw Israel into the fighting
and break up the Arab coalition against him. Patriot anti-aircraft
missiles sent to Israel at the time by the United States, proved
ineffectual against the Scuds.
	   At the request of the United States, Israel did not retaliate at
the time against Iraq.
	   Asked Friday whether Israel would strike back this time, if
attacked by Iraq, Sharon said: ``I think it's well-known in the
Middle East, that Israel will know how to defend its people,''
Sharon said.
	   He downplayed the threat to Israel.
	   ``I think we have have to continue to lead our normal lives. I
would like to encourage tourists to come. As you will see, it is
beautiful here, wonderful weather. Life is normal,'' Sharon said.
	   However, some did not take Sharon's word.
	   The European Under-18 Championships qualifying soccer tournament
scheduled to take place in Israel next week was canceled because of
security concerns. England, Israel, Andorra and Spain were to
compete in the tournament.
	   UEFA canceled the events Thursday after the English team said it
would not attend because of the tense situation in the Gulf, UEFA
spokesman Massimo Gonnella said in Geneva.

UN commissioner urges more respect for human rights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The U.N. high commissioner for human rights on
Friday urged nations to work together to promote democracy and
development.
	   ``Society has undergone major changes,'' said Mary Robinson in a
speech here to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the international
declaration on human rights. ``But many nations have also
experienced ethical and moral vacuums.''
	   The speech was given at the Pontifical Lateran University.
	   ``Peace cannot exist without dialogue between religions,'' said
Robinson. ``That's why we need to promote global alliances between
people with different cultures and religions.''

The Full Monarchy: Charles keeps clothes on at birthday tribute
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ The difference between ``The Full
Monty'' and ``The Full Monarchy'' is elemental: Prince Charles
keeps his clothes on.
	   But the heir to the throne was a hit nonetheless Friday at a
50th birthday party staged in his honor featuring cast members from
the hit film about unemployed Sheffield men who turn to stripping.
	   The icing on a birthday cake in the shape of a security guard's
cap proclaimed ``The Full Monarchy.''
	   Taking a lead from Hugo Speer, who played ``Lunchbox'' in the
1997 film, Charles quickly mastered the steps and joined in
recreating the scene where the men start dancing while waiting in
line at a job center.
	   ``I've even been given a bit of choreography on how to do things
in a queue,'' Charles said.
	   ``He's a cinch _ a natural,'' Speer said of the prince. ``He
asked for a few tips but didn't need them. It looks like he's been
practicing in his bedroom.''
	   During an earlier visit to a drug rehabilitation center in
Sheffield, Charles encountered a warm admirer in 78-year-old Elaine
Glaza.
	   ``Can I kiss you?'' she asked.
	   ``Absolutely,'' said Charles, and some bystanders shouted ``Go
on, Charlie!'' Mrs. Glaza also gave him cufflinks and a carnation.
	   Charles, who reaches the half-century mark Saturday, began his
birthday celebrations Thursday night with a private party at
Hampton Court Palace. On Friday night, Queen Elizabeth II planned a
party at Buckingham Palace.
	   Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' longtime love, was among the
guests Thursday, but the event produced no pictures of the two of
them together. She is hosting a party for Charles on Saturday at
Highgrove, his country home.

Spanish TV director steps down as part of gov't move to center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government Friday announced the
resignation of the head of Spain's state-run radio and television
company RTVE, a move newspapers said was part of conservative Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar efforts to give his government a more
moderate image.
	   Government spokesman Josep Pique said outgoing director Fernando
Lopez-Amor, appointed in February 1997, would be replaced by Pio
Cabanillas in the coming days. Lopez Amor was reported to be
currently on holidays in Costa Rica.
	   Spanish newspapers, including the leading daily El Pais and the
Barcelona-based La Vanguardia, said the move was part of Aznar's
attempts to shed his government's conservative right-wing image for
a more moderate centrist one.
	   El Pais said Aznar blames his government's inability to push
ahead of the opposition Socialist party in opinion surveys on the
image of some of his associates. The Popular Party took office in
May 1996 ending nearly 14 years of Socialist rule.
	   Earlier this year Aznar appointed Pique as government spokesman
replacing long-term associate Miguel Angel Rodriguez who was
associated with the more conservative and rightist side of the
Popular Party. In recent months, deputy Prime Minister Francisco
Alvarez Cascos has also been edged to the sidelines.
	   Cabanillas was formerly a board member of the Prisa group, one
of Spain's leading publishing and television groups which runs El
Pais and the Cadena SER, the country's leading radio chain.
	   Under Lopez-Amor, RTVE cemented its position as No.1 in the
audience ratings over Spain's three private television companies.
He has, however, been accused of allowing the company become a mere
propaganda outlet for Aznar's government as well as companies and
personalities close to the premier.
	   RTVE's debt is expected to reach 600 billion pesetas (dlrs 4.2
million) by the end of this year and news reports said the European
Union is pushing for the Madrid government to find a solution.
	   There was no official reason given for the director change but
Pique said it was part a move to make RTVE more efficient.

Decline in Kenyan coffee industry affects quality at market
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI (Dow Jones) _ Kenya's coffee industry is in decline
because of an incomplete and flawed process of sector
liberalization, a World Bank official said Friday, and it is
affecting the quality of the product.
	   ``It is clear from talking to the international buyers of
Kenya's coffee that confidence in Kenya coffee in the international
market is waning,'' said Christine Cornelius, a country
representative in Kenya.
	   Cornelius said the government-controlled Coffee Board of Kenya
still plays the major commercial role in the industry and at the
same time plays referee.
	   ``Currently, the CBK mandate is to be responsible for the
promotion of the coffee industry, including the marketing and
processing of the coffee as well as licensing and control
procedures of the coffee and research connected with the
industry,'' she said.
	   She spoke to 20 legislators from coffee-growing areas who are
holding a two-day conference in Nyeri, 120 kilometers (75 miles)
north of Nairobi, to discuss ways to improve the coffee industry,
	   Cornelius said the board's commercial functions should be
separated to allow for their proper management in a liberalized
environment.
	   She said it is the World Bank's opinion that a separate body
with a strong government presence should be formed to be in charge
of licensing and planters' factories.
	   She said there is urgent need to redefine role and
responsibilities of the CBK in order to save the industry from
collapse.
	   The coffee industry, which used to rank second in foreign
exchange earnings behind tea, has been overtaken by tourism and
horticulture.

CNBC Sports announces golf package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Golf's five major tours will be telecast worldwide
each weekend under a deal announced Friday by CNBC Sports, a joint
venture between American broadcaster NBC and the London-based
sports marketing company Parallel Sport.
	   The golf coverage will be carried on CNBC, NBC's satellite
business channel. In addition to golf, the weekly 12 hours of
sports programing will also include tennis, sailing and Alpine
skiing.
	   CNBC, the business channel launched in 1989, has been offering
spot sports coverage, but this will be its first venture into
regular coverage with eight hours each weekend dedicated to golf
tournaments.
	   Coverage begins in February and will include the PGA tours in
North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and South Africa.
	   ``The PGA is excited about the new partnership and it will offer
us expanded in both Europe and Asia,'' said U.S. PGA Commissioner
Timothy Finchem.
	   Although the coverage will be obtainable anywhere in the world
with a satellite dish, it's biggest impact is expected in Europe
and Asia. Coverage will be in English.
	   Financial terms of the ``long-term'' deal were not disclosed.

Ukraine to eliminate first strategic bomber
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ U.S. Senator Richard Lugar will witness the
destruction of the first of several dozen strategic bombers Ukraine
is to eliminate under a nuclear disarmament program he spearheaded,
officials said Friday.
	   Lugar, a Republican from Indiana, is arriving in Ukraine on
Sunday. Accompanied by Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan
and Republican Senator Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Lugar will
watch Ukrainian officials destroy a Tu-160 bomber at the Pryluky
air base in northeast Ukraine on Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev
said.
	   Ukraine inherited the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal with
the 1991 Soviet collapse, including 19 Tu-160s and 25 Tu-95 MC
bombers. The long-range planes, designed to carry guided missiles
with nuclear warheads, are based at two airfields in Kiev and
Chernihiv regions.
	   The United States has contributed dlrs 500 million to help
Ukraine dismantle the bombers and other nuclear weapons
infrastructure under the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program
initiated by Lugar and then-Senator Sam Nunn in 1991.
	   American and Ukrainian defense officials are still deciding how
to destroy the bombers, but they plan to keep parts of the planes
intact, said John Connell of the U.S. Defense Threat Reduction
Agency.
	   The destruction will allow a ``maximum reuse of the aircraft for
the national economy,'' including recovery of its engine and
high-quality pieces of steel, Connell told a news conference.
	   Ukraine has unsuccessfully tried to sell the planes to Russia
for years, and finally decided last April to destroy them.
	   The Nunn-Lugar program provides for American technical
assistance to the former Soviet Union to eliminate weapons of mass
destruction and account for weapons material.
	   Ukraine has surrendered all its nuclear warheads to Russia and
pledged to remain nuclear-free. Ukraine has destroyed all 130 of
its SS-19 nuclear missile silos, and plans to finish dismantling
the SS-19 missiles by next January.
	   It also eliminated the first of 46 SS-24 missile silos this
summer, and is now preparing to start dismantling the missiles
themselves, U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Steven Pifer said.
	   The elimination of all strategic bombers and SS-24 ballistic
missiles is scheduled to be finished by December 2001. That will
complete Ukraine's obligations under the Nunn-Lugar program.

Encyclopedia lists old and new workplace hazards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Labor Organization has
chronicled details of thousands of workplace hazards, showing that
high-tech hazards have added to traditional threats like accident
and infectious disease for tens of millions of workers.
	   The Encyclopedia of Occupational Health and Safety contains more
than 4,000 pages about risks in the workplace and how to combat
them.
	   Many of the dangers laid out in the encyclopedia, the fourth
edition published by the U.N. labor agency, are the same as in the
first edition in 1930.
	   For instance, a 1993 fire that killed 188 workers at a toy
factory in Thailand was similar to a 1911 New York clothing factory
fire which previously held the record for the highest number of
fatalities with 146 dead.
	   Both factories had inadequate prevention, protection and escape
systems. And both hadn't given workers enough fire safety training.
	   ``I was struck by the sense of history repeating itself,''
Jeanne Mager Stellman, a Colombia University professor and editor
of the encyclopedia, said in an interview Friday.
	   ``We've learned much. But we've expanded the hazards and the old
ones are still there.''
	   Respiratory diseases like asthma cause the most diseases and
injuries worldwide, according to the encyclopedia.
	   Infectious diseases ranging from hepatitis to tuberculosis are
also high on the list.
	   Pesticide poisoning is the cause of hundreds of thousands of
deaths in the developing world where untrained workers use
chemicals that have been banned in industrialized countries,
according to Mager Stellman.
	   But even rich countries still use pesticides that are known to
pose a health risk, like a herbicide called 2,4,5-T used in rice
fields in the United States, the ILO says.
	   In industrialized countries repetitive strain injury resulting
from intensive work with computers is becoming a major cause of
disability,'' said Mager Stellman. She said in the United States in
1995 31,457 workers received compensation for carpal tunnel
syndrome _ a painful condition of the wrist. More than 70 percent
were women.
	   ``As we have more and more automated work places, the number of
women with these kind of injuries is growing dramatically,'' said
Mager Stellman.
	   Other ``new'' hazards range from nuclear plant accidents to
chemical processes used to make semiconductors.
	   Mager Stellman said the workplace had become much safer for the
vast majority of people in developed countries thanks to education,
training, legal protection, better nutrition and health care.
	   But in developing countries, many workers had no options or
education and faced similar health hazards prevalent at the time of
the ILO's first encyclopedia in 1930.
	   The encyclopedia is aimed at management, unions, regulatory
authorities and health professionals. It also comes in CD-ROM
format.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Love her or loathe her, she is
impossible to ignore.
	   From taking on the tobacco industry to importing Cuban doctors,
Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, South Africa's first black Minister of Health,
is often at the center of government controversies.
	   On Thursday she notched her latest victory when the upper house
of Parliament gave final approval to one of the world's toughest
anti-smoking laws, which bans lighting up in public places and all
tobacco advertising. It awaits President Nelson Mandela's approval.
	   In some ways she typifies the leadership of the governing
African National Congress as it gears up for national elections
next year, which it likely will sweep.
	   Transformed from liberation fighter to government minister, Zuma
and her colleagues still display the combative political style that
marked the struggle for survival under the onslaught of apartheid.
	   Showing no fear of tackling huge global concerns, like the
prices charged for drugs by pharmaceutical firms, Zuma has pressed
on with her health reforms in spite of fierce criticism from her
opponents.
	   Zuma summed up her own attitude during a parliamentary debate
earlier this year when she lambasted opposition lawmakers for
demonizing her and insisted she would not ``somehow disappear.''
	   ``Forget about the person and look at the issues,'' she snapped.
	   To critics she is the ``nanny of the nation,'' an interfering,
power-hungry busybody who wants to ban smoking in public and whose
mistake prone department squanders millions of rand (dollars).
	   For her defenders, Zuma, 49, is the champion of the poor who
overhauled a racist health system and brought basic care to
millions of blacks ignored during apartheid.
	   Change has come quickly in her four years at the helm since
all-race elections in 1994 ended apartheid.
	   Within months of taking office, she made primary health care
free for pregnant women and children under six. By 1996 it was free
for all South Africans.
	   Shifting resources from wealthy hospitals mainly serving whites,
Zuma launched a campaign to build clinics in poor rural areas. By
the end of 1997 more than 350 had been built, compared to 17 in the
last year of white rule.
	   ``We have brought health care into parts of the country that
never had it before,'' said Zuma's spokesman Vincent Hlongwane.
	   Born in KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma was the oldest child in a family of
eight headed by a primary school teacher. She won a place at
medical school, but left the country to join the ANC in exile and
finished her degree in Britain.
	   From the start Zuma hit the headlines after sponsoring an AIDS
awareness musical that cost one-fifth of the government's AIDS
budget and was shut down due to mishandling the tender for the
lavish production.
	   On Friday, the scandal came back to haunt Zuma when a
government-mandated corruption commission started civil proceedings
to recover 10 million rand (dlrs 1.8 million) from Zuma and other
health officials in connection with the production.
	   True to form the government backed Zuma to the hilt. Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki's office defended her role and said it had
full confidence in her.
	   But there have been other incidents too, including Zuma's
backing of anti-AIDS drug Virodene, which contains a potentially
cancerous industrial solvent.

Danish bank appears set to win race to take over Norwegian lender
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Denmark's largest bank, Den Danske Bank,
appeared set to win a Scandinavian bidding duel with Swedish rival
Svenska Handelsbanken over Norway's Fokus Bank ASA.
	   The board of Fokus, Norway's third largest commercial lender,
late Thursday recommended that its stockholders accept a takeover
offer from Den Danske Bank of 80 kroner (dlrs 10.67) per share,
despite a matching a bid from Svenska Handelsbanken, the Nordic
countries' largest lending institution.
	   The Fokus board recommended the Danish bid because Den Danske
Bank promised to continue operating Fokus as an independent lending
institution based in the city of Trondheim.
	   Conditions of the bid, worth 5.7 billion kroner (dlrs 760
million), include 90 percent of Fokus' shareholders accepting the
offer by Dec. 4 and Norwegian government approval.
	   ``This is a very good price,'' said Fokus board chairman Stein
Holst Annexstad. But the Fokus board did not exclude the
possibility of higher bids, which would be considered.
	   Svenska Handelsbanken on Friday announced that it was not
increase its offer.
	   Fokus has 70 branch offices, about 1,000 employees and 39
billion kroner (dlrs 5.2 billion) in assets.

German high court refuses to block Turkish boy's deportation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS boy could return to Germany if he wins original lawsuit,
still pending &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany's highest court refused Friday
to block Bavaria's attempts to deport a 14-year-old Turkish
juvenile delinquent born and raised in Germany.
	   Bavarian officials said they would put Muhlis Ari, known in the
German media as ``Mehmet,'' on a plane to Turkey on Saturday.
	   ``We'll now act without delay and prepare the deportation of
Mehmet,'' said Bavarian Interior Minister Gunther Beckstein. He
said problems with the boy's lack of a valid passport had been
resolved.
	   Critics, meanwhile, renewed their attacks on Bavaria's ruling
conservatives, accusing them of shirking their responsibility to
the boy by deporting him rather than helping him.
	   ``The judges' decision ... may be legally correct, but it is
regrettable as far as promoting a policy of integration'' of
foreigners,'' said Cem Ozdemir, domestic policy spokesman for the
Greens party.
	   ``It will be the new (federal) government's task to solve the
problems of youth crime where they develop _ in our society _ and
not to export them through deportations.''
	   The Mehmet case made headlines this summer when Bavarian
officials sought to deport not only the boy, but also his parents,
who have lived and worked in Munich for 30 years.
	   Although the parents had never been in trouble with the law,
they were accused of endangering public safety by failing to raise
their son properly.
	   Courts have blocked the deportation of the parents. But the
entire case became an election-year issue, with liberals accusing
the ruling conservatives of using a family tragedy to show they
were cracking down on ``criminal foreigners.''
	   After a quick, abbreviated trial, Bavaria's highest court last
month upheld the state's decision to deny Ari a new residency
permit because of a string of violent offenses, thus clearing the
way for a deportation. His lawyer had asked the Constitutional
Court to block it.
	   But the high court ruled unanimously Friday that arguments that
the boy's rights were being violated were inadmissible. It said his
lawyer should have challenged the immediate implementation of the
deportation order in a lower court as well.
	   It also noted that Ari could return to Germany if he wins his
lawsuit seeking to compel Munich officials to renew his residency
permit. That appeal has yet to have a full trial, but the court
said the case could continue even with Ari in Turkey.

Graham returns to Highbury with arch rivals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ George Graham's record in north London derby
matches between Arsenal and Tottenham stands at eight wins, five
ties, four losses _ although he's only ever seen the series from
one perspective.
	   The Arsenal versus Tottenham clash at Highbury on Saturday has
all the ingredients of a classic _ revenge, high drama and
intrigue.
	   Graham, a hero at Highbury during an unsurpassed management
stint in the 1980s and '90s, returns to his old ground as manager
of the arch-enemy _ Spurs _ for the first time.
	   The stakes are always high when Arsenal and Tottenham meet.
	   But for Graham, who was sacked by the Arsenal board in 1995
after being accused of financial wrong-doing in a player transfer,
the stakes are even higher.
	   He has a point to prove to the Arsenal board and the match is
the perfect vehicle.
	   After serving a one-year ban from soccer over the transfer
fiasco, Graham returned to manage Leeds for two years until he
moved back to London in September as Christian Gross' replacement
at Spurs.
	   The Gunners are reigning FA Cup and League double titlists and
are currently No. 2 in the league standings, while Tottenham
struggled against relegation last season and have not been far from
consistent this season.
	   But form will count for nothing on Saturday, with both teams
playing to win.
	   In the 122 league matches contested between the Gunners and the
Spurs, Arsenal leads the series 48-44.
	   Arsenal's record is better at Highbury, with 28 wins, 16 ties
and 17 losses in 61 league matches with Tottenham.
	   Veteran Arsenal defender Tony Adams is one of the few survivors
from Graham's era at the club.
	   The England stalwart was under an injury cloud after missing
five recent matches with back trouble but made sure he was fit for
the crucial derby match.
	   Adams is the Arsenal captain and will only entertain thoughts of
a Gunners win but he has enough respect for Graham to know the
match will be one of the toughest of the season.
	   ``I love George...I think he is a great manager,'' Adams said.
``I think George felt angry and bitter about the way things turned
out at Arsenal. He thought he should have been a hero rather than a
figure who left in disgrace.''
	   Paul Merson, another of Graham's former charges at Arsenal who
now plays for Aston Villa, said Gunners fans still regarded Graham
as a hero but would not forgive him for going to Tottenham.
	   ``In their eyes, he couldn't have gone to a worse place. I think
he'll be given a rough ride,'' he said.
	   Arsenal's only injury concern is star striker Dennis Bergkamp,
who was Friday rated by Wenger as only a 40 percent chance for the
match.
	   Spurs have some injury concerns going into the match. David
Ginola has not trained since he injured a calf in Spurs league cup
win over Liverpool on Tuesday and Les Ferdinand is expected to be
ruled out for another week.

Yugoslav official rules out talks with Kosovo guerrillas
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs: UPDATES with Yugoslav soldier reported killed; NATO
protection force approved.
 &UR; By ELENA BECATOROS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Yugoslav official on Friday
ruled out involving separatist Albanian guerrillas in peace plans
for Kosovo but urged the resumption of talks with more moderate
ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   A statement issued by Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic and carried by
the Tanjug news agency excluded participation of the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army in the peace process, saying ``there is no
place for extremists, terrorism, abductions, killings, armed
attacks.''
	   Alluding to the Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb
police forces from Kosovo, he said: ``An agreement respected only
by one side stands no chance.''
	   At talks in Belgrade with European Union envoy Wolfgang
Petritsch, Lilic said authorities are abiding by the agreement,
meant to set up a deal designed to restore autonomy to Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy to the October
agreement, it says it is respecting a de-facto cease fire it
created and responding only when attacked. Authorities claim the
guerrillas are provoking fights, hoping for a massive response
which will revive the threat of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav
targets.
	   Armed Serb civilians swapped hostages with ethnic Albanian
guerrillas on Friday, defusing a standoff. But tensions were fed by
reports that Serb police shot and killed an ethnic Albanian.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot
throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
Members of a still-forming 2,000-strong team meant to monitor the
October agreement mediated in the releases.
	   In Brussels Friday, NATO ambassadors approved plans Friday for a
French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand ready to
rescue the unarmed civilian ``ground verifiers'' in Kosovo should
they come under threat.
	   The NATO ``extraction force,'' called Joint Guarantor, will be
on standby in Macedonia and prepared to rescue any of the civilian
verifiers that might find themselves under attack or in a
threatening situation.
	   Two killings, reported Friday, continued to fuel Kosovo
tensions.
	   A crew for Associated Press Television News said a Yugoslav
soldier was killed on the road connecting Pristina and Prizren and
two others were wounded.
	   Though details were unclear, the crew said they had heard bursts
of gunfire coming from the region, between Suva Reka and Stimlje
villages. Traffic was backed up in the area. The APTN crew saw two
tanks and several trucks full of soldiers in the vicinity.
	   Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness
said Serb police opened fire on a group of ethnic Albanian men and
children, killing one of the men and injuring another. The Kosovo
Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, also carried
the report.
	   According to Tafil Kryeziu, six police pulled up in an unmarked
car Thursday and opened fire on the group. The children fled
unharmed, but one man was killed and another wounded in the arm,
said the witnesses, identifying both victims by name.
	   Journalists visiting Mlecane Friday saw two pools of blood amid
15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident reportedly
took place. Male villagers, who only recently returned to the homes
they left earlier, said all the women and children had fled again.
	   ``We aren't normal folks anymore. Whenever we see a car, we run
away because we're afraid,'' said Ismajl Gashi, 40.
	   The continued shootings have chipped away at hopes for a
solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and Albanians, ushered
in by an Oct. 12 agreement.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province has left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made
refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told
Serbs _ a less than 10 percent minority in the province _ they had
nothing to fear from the October agreement,
	   ``All Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told
reporters.

Newspaper fails to publish for second day in one week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ For the second time in a week, a
daily newspaper that says it is the victim of sabotage failed to
publish on time Friday morning.
	   The San Juan Star, the island's only English-language daily
newspaper was not delivered to subscribers Friday. Its Sunday
edition did not come out on time either, and publisher Gerry Angulo
blamed saboteurs who damaged pressroom equipment.
	   The newspaper recently laid off about 30 employees, many of them
translators for the Spanish-language edition of the newspaper.
	   In the past year, Angulo has expanded the business from the
single, English-language paper by adding a Spanish version, an
afternoon edition and three regional editions, all in Spanish.
	   A new press has been purchased to keep up with the expansion but
is not yet installed.

Man accused of Kremlin car bombing faces charges
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian man who blew up his car just outside the
Kremlin gates, badly wounding three guards, has been put in prison
on charges of terrorism, officials said Friday.
	   Ivan Orlov, 65, suffered only minor scratches when he drove his
car across Red Square, jumped out and detonated a bomb just outside
the Kremlin's Spassky Gate last week.
	   He spent several days at a hospital before being transferred to
Moscow's Lefortovo prison on terrorism charges, the Federal
Security Service (FSB) said in a statement carried by Russian news
agencies. The FSB is the main successor to the Soviet KGB.
	   If convicted, Orlov faces 10 to 20 years in prison, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   The FSB report didn't elaborate on Orlov's condition. A
psychiatrist who examined him at a hospital after the attack on
Nov. 4 issued a preliminary diagnosis of schizophrenia.
	   The Kremlin guards wounded in the attack have remained at a
hospital and are now in stable condition, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said Friday.
	   Orlov worked for the magazine Russian Pravda, which carried
anti-Semitic and nationalist articles. Its editor said after the
attack that Orlov ``hated President Boris Yeltsin because Yeltsin's
policy had driven him to despair.''
	   Yeltsin's office is inside the Kremlin walls, but the president
was vacationing at a Black Sea resort at the time of the attack.
	   Before the attack, Orlov bought a piece of land at a cemetery at
his hometown of Podolsk just outside Moscow and installed a
gravestone with his name and picture. He also left a letter leaving
all his belongings to the local Communist Party branch.

Turkey's ailing government vows to stay on power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Turkey's coalition government vowed to
stay in power on Friday in defiance of no-confidence motions,
including one brought by an ally.
	   ``Turkey has definitely no patience for a power vacuum,'' Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz said.
	   Yilmaz made his comments while describing the capture in Rome on
Thursday of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, who has been
waging a guerrilla war against Ankara for autonomy in the
southeast, as a great success for his government.
	   Yilmaz' 16-month old minority government moved toward collapse
Thursday when a key ally lodged a no-confidence motion against him,
joining two opposition parties which already filed similar motions.
	   The motions, expected to come to the floor of parliament in two
weeks, accuse Yilmaz of abusing his power and being linked to
organized crime.
	   While one of the coalition partners of Yilmaz, Democratic Turkey
Party, debated withdrawing its support, another one led, by Deputy
Premier Bulent Ecevit, supported Yilmaz.
	   ``My conscience is peaceful,'' said Ecevit, leader of the
Democratic Left Party. ``We have definitely no decision to withdraw
from the government.''
	   But with the pivotal Republican's People Party turning against
Yilmaz, the government has little hope of survival.
	   The crisis began Tuesday when a businessman linked to mobsters
claimed Yilmaz rigged the privatization of a state-run bank in his
favor. Yilmaz, leader of the center-right Motherland Party, denied
any wrongdoing.
	   Three governments have collapsed since the Islamic party won the
1995 elections. Early elections are now planned for April.

FA says it would consider non-Englishman as English coach
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ The Football Association says it
would consider appointing a non-Englishman as coach of the national
soccer team when Glenn Hoddle's term ends.
	   Noel White, chairman of the FA's international selection
committee, said the appointment would be made purely on the basis
of track record instead of nationality.
	   England has never had a non-English national soccer coach.
	   White said that Hoddle has the full support of the FA and that
there is no search for a successor.
	   ``But I am at liberty to say that when the day comes to appoint
a successor to Glenn, the new chief coach will not necessarily be
English,'' White told the Manchester Evening News.
	   ``We will be looking to appoint the person with the best
managerial qualifications _ irrespective of his nationality.''
	   The newspaper suggested the FA's break with tradition could open
the way for Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, a Scot, to
succeed Hoddle.
	   But there has also been speculation that the FA could opt for a
non-British coach. Arsenal's French manager, Arsene Wenger, has
been mentioned as a potential candidate.
	   The FA recently granted Hoddle a contract extension to lead
England to the 2000 European Championships. Hoddle has been under
fire in the British media after recent poor results, with several
papers calling for him to be fired.

Nepal premier offers general amnesty to Maoist insurgents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Nepal's prime minister has offered a
general amnesty to the Maoist insurgents if they agree to surrender
their arms.
	   Speaking to his Nepali Congress Party workers Thursday night in
the western town of Pokhara, Girija Prasad Koirala urged the
guerrillas to give up their battle.
	   More than 350 people have been killed since the insurgency began
2 1/2 years ago. The guerrillas oppose Nepal's constitutional
monarchy and want Nepal to be turned into a republic.
	   Koirala said he also invited the guerrillas to join in the task
of nation-building. There was no immediate comment Friday from the
insurgents to Koirala's offer.

Fearing attack, some Iraqis line up at gas stations, prices up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Albright saying an attack can be averted if
Iraq reverses its decision in grafs 9-10. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-105

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations
and shoppers found some prices up in Baghdad's crowded markets
Friday amid widening fears that a U.S. military strike is imminent.
	   Still, the mood seemed defiant, reflecting the Iraqi
government's efforts to forge a united front against U.N. sanctions
imposed eight years ago after it invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her
four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   Preachers at Friday prayers in the nation's mosques called on
Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss of
support in its confrontation over U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   ``Do not be claws in the hands of Jews and Americans,'' he
added.
	   The United States and Britain have beefed up their military
strength in the Gulf and are threatening to attack Iraq to force it
to allow inspections by the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has destroyed those
weapons before the U.N. Security Council will lift the sanctions,
which have devastated the Iraqi economy by limiting the sale of oil
and other trade dealings.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Friday that an
attack can be averted if Iraq resumes cooperation with the
inspectors.
	   ``We are prepared to act,'' she said. ``That is our position. No
further warnings are needed.''
	   On Thursday, the foreign ministers of six Gulf governments,
Iraq's most vulnerable neighbors, along with Egypt and Syria called
for a diplomatic settlement. But they also warned in an unusually
strong statement that ``the Iraqi government is held responsible
for any consequences'' if it doesn't back down from its Aug. 5
decision.
	   Iraqi newspapers, however, ignored the statement, presenting a
far different picture to their readers.
	   ``There is condemnation of American threats on both Arab and
international levels,'' read the banner headline of Al-Thawra, the
paper published by President Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party.
	   Despite such rhetoric, there were scattered signs Friday that
the Iraqi people were beginning to take the threat of attack
seriously.
	   Long queues formed at gasoline stations as Iraqis filled their
tanks _ and jerrycans _ with fuel. At one station in the capital,
about 20 cars were lined up in front of each of its eight pumps.
	   Taxi drivers said they didn't want to be caught short if the
government imposes rationing, as it did during the last standoff
over weapons inspections in January and February. There also were
fears that the Americans might bomb refineries, reducing the
supply.
	   Western television crews and photographers were barred by
government ``minders'' from the gas stations, and reporters were
told they could not interview people in the queues.
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   At Baghdad's downtown Shorja market, merchants said some prices
had increased _ a barometer of anxiety here _ but that they mainly
for perishable goods such as eggs and fresh milk.
	   Merchants and shoppers said an attack was not their first
concern.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, as he
sold vegetables at Shorja. ``But it's not about any kind of
aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money to buy
food.''
	   Haidar Saad, 18, a soldier shopping for his family, said he
didn't expect any panic buying.
	   ``The markets have stayed open during past crises,'' he said.
``Anyway, most people live on their (government) rations and don't
have the money to stockpile food.''
	   The rations are distributed under the U.N.-approved oil-for-food
program, which allows Iraq to sell limited quantities of oil to buy
food, medicine and other necessities for its 22 million people.
	   U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said Friday that oil was being exported
normally and that ships carrying Vietnamese rice and Australian
wheat were being unloaded at the southern Iraqi port of Mina
al-Bakr.
	   Since Wednesday, the United Nations has pulled out of Iraq all
its weapons inspectors and a third of the 450 people working on
U.N. relief programs because of the threatened military strikes.

Police intervene to end 73-day protest by illegal immigrants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Police intervened Friday to end a 73-day sit-in by
illegal immigrants at a town hall east of Paris where they have
been demanding that the government reconsider their residency
requests.
	   Riot police and firefighters raided the town hall in
Limeil-Brevannes where 11 immigrants, from the west African country
of Mali, had been allowed to stage their protest by Socialist Mayor
Joseph Rossignol.
	   The protesters have refused to eat for 73 days, but have been
taking vitamins and sugar.
	   Friday's intervention was ordered by the local police chief, the
town hall press office said.
	   Immigrants and their supporters have staged marches, hunger
strikes, church sit-ins and other protests over the past months to
press France's leftist government to let thousands of mainly
African immigrants remain.
	   But after legalizing 76,000 people, the government rejected
residency requests for more than 64,000 others.
	   Some leftists have criticized Prime Minister Lionel Jospin as
being too tough on immigration, while the far-right National Front
has criticized him as being too soft. The Front blames immigrants
for high crime and unemployment.
	   Also Friday, demonstrators jumped onto train lines in northern
Paris at Charles de Gaulle airport to block a train in which an
Algerian illegal immigrant was being escorted out of the country.
	   The immigrant was being sent to Marseille where he was then to
take a ferry back to Algeria. Police clashed with the demonstrators
who threw a banner on the train lines saying, ``In favor of
welcoming and protecting Algerians.''
	   After the police intervened to disperse the protesters, the
train left for Marseille without further delay.

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - Russians world champions led the
opening two events Friday at the Nations Cup with Alexei Yagudin
showing juggling skills as well as skating.
	   Yagudin used a circus theme that included portions of juggling
motions while entering into jumps to leap into first in the men's
event after the short program.
	   Yagudin did all his elements cleanly -- including a high triple
axel-triple toe loop -- to score marks between 5.7 and 5.9 despite
being the first skater.
	   Another Russian, Alexander Abt, was second. Abt had a more
difficult routine that Yagudin but missed a triple axel-triple loop
slightly and two footed a quadruple attempt. Quads are now allowed
in the short program. which is one-third of the total mark.
	   Still he took second with Andreas Vlacenko of Germany third.
	   Russian ice dance world champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov made their season's debut and comfortably led after the
initial portion
	   In the compulsory dance, the Tango Romantica, they skated first
and scored mark mostly of 5.7 and 5.8 with a pair of 5.9s,
unusually high with the rest of the field to come.
	   Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz were in second but
were at least two-tenths behind on nearly every judge.
	   Third was the German couple of Kati Winkler and Rene Lohse.
	   The original dance to the waltz tempo is later Friday along with
the opening short program of the pairs event.
	   The men have their long program Saturday night and it will be
hard for Yagudin to better his performance at Skate America when he
did nine triple jumps -- one more than legal.
	   With three-time world champion Elvis Stojko of Canada still slow
in coming back from a groin injury, Yagudin looks to dominate the
season.
	   Yagudin is now coached by Tatiana Tarasova, who guided Ilia
Kulik and ice dancers Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov to Olympic
gold medals in Nagano, Japan.
	   The women's competition begins Saturday with Russians looking to
continue winning. European champion Maria Butyrskaya is the
favorite.
	   With Olympic champion Tara Lipinski leaving the eligible ranks
and world champion Michelle Kwan taking the year off from these
competitions the women's field is wide open this year.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Lalique Trophy in Paris next week.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Official: Ukraine to pay off gas debt to Russia by the end of 1998
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine hopes to pay off its dlrs 1 billion
gas debt to Russia by the end of the year with food, machines and
other goods, a top industry official said Friday.
	   Repayment of the mounting debt to Russia's gas monopoly Gazprom
became possible ``thanks to Russia's willingness to meet Ukraine
halfway,'' said Ihor Bakai, chairman of Ukraine's state oil and gas
giant Naftogaz Ukrainy.
	   Under a deal finalized earlier this month, Ukraine is to cover
half the debt with supplies of food products, and the other half
with farm machines and gas industry equipment.
	   Although the two countries have often wrangled over Ukraine's
gas debt in previous years, the latest debt repayment deal has
allowed Ukraine and Gazprom to significantly improve relations,
Bakai said.
	   ``We are now cooperating with Gazprom as partners that help each
other,'' Bakai was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   Gazprom is Russia's largest single taxpayer, and owes the
cash-strapped government huge amounts of back taxes. The company
says it cannot pay because former Soviet republics have failed to
pay their debts to Gazprom.
	   Last week, Ukraine and Russia reached a deal on 1999 gas
supplies, under which Ukraine is to receive 40 billion cubic meters
(1.4 trillion cubic feet) of gas as payment for transit of Russian
gas through its territory to Western Europe.
	   Ukraine, the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, needs about
80 billion cubic meters (2.8 trillion cubic feet) of gas annually,
of which only 18 billion cubic meters (630 billion cubic feet) is
domestically produced and the rest is imported, mostly from Russia.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Golf's five major tours will be telecast worldwide
each weekend under a deal announced Friday by CNBC Sports, a joint
venture between American broadcaster NBC and the London-based
sports marketing company Parallel Sport.
	   The golf coverage will be carried on CNBC, NBC's satellite
business channel. In addition to golf, the weekly 12 hours of
sports programing will also include tennis, sailing and Alpine
skiing.
	   CNBC, the business channel launched in 1989, has been offering
spot sports coverage, but this will be its first venture into
regular coverage with eight hours each weekend dedicated to golf
tournaments.
	   Coverage begins in January and will include the PGA tours in
North America, Europe, Asia, Australia and South Africa.
	   ``The PGA is excited about the new partnership and it will offer
us expanded in both Europe and Asia,'' said U.S. PGA Commissioner
Timothy Finchem.
	   Although the coverage will be obtainable anywhere in the world
with a satellite dish, it's biggest impact is expected in Europe
and Asia. Coverage will be in English.
	   Financial terms of the ``long-term'' deal were not disclosed.

Real Madrid chairman says club closer to deal with Liverpool's
</HEADLINE>
McManaman &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Liverpool manager

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chairman of reigning European champion
Real Madrid said Friday the club was closer to clinching attacking
Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman for a four-season contract.
	   ``Our positions have come closer, so much so that a satisfactory
resolution to the matter looks likely,'' Lorenzo Sanz told the
leading Spanish daily El Pais after talks with McManaman's agent
Colin Gordon on Thursday.
	   Previous negotiations this month had stumbled over Real Madrid's
opinion that the 26-year-old player was asking for too much, El
Pais said. The paper added that the latest talks indicated such
problems had been ironed out.
	   Sanz said Real was looking to sign McManaman for four seasons
with an option on a fifth. There were no details available
regarding the financial side of the contract.
	   McManaman's contract with Liverpool expires in June 1999. The
club is expected to offer him an attractive renewal deal. But Real
Madrid officials say the chances of the midfielder leaving have
increased because of difficulties at the struggling Premier league
side, exemplified Thursday by the resignation of co-manager Roy
Evans.
	   In addition, Madrid believes McManaman would favor a move to the
Spanish club as he has a bone to pick with Real's eternal rival FC
Barcelona who, in the last minute, pulled out of negotiations to
sign him two seasons ago preferring to do a deal with Brazilian
Rivaldo.
	   Gerard Houllier, who assume sole control as Liverpool manager
after Evans' departure, said Friday there is little the Reds can do
to stop McManaman leaving if he wants to.
	   ``I will be sorry if he goes because we will miss him,'' he
said. ``But you have to admit that he is a good player at the club
and is going to be a free agent. You have to respect what he wants
to do.
	   ``Steve has never hidden the fact that he wanted at one stage of
his career to go abroad, and if he finds the opportunity this
season, I will feel very sorry for the club and I will regret it
because I would like him to stay, I want him to stay and I will let
him know that.
	   ``We are trying hard to do so, I don't know whether a deal has
been done or not, because he can't sign anything until Jan. 1. But
if he prefers to go abroad. .... you have to accept that and
respect it. But I am not resigned to him going and we will continue
the battle to keep him at the club.''

500 to lose jobs in banana industry restructuring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ About 500 banana workers will lose
their jobs and another 2,000 will face pay cuts in a massive
reorganization of the industry, exporters and trade unions
announced Friday.
	   Marshall Hall, chairman of Producers Group, Ltd. and three
banana plantations, said the restructuring is necessary to make
Jamaican bananas competitive in the world markets.
	   ``We have to take a decision to make the industry viable and it
will also mean that workers will have to take lower wages,'' said
Hall.
	   All 2,500 workers at the three plantations will be laid off,
according to a joint statement issued by Producers Group and the
three trade unions representing the workers. Of those laid off,
2,000 will be re-hired by a newly formed company under different
terms and lower wages.
	   The issue of European countries paying preferential prices for
bananas from their former colonies in the Caribbean has led the
United States to threaten further free-trade complaints. Despite
preferences, Jamaica has not been able to fulfill its quota of
banana exports to Europe for several years.

Police arrest three suspects in child porn case
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch police have arrested three
men suspected of owning and distributing child pornography and
seized thousands of electronically stored images, prosecutors
announced Friday.
	   The identities of the arrested men, aged 23, 25 and 50 years,
were not released, nor were details of the 3,000 pornographic
images found during police searches Thursday.
	   Police seized computers, videotapes and CD-ROMs from the
suspects' homes in Uden in the eastern Netherlands and in Voorburg,
a small town on the outskirts of The Hague.
	   There was no immediate indication that the men were linked to a
Dutch-based international pedophilia ring that was smashed this
summer after the discovery of a huge stash of child pornography in
an apartment in the seaside town of Zandvoort.
	   The Zandvoort case involved a ring that used the Internet to
spread images of children as young as 18 months being raped.
	   In a press release, the Hague Public Prosecutor's Office added
that police had been given permission to use an undercover
informant in their latest investigations _ the first time an
infiltrator has been deployed in a Dutch child porn case.
	   The decision was taken ``in view of the seriousness of the
allegations and in order to get a good overview of the ...
suspects,'' according to the prosecutor's office statement.

Kurdish rebel leader detained in Rome; Turkey seeks extradition

 &UR; By VICTOR L. SIMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The leader of a 14-year-old Kurdish insurgency,
considered a terrorist by Turkey and its most-wanted criminal, has
been arrested in Rome, setting up a major battle with Italy over
his extradition.
	   Abdullah Ocalan was arrested after stepping off a plane from
Moscow, where he had sought asylum after recently fleeing his
hideout in Syria, Turkish and Italian officials said Friday.
	   Ocalan leads the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, PKK, which
has been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984.
Nearly 37,000 people have died in the conflict.
	   Italian officials said Ocalan was picked up on arrival Thursday
night at Leonardo da Vinci airport in Rome because of an
outstanding Turkish warrant.
	   ``Once identified, the Italian government had the obligation to
go ahead with his arrest given the serious charges against him,''
said Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
	   Ocalan is on trial in absentia in Turkey on charges of leading a
terrorist organization, threatening the country's territorial
integrity and ordering killings, charges than can bring the death
penalty.
	   Germany also issued an arrest warrant in January 1990 that
accuses Ocalan of ordering the killing of PKK deserters and being
the head of a terrorist organization.
	   Although there have been no executions in Turkey since 1984,
Italy has consistently refused to extradite anyone if there was
even a risk of capital punishment.
	   Luca Cosson, an official of Rome police, said that Ocalan flew
to Rome from Moscow and was carrying a false passport. Further
checks revealed his identity, Cosson said.
	   Ocalan was held in a Rome prison, pending a hearing on Turkey's
request for extradition. No hearing date was immediately set.
Earlier reports said he was being treated in a hospital after
complaining of feeling unwell.
	   In Turkey, Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz, who has been on the
political ropes in a corruption scandal, hailed the arrest as
evidence the government's crackdown on the rebels was succeeding.
	   ``As a result of the pressure we have applied on Syria, our
struggle against terrorism has reached a very positive stage,''
Yilmaz said. He said he asked through Italy's ambassador to Ankara
for Ocalan's extradition and that Turkey's envoy in Rome made the
same request.
	   ``As our NATO ally we do not believe that Italy would make the
wrong decision,'' Yilmaz said.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   A Kurdish news agency said he would ask for political asylum in
Italy, a call also taken up by leftist politicians in the Italian
parliament, who asked their government to grant it.
	   Ocalan was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus
following Turkey's threats to strike Syria. Ankara claims Syria has
long supported the rebels, offering them arms and refuge.
	   Of Marxist inspiration, the PKK was founded by Ocalan, a
political science dropout from Ankara university in 1978. Ocalan
turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding fertile
ground among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.

Yilmaz said. He said he asked through Italy's ambassador to Ankara
for Ocalan's extradition and that Turkey's envoy in Rome made the
same request.
	   ``As our NATO ally we do not believe that Italy would make the
wrong decision,'' Yilmaz said.
	   It was unclear why Ocalan would travel to Italy, which is not
known to be a hub for Turkish Kurdish rebels. However, the
so-called Kurdish Parliament in exile was recently invited by
Italian deputies to hold a session in the capital.
	   A Kurdish news agency said he would ask for political asylum in
Italy, a call also taken up by leftist politicians in the Italian
parliament, who asked their government to grant it.
	   Ocalan was reportedly forced to leave his hideout in Damascus
following Turkey's threats to strike Syria. Ankara claims Syria has
long supported the rebels, offering them arms and refuge.
	   Of Marxist inspiration, the PKK was founded by Ocalan, a
political science dropout from Ankara university in 1978. Ocalan
turned the group toward armed struggle in 1984, finding fertile
ground among poor Kurds in the underdeveloped southeast.
	   The Turkish army claims it all but wiped out the PKK within
Turkey, but the rebels have hideouts in Iran, Syria, and Iraq and
the fighting continues.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered
Frenchman Guillaume Raoux 6-1, 6-1 in a lopsided quarterfinal of
the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup tennis tournament Friday.
	   Earlier, it took the hard-hitting Marc Rosset of Switzerland
only 49 minutes to down qualifier Jan Kroslak of to reach
Saturday's semifinal.
	   Kafelnikov, seeded second, came out strong in the first set. He
hit two aces to end the first game and broke immediately in the
second.
	   The Russian's ability to make points when he needed them,
combined with Raoux's frequent unforced errors, made the first set
pass in less than a half an hour. In the sixth and seventh games,
Kafelnikov came back from 0-30 to beat Raoux, who only managed to
hold the fourth game.
	   In the second set, Kafelnikov controlled Raoux just as easily,
keeping him pointless to break in the first, and served without
dropping a point in the second.
	   Raoux never even threatened, sending balls careening wide or
into the net. He could only hold serve in the third game, and
didn't have a single ace to Kafelnikov's eight overall.
	   The match was the pair's fourth face-off, over which Kafelnikov,
ranked eighth on the ATP tour, has not dropped a single game.
	   Meanwhile, sixth-seeded Rosset, two-time Kremlin Cup champion,
blitzed Kroslak 6-2, 6-4 with 14 aces in all.
	   In quarterfinal doubles action Martin Damm and Cyril Suk
defeated Andrei Medvedev and Vladimir Voltchkov 4-6, 7-6 (8-6),
6-3.

Encyclopedia lists old and new workplace hazards
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Labor Organization has
chronicled details of thousands of workplace hazards, showing that
high-tech hazards have added to traditional threats like accident
and infectious disease for tens of millions of workers.
	   The Encyclopedia of Occupational Health and Safety contains more
than 4,000 pages about risks in the workplace and how to combat
them.
	   Many of the dangers laid out in the encyclopedia, the fourth
edition published by the U.N. labor agency, are the same as in the
first edition in 1930.
	   For instance, a 1993 fire that killed 188 workers at a toy
factory in Thailand was similar to a 1911 New York clothing factory
fire which previously held the record for the highest number of
fatalities with 146 dead.
	   Both factories had inadequate prevention, protection and escape
systems. And both hadn't given workers enough fire safety training.
	   ``I was struck by the sense of history repeating itself,''
Jeanne Mager Stellman, a Colombia University professor and editor
of the encyclopedia, said in an interview Friday.
	   ``We've learned much. But we've expanded the hazards and the old
ones are still there.''
	   Respiratory diseases like asthma cause the most diseases and
injuries worldwide, according to the encyclopedia.
	   Infectious diseases ranging from hepatitis to tuberculosis are
also high on the list.
	   Pesticide poisoning is the cause of hundreds of thousands of
deaths in the developing world where untrained workers use
chemicals that have been banned in industrialized countries,
according to Mager Stellman.
	   But even rich countries still use pesticides that are known to
pose a health risk, like a herbicide called 2,4,5-T used in rice
fields in the United States, the ILO says.
	   In industrialized countries repetitive strain injury resulting
from intensive work with computers is becoming a major cause of
disability,'' said Mager Stellman. She said in the United States in
1995, 31,457 workers received compensation for carpal tunnel
syndrome _ a painful condition of the wrist. More than 70 percent
were women.
	   ``As we have more and more automated work places, the number of
women with these kind of injuries is growing dramatically,'' said
Mager Stellman.
	   Other modern hazards range from nuclear plant accidents to
chemical processes used to make semiconductors.
	   Mager Stellman said the workplace has become much safer for the
vast majority of people in developed countries thanks to education,
training, legal protection, better nutrition and health care.
	   But in developing countries, many workers have no options or
education and face similar health hazards prevalent at the time of
the ILO's first encyclopedia in 1930.
	   The encyclopedia is aimed at management, unions, regulatory
authorities and health professionals. It also comes in CD-ROM
format.

Georgia demands extradition of former security chief
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Georgia renewed its demand Friday that
Russia extradite a former Georgian security chief who is accused of
organizing a 1995 assassination attempt against President Eduard
Shevardnadze.
	   In a letter delivered to the Russian embassy in Tbilisi, the
Georgian capital, the government demanded the return of Igor
Georgadze to face charges of terrorism stemming from the Aug. 29,
1995, attack.
	   Georgadze is believed to be in Russia, and Georgian Foreign
Ministry spokesman Avtandil Napetvaridze noted that he had recently
been interviewed on Russian television.
	   ``Despite repeated requests to extradite him, Russian law
enforcement bodies keep saying they do not know his whereabouts.
However, Russian journalists are perfectly well informed of this,''
Napetvaridze told reporters.
	   Earlier this year, Russia honored a Georgian request that it
extradite a former Georgian finance minister wanted in another,
more recent assassination attempt against Shevardnadze.
	   Georgia said at the time that the gesture had helped warm
relations between the two neighbors. Relations between Georgia and
Russia have been strained at times during the seven years since the
Soviet collapse.

German sport plane crashes into barn killing three in ensuing fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEER, Germany (AP) _ A twin-engine sports plane carrying a pilot
and two passengers crashed into a barn near Leer Friday and
exploded in flames, killing all three on board, police said.
	   The 61-year-old pilot who was flying from Bonn to the island of
Juist in the North Sea, was forced to turn around because of bad
weather and had returned to Leer, about 80 kilometers west of
Bremen, according to police.
	   Approaching Leer the plane struck a radio tower before the
aircraft owned by the ``Travel Air'' company plunged through the
roof a barn near the airport and burst into flames, police said.
	   The names of the victims were not immediately released. An
investigation into the cause of the accident continues.

Young strikers called for exhibition against Spain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With strikers Alessandro Del Piero and Pierluigi
Casiraghi sidelined for months with severe knee injuries, Italy's
coach Dino Zoff called a trio of young forwards _ Filippo Inzaghi,
Francesco Totti and Nicola Ventola _ for Wednesday's soccer
exhibition against Spain.
	   Ventola, Totti and Inzaghi, aged between 21 and 25, have played
only portions of games with the national team so far.
	   The list of 20 did not include veteran star-forward Roberto
Baggio, in questionable form following a knee injury, and Italy's
World Cup keeper Gianluca Pagliuca, sacked by Zoff despite his
impressive performances with Inter Milan this season.
	   Christian Panucci, who plays in Spain with Real Madrid, was the
only expatriate called by Zoff, who succeeded Cesare Maldini at the
helm of the ``Azzurri'' last summer.
	   Italy-Spain, between two early losers at France '98, will be
played in Salerno, near Naples.
	   The Arechi stadium of Salerno was the scene of the explosion
which injured a Belgian off-field official during a UEFA Cup game
between Fiorentina and Grasshoppers last week.
	   Italy's roster (clubs in parentheses):
	   Goalies: Gianluigi Buffon (Parma); Angelo Peruzzi (Juventus).
	   Defenders: Fabio Cannavaro (Parma); Giuseppe Favalli (Lazio);
Mark Iuliano and Gianluca Pessotto (Juventus); Christian Panucci
(Real Madrid); Moreno Torricelli (Fiorentina); Paolo Maldini (AC
Milan).
	   Midfielders: Demetrio Albertini (AC Milan); Jonathan Bachini
(Udinese); Eusebio Di Francesco, Damiano Tommasi and Luigi Di
Biagio (AS Roma); Diego Fuser and Dino Baggio (Parma).
	   Forwards: Enrico Chiesa (Parma); Filippo Inzaghi (Juventus);
Francesco Totti (AS Roma); Nicola Ventola (Internazionale).

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Iraqi prodding, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan says he has no plans to mediate the latest crisis over
U.N. arms inspections.
	   The five permanent members of the Security Council _ the United
States, Britain, France, Russia and China _ met Friday morning to
discuss the crisis before the full 15-member council met with Annan
later in the day.
	   Diplomats who attended the closed meeting said there was a brief
discussion about the secretary-general possibly flying to Baghdad _
but no proposal or initiative for him to do it.
	   It's not that Iraq's traditional sympathizers on the council _
Russia, France and China _ don't want the secretary-general to go
to Iraq. But they support the council's view that the next move is
up to Iraq: It must resume full cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors, and this is non-negotiable.
	   Until Iraq complies, the council doesn't see any mission that
Annan could undertake, the diplomats said.
	   And so far, they said, there has been no movement from Baghdad.
	   Annan was planning to meet the ambassadors of France, Russia and
China before the Security Council meeting Friday, a French diplomat
said.
	   The crisis follows Baghdad's Oct. 31 decision to cut all
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. Since then, the United
States has sent more warships to the Gulf and speculation about
American airstrikes has deepened.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Geoffrey Boycott, the cricket pundit who was
dropped by the BBC and the tabloid Sun when he was convicted by a
French court of battering a former girlfriend, has a new media job.
	   The former England captain was Friday named as chief cricket
correspondent for Britain's Talk Radio network for the Ashes
cricket tour in Australia.
	   The outspoken Yorkshireman's broadcasting career was in tatters
Tuesday when a French Court upheld the verdict of an initial trial
where he was convicted of assaulting Margaret Moore in a French
Riviera hotel in 1996.
	   Boycott received a three-month suspended sentence and was fined
5,300 pounds (dlrs 8,800).
	   Talk Radio chief executive Kelvin MacKenzie on Friday said
Boycott was a ``cricketing legend'' and his views on the sport were
highly valued.
	   Boycott will cover the five tests of the Ashes series, which
starts Nov. 20 in Brisbane.

Vote on legal status for unmarried couples could face delay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Passionate differences over a bill aimed at giving
legal status to unmarried couples could delay its passage by
France's parliament for up to a year, the newspaper Le Monde
reported Friday.
	   The Civil Solidarity Pact, known as PACS, has faced fierce
opposition from critics who have equated the bill with gay
marriage.
	   Leftist politicians say they now want to proceed with caution,
Le Monde reported, after conservative lawmakers delayed the bill's
passage last week with a procedural battle.
	   Thousands of people from around France also have marched against
the proposal.
	   The bill was initially scuttled by rightist politicians Oct. 9
after they launched a fight to quash the legislation. The
government of Socialist Prime Minister has since revised the bill.
	   According to Justice Minister Elisabeth Guigou's office, hopes
that the bill could be approved in June _ as originally planned _
are ``blissfully optimistic,'' Le Monde said.
	   Opponents, who fear the bill could also open the door to
adoptions by homosexual couples, made themselves heard during a
march against the proposal in the streets of Paris last Saturday.
	   The new bill would allow two unrelated people to conclude a
union that would, among other things, allow them to file joint tax
returns, gain inheritance benefits, and take part in the other's
social security coverage.

decisions Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 to restrict the activities of U.N.
weapons inspectors ``were intended to get responses to Iraq's legal
demands.''
	   He didn't elaborate, but apparently was talking about Iraq's
often-stated demand to lift the punishing U.N. trade sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Britain is withdrawing another
400 troops from Northern Ireland because of the reduced threat from
paramilitary groups, Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said Friday.
	   The troops from the Royal Artillery had been based in County
Armagh.
	   The withdrawal leaves 15,000 soldiers in Northern Ireland, the
lowest level since 1970 and down by 2,000 from this summer, the
army said.
	   Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said the troop removal and
the dismantling of borderside vehicle checkpoints were ``important
steps on the way to the normalization of security arrangements,''
following the Northern Ireland peace accord.

Farmers' organization reports second farm attack this week
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Armed men raided a farm east of Harare
and shot dead one of the homestead occupants, the main white
farmers' organization said Friday.
	   Edward Benzies, aged in his 40s, died from gun shot wounds in
the attack late Thursday at Bromley, a mainly white farming area 50
kilometers (30 miles) east of the Zimbabwe capital, the Commercial
Farmers' Union said.
	   Benzies was not a farmer but lived at the homestead. No further
details were available from police but the union said it was
believed three attackers were arrested and that the attack was
motivated by robbery.
	   On Wednesday, an elderly white woman, the owner of a farm at
nearby Marondera and an outspoken critic of the government's plan
to nationalize white-owned farms, died when her homestead was
torched.
	   While the death was on Wednesday attributed to a nationwide
strike against deteriorating economic conditions, police said
Friday that the 70-year-old Sylvia Jackson was burned to death
after one of her workers set the building alight with gas canisters
in a dispute over pay.
	   The worker was arrested and confessed to his action, said police
spokesman Claudius Mateko in Marondera, 25 kilometers (15 miles)
east of Bromley.
	   But neighbors said squatters earlier blockaded Jackson's
driveway and demanded she leave the property.
	   Earlier this year, she was accused by local officials of racism
after she complained her sheep suffered from parasites left by
black trespassers on her land.
	   The homestead attacks, rare in the former Rhodesia, came as
fears mounted among the nation's 4,000 white farmers.
	   Squatters have settled themselves on several farms in wheat,
tobacco and corn growing areas east of Harare in recent weeks.
	   In a separate development Friday, the Commercial Farmers Union
leader Bob Swift resigned his post, citing what he described as
``the fast deteriorating land issue'' and an impasse between
farmers and the government over proposed land seizures.
	   The union said it accepted his resignation in light of
continuing seizures and farm ``invasions'' by squatters. A former
union president, Nick Swanepoel, agreed to replace Swift.

	   ``Saddam expressed his appreciation and trust in President
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Primakov and for Russia's efforts in
supporting Iraq's just cause,'' INA said.
	   Russia and China have urged the U.N. Security Council to ease
the sanctions to reward Iraq for its compliance to date with U.N.
resolutions enacted after the 1991 Gulf War that call for the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, and since Aug. 5, has restricted
the activities of weapons inspectors as a way to push its demands
for lifting the sanctions.
	   INA quoted Saddam as telling Kartouzov that Iraq took the action
``not to create crisis or stop cooperating with the Security
Council but to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.''
	   The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
who on Thursday blamed the United States for working to prolong the
weapons inspections as well as the sanctions.

farewell to Jean Marais, one of France's most beloved actors,
buried in the simple cemetery of his Riviera village.
	   Even in death, the smooth baritone voice of Marais, who died
Sunday at age 84, resounded through St. Anne church, in Valluris,
southern France, where village friends and actors paid tribute:
``Give up! Let go! Life is dead! Long live life!''

	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - Russians world champions led the
opening two events Friday at the Nations Cup with Alexei Yagudin
showing juggling skills as well as skating.
	   Yagudin used a circus theme that included portions of juggling
motions while entering into jumps to leap into first in the men's
event after the short program.
	   Yagudin did all his elements cleanly -- including a high triple
axel-triple toe loop -- to score marks between 5.7 and 5.9 despite
being the first skater.
	   ``It wasn't difficult for me to skate first,'' Yagudin said.
``It is never difficult for me to skate. First or last it doesn't
matter.''
	   Another Russian, Alexander Abt, was second. Abt had a more
difficult routine than Yagudin but missed a triple axel-triple loop
slightly and two footed a quadruple attempt. Quads are now allowed
in the short program. which is one-third of the total mark.
	   ``It was the first time I showed this short program and I was
nervous but I wanted to risk everything,'' Abt said. ``I say `The
sooner you try something the sooner you will be successful.'''
	   Still he took second with Andreas Vlacenko of Germany third.
	   Russian ice dance world champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg
Ovsiannikov made their season's debut and comfortably led after the
initial portion
	   In the compulsory dance, the Tango Romantica, they skated first
and scored mark mostly of 5.7 and 5.8 with a pair of 5.9s,
unusually high with the rest of the field to come.
	   Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz were in second but
were at least two-tenths behind on nearly every judge.
	   Third was the German couple of Kati Winkler and Rene Lohse.
	   The original dance to the waltz tempo is later Friday along with
the opening short program of the pairs event.
	   The men have their long program Saturday night and it will be
hard for Yagudin to better his performance at Skate America when he
did nine triple jumps -- one more than legal.
	   With three-time world champion Elvis Stojko of Canada still slow
in coming back from a groin injury, Yagudin looks to dominate the
season.
	   Yagudin is now coached by Tatiana Tarasova, who guided Ilia
Kulik and ice dancers Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov to Olympic
gold medals in Nagano, Japan.
	   The women's competition begins Saturday with Russians looking to
continue winning. European champion Maria Butyrskaya is the
favorite.
	   With Olympic champion Tara Lipinski leaving the eligible ranks
and world champion Michelle Kwan taking the year off from these
competitions the women's field is wide open this year.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Lalique Trophy in Paris next week.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Twelve AC Milan players in tax evasion probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian tax police alleged Friday that 12
present and past players of major league soccer club AC Milan
evaded taxes over a seven-year period.
	   According to news reports those are investigation are the trio
of Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco Van
Basten, past team captain Franco Baresi, present captain Paolo
Maldini and defender Christian Panucci, now with Real Madrid in the
Spanish league.
	   Others mentioned in the case were former French striker Jean
Pierre Papin and Montenegrin star Dejan Savicevic.
	   The other players mentioned in the reports were Mauro Tassotti,
Gianluigi Lentini, Nando De Napoli and Stefano Eranio.
	   Court sources indicated that Milan prosecutors must now decide
whether to recommend indictment of players or officials.
	   The Milan club is owned by media mogul and former premier Silvio
Berlusconi.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the investigation
focused on possible tax evasion via under-the-table, multimillion
dollar contracts between 1991 and 1997.
	   Gullit, Van Basten and Rijkaard were part of the Milan soccer
powerhouse which dominated the national and international scene in
the early 90s.
	   Gullit moved to the English Premier League as player-coach of
Chelsea at the end of his Italian career.
	   Rijkaard was recently hired as coach of the Dutch national
soccer team.
	   The case is part of a broad investigation of soccer, rugby and
volleyball teams now or formerly in Berlusconi's business empire
Fininvest.

Report: Polish club banned from Europe in `knife' indident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish club Wisla Krakow has been banned
from European soccer following the arrest Friday of a man
implicated in an alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA Cup
match last month.
	   Poland's PAP news agency, citing Michal Listkiewicz of the
Polish Soccer Union, said the club would be banned from European
competition for the next season it qualifies.
	   A UEFA spokesman in Nyon, Switzerland, declined to comment but
indicated a statement would be issued later Friday.
	   Police on Friday detained a 19-year-old man in the Oct. 20
incident, in which Italian soccer star Dino Baggio was struck by an
object thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches to close a
head wound.
	   Private Radio Zet said the Wisla fan, identifield as Pawel
Michalski, 19, could face up to 10 years in prison for injuring
Baggio. The radio reported prosecutors saying he threw a
switch-blade knife.
	   Krakow prosecutors were not immediately available to confirm the
report and the prosecutors office was closed Friday afternoon.
	   The teen-ager was also wanted for beating a policeman.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match between AC Parma and Wisla Krakow. The teams tied
1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.
	   Wisla officials, who deny Baggio was struck by a knife, have
offered a zloty 5,000 (dlrs 1,470) reward in the case.

flood watch is in effect until 6 p.m. for all of Puerto Rico and

thunderstorms were detected by Doppler radar over the Caribbean sea
and the Atlantic Ocean and most of Puerto Rico and from St. Croix

use of nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The United States does not feel
comfortable with assurances by India that it will not be the first
nation to use nuclear weapons in case of war with its hostile
neighbor Pakistan, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
said Friday.
	   That is only a doctrine and ``it's what the government says,''
Talbott said during a videoconference from Washington with
journalists and retired diplomats in New Delhi and Islamabad.
	   ``We feel it's is not as important as the kind of weapons they
have or the kind of rivalry in hardware,'' he said.
	   Soon after the five tests in May and retaliatory tests by
Pakistan, India announced it would stop further tests and adopt a
no-first use policy for nuclear weapons.
	   Talbott has held several rounds of talks with Indian and
Pakistani politicians to persuade both nations to sign the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty or the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty.
	   In addition, Talbott said he has stressed that both nations
should stop producing material that can be used to make nuclear
weapons, restrict the use of missiles or aircraft that can carry
nuclear warheads and ban the export of nuclear technology or
material.
	   India has refused to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and
the NPT, saying it allows declared nuclear powers to build and test
nuclear weapons while denying the opportunity to other nations that
want to do so.
	   Responding to repeated suggestions that the United States has a
different set of standards for itself in regard to eliminating
nuclear weapons, Talbott said U.S. has certainly taken positive
steps to reduce its nuclear arsenal.
	   On Friday, India's prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee,
reiterated that he would not compromise on security issues,
indicating he would not be pressured into signing the CTBT. He
spoke as he laid a foundation stone for a new oil refinery in the
northern state of Punjab.
	   In an address Thursday at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, Talbott said the partial lifting of sanctions against
Pakistan and India is designed partly to prevent a ``financial
meltdown'' in Pakistan and should not be viewed as tilting U.S.
policy against India.
	   ``Our Pakistani friends are in very dire economy straits. India
is not in a comparable crisis,'' he said, denying any favoritism
towards Pakistan.
	   Actual lifting of the sanctions, announced last week by the
White House, will take place ``very soon,'' Talbott said. The
action will open the way for U.S. investments and lending in both
countries, resumption of military-to-military education and
training programs, and U.S. support for International Monetary Fund
loans to Pakistan.
	   All are prohibited under sanctions required by law after both
countries conducted their first nuclear bomb tests in May.
	   Talbott said India and Pakistan should not try to replicate the
U.S. and Soviet nuclear competition. He said cost nearly dlrs 5.5
trillion and the expenditure by the Soviet Union ultimately led to
its collapse.
	   Meanwhile, the European Union hoped India will sign the CTBT,
saying it got the impression that the government is moving toward a
possible solution in the future, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Benita Ferrero-Waldner, leader of the EU ministerial troika that
is holding talks with Indian officials, said the delegation however
got no firm committment that India would sign the CTBT.
	   An Indian Foreign Office spokesman said India has said it will
sign the CTBT only if other countries ratify it and India's
security concerns relating to Pakistan are addressed.

	   ``Saddam expressed his appreciation and trust in President
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Primakov and for Russia's efforts in

	   Russia and China have urged the Security Council to ease the
sanctions to reward Iraq for its compliance to date with U.N.
resolutions after the 1991 Gulf War that require Iraq to eliminate
its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, and since Aug. 5, has restricted

``not to create crisis or stop cooperating with the Security
Council but to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.''
	   The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
who on Thursday blamed the United States for working to prolong the
weapons inspections as well as the sanctions.

Gov't opts for Moneo's discreet design in Prado Museum extension
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain, (AP) _ Hoping to ease the Prado museum's severe
space problems, Spain's Culture Ministry has chosen the discreet
and restrained extension plan designed by renowned architect Rafael
Moneo.
	   The scale model of Moneo's design, unveiled to the public
Friday, demonstrates the architect's intention not to interfere
with the austere and majestic design of the Prado's 18th century
main building located along Madrid's Paseo del Prado boulevard.
	   Moneo, who is to design the Los Angeles Roman Catholic cathedral
which is expected to be the biggest Roman Catholic church in the
United States, was Wednesday notified that his design for the Prado
extension had been chosen.
	   His final plan is to be presented within three months and the
construction, estimated at 3.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 2.5 million),
is to take two years to complete.
	   Architects from around the world were invited to design the best
way to annex a church located at the back of the Prado to the
museum itself.
	   Moneo, who was born in the northern Spanish town of Tudela in
1937, plans to link the Prado and the reformed cloister of the
Jeronimos church with a glass and steel underground passage which
will serve as the main entrance to the museum.
	   Moneo also intends the church and reconstructed cloister to
serve as space for special exhibitions, thus alleviating space
pressure at the museum's main building.
	   The cloister is also to hold the museum's 200,000-volume library
as well as the museum's restoration workshops.
	   ``The Prado must continue to be the Prado,'' Moneo told the
leading daily El Pais this week. ``It's not a case of unbalancing
the actual building but rather of liberating it from functions it
had been lumped with and which took away from its virtue.''
	   In 1996, Moneo won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for
architecture. Works cited by the Pritzker jury included the San
Pablo Airport terminal in Seville, Spain, and the Pilar and Joan
Miro Foundation gallery and offices in Palma on the island of
Mallorca.
	   In the United States, Moneo designed the Davis Museum and
Cultural Center at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass., built in
1993.
	   He has also designed Stockholm's new Moderna Museet located on
Skeppsholmen, an island in the center of the city, and which was
inaugurated in February.
	   Spain's Prado was opened as a public museum in 1819 and is
ranked among the world's top three museums for Old Master and
19th-century art.
	   In recent years, besides serious space and storage problems, the
museum has had to be reroofed because of leaks.

U.S. commerce secretary promotes business on first Lebanon visit

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on
Friday urged American businesses to get more involved in the
multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction of Lebanon, a country
once synonymous with hijackings and hostage-taking.
	   ``The message I brought is that the United States is back and
wants to do more business in Lebanon,'' Daley said after a meeting
with President-elect Emile Lahoud on his one-day visit.
	   U.S. companies have been virtually shut out of major
reconstruction projects after the 1975-90 civil war because of a
decade-old U.S. government travel ban that was lifted last year.
Most contracts went to European and Asian companies.
	   But private American business involvement in the Lebanese
free-market economy has surged in the last few years. The United
States is Lebanon's second-biggest trading partner, selling goods
worth dlrs 550 million and importing dlrs 80 million worth of
merchandise.
	   In a speech to U.S. and Lebanese business executives, Daley
delivered a veiled criticism of the way contracts have been awarded
in the dlrs 13 billion program of reconstruction.
	   ``When American companies bid on projects, whether they win or
lose, they expect the bidding process to be transparent and to be
fair and open,'' he said.
	   Lebanese politicians have frequently leveled charges of
kickbacks and underhand tactics in the awarding of contracts.
	   Daley is the first senior American trade official to visit
Lebanon. As with previous trips by senior U.S. government
officials, security was tight. Instead of landing at Beirut's
gleaming new international airport, Daley took a U.S. military
helicopter from Cyprus to the fortified U.S. Embassy compound north
of Beirut.
	   Among the immediate fruits of Daley's visit was a dlrs 7.5
million deal signed Friday between Continental Electronics Corp. of
Dallas, Texas, and the Lebanese government to build a new radio
station. The U.S. Export-Import Bank will finance the contract.
	   Daley welcomed a parliamentary committee's approval Thursday of
an intellectual property bill on piracy of computer software. The
bill, long demanded by the United States, now goes to the full
legislature for a vote.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In his first statement since the start of
the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections, President Saddam Hussein
said Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and would accept
``positively any initiative'' that would end U.N. sanctions.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Saddam as saying his
decisions Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 to restrict the work of U.N.
inspectors ``were intended to get responses to Iraq's legal
demands.''
	   He didn't elaborate, but apparently was talking about Iraq's
often-stated demand for the lifting of punishing U.N. trade
sanctions imposed eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Saddam added that ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative
that meets these just and balanced demands.''
	   This, he said, required that the Security Council and the United
States ``commit themselves to the letter and spirit of the
resolutions as Iraq has done over the past eight years.''
	   The agency said Saddam spoke with the Russian ambassador,
Nikolai Kartouzov, who delivered letters from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. It did not
disclose the contents of the letters.
	   ``Saddam expressed his appreciation and trust in President
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Primakov and for Russia's efforts in
supporting Iraq's just cause,'' the agency said.
	   Russia and China have urged the U.N. Security Council to ease
the sanctions to reward Iraq for its compliance to date with U.N.
resolutions enacted after the 1991 Gulf War that call for the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.

sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify

Real Madrid chairman says club closer to deal with Liverpool's
</HEADLINE>
McManaman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The chairman of reigning European champion
Real Madrid said Friday the club was closer to signing a four-year
contract with Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman.
	   ``Our positions have come closer, so much so that a satisfactory
resolution to the matter looks likely,'' Lorenzo Sanz told the
leading Spanish daily El Pais after talks with McManaman's agent
Colin Gordon on Thursday.
	   Previous negotiations this month had stumbled over Real Madrid's
opinion that the 26-year-old player was asking for too much, El
Pais said. The paper added that the latest talks indicated such
problems had been worked out.
	   Sanz said Real was looking to sign McManaman for four seasons
with an option on a fifth. There were no details available
regarding the financial terms of the contract.
	   McManaman's contract with Liverpool expires in June 1999. The
club is expected to offer him an attractive renewal deal. But Real
Madrid officials say the chances of the midfielder leaving have
increased because of difficulties at the struggling Premier League
side, exemplified Thursday by the resignation of co-manager Roy
Evans.
	   In addition, Madrid believes McManaman would favor a move to the
Spanish club since he has a grudge against Real's eternal rival FC
Barcelona who, in the last minute, withdrew from negotiations to
sign him two seasons ago, preferring to sign Brazilian Rivaldo.
	   Gerard Houllier, who will assume sole control as Liverpool
manager after Evans' departure, said Friday there is little the
Reds can do to stop McManaman leaving if he wants to.
	   ``I will be sorry if he goes because we will miss him,'' he
said. ``But you have to admit that he is a good player at the club
and is going to be a free agent. You have to respect what he wants
to do.
	   ``Steve has never hidden the fact that he wanted at one stage of
his career to go abroad, and if he finds the opportunity this
season, I will feel very sorry for the club and I will regret it
because I would like him to stay. I want him to stay and I will let
him know that.
	   ``We are trying hard to do so, I don't know whether a deal has
been done or not, because he can't sign anything until Jan. 1. But
if he prefers to go abroad. .... you have to accept that and
respect it. But I am not resigned to him going and we will continue
the battle to keep him at the club.''

Angolan troops find corpses of foreigners believed abducted in mine

attack &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan troops tracking gunmen who raided
a Canadian-owned mine have found three corpses believed to be those
of three kidnapped expatriate workers, an army spokesman said
Friday.
	   ``We found three white men floating in a river,'' Brig. Jose
Joao Manuel said by phone.
	   ``It seems that they drowned, but we don't know the specific
cause of death yet,'' he added.
	   The identities of the three men had not yet been ascertained,
but they were believed to be from the group of four workers _ two
Filipinos, a Briton and a South African _ who were abducted during
last Sunday's attack on the Yetwene mine, he said.
	   The bodies were awaiting identification by officials from the
mine, owned by Vancouver-based DiamondWorks Ltd.
	   Gunmen attacked the mine at Yetwene, a remote mining village
about 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the capital Luanda, before
dawn Sunday, killing eight employees and wounding 18 others.
	   Two Britons and a South African were among those killed.
	   Brig. Manuel said troops found the corpses on Thursday in a
river ``dozens of kilometers (miles)'' from the mine, but he could
not give an exact location.
	   Troops were still pursuing the gunmen, estimated to number about
200, towards the northern border with Congo, he said.
	   However, the gunmen had split up into smaller groups, making it
difficult to catch them all, he said.
	   Officials have blamed the former rebel group UNITA for the raid,
claiming it wanted to destabilize the country as part of its
continuing hostility towards the government despite signing a 1994
peace pact to end a two-decade civil war.
	   However, gangs of armed bandits, mostly demobilized soldiers,
roam the countryside of the vast southwest African nation and
regularly have pillaged outlying towns in recent months.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ No quick end to the economic crisis is in sight,
and the Russian economy, which has shrunk 5 percent this year, will
drop another 3 percent to 9 percent in 1999, the Finance Ministry
said Friday.
	   Ministry analysts estimate that the crisis will last through
most or all of next year. The Russian economy has been shrinking
throughout the 1990s in one of the most painful and prolonged
recessions ever suffered by an industrialized nation.
	   It showed signs of stabilizing late last year, but took another
devastating plunge after Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on
domestic debts this August.
	   Prominent liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky has estimated that
Russia's gross domestic product will drop 10 percent next year if
the government goes ahead with its latest economic program.
	   The GDP is measured as the total value of all goods and services
produced by a country.
	   The Finance Ministry estimated that even in the best-case
scenario, the economy will probably contract by 3 percent next
year, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   This forecast assumes the government will meet its revenue
targets, the country will receive foreign loans that have been
promised, and inflation will stay relatively tame at 30 percent.
	   But the Finance Ministry acknowledged that events were unlikely
to be so rosy.
	   Under the gloomier scenario, the economy would shrink 9 percent
and the cash-strapped government would have to print 320 billion
rubles (dlrs 19.3 billion) to pay off back wages and other debts,
pushing inflation up to around 130 percent.
	   The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund put together
a dlrs 22.6 billion loan for Russia in July, but the installments
were put on hold after the country's latest economic crisis hit in
August.
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn was in Moscow on Friday to
get a first-hand view of the economic problems.
	   He criticized the Russian government for failing to deliver on
some previous agreements, and said that before the government gets
any more foreign loans it would have to come up with a good plan
for rescuing the economy and start acting on it, Interfax reported,
citing unidentified participants in the talks.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's Central Bank said it plans to give the
country's failing banks 19 billion rubles (dlrs 1.1 billion) in
credits for the rest of this year, and another 25 billion rubles
(dlrs 1.5 billion) next year, according to a letter from the
central bank's Deputy Chairman Andrei Kozlov to the head of
parliament's budget committee.
	   To receive the money, banks must meet minimal requirements for
hard currency reserves, have no arrears to the Central Bank, and
agree on a jointly drafted restructuring program, Kozlov said.
	   The Central Bank has said it would need 141 billion rubles (dlrs
8.5 billion) to completely bail out the banking sector, money it
admits it doesn't have.

Saddam says open to `any initiative' that would end sanctions

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background in 6th graf, Iraqi foreign minister
criticizing decision to withdraw U.N. inspectors in grafs 7-8. &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In his first statement since the start of
the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections, President Saddam Hussein
said Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and would accept
``positively any initiative'' that would end U.N. sanctions.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted Saddam as saying his
decisions Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 to restrict the work of U.N.
inspectors ``were intended to get responses to Iraq's legal
demands.''
	   He didn't elaborate, but apparently was talking about Iraq's
often-stated demand for the lifting of punishing U.N. trade
sanctions imposed eight years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
	   Saddam added that ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative
that meets these just and balanced demands.''
	   This, he said, required that the Security Council and the United
States ``commit themselves to the letter and spirit of the
resolutions as Iraq has done over the past eight years.''
	   In essence, his statement mirrored Iraqi declarations since the
crisis began. But both U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary
State Madeleine Albright insisted Friday that an attack can only be
averted if Iraq rescinds its decision to halt arms inspections.
	   Also Friday, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
criticized a U.N. decision to evacuate 103 weapons inspectors and
about a third of its 450 relief workers because of growing fears
that a U.S. strike is imminent.
	   The evacuation ``contributed to the negative atmosphere
triggered by the U.S. administration ... which it created by
preparing for a military strike against Iraq instead of seeking a
peaceful solution,'' he said in a letter to U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan.
	   The agency said Saddam spoke with the Russian ambassador,
Nikolai Kartouzov, who delivered letters from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. It did not
disclose the contents of the letters.
	   ``Saddam expressed his appreciation and trust in President
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Primakov and for Russia's efforts in
supporting Iraq's just cause,'' the agency said.
	   Russia and China have urged the U.N. Security Council to ease
the sanctions to reward Iraq for its compliance to date with U.N.
resolutions enacted after the 1991 Gulf War that call for the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, and since Aug. 5, has restricted
the activities of weapons inspectors as a way to push its demands
for lifting the sanctions.
	   The agency quoted Saddam as telling Kartouzov that Iraq took the
action ``not to create a crisis or stop cooperating with the
Security Council but to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.''
	   The meeting was attended by Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz,
who on Thursday blamed the United States for working to prolong the
weapons inspections as well as the sanctions.

Woman parks car in goal mouth to prove a point
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST YORKSHIRE, England (AP) _ An English woman added a new
dimension to pitch invasions when she halted a soccer game by
driving onto the field and refusing to move until her demands were
met.
	   Amanda MacNaughton reportedly became frustrated when the
driveway of her Beverley home was blocked by a car belonging to a
supporter from a neighboring soccer club.
	   So she took the law into her own hands.
	   Match referee Brian Freeman said MacNaughton drove onto the
field while play was in progress, parked her car in the goal mouth
and refused to shift it until the guilty fan moved the vehicle.
	   Freeman said the 27-year-old woman told the stunned crowd: ``You
park on my pitch and I'll park on yours.''
	   Freeman said he had seen nothing like it in 20 years of
refereeing.
	   ``Even from 75 yards I could see she was very annoyed. She
slammed the door, locked it and then marched off and stood by the
side of the goal,'' Freeman said.
	   ``She was insistent that until someone moved the van she wasn't
going to move the car.''
	   The fan was eventually moved and the match resumed without
further incident.
	   The incident reportedly occurred during an East Riding County
league match between Beverley and Long Riston.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov overpowered
Frenchman Guillaume Raoux 6-1, 6-1 in a lopsided quarterfinal
Friday at the the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup.
	   Earlier, it took the hard-hitting Marc Rosset of Switzerland
only 49 minutes to down qualifier Jan Kroslak of Slovakia to reach
Saturday's semifinal.
	   Kafelnikov, seeded second, came out strong in the first set. He
served two aces to end the first game and immediately broke Raoux
to start the second.
	   The Russian's ability to make points when he needed them,
combined with Raoux's frequent unforced errors, completed the first
set in less than a half an hour. In the sixth and seventh games,
Kafelnikov rallied from 0-30 to beat Raoux, who only managed to
hold the fourth game.
	   In the second set, Kafelnikov controlled Raoux just as easily,
winning at love to break the Frenchman in the first, and winning at
love to claim the second.
	   Raoux never even threatened, sending balls wide or into the net.
He could only hold serve in the third game, and didn't have a
single ace to Kafelnikov's eight.
	   The match was the pair's fourth face-off, over which Kafelnikov,
ranked eighth on the ATP tour, has not dropped a single game.
	   Meanwhile, sixth-seeded Rosset, two-time Kremlin Cup champion,
blitzed Kroslak 6-2, 6-4 with 14 aces in all.
	   The other two quarterfinals were played on Thrusday with
Frenchman Arnaud Clement beat Canadian Sebastien Lareau 6-3, 7-5
and Croatia's Goran Ivanisevic routing Lars Burgsmuller of Germany
6-2, 6-1.

Yugoslav official rules out talks with Kosovo guerrillas

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Yugoslav official on Friday
ruled out involving separatist Albanian guerrillas in peace plans
for Kosovo but urged the resumption of talks with more moderate
ethnic Albanian leaders.
	   A statement issued by Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic and carried by
the Tanjug news agency excluded participation of the militant
Kosovo Liberation Army in the peace process, saying ``there is no
place for extremists, terrorism, abductions, killings, armed
attacks.''
	   Alluding to the Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb
police forces from Kosovo, he said: ``An agreement respected only
by one side stands no chance.''
	   At talks in Belgrade with European Union envoy Wolfgang
Petritsch, Lilic said authorities are abiding by the agreement,
meant to set up a deal designed to restore autonomy to Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy to the October
agreement, it says it is respecting a de-facto cease fire it
created and responding only when attacked. Authorities claim the
guerrillas are provoking fights, hoping for a massive response
which will revive the threat of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav
targets.
	   Armed Serb civilians swapped hostages with ethnic Albanian
guerrillas on Friday, defusing a standoff. But tensions were fed by
reports that Serb police shot and killed an ethnic Albanian.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing in the central Drenica region, a trouble spot
throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown by Serb forces
on guerrillas seeking independence for Kosovo.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, said the sources.
Members of a still-forming 2,000-strong team meant to monitor the
October agreement mediated in the releases.
	   In Brussels Friday, NATO ambassadors approved plans Friday for a
French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand ready to
rescue the unarmed civilian ``ground verifiers'' in Kosovo should
they come under threat.
	   The NATO ``extraction force,'' called Joint Guarantor, will be
on standby in Macedonia and prepared to rescue any of the civilian
verifiers that might find themselves under attack or in a
threatening situation.
	   Two killings, reported Friday, continued to fuel Kosovo
tensions.
	   A crew for Associated Press Television News said a Yugoslav
soldier was killed on the road connecting Pristina and Prizren and
two others were wounded. Serb sources close to the military
confirmed the report.
	   Though details were unclear, the crew said they had heard bursts
of gunfire coming from the region, between Suva Reka and Stimlje
villages. Traffic was backed up in the area. The APTN crew saw two
tanks and several trucks full of soldiers in the vicinity.
	   Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness
said Serb police opened fire on a group of ethnic Albanian men and
children, killing one of the men and injuring another. The Kosovo
Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, also carried
the report.
	   According to Tafil Kryeziu, six police pulled up in an unmarked
car Thursday and opened fire on the group. The children fled
unharmed, but one man was killed and another wounded in the arm,
said the witnesses, identifying both victims by name.
	   Journalists visiting Mlecane Friday saw two pools of blood amid
15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident reportedly
took place. Male villagers, who only recently returned to the homes
they left earlier, said all the women and children had fled again.
	   ``We aren't normal folks anymore. Whenever we see a car, we run
away because we're afraid,'' said Ismajl Gashi, 40.
	   The Yugoslav foreign ministry reported Friday that ethnic
Albanian rebels opened fire Thursday at a police vehicle traveling
the main road, near Mlecane. No causalities were reported and it
was not immediately clear the incident was linked to the shooting
in the village.
	   The continued shootings have chipped away at hopes for a
solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and Albanians, ushered
in by an Oct. 12 agreement.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province has left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made
refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told
Serbs _ a less than 10 percent minority in the province _ they had
nothing to fear from the October agreement,
	   ``All Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told
reporters.

 &UR; UEFA bans Polish club from Europe in `knife' incident &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UEFA confirmation, more details, player
suspended, MOVES dateline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA said Friday it has banned Polish
club Wisla Krakow from European soccer for one season over an
alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA Cup match last month.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' European soccer's governing body
said in a statement.
	   Police on Friday detained a 19-year-old man in the Oct. 20
incident, in which Italian soccer star Dino Baggio was struck by an
object thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches to close a
head wound.
	   UEFA identified the weapon as a flick knife.
	   UEFA's control and disciplinary committee also suspended Ryszard
Czerwiec of the Polish club for one European match.
	   ``Czerwiec, who was standing next to Baggio at the time of the
incident, picked up the knife and through it back into the crowd,
to prevent the Italian players showing the knife to the refugee,''
the statement said.
	   Private Radio Zet said the Wisla fan, identified as Pawel
Michalski, 19, could face up to 10 years in prison for injuring
Baggio. The radio reported prosecutors saying he threw a
switch-blade knife.
	   Krakow prosecutors were not immediately available to confirm the
report and the prosecutors office was closed Friday afternoon.
	   The teen-ager was also wanted for beating a policeman.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match between AC Parma and Wisla Krakow. The teams tied
1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.
	   Wisla officials, who deny Baggio was struck by a knife, have
offered a zloty 5,000 (dlrs 1,470) reward in the case.

	   LEER, Germany (AP) _ A twin-engine sports plane carrying a pilot
and two passengers crashed into a barn near Leer Friday and
exploded in flames, killing all three on board, police said.
	   The 61-year-old pilot who was flying from Bonn to the island of
Juist in the North Sea, was forced to turn around because of bad
weather and had returned to Leer, about 80 kilometers west of
Bremen, according to police.
	   Approaching Leer the plane struck a radio tower before the
aircraft owned by the ``Travel Air'' company plunged through the
roof a barn near the airport and burst into flames, police said.
	   The names of the victims were not immediately released. An
investigation into the cause of the accident continues.

UEFA bans Polish club from Europe in `knife' incident

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA said Friday it has banned Polish
club Wisla Krakow from European soccer for one season over an
alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA Cup match last month.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' European soccer's governing body
said in a statement.
	   Police on Friday detained a 19-year-old man in the Oct. 20
incident, in which Italian soccer star Dino Baggio was struck by an
object thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches to close a
head wound.
	   UEFA identified the weapon as a flick knife.
	   UEFA's control and disciplinary committee also suspended Ryszard
Czerwiec of the Polish club for one European match.
	   ``Czerwiec, who was standing next to Baggio at the time of the
incident, picked up the knife and through it back into the crowd,
to prevent the Italian players showing the knife to the referee,''
the statement said.

Israel confirms decision to pave roads to Jewish settlements
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with U.S. envoy arriving, details.
No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel has authorized the paving of 13 roads to
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, including one that will
require the expropriation of huge tracts of land owned by
Palestinians.
	   The Palestinians sharply protested the decision _ which Israel
confirmed Friday _ as a threat to the recently reached peace
agreement.
	   ``Such actions create an atmosphere that will not be encouraging
for the peace process and is a direct provocation to the
Palestinians,'' said Nabil Amr, an adviser to Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
	   There is no mention of bypass roads in the Mideast peace
agreement struck last month in the United States. Palestinian
negotiator Hassan Asfour said that while the Palestinians had
expected some roads would be built, they were taken aback by the
large number of projects authorized.
	   The Palestinians consider the paving of those roads a unilateral
Israeli act, especially since they involve seizing
Palestinian-owned lands.
	   As part of the land-for-security agreement, Israel is to
gradually withdraw from an additional 13 percent of the West Bank
by the end of January. The pullback will turn several Jewish
settlements into isolated enclaves in Palestinian-controlled areas
and Israel has said it needs to pave new roads to ensure safe
passage to all settlers.
	   U.S. officials were also critical of Israel's decision, which
came as U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross arrived in Jerusalem to
oversee implementation of the deal.
	   Ross was to meet separately Friday with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, and with
Arafat on Saturday morning.
	   Netanyahu and senior Cabinet ministers authorized the paving of
the bypass roads Thursday, although initial reports were unclear on
how many and which projects had been approved.
	   Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said Friday that in all, 13
roads would be paved, including one that will stretch from near the
West Bank town of Hebron and past the Palestinian refugee camp of
Al Aroub to Jerusalem.
	   Asfour, the Palestinian negotiator, said that for the paving of
the Al Aroub bypass, Israel would have to expropriate land in areas
already under Palestinian control.
	   U.S. officials were critical of Israel's decision, which came as
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross was en route to the region to
oversee implementation of the deal.
	   The peace agreement is to be implemented beginning next week,
starting with the opening of the new Palestinian airport, a
powerful symbol of fledgling independence. After an operations
drill with Israeli officials, the Palestinian aviation authorities
said Friday that the airport was ready for operations.
	   Also Friday, the Israeli army imposed a curfew in the West Bank
town of Hebron after an assailant hurled a hand grenade at an army
outpost. The grenade did not go off and there were no injuries.

Martin and Rusedski advance to semis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rusedski's quarterfinal; will be updated &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Greg Rusedski received the tough match
he expected, needing three sets to outlast Daniel Nestor in the
quarterfinals of the Stockholm Open.
	   Rusedski won the clash between the two Canadian-born players 7-6
(7-2), 1-6, 6-3 to set up a semifinal meeting against Thomas
Johansson or Jason Stoltenberg, who upset top-ranked Pete Sampras
in the opening round.
	   Rusedski hurt a gluteal muscle during the match and was treated
by a trainer in the second set, won by Nestor after ripping off 10
straight points and the last two games at love.
	   ``I got painkillers,'' Rusedski said. ``It felt like I pulled it
a little bit. But he (the trainer) said it was basically an overuse
of the muscle. He doesn't feel that it's anything that will cause
me damage. I'll just go out and play tomorrow. I'm pleased it's too
serious.''
	   Rusedski, the fourth seed, broke Nestor's serve for the only
time in the decisive set to take a 4-2 lead. A marathon game that
lasted more than 10 minutes, Rusedski won it on his fifth break
point when Nestor netted a volley.
	   ``I just had to forget about it (the injury) in the third set
and go for it,'' Rusedski said. ``Fortunately for me I managed to
get the only break in the third set. That was the key game. It
could have gone either which way.''
	   It was the Briton's 32nd victory indoors this year, tops on the
ATP Tour. Last week, Rusedski beat Sampras to win the Paris Open.
	   Rusedski, who is looking to qualify for the ATP Tour World
Championship for the second consecutive year, also reached the
semis in Stockholm last year but lost to Jan Siemerink.
	   Todd Martin stopped Takao Suzuki's run in the Stockholm Open
earlier Friday, beating the Japanese qualifier 6-3, 6-4 in the
first quarterfinal.
	   Martin broke Suzuki twice in game seven and nine to win the
first set. After trading service breaks early in the second set,
Martin broke Suzuki again in the last game.
	   Suzuki fell behind 15-40 after two superb crosscourt returns by
Martin. The American clinched the match with a perfect lob.
	   ``The key point of the game came at 15 all in the last game,
when I hit a passing shot for a winner,'' Martin said. ``That gave
me a boost and took the wind out of him.''
	   ``I feel I'm playing great, better than a few years ago. That's
more than I can ask for. I just hope it continues for the rest of
the week and that it doesn't vanish come 1999.''
	   Martin, who reached the 1996 Stockholm final but lost to Thomas
Enqvist, will play the winner between third-seed Tim Henman and
Magnus Gustafsson in Saturday's semifinal.
	   Suzuki, ranked 122nd on the ATP Tour coming into the tournament,
reached the main draw by winning three qualifying matches last
weekend.
	   He upset Enqvist, who was the No. 8 seed, in three sets in the
first round and then beat Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen in two straight
to gain his first quarterfinal on the ATP Tour.
	   Before Stockholm, Suzuki had only won two matches on the tour
since 1996. He won three Challenger tournaments this year in the
United States.
	   ``He's a very talented player,'' Martin said. ``He's got a good
serve and an incredible volley. He just neds to improve his seve a
bit to become a great player.''

Czech president urges no delay in EU expansion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czech President Vaclav Havel
warned of delays in integrating former Communist countries into the
European Union, CTK news agency reported Friday.
	   ``I consider the expansion necessary ... the importance of the
historical integration process is unprecedented,'' Havel told CTK.
	   According to the report, Havel spoke in reference to a recent EU
summit in Poertschach, Austria, which voiced some concerns that the
integration efforts could be delayed for technical reasons.
	   ``Amid the technical ... and administrative matters ... the
historical purpose of the integration is being dangerously
forgotten,'' Havel said, adding integration should go hand in hand
with EU reform.
	   Havel found criticism for the Czechs as well, citing a ``lack of
enthusiasm'' for integration and insufficient legislative change.
	   ``Some things cannot be hurried, but there are other things that
could have been done already,'' Havel said, mentioning the reform
of municipal administration as an example.
	   Speaking just days before the one-day official visit of French
Premier Lionel Jospin here next Wednesday, Havel pinned his hopes
on France to make an important move toward integration.
	   ``I think that France could be expected to bring a substantial
contribution (to integration) because it was France which
traditionally ... used to bring interesting spiritual thoughts and
visions to European history,'' Havel told CTK.
	   The Czech Republic is among the first group of former Communist
countries slated for EU integration, also including Poland and
Hungary as well as Slovenia.
	   Although no date has been set, new members are not expected for
admittance before 2003 or even 2005, more than fifteen years after
the demise of communism in the region.

Packers might be struggling, but not like Giants
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY WILNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ If the Green Bay Packers think they're
struggling, they need not look any further than their opponent on
Sunday, the New York Giants, to find a team in a worse fix.
	   The Giants headed into their bye week fresh off a revitalizing
rout of Arizona. They came out of the off week as flat as the
Meadowlands turf, giving Washington its first victory, then falling
16-6 at Dallas.
	   Green Bay hasn't looked much like the team that won the 1996
U.S. National Football League championship and lost in the Super
Bowl last January. The Packers fell 27-20 at Pittsburgh last
weekend, only making the game close in the final minutes.
	   Still, the Pack is 6-3 and solidly in contention for the
playoffs. The Giants (3-6), who won the NFC East Division last
year, have become also-rans in the weak division _ even if Brett
Favre isn't taking that view.
	   ``The Giants are not much different than they were last year,''
Favre said. ``But things happen in this league and it does not
always happen the way you would like it to.''
	   It's certainly not happening the way the Packers envisioned.
They've already lost to the Vikings, who are two games ahead of
them _ the teams meet in Minnesota next weekend _ and looked awful
for most of the Steelers game.
	   ``We had Minnesota in our sights,'' safety LeRoy Butler
lamented. ``But now we have to forget about that.''
	   They might have to forget about running the ball, too, and not
just because the Giants usually handle the rush well. The Packers
are down to three running backs, and the projected starter, Raymont
Harris, hurt his leg in practice Thursday.
	   ``Really, right now, we've got to figure out what kind of
coaches we are, see if we're any good,'' Mike Holmgren said.
	   The Giants haven't looked very good at anything the last two
weeks. Their flop has been one of the biggest in the league this
season.
	   ``Mathematically, we are not eliminated,'' said coach Jim
Fassel, who Holmgren's college roommate at the University of
Southern California (USC). ``Realistically, it put us far enough
behind the 8-ball that I am not going to try to stand around and be
a Pied Piper and make everything sound wonderful when it is not.''
	   While the Packers are trying to stay within sight of Minnesota,
the Vikings are home for Cincinnati on Sunday. If the Giants can
stage an upset, they'll turn their attention to the matchup in the
East between Dallas and Arizona.
	   Also Sunday, it's Miami at Carolina, New England at Buffalo, the
New York Jets at Indianapolis, Philadelphia at Washington,
Pittsburgh at Tennessee, St. Louis at New Orleans, San Francisco at
Atlanta, Seattle at Oakland, Baltimore at San Diego, Tampa Bay at
Jacksonville, and Chicago at Detroit.
	   Denver is at Kansas City on Monday night.
	   Minnesota expects to have Randall Cunningham in the lineup just
six days after he had arthroscopic knee surgery. The NFL's leading
passer could sit out and await the Packers, but that would leave
untested Jay Fiedler at quarterback _ Brad Johnson has a broken
thumb and will be out at least until Dec. 6.
	   Cunningham doesn't want to miss the fun.
	   ``There's something happening here and it's very strong, and
there are a lot of positive vibes going around,'' Cunningham said.
``We're just going to ride them and stay with them, and hopefully
it takes us to our destiny.''
	   The fun would just be starting in the NFC East if Arizona, which
never has been a valid contender, upsets Dallas and ties for the
lead.
	   ``Have we been in the situation of playing for first place 10
games into the season? No,'' Cardinals coach Vince Tobin said.
``But we have been in an awful lot of games where we felt like our
backs were to the wall and we had to win and we had to play well.''

Army of models, designers blitz Sahara Desert
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos TIG101,104,106 &QL; 
 &UR; By GLENN McKENZIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIGUIDIT, Niger (AP) _ In a move bizarre even for the world of
haute couture, flamboyant fashion designers and teen-aged models in
body-hugging tights and tube tops blitz the Sahara Desert.
	   International runway successes parade the latest clothing
creations at an outdoor fashion show Friday in the craggy cliffs
and shifting dunes of Niger, a mainly Muslim country of goat
herders and nomads recovering from a rebellion.
	   Hairdressers, diplomats and cigarette and liquor executives
stood alongside a lanky mix of turban-clad soldiers and miniskirted
models in a sprawling tent city of Tiguidit, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) south of the desert town of Agadez.
	   The fashion show itself, held Friday evening on a 100-foot
(30-meter) stage at the base of a spotlit cliff, was the brainchild
of Alphadi, a Nigerien designer who has found a niche in the elite
circles of Paris.
	   A few of the best-known names in the fashion business including
Paris-based Japanese designer Kenzo and Sudanese-born model Alek
Wek were among the chaotic influx. Also descending on Agadez were
battalions of beggars _ men with twisted limbs and children tugging
on sleeves for coins or pens.
	   Wek, who has been billed by some as the next ``face'' of African
fashion succeeding supermodels like Iman, believed that Africa's
small but growing group of designers need a place to show their
strengths.
	   ``I think that if outsiders will see what there is here in Niger
and Africa as a whole and that can only be good,'' Wek said of
trying raise the profile of designers such as Pepita D from Benin
and retired modeling star Katoucha from Guinea.
	   Other models said they felt shocked by the poverty in the region
and embarrassed by the opulence of the show.
	   The cost of the spectacle was expected to top dlrs 2.5 million _
in Niger, where the average person lives on less than 50 cents a
day _ even though most participants stayed in modest hotel rooms
with no hot water and later tents with sand floors and no showers
at all.
	   Corporate sponsors came through after nearly 10 years of
planning, and tons of lights, cables, generators and other supplies
were trucked in from Cotonou, Benin, a West African coastal city
more than 1,800 kilometers (1,100 miles) away over pitted roads.
	   A male hairdresser in a maroon wig stood in halting contrast to
surly machine-gun toting soldiers.
	   Models rehearsed on the runway in a stinging sandstorm, some
covering their faces with turbans or rode camels.
	   Local artisans and vendors complained the models were spending
their whole time being seen, instead of being tourists.
	   ``When are the real tourists coming?'' asked Aminatou Atta, an
artist from the capital of Niamey who sells batik cloth for a
living. ``I spent a lot of money to get here because I heard there
were going to be thousands of people at this fashion show. But
these pretty girls, you know, I cannot eat pretty girls.''
	   Niger is a country of beautiful desert, mountain and savannah
vistas and a vibrant ethnic mix that includes the light-skinned
Tuaregs, Berber-descended nomads known for their hauntingly
beautiful guitar music, silver-making and colorful traditional
clothing.
	   Stunning clothing is very much part of this society, although
almost no one has seen models or fashion shows before. Unlike in
more conservative Muslim societies, Tuareg women wear brilliantly
striped gowns of sequin that glow in the bright desert sand.
	   Despite its colorful flavor, an ethnic rebellion by Tuareg
leaders from 1992-96 drove tourists away, a situation that has
changed little despite the tapering off of hostilities.
	   Alphadi said he hopes the Sahara fashion show will promote a
change for Niger and help develop Africa's fashion business and the
related textiles industry. His aim is to hold similar shows ever
two or three years.
	   ``This is my dream,'' he said. ``And if you believe it possible
for Africans to be recognized in the fashion world, that's what
will happen.''

Juventus star-forward sidelined for six months
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ A torn left-knee ligament, that will require
surgery in about two weeks, will sideline Juventus of Turin
star-forward Alessandro Del Piero for the rest of the season.
	   The Turin club announced Del Piero's long absence from Serie A
action and from European qualifying games with Italy's national
team following medical examinations performed by a French
specialist.
	   Juventus officials said the examinations by professor Pierre
Chambat in Lyon confirmed the ``worst expectations'' - a compulsory
absence from five to six months.
	   The Italian Serie A ends on May 23.
	   Del Piero's injury, following a collision with a defender of
Udinese during a league match last Sunday, landed a blow to
Juventus' hopes to win the league title for the third consecutive
year.
	   The Turin club, which is owned by the Agnelli family of auto
tycoons, is expected to possibly sign a new forward when the market
reopens in January.
	   The severe knee injury capped an unlucky year for 23-year-old
Del Piero, one of the most imaginative and popular Italian
strikers.
	   He pulled a muscle in the Champions Cup final lost by Juventus
to Real Madrid in May and had a streak of unimpressive performances
with Italy in the World Cup as a result of his questionable form
following the injury.
	   Club officials said Del Piero will undergo surgery by the end of
November, at an undisclosed clinic.

German foreign minister say U.S. air strikes against Iraq could
</HEADLINE>
come next week &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-UN-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Saying Germany's new center-left coalition
government would fully support the United Nations Security Council,
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer on Friday told parliament in Bonn
the United States may carry out air strikes against Iraq as early
as next week.
	   The Greens party minister said that the crisis in Iraq was
``alone the fault of the Iraqi government and criminal rulers whose
methods were rejected by the international community.''
	   The surprise debate over Iraq was raised during a parliament
session on the next budget, after the conservative opposition asked
for an explanation on the new government's stance in the latest
crisis.
	   No one in the international community is willing to accept
``that mass destruct weapons are in the hands of Saddam Hussein,''
Fischer said.
	   Former Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, a Christian Democrat in
the opposition, demanded the new government assure the United
States and Great Britain political and military support in the
event air strikes against Iraq take place, as did the previous
government earlier this year.
	   Former Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of the Free Democrats, now
also in the opposition, appealed to U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan to schedule a trip to Iraq to seek a political solution to
the standoff.
	   Annan has already said that he has no plans to mediate the
latest crisis over U.N. arms inspections.
	   The crisis follows Baghdad's Oct. 31 decision to cut all
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. Since then, the United
States has sent more warships to the Gulf and speculation about
American airstrikes has increased.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ In the worst violence since riots
toppled President Suharto in May, at least five people were killed
Friday when Indonesian security forces battled rock-throwing
protesters and street mobs attacked suspected police informers.
	   Local media reports said possibly several hundred had been
injured in clashes with police, who fired plastic bullets, tear gas
and water cannons at the protesters. Hospitals said their emergency
rooms were full of bleeding students, many in critical condition
with gunshot wounds.
	   Pressed by the bloody protests raging outside, Indonesia's
highest legislative body Friday endorsed a new government blueprint
for the troubled nation.
	   The 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly also named
Suharto in a decree demanding a massive government crackdown on
corruption under his 32-year rule.
	   As thousands of troops and police patrolled outside, the
assembly voted unanimously to pass 11 of 12 reform decrees. A 12th
decree passed 784-123 after a lengthy debate _ the first time in
three decades that the assembly failed to reach total agreement on
an issue.
	   It backed a plan by President B.J. Habibie to hold parliamentary
elections in May or June and to open the ballot to a wide range of
new political parties. It set no election date, however.
	   Assembly members, many of them holdovers from the authoritarian
Suharto era, hailed the decrees as major reforms, pointing to their
demands for greater human rights and economic restructuring.
	   But students and other critics said they did not represent major
democratic change and only entrenched the power of the status quo,
including Habibie, the military, and the ruling Golkar Party.
	   As the assembly met, violence raged in the capital. Mobs burned
tires while baton-wielding soldiers dispersed the crowd. Armored
personnel carriers rumbled along Jakarta's main boulevard, and
troops fired warning shots, chasing thousands of protesters through
Jakarta's downtown area, where offices and shops were closed.
	   Molotov cocktails exploded in flames in front of police lines.
	   Soldiers were seen firing what appeared to be blanks and plastic
bullets into buildings at Atama Jaya Catholic University. Several
students, some bleeding, were removed on stretchers.
	   A morgue official at the nearby Jakarta Hospital, said two
bodies of male students were brought from the university with
gunshot wounds to their chests.
	   Other hospitals reported a steady stream of injured.
	   Cipto Mungunkusomo Hospital received the bodies of one male
student and a civilian security guard, a morgue attendant said.
Both also had gunshot wounds to their chest, he said.
	   In East Jakarta, a mob beat a third man to death in a street
while soldiers looked on. Witnesses reported dozens of other mob
attacks against individuals accused of being police informers.
	   The clashes followed two deaths _ a high school student and a
police officer _ in similar street battles Thursday night in
Jakarta. More than 100 students were hospitalized, some with
serious injuries.
	   The violence since Thursday night was the worst in Jakarta since
riots forced Suharto to quit in May.
	   Late Friday, a smiling Habibie was whisked past the protests in
a heavily guarded motorcade to the Parliament, where he closed the
four-day assembly.
	   He expressed his condolences for the deaths of the student
protesters saying they were the ``victims of the process of
reform'' that would bring Indonesia a better future.
	   Friday's approval of a new political blueprint for Indonesia
comes as the country battles its worst economic crisis in decades.
Inflation, unemployment and poverty rates are soaring.
	   The assembly's aim for total consensus stumbled when the
Islamic-oriented United Development Party refused to put its name
to a decree calling for only a gradual reduction of the 75-seat
military representation in the 500-seat Parliament.
	   The United Development Party, which backs student demands for an
immediate end to the military's political role, staged an
unprecedented protest walkout when the issue was debated.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto had warned that an estimated
30,000 police and troops deployed across the capital would take
``firmer action'' if student protests again got out of control.
	   Clashes continued into the night.

Humble Grant in deep against Jones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASHANTUCKET, Connecticut (AP) _ When they missed a flight
connection in New York, Otis Grant and his small entourage piled
into a friend's car and drove 3 hours to the site of the biggest
boxing match of his career.
	   ``We're not into limos,'' Russ Anber, Grant's trainer, said
Thursday. ``We're not into first-class air tickets. ``We're here to
do business.''
	   The business at hand, according to Anber, is pulling off ``one
of the top 10 upsets in boxing history.''
	   On Saturday night, Grant, a high school recreation counselor
from Montreal who is also the WBO middleweight champion, will fight
for the WBC light heavyweight championship against Roy Jones Jr.
	   Many boxing observers call Jones the best boxer, kilo-for-kilo,
in the world. He a 37-1 record, with 31 knockouts, and has held
titles in three weight classes.
	   Jones' only loss was by disqualification to Montell Griffin
1997, and he knocked Griffin in the first round of the rematch.
	   Grant (31-1-1) is a decided underdog, but he didn't hesitate
before accepting the fight when Jones's proposed meeting with
German Graziano Rocchigiani fell through.
	   The 12-round bout at the Foxwoods Casino Resort will be the
second half of a two-title card. In the first fight, unbeaten Shane
Mosley will defend his IBF lightweight title against James Leija.
	   Grant said the exposure and the chance to fight the best made it
worth the risk.
	   ``I have no trouble moving up two weight classes to fight Roy,''
said the 31-year-old Grant. ``If I put up a good fight and end up
losing, I'll still come out ahead.''
	   Jones agreed to meet Grant at a compromise weight of 170 pounds
(77 kilos), 2 1-2 kilos (five pounds) under the light heavyweight
limit.
	   ``This is a fight between two super-middleweights (76 kilos, 168
pounds),'' Jones said. ``There is no size advantage.''
	   ``If I don't get caught early, I think I can give him a fight,''
Grant said at a news conference.

Twelve AC Milan players in tax evasion probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with AC Milan denying any wrongdoing &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian tax police alleged Friday that 12
present and past players of major league soccer club AC Milan
evaded taxes over a seven-year period.
	   According to news reports, those under investigation are the
trio of Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco
Van Basten, past team captain Franco Baresi, present captain Paolo
Maldini and defender Christian Panucci, now with Real Madrid in the
Spanish league.
	   Others mentioned in the case were former French striker Jean
Pierre Papin, Montenegrin star Dejan Savicevic and Italian
internationals Mauro Tassotti, Gianluigi Lentini, Nando De Napoli
and Stefano Eranio.
	   Court sources indicated that Milan prosecutors must now decide
whether to recommend indictment of players or officials.
	   The Milan club, which is owned by media mogul and former premier
Silvio Berlusconi, denied any wrongdoing while noting it had not
received any formal report about the investigation.
	   ``The club always acted in the full respect of the law,
including taxes,'' the Milan club made public through an official
communiquee.
	   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the investigation
focused on possible tax evasion via under-the-table, multimillion
dollar contracts between 1991 and 1997.
	   Gullit, Van Basten and Rijkaard were part of the Milan soccer
powerhouse which dominated the national and international scene in
the early 90s.
	   Gullit moved to the English Premier League as player-coach of
Chelsea at the end of his Italian career.
	   Rijkaard was recently hired as coach of the Dutch national
soccer team.
	   The case is part of a broad investigation of soccer, rugby, ice
hockey and volleyball teams now or formerly in Berlusconi's
business empire Fininvest.

Juventus coach sought by Inter, Lazio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Struggling Milan powerhouse Internazionale
may sign Marcello Lippi next season to add a successful coach to a
star-studded roster.
	   Inter's president Massimo Moratti on Friday was quoted by
Milan's sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport as saying that he was
considering the possibility of Lippi suceeding Gigi Simoni at Inter
for the 1999-2000 season.
	   ``Lippi is one possibility,'' Moratti said.
	   Lippi, who is the coach of league champion Juventus of Turin,
also is being sought by Lazio of Rome and other clubs with his
contract with La Juve due to expire in June.
	   Moratti's remarks were another blow to Simoni, who repeatedly
has been criticized by the club president and Italian media for
Inter's lackluster play and mixed results this season.
	   Inter, whose roster boasts Ronaldo, Roberto Baggio, Ivan
Zamorano, Youri Djorkaeef and Diego Simeone, is in seventh place in
the league, seven points behind leader Fiorentina, after starting
the season as a title favorite.
	   The team has been also struggling in the European Champions
League and in the Italian Cup.
	   Lippi has been one of the most successful Italian coaches in
recent years, having led Juventus to consecutive league titles and
to three straight European Champions Cup finals.
	   This is his second season at Inter.

UEFA bans Polish club from Europe in ``knife'' incident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Precede WARSAW &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UEFA confirmation, more details, player
suspended. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA said Friday it has banned Polish
club Wisla Krakow from European soccer for one season over an
alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA Cup match last month.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' European soccer's governing body
said in a statement.
	   Police on Friday detained a 19-year-old man in the Oct. 20
incident, in which Italian midfielder Dino Baggio was struck by an
object thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches to close a
head wound.
	   UEFA identified the weapon as a flick knife.
	   UEFA's control and disciplinary committee also suspended Ryszard
Czerwiec of the Polish club for one European match.
	   ``Czerwiec, who was standing next to Baggio at the time of the
incident, picked up the knife and through it back into the crowd,
to prevent the Italian players showing the knife to the referee,''
the statement said.
	   Private Radio Zet said the Wisla fan, identified as Pawel
Michalski, 19, could face up to 10 years in prison for injuring
Baggio. The radio reported prosecutors saying he threw a
switch-blade knife.
	   Krakow prosecutors were not immediately available to confirm the
report and the prosecutor's office was closed Friday afternoon.
	   The teen-ager was also wanted for beating a police officer.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match between AC Parma and Wisla Krakow. The teams tied
1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.
	   Wisla officials, who deny Baggio was struck by a knife, have
offered a zloty 5,000 (dlrs 1,470) reward in the case.

Gulf crisis prompts cancellation of youth tourney in Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The European Under-18 Championship qualifying
tournament scheduled to take place in Israel next week has been
postponed because of security concerns, a European soccer official
said Friday.
	   ``It was a political decision ... there's a political crisis in
the world right now,'' UEFA spokesman Massimo Gonella said in
Geneva.
	   UEFA canceled the events Thursday after the English team said it
would not attend because of the tense situation in the Gulf, the
Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post said.
	   The United States has been stepping up preparations for a
military strike against Iraq. During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired
39 Scud missiles with conventional warheads at Israeli cities.
	   England, Israel, Andorra and Spain were to compete in the
tournament.
	   A new date and venue have not yet been announced. The finals are
scheduled to be played in Sweden next summer.

Saddam says open to `any initiative' that would end sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with Saddam saying he does not want
crisis, open to initiative to end sanctions, Clinton calling on
Iraq to reverse decision. No pickup.
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-105
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In his first statement since the start of
the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections, President Saddam Hussein
said Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and would accept
``positively any initiative'' that would lift U.N. sanctions.
	   But U.S. President Clinton declared the standoff would end only
with a decision by Iraq to resume its cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now
by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM,'' Clinton said.
	   His warning came shortly after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Iraq to ``reverse course or face the
consequences.''
	   The statements suggested that both sides were no closer to a
compromise that would avert a threatened U.S. attack on Iraq. They
mirrored past declarations made since the crisis began in August _
and offered little room for compromise.
	   In Baghdad, there were widening fears that a U.S. military
strike was imminent. Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations and
shoppers found some prices up in Baghdad's crowded markets Friday.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, selling
vegetables in downtown Baghdad. ``But it's not about any kind of
aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money to buy
food.''
	   Still, the mood seemed defiant, reflecting the government's
efforts to forge a united front against the U.N. sanctions, which
were imposed eight years ago after it invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her
four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   Preachers at Friday prayers in the nation's mosques called on
Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss of
support in its confrontation over the inspections.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   Saddam's statement marked his first since the crisis began.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as saying his
decisions Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 to restrict the work of U.N.
inspectors ``were intended to get responses to Iraq's legal
demands.''
	   He didn't elaborate, but apparently was talking about Iraq's
often-stated demand for a U.N. Security Council statement pledging
an end to sanctions.
	   Saddam added that ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative
that meets these just and balanced demands.''
	   This, he said, required that the Security Council and the United
States ``commit themselves to the letter and spirit of the
resolutions as Iraq has done over the past eight years.''
	   The agency said Saddam spoke with the Russian ambassador,
Nikolai Kartouzov, who delivered letters from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Russia and China have urged the U.N. Security Council to ease
the sanctions to reward Iraq for its compliance to date with U.N.
resolutions enacted after the 1991 Gulf War that call for the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, and since Aug. 5, has restricted
the activities of weapons inspectors as a way to push its demands
for lifting the sanctions.
	   The agency quoted Saddam as telling Kartouzov that Iraq took the
action ``not to create a crisis or stop cooperating with the
Security Council but to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.''
	   In other developments:
	   _ Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf criticized a U.N.
decision to evacuate 103 weapons inspectors and about a third of
its 450 relief workers because of growing fears of a U.S. strike.
	   In a letter to Friday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, he
said the evacuation ``contributed to the negative atmosphere'' and
that the United States was preparing for an attack.
	   _ U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said oil was being exported normally
and that ships carrying Vietnamese rice and Australian wheat were
being unloaded at the southern Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr.
	   _ Hans von Sponeck, the director of U.N. humanitarian programs
in Iraq, said Friday that food distribution under an exemption to
U.N. sanctions has continued despite the evacuation of aid workers.

Prosecutor charges news agency with libel over doping allegation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A prosecutor on Friday charged the
Finnish news agency STT with libel for reporting that top Finnish
Nordic skier Jari Rasanen had bought illegal growth hormones.
	   On Jan. 21, STT said that Rasanen had bought growth hormones
that are banned for competing athletes. The hormones had been
stolen from a hospital in Sweden, the report said.
	   STT also claimed that Finnish Ski Federation officials had been
planning to buy large amounts of the performance-enhancing
substances.
	   However, after investigations in Finland and Sweden, Finnish
police said they found no evidence of either Rasanen or Finnish ski
officials being involved in, or planning, the purchase of hormones.
	   STT has not given sources for its report. In January, it said it
would reveal the names of the federation officials and details of
Rasanen's alleged purchase, but so far has not done so.
	   Helsinki District Prosecutor Maarit Loimukoski charged the
writer of the STT report, Johann Aatsalo-Sallinen, and
editor-in-chief Kari Vaisanen with libel.
	   Neither would immediately comment on the charge.
	   Rasanen, who won a relay silver medal at the Nordic World
Chamionships last year, has vehemently denied he has been involved
in the use, purchase or planned purchase of growth hormones.
	   Rasanen has threatened to sue STT for up to 2 million markkaa
(dlrs 390,000). The Finnish Ski Federation has also said it will
take the news agency to court.
	   Since publishing the allegations, STT has come under criticism
from other media, politicians and its owners, Finland's leading
newspapers.
	   Federation chairman and former Prime Minister Esko Aho said he
had lost confidence in the news agency which has a semi-official
position in Finland, and often is the government's main channel for
the dissemination of information.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Yugoslav official ruled out
involving separatist Albanian guerrillas Friday in peace plans for
Kosovo, urging the resumption of talks with more moderate ethnic
Albanian leaders.
	   A statement issued by Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic and carried by
the Tanjug news agency rejected the possibility of the Kosovo
Liberation Army taking part in the peace process, saying ``there is
no place for extremists, terrorism, abductions, killings, armed
attacks.''
	   At talks in Belgrade with European Union envoy Wolfgang
Petritsch, Lilic said authorities are abiding by an Oct. 12
agreement meant to end the crisis in the province in Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   While the KLA was not part of the deal negotiated by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic last
month, the guerrilla group says it is respecting a cease fire and
responding only when attacked.
	   Serb authorities claim the guerrillas are provoking fights,
hoping for a massive response which will revive the threat of NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslav targets.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, meanwhile, NATO ambassadors approved plans
Friday for a French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand
ready to rescue unarmed civilians monitoring the peace deal in
Kosovo should they come under threat. The force is called Joint
Guarantor.
	   Two killings, reported Friday, continued to fuel tensions in
Kosovo.
	   A Yugoslav soldier was killed on the road connecting Pristina
and Prizren and two others were wounded, said a diplomatic observer
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Though details were unclear, the crew from Associated Press
Television News said they had heard bursts of gunfire coming from
the region, between Suva Reka and Stimlje villages, about 30 miles
(50 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. The APTN crew saw two tanks
and several trucks full of soldiers in the vicinity.
	   The continued shootings have chipped away at hopes for a
solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and ethnic Albanians.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists that began in
February has left hundreds dead and made thousands of people
refugees.
	   In comments Friday, Kosovo Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova told
Serbs _ the minority in the province _ they had nothing to fear
from the October agreement.
	   ``All Serb interests in Kosovo will be protected,'' he told
reporters.

Swedish commander warns of effects of defense budget cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Sweden's supreme military commander
said Friday that a stingy defense budget could undermine the
country's defense capabilities and severely damage its defense
industries.
	   In an assessment of the effects of the government budget
proposal of 44 billion kronor (dlrs 5.8 billion) for defense next
year, commander Owe Wiktorin said that was about 3 billion kronor
(dlrs 400 million) short.
	   The military could try to save the money by not calling many of
the young men who usually are obliged to spend time in national
service, by reducing the use of Swedish troops in international
operations, and by cancelling orders for new equipment, Wiktorin
said.
	   The government calls for the military to keep defense
capabilities at the current level, even with a reduced budget,
''which is expecting magic,'' Wiktorin said, according to the
Swedish news agency TT.

Juventus star-forward out for remainder of season
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TURIN, Italy (AP) _ Juventus forward Alessandro Del Piero will
miss the remainder of the Italian season with a torn a ligament in
his left knee that will require surgery in about two weeks, the
club announced Friday.
	   Juventus made the announcement following examinations by a
French specialist Pierre Chambat in Lyon, where he confirmed the
``worst expectations.''
	   Del Piero injured the knee in a collision with an Udinese
defender in last Sunday's league match, delivering a sever blow to
Juventus' hopes of a third consecutive ``scudetto'' or Italian
league title.
	   The Turin club, which is owned by the Agnelli family of auto
tycoons, is expected to possibly sign a new forward when the
transfer market re-opens in January.
	   The injury capped an unlucky year for 23-year-old Del Piero, one
of the more creative and popular Italian strikers.
	   He pulled a muscle in the Champions Cup final lost by Juventus
to Real Madrid in May and had a streak of unimpressive performances
with Italy in the World Cup.
	   Club officials said Del Piero will undergo surgery by the end of
November at an undisclosed clinic.

Ukraine introducing unorthodox taxes to cover budget holes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine wants to tax its increasing number
of mobile phone users to increase tax revenues to meet conditions
for an International Monetary Fund loan, the tax chief said Friday.
	   The proposed tax is one of tactics the government is trying to
boost taxes, including locking debtor company executives in a
Cabinet room and forbidding Ukrainian companies from depositing
money in off-shore zones.
	   The government has to raise an additional 500 million hryvna
(dlrs 145 million) in taxes in December, up from a monthly average
of 1.8 (dlrs 525 million) billion hryvna, to keep its 1998 budget
balanced, State Tax Administration chief Mykola Azarov said.
	   Ukraine has to accumulate money urgently to keep the 1998 budget
deficit at 2.5 percent, a key condition the IMF set for disbursing
a recently approved dlrs 2.2 billion loan.
	   The former Soviet republic also has to regularly pay off parts
of its mounting foreign debt, which is now dlrs 10.9 billion.
	   However, tax collection in Ukraine has been far below target for
years, with companies refusing to pay what they call overly high
rates.
	   Companies' tax debt skyrocketed to more than 11 billion hryvna
(dlrs 3.2 billion) in 1998, according to government data.
	   The Cabinet has responded to massive tax evasion with new taxes
and pressure on debtors, from threats to confiscate their property
to arresting company accounts.
	   On Friday, Azarov said the government was working out a tax on
the country's 130,000 mobile phone users and three mobile phone
operating companies, who he said were contributing practically
nothing to the government.
	   He did not say how much the tax would be or how much money it
might bring in.
	   The Cabinet announced plans Thursday to ban Ukrainian companies
from depositing their money in off-shore zones, a common way of
avoiding Ukrainian taxes.

IOC official says federations could face punishment
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A senior IOC official warned Friday that sports
federations could lose their TV revenues or be kicked out of the
Olympics if they refuse to adopt common anti-doping policies.
	   The International Olympic Committee is proposing a sigle medical
code embracing common anti-doping rules, procedures and sanctions,
and wants all sports federations to comply.
	   The IOC hopes the single code can be approved by the federations
when they meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Nov. 27. The November
meeting is a prelude to the worldwide anti-doping summit in
Lausanne in February.
	   ``I don't think we will have to threaten (the federations), but
if the organizations refuse to cooperate and the world conference
isn't a success, they will feel pressure from the IOC,'' IOC
executive board member Thomas Bach said.
	   ``Federations, who refuse, could lose their part of Olympic TV
money,'' he said. ``Sports, or at least some disciplines, could
disappear out of the Olympic program.''
	   Despite promises five years ago that a unified anti-doping
policy would be adopted by the world's sports federations, many
still pursue their own policies.
	   Among those cited are FIFA, soccer's governing body, and
cycling's UCI, which was rocked by this summer's Tour de France
scandal.
	   ``I don't think the federations will refuse the code,'' Bach
told the German sports news agency SID. ``FIFA and (its president)
Sepp Blatter have already agreed.''
	   Bach also dismissed suggestions that the fight against doping
should be handed to the state because the problem is overwhelming
sports bodies.
	   ``Sport has to keep the ability to control and punish
athletes,'' he said. ``The state can't take that over.
	   ``But the state will have to deal with the athlete's
environment. Doctors, who are proven to have doped (athletes),
should face fines and in extreme cases, threatened with the loss of
their license. Drug dealers belong in the courts.''
	   Some officials say sports lack the means to deal with the
spreading doping problem and that athletes need to face legal
repercussions when they use banned substances.
	   ``I'm of the opinion, the athlete has to be punished for what he
does just like any other citizen. Sport is pushing its limits with
the doping problems,'' Helmut Digel of the IAAF, track's governing
body, told the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ With strikers Alessandro Del Piero and Pierluigi
Casiraghi unavailabe due to season-ending knee injuries, Italian
national team coach Dino Zoff called in a trio of young forwards
Friday for next week's friendly against Spain.
	   Filippo Inzaghi, Francesco Totti and Nicola Ventola _ all under
25, have played only portions of games with the Azzurri.
	   The 20-man roster did not include veteran Roberto Baggio, who
has not fully recovered his form following a knee injury, and
Italy's World Cup keeper Gianluca Pagliuca, dropped by Zoff despite
his impressive performances with Inter Milan this season.
	   Real Madrid defender Christian Panucci was the only expatriate
called by Zoff, who replaced Cesare Maldini following the World
Cup.
	   The Italy-Spain match, pitt two early round losers at France
'98, will be played in Salerno, near Naples.
	   The Arechi stadium of Salerno was the scene of the explosion
which injured a Belgian off-field official during a UEFA Cup game
between Fiorentina and Grasshoppers last week.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Italian Roster &QC; 
	   Goalkeepers: Gianluigi Buffon (Parma); Angelo Peruzzi

	   Developments Friday in the crisis with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspections:
	   ___
	   In his first public statement since the start of the crisis,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein asserts he is not trying to stop
cooperation with the United Nations and will accept ``positively
any initiative'' that leads to the lifting of U.N. sanctions.
	   ___
	   Both U.S. President Bill Clinton and U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright insist airstrikes can only be averted if Iraq
rescinds its decision to halt arms inspections.
	   Clinton says Saddam ``has it within his hands to end this crisis
now'' by resuming cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors. ``None of
us can tolerate an Iraq free to develop weapons of mass destruction
with impunity,'' he says.
	   Albright warns Saddam to ``reverse course or face the
consequences,'' adding there is little room for democracy.
	   ``We all want a peaceful outcome,'' she says. But ``one by one,
the diplomatic options have been rebuffed.''
	   ___
	   Official Iraqi newspapers ignore Thursday's declaration from
eight Arab foreign ministers that Iraq would be ``held responsible
for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of U.N.
inspectors. Instead, they publish articles claiming there is
worldwide condemnation of American threats.
	   ___
	   Thousands of Iraqis line up outside gasoline stations, fearing
U.S. airstrikes could interrupt the nation's fuel supply.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In his first statement since the start of
the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections, President Saddam Hussein
said Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and would accept
``positively any initiative'' that would lift U.N. sanctions.
	   But U.S. President Clinton declared the standoff would end only
with a decision by Iraq to resume its cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now
by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM,'' Clinton said.
	   His warning came shortly after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Iraq to ``reverse course or face the
consequences.''
	   The statements suggested that both sides were no closer to a
compromise that would avert a threatened U.S. attack on Iraq. They
mirrored past declarations made since the crisis began in August _
and offered little room for compromise.
	   In Baghdad, there were widening fears that a U.S. military
strike was imminent. Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations and
shoppers found some prices up in Baghdad's crowded markets Friday.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, selling
vegetables in downtown Baghdad. ``But it's not about any kind of
aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money to buy
food.''
	   Still, the mood seemed defiant, reflecting the government's
efforts to forge a united front against the U.N. sanctions, which
were imposed eight years ago after it invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her
four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   Preachers at Friday prayers in the nation's mosques called on
Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss of
support in its confrontation over the inspections.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   Saddam's statement marked his first since the crisis began.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as saying his
decisions Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 to restrict the work of U.N.
inspectors ``were intended to get responses to Iraq's legal
demands.''
	   He didn't elaborate, but apparently was talking about Iraq's
often-stated demand for a U.N. Security Council statement pledging
an end to sanctions.
	   Saddam added that ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative
that meets these just and balanced demands.''
	   This, he said, required that the Security Council and the United
States ``commit themselves to the letter and spirit of the
resolutions as Iraq has done over the past eight years.''
	   The agency said Saddam spoke with the Russian ambassador,
Nikolai Kartouzov, who delivered letters from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Russia and China have urged the U.N. Security Council to ease
the sanctions to reward Iraq for its compliance to date with U.N.
resolutions enacted after the 1991 Gulf War that call for the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, and since Aug. 5, has restricted
the activities of weapons inspectors as a way to push its demands
for lifting the sanctions.
	   The agency quoted Saddam as telling Kartouzov that Iraq took the
action ``not to create a crisis or stop cooperating with the
Security Council but to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.''
	   In other developments:
	   _ Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf criticized a U.N.
decision to evacuate 103 weapons inspectors and about a third of
its 450 relief workers because of growing fears of a U.S. strike.
	   In a letter to Friday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, he
said the evacuation ``contributed to the negative atmosphere'' and
that the United States was preparing for an attack.
	   _ U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said oil was being exported normally
and that ships carrying Vietnamese rice and Australian wheat were
being unloaded at the southern Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr.
	   _ Hans von Sponeck, the director of U.N. humanitarian programs
in Iraq, said Friday that food distribution under an exemption to
U.N. sanctions has continued despite the evacuation of aid workers.

Rosset slams women's tennis: `Huge money with no big effort'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICK WADHAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Bristling against criticism that men's tennis is
boring, Marc Rosset on Friday called women players weak and said
they were making ``huge money with no big effort.''
	   ``Maybe four or five girls on the tour'' are powerful players,
``but I think the rest of the women are not in good shape,'' said
Rosset, who advanced to the semifinals of the Kremlin Cup on
Friday, beating Jan Kroslak in straight sets.
	   The men's game has been criticized for lacking a charismatic
star. Meanwhile, the women's game has several exciting young
players like Martina Hingis, Anna Kournikova and the Williams
sisters _ Venus and Serena.
	   Rosset begged to differ.
	   ``I don't think Pete Sampras, to stay No. 1, has plenty of time
to go for shopping or sightseeing and to (be a) fashion model on
the street,'' he said. ``So if (the women) have time, I think it's
because the tennis is really weak.''
	   Rosset wasn't quite as harsh as former Wimbledon champion
Richard Krajicek, who once alleged that ``80 percent of the top 100
women are lazy, fat pigs.''
	   But he came close.
	   ``I would say that they are making huge money with no big
effort,'' Rosset said. ``I mean, compared to a guy who's ranked 25
or 20 in the world, he has to practice hard and he's really tough.
And I think for the women to be (at the same position) _ it's much
easier.''

Air France flight attendants set to strike Nov. 17, 18
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French national carrier Air France said Friday that
flight attendants' unions have called a strike for next Tuesday and
Wednesday that will ground a large percentage of domestic and
international flights.
	   Air France said in a statement it would assure 55 percent of
long-haul flights and 60 percent of short and medium-distance
flights during the two-day strike.
	   Flight attendants' unions said the strike had to do with
salaries, but they provided no further information.
	   A 10-day pilots strike in early June cost the company dlrs 166
million before the main pilots union accepted an offer of stock in
exchange for pay.
	   The strike proved a public relations disaster for the company
since it coincided with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of
people to watch the World Cup.
	   The pilots had been protesting 500 million francs (dlrs 83
million) in proposed salary cuts. Air France had said the cuts were
needed to provide capital to modernize the airline, which was saved
from bankruptcy in 1993 but reported profits in 1996 and 1997.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Yugoslav official ruled out
involving separatist Albanian guerrillas Friday in peace plans for
Kosovo, urging the resumption of talks with more moderate ethnic
Albanian leaders.
	   A statement issued by Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic and carried by
the Tanjug news agency rejected the possibility of the Kosovo
Liberation Army taking part in the peace process, saying ``there is
no place for extremists, terrorism, abductions, killings, armed
attacks.''
	   At talks in Belgrade with European Union envoy Wolfgang
Petritsch, Lilic said authorities are abiding by an Oct. 12
agreement meant to end the crisis in the province in Serbia, the
dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   While the KLA was not part of the deal negotiated by U.S. envoy
Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic last
month, the guerrilla group says it is respecting a cease fire and
responding only when attacked.
	   Serb authorities claim the guerrillas are provoking fights,
hoping for a massive response which will revive the threat of NATO
airstrikes against Yugoslav targets.
	   In Brussels, Belgium, meanwhile, NATO ambassadors approved plans
Friday for a French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand
ready to rescue unarmed civilians monitoring the peace deal in
Kosovo should they come under threat. The force is called Joint
Guarantor.
	   Two killings, reported Friday, continued to fuel tensions in
Kosovo.
	   A Yugoslav soldier was killed on the road connecting Pristina
and Prizren and two others were wounded, said a diplomatic observer
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Though details were unclear, the crew from Associated Press
Television News said they had heard bursts of gunfire coming from
the region, between Suva Reka and Stimlje villages, about 30 miles
(50 kilometers) southwest of Pristina. The APTN crew saw two tanks
and several trucks full of soldiers in the vicinity.
	   Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness
said Serb police opened fire on a group of ethnic Albanian men and
children Thursday, killing one of the men and injuring another. The
Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, also
carried the report.

 &UR; Britain again warns Iraq on compliance &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATING with comment from foreign secretary

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Friday that
Saddam Hussein is facing the 11th hour in the latest weapons
inspections crisis, but that it is not too late for him to avoid
military action.
	   In his first statement since the start of the dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections, the Iraqi president said he was not trying to
create a crisis and would accept ``positively any initiative'' that
would lift U.N. sanctions.
	   ``We are at the 11th hour,'' Cook said. ``If he wants a
diplomatic solution, he should act now.''
	   Cook said that all Saddam has to do is announce he is letting
U.N. weapons inspectors get back to work.
	   Earlier Friday, Prime Minister Tony Blair said it would be
``disastrous'' if the United States and Britain backed down in the
current confrontation with Iraq.
	   Both nations have threatened military action if Saddam does not
resume cooperation with the inspection teams.
	   ``If we do not act in those circumstances and he is allowed to
break the agreement without any comeback at all from the
international community, the consequences would be disastrous for
us,'' Blair said in an interview with British Broadcasting Corp.
Radio Scotland.
	   Blair added: ``But if we do not act, if we let Saddam Hussein
break his word and develop these weapons of chemical and biological
warfare, do it in breach of the agreement he has made with the UN,
the agreements he has made at the end of the Gulf war, then we will
pay a heavy price for that.''

	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA said Friday it has banned Polish
club Wisla Krakow from European soccer for one season over an
alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA Cup match last month.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' European soccer's governing body
said in a statement.
	   Wisla president Ludwik Mietta-Mikolajewicz called the decision
``too severe and harmful'' and said immediatley the club would
appeal to UEFA.
	   Police on Friday detained a 19-year-old man in the Oct. 20
incident, in which Italian soccer star Dino Baggio was struck by an
object thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches to close a
head wound.
	   UEFA identified the weapon as a flick knife.
	   UEFA's control and disciplinary committee also suspended Ryszard
Czerwiec of the Polish club for one European match.
	   ``Czerwiec, who was standing next to Baggio at the time of the
incident, picked up the knife and through it back into the crowd,
to prevent the Italian players showing the knife to the referee,''
the statement said.
	   Private Radio Zet said the Wisla fan, identified as Pawel
Michalski, 19, could face up to 10 years in prison for injuring
Baggio. The radio reported prosecutors saying he threw a
switch-blade knife.
	   Krakow prosecutors were not immediately available to confirm the
report and the prosecutors office was closed Friday afternoon.
	   The teen-ager was also wanted for beating a policeman.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match between AC Parma and Wisla Krakow. The teams tied
1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.
	   Wisla officials, who deny Baggio was struck by a knife, have
offered a zloty 5,000 (dlrs 1,470) reward in the case.

United prepares for Interamerican Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HERNDON, Virginia (AP) _ Not that many Americans will notice,
but U.S. soccer fans will be paying keen interest Saturday when
D.C. United tries to score yet another big goal for the fledgling
Major League Soccer in the Interamerican Cup.
	   D.C. United is the first U.S. team ever to play in the annual
two-leg championship between the CONCACAF and South America's club
champions.
	   The first leg will be played Saturday at Washington's RFK
Stadium, with Brazilian Vasco da Gama's ``home'' leg scheduled for
Dec. 5 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
	   ``We think it's important to give a good showing,'' said United
coach Bruce Arena, who was recently named the U.S. national team
coach.
	   The Interamerican Cup will end Arena's three-year tenure with
United.
	   ``I'm certainly going to miss my association with the club, but
this is about the players. This isn't about me,'' Arena said.
	   United captured the first-ever MLS titles in 1996 and 1997 and
finished runner-up to the Chicago Fire in last month's championship
game. United advanced to the Interamerican Cup after beating Toluca
of Mexico 1-0 in the finals of the CONCACAF Champions Cup in
August.
	   ``It's a good test of where this team is and hopefully it will
be a good measuring stick for where (Major League Soccer) is,''
said United defender Jeff Agoos.
	   Vasco da Gama qualified by winning the Copa Libertadores in
August.
	   The Rio de Janeiro club is favored to win the Interamerican Cup,
but to United's advantage is Vasco da Gama's focus on winning the
current world club championship, the Toyota Cup.
	   Vasco da Gama will make a 16-hour flight to Japan after
Saturday's game to train for a Dec. 2 meeting in Tokyo against
European Cup winner Real Madrid. It will then return to the United
States on the morning of Dec. 4, a little more than a day before
the second leg.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Communist lawmaker whose anti-Semitic remarks
have provoked outrage is under a separate investigation for alleged
calls for the violent ouster of the Russian government, Russia's
security chief said Friday.
	   Many prominent Russians have expressed indignation over speeches
by lawmaker Albert Makashov, who blamed the country's problems on
``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews. Israel's ambassador to
Russia said Thursday that the attacks were an insult to the entire
Israeli nation.
	   The chief of Russia's Federal Security Service, Vladimir Putin,
said Friday that Moscow city prosecutors had officially launched a
probe against Makashov. But prosecutors said the investigation
dealt only with calls for the government's ouster made by several
politicians at public rallies _ and didn't specifically name
Makashov.
	   Calling for violent change of the government is illegal in
Russia.
	   President Boris Yeltsin has scolded his government for a slow
response to ``ethnic and political extremism'' and urged Prosecutor
General Yuri Skuratov and other law enforcement officials to be
more resolute in combating it.
	   The Communist Party refused last month to condemn Makashov's
remarks, prompting more outrage and calls to ban the party.
	   On Friday, the Communist-dominated State Duma, the lower house
of parliament, failed again to censure Makashov.
	   The house adopted a vague measure that chides unspecified
lawmakers for ``inciting ethnic tension.'' But the measure, which
passed 303-34, doesn't contain any specific reference to Makashov
or anti-Semitism.
	   Another resolution, proposed by liberal lawmakers, that
specifically condemned Makashov's remarks, was rejected by the Duma
on Friday.
	   ``Makashov's words reflect the opinion of his party comrades,''
said Yelena Mizulina of the liberal Yabloko faction, who proposed
the second resolution.
	   Russia's Jewish Congress issued a statement on Friday expressing
``bewilderment'' at the government's failure to take action against
Makashov.
	   ``The anti-Semitic statements made by this politician, a member
of a party that is trying to win a respectable position in the eyes
of the Russians and the international community, are ugly and
dangerous,'' said the statement carried by the Interfax news
agency.
	   ``The situation is aggravated by the fact that the Communist
majority in the Duma is effectively defending a man who is
borrowing his ideas from the archives of the Third Reich,'' the
statement said.
	   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev also condemned
Makashov's remarks, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``This is serious,'' Gorbachev said. ``There should be no
division into first-class and second-class citizens in our society
if we want Russia to have a good future.''
	   Russia's Constitution forbids statements that ``incite ethnic
strife,'' but few people have been punished for making such
remarks.
	   Putin, the security chief, said he would urge prosecutors to
bring charges against Makashov for his anti-Semitic remarks.
	   Makashov enjoys immunity from prosecution as a lawmaker.

Jordanian opposition party denounces U.S. threat to strike Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-UN

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's largest opposition group condemned
Friday the U.S. threats to strike Iraq, saying such an attack would
be a ``Crusader-Zionist'' blow against Arabs and Muslims.
	   The fundamentalist Islamic Action Front urged Arab and Muslim
countries ``to refuse and condemn the American aggression and
prevent the use of their territories as bases for American
forces.''
	   The U.S. and Britain have moved forces to the Gulf and
threatened to attack Iraq if it does not reverse its decision to
block the work of U.N. inspectors charged with overseeing the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The front, the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood Movement,
said in a statement said that these threats were ``a joint
Crusader-Zionist war on all Arab and Muslim resurrection forces.''
	   The front appealed to Muslims to ``confront the coming assault''
and called on Arab legislatures to press their governments to
``defy the American scheme which aims to destroy the nation and its
fortunes.''
	   The statement stopped short of calling for pro-Iraqi
demonstrations. This week the Jordanian government issued a ban on
such protests.
	   During the previous Iraq-U.N. standoff in February, the front
and other groups defied a government ban and staged pro-Iraq
protests in southern Jordan that turned violent. One person was
killed and 24 others were injured in the riots.
	   The front is highly critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East,
saying it is biased towards Israel and bent on controlling Arab oil
wealth.

	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Argentine President Carlos Menem said Pope
John Paul II told him Friday that he is counting on a just decision
on the fate of Augusto Pinochet, Chile's former dictator.
	   The Vatican announcement of the private meeting gave no details.
	   But Menem, meeting later with reporters, said he and the pontiff
discussed the dilemma over Pinochet, who was arrested in London on
Oct. 16 and is awaiting a decision by Britain's highest court on
Spain's request for extradition. A Spanish judge wants Pinochet
tried for the deaths of Spaniards.
	   Menem told reporters that the pope ``was counting on a just
decision by those who are intervening in the problem.''
	   The pope, according to the Argentine president, considers
paramount ``the maintenance of peace and democracy in Chile.''
	   Menem earlier this month was honored by the Vatican for work in
favor of families and peace.
	   Menem later attended a prayer service led by the pope Friday
evening in the Argentine national church in Rome.

Combined British-Irish team heads for Chile

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ A week after a combined Britain and
Ireland women's team pulled out of a golf tournament in Chile
because of safety concerns, the men's team traveled Friday to the
same event.
	   The men headed for the World Amateur Golf Team Championship
despite fact that Britain's highest court has yet to rule on the
legality of the arrest in London last month of former Chilean
dictator Gen. Augosto Pinochet.
	   Last week the Ladies Golf Union elected not to play in Chile,
following the advice of Britain's Foreign and Commonwealth Office
	   ``The advice from Santiago is that it's OK,'' Peter McEvoy, the
non-playing captain, said on Friday.
	   ``We have also taken comfort from the fact that a tennis
tournament featuring Spaniards this week has not been disrupted.''
	   The British-Irish team members for the tournament, beginning
Thursday, are: England's Gary Wolstenholme and Luke Donald, Lorne
Kelly of Scotland and Ireland's Paddy Gribben.

Chile asks Supreme Court to takeover lawsuits against Pinochet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Britain-Pinochet &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile's government on Friday asked the
Supreme Court to appoint a special justice to take over 12 lawsuits
against Gen. Augusto Pinochet now being handled by a lower court
judge.
	   The move appeared to demonstrate that even if Pinochet returns
home from London, where a court is deciding whether to extradite
him to Spain, he would still face trial.
	   Chief Justice Roberto Davila said that the Court's 21 members
``carefully analyzed'' the foreign ministry request and were
expected to decide early next week.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a warrant from a
Spanish judge wanting to try him for genocide, torture and murder.
Britain's highest court was deciding whether he has immunity from
prosecution as a former chief of state.
	   Fernandez said it was ``especially timely'' to request a special
magistrate while Britain's House of Lords was deliberating.
	   The appointment of a Supreme Court justice paves the way for
Chile to request Pinochet's extradition in case the Lords rule that
he does not have immunity.
	   Chilean legal experts believe an extradition request by Chile
should take precedence over those from Spain or other European
nations who also want to try the 82-year-old former dictator,
because he is a Chilean and the alleged crimes were committed in
Chile.
	   During his 17-year rule, an estimated 3,000 suspected dissidents
were killed or disappeared. Most were Chilean, but some were
citizens of other nations that are also seeking his extradition.
	   There are currently 12 lawsuits against Pinochet, who seized
power in 1973 and ruled until 1990. They were filed by victims of
repression, the Communist Party and the National Association of
Journalists.
	   All the suits are being handled by judge Juan Guzman of the
Santiago Court of Appeals, whom the foreign ministry wants replaced
by a Supreme Court justice. Acting Foreign Minister Mariano
Fernandez said appointing a Supreme Court Justice ``emphasizes our
rejection of the (foreign) intervention.''
	   Trying Pinochet at home, however, would face some complex
hurdles, as he has wide immunity as a member of the Chilean senate,
and is further protected by an amnesty law he issued during his
regime.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana said Friday
that U.S. authorities should have warned Colombia that one of its
air force planes was taking off for Florida carrying almost a ton
of cocaine.
	   ``Why, if they knew about this cargo...didn't they tell us
first?'' Pastrana told reporters. They were his first public
comments on what has been an international embarrassment for his
three-month old administration.
	   ``We're truly sad that an incident like this once again
blemishes the image of an entire country, '' said Pastrana, who
took office vowing to step up Colombia's fight against drug
trafficking.
	   In 1996, Colombian authorities seized eight pounds (3 1/2
kilograms) of heroin in an air force plane preparing to take
then-President Ernesto Samper to a U.N. General Assembly meeting in
New York.
	   In the latest scandal, U.S. Customs officials disclosed Tuesday
they had discovered 1,639 pounds (743.5 kilos) of cocaine hidden in
a Colombian air force cargo plane at Fort Lauderdale's
international airport. The C-130 Hercules was on a routine supply
run, officials said.
	   U.S. Customs officials, who did not return calls seeking a
reaction to Pastrana's complaints, have not said whether they knew
the cocaine was on board before it left Colombia, or whether they
informed Colombia's government.
	   In his comments Friday, Pastrana also questioned U.S.
authorities for seizing the plane at the Florida airport, instead
of trying to gain more information by tracking the shipment to its
final destination.
	   The airplane's six-man crew remained in the United States,
undergoing questioning by U.S. authorities, Colombian officials
said.
	   In Colombia, the seizure has led to multiple arrests and a
command shakeup in the 12,000-member air force.
	   Federal prosecutor on Thursday detained six air force members,
including Maj. Gonzalo Noguera, the intelligence chief of the
Bogota military airport from which the plane took off, a lieutenant
and four aviation technicians. Noguera and two other officers,
airport commander Col. Arturo Duenas and his second-in-command, Lt.
Col Jorge Leal, have been forced into retirement.
	   Air force commander Gen. Jose Manuel Sandoval resigned and was
replaced by his former deputy, Gen. Hector Fabio Velasco.
	   Authorities have not said to what extent they believe drug
traffickers have infiltrated the air force, or whether the officers
forced into retirement were directly involved in the seized cocaine
shipment.
	   Even if they were not, Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda said
Friday, there's no doubt that there were ``serious and very
delicate failures that cannot be tolerated.''

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund announced
approval Friday of a long-expected dlrs 41.5 billion rescue package
for Brazil designed to stop global financial turmoil from spreading
to Latin America.
	   Under the program, Brazil becomes the first recipient of a new
sort of aid proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton in which
countries following IMF-approved policies can get access to large
lines of credit they can draw on as needed.
	   The package is to assure financial markets that Brazil will have
sufficient funds to pay its international obligations as it puts
its fiscal house in order.
	   ``The Brazilian authorities and an IMF team have successfully
concluded negotiations on a strong three-year program of economic
and financial reform,'' said IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus.
	   Camdessus said that as part of the agreement, Brazil committed
itself to reducing its dlrs 65 billion budget deficit through
spending cuts and other measures.
	   The IMF will release dlrs 5 billion to Brazil upon formal
approval of the package by the IMF board, probably in early
December. In what IMF called an innovative approach, dlrs 5 billion
will made available on a floating basis in the first half of next
year whenever Brazil decides it needs the money.
	   ``The way is now open for the international community to provide
financial support to Brazil that will enhance market confidence in
the government's economic policies and help ensure the success of
the country's program,'' Camdessus said.
	   Camdessus said more than dlrs 41 billion would be available to
Brazil over the next three years, with dlrs 37 billion ready if
needed in the next 12 months. Camdessus said that as part of the
package the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank
would provide dlrs 4.5 billion each.
	   He said Brazil also would obtain funds from a large number of
industrial countries in North America, Europe and Asia totaling
about dlrs 14.5 billion. That includes dlrs 5 billion from the
United States, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said 19
other countries are expected to contribute the rest.
	   Rubin said the package offers ``a solid basis for restored
confidence and renewed growth.'' He said U.S. government
participation ``reflects our commitment to strengthen the
international financial system, guard against financial market
contagion and protect America's economic interests.''
	   Clinton issued a brief written statement praising the agreement,
which he called an important step in dealing with the global
financial crisis.
	   ``A strong Brazil is in America's interests, and President
Cardoso has launched a solid program to tackle its fiscal problems
that he has committed to implement swiftly,'' Clinton said. ``A
strong Brazil makes for a stronger United States.''
	   The IMF is expected to contribute between dlrs 15 billion and
dlrs 18 billion to support President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's
austerity plan of tax increases and spending cuts aimed at saving
dlrs 23.5 billion so he can avert devaluation of the country's
currency, the real.
	   A devaluation could set off an economic meltdown in Latin
America and worsen turmoil in other world markets including the
United States.
	   For months, Brazil has ranked among the most closely watched
patients on the emerging markets sick list.
	   After Asia's financial crisis last year and Russia's economic
upheaval this summer triggered panic in global markets,
international investors and bankers feared Brazil would have to
devalue.
	   The country's foreign exchange reserves have dropped from dlrs
65 billion to dlrs 47 billion as investors moved out their money.
In an attempt to stem the flow, Cardoso's government raised
interest rates to 50 percent.
	   Cardoso won re-election in early October and then presented his
belt-tightening proposals to parliament.

Police break up large prostitution ring
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A popular singer, a former prostitute and
a taxi driver were charged Friday with allegedly running a large
prostitution ring, in which young women were lured here from the
former Soviet Union.
	   The three were arrested along with another 32 people in police
raids Wednesday after one of the victims revealed her plight on a
popular corruption-busting television show. It was not known how
many women were involved in the ring, which controlled 30 illegal
brothels.
	   Thousands of women from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union are believed to be working illegally in Greece as
prostitutes.
	   Public pressure has been mounting in recent weeks for the police
to crack down on crime. Authorities here have been struggling with
a growing corruption scandal that includes allegations of police
protection for prostitution rings.
	   Prostitution is legal here, but is highly regulated.
	   Local media reported that many women working for those arrested
were subjected to frequent beatings and deprived of nearly all
their money.
	   The women reportedly traveled to Greece on promises of bar jobs,
but were kept in virtual captivity when they arrived here and
threatened with deportation if they did not work as prostitutes.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya was
freed Friday, more than six months after he was taken hostage in
the breakaway southern region.
	   Looking haggard and pale, Valentin Vlasov, arrived in Moscow on
Friday morning following successful negotiations carried out by
Russia's Interior Ministry.
	   ``What should have happened, did happen,'' Vlasov, dressed in a
black raincoat, said in a brief interview shown on Russian
television. ``I don't bear a grudge against anyone, even those who
hold me in captivity.''
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin greeted Vlasov at a Moscow
airport and said that no ransom was paid for his release. But
Chechen officials immediately countered that claim, saying that
Russian officials had paid.
	   ``By doing that, they once again financed the Chechen criminal
groups,'' Nasrudi Bazhiyev, Chechnya's deputy security minister,
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The Chechen officials also said that Vlasov had been kept
outside Chechnya, though he was abducted in Chechnya in May after
holding talks with Chechen officials. Russian officials refused to
give details of how Vlasov was released.
	   Ruslan Yeshugayev, the chief of Russia's anti-organized crime
squad in the region, said Vlasov was brought from Chechnya to
neighboring region of Ingushetia early Friday and then flown to
Moscow, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Vlasov lost 15 kilograms (33 pounds) while in captivity, but was
``in a vigorous and constructive mood,'' said Russian presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. Vlasov will spend a week recovering at
Russia's Central Clinical Hospital, officials said.
	   Vlasov was the most prominent of the hundreds of people have
been kidnapped in and around Chechnya following its 1994-96 war
with Russia.
	   Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, who has helped
negotiate several hostage releases, estimated that 700 people were
being held in captivity in Chechnya. He spoke on the television
program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   Most kidnappings are carried out by criminal gangs seeking
ransom, and have no political motive. The Russian media reported
that Vlasov's kidnappers were seeking millions of dollars.
	   Chechen officials have said that ransoms have been paid in some
cases, though the parties involved in the negotiations rarely, if
ever, provide details.
	   Meanwhile, five residents of a village in the nearby republic of
North Ossetia were kidnapped late Thursday, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Friday.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew in the fall of 1996, but Moscow still considers it a part
of Russia and no country has recognized its independence.

U.S. mediator hands over paper with new proposals for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The U.S. mediator for Kosovo handed
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic Friday a paper containing new
proposals on a draft agreement for the strife-torn province, the
state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
	   Christopher Hill, who is also the U.S. ambassador to neighboring
Macedonia, is engaged in an intensive shuttle diplomacy, trying to
broker an interim agreement between the two sides in the Kosovo
conflict.
	   Hill met Milutinovic to discuss the Kosovo situation and gave
him ``a paper containing elements'' toward an agreement for Kosovo,
Tanjug said.
	   The paper was the result of several weeks of the U.S. mediator's
shuttle diplomacy and ``talks with (Kosovo) Albanian political
parties,'' it said, adding the document was based on the Oct. 12
agreement reached between U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke and Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   Milutinovic was reported to have welcomed all ideas that could
contribute to finding a political solution for Kosovo, urging all
parties involved to ``come to the table and finally begin direct
talks.'' He said he would personally travel to Pristina next week
and initiate these talks.
	   Hill's spokesman Philip Reeker confirmed to The Associated Press
that the Serbian president was handed ``a new and updated draft
paper'' but that this is a daily, ongoing process. Friday's meeting
``was just another shuttle meeting,'' Reeker said.

Hundreds of immigrants fail in bid to slip into Italy via France
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout with hundreds of illegal immigrants caught at
Italian border, ADDS byline
 &UR; By IAN PHILLIPS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Several hundred illegal immigrants from Asia, the
Middle East and North Africa have been caught trying to slip into
Italy, lured by the prospect of papers under an amnesty, officials
said Friday.
	   French Interior Ministry officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the immigrants crossed into Italy this week via
France. They were thought to have been previously living in Spain,
Portugal, France and Belgium.
	   Most were carrying the four million lira (dlrs 2,300) needed to
apply for Italian work permits currently on offer, the Italian news
agency AGI reported.
	   But to be eligible, applicants must be able to prove they were
in Italy before March 27, 1998, and that they have a job, or a
promise of one.
	   The measure has sparked a huge flow of immigrants to Italy,
which offered 38,000 permits. Officials have since hinted they may
issue more.
	   AGI reported that a Chinese man had been arrested Friday for
trying to smuggle in the immigrants. French officials also
suspected organized crime.
	   The immigrants were originally from Egypt, Sri Lanka, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, the Philippines, China and North Africa, officials
said.
	   French officials would not give a figure of how many were
blocked, saying more were still being picked up. But they estimated
it was below 1,000.
	   AGI said 200 immigrants were blocked Friday in Bardonecchia, and
another 500 Thursday, and that many were being held in Italy.
	   In France, hundreds were being held at train stations at three
border points while authorities sought to determine their
nationalities for repatriation purposes.
	   Illegal immigration is an increasing problem across Europe due
to disappearing borders.
	   In France, police intervened Friday to end a 73-day sit-in at a
town hall in Limeil-Brevannes, east of Paris, by 11 immigrants,
most from the west African country of Mali.
	   The protesters had refused to eat for 73 days, but had taken
vitamins and sugar.
	   Immigrants and their supporters have staged marches, hunger
strikes, church sit-ins and other protests regularly over the past
months to press France's leftist government to let thousands of
mainly African immigrants remain.
	   But after legalizing 76,000 people, the government rejected
residency requests for more than 64,000 others.
	   Some leftists have criticized Prime Minister Lionel Jospin as
being too tough on immigration, while the far-right National Front
has criticized him as being too soft. The Front blames immigrants
for high crime and unemployment.
	   Also Friday, police clashed with demonstrators at the Charles de
Gaulle airport train station, north of Paris. They were trying to
block a train in which an Algerian illegal immigrant was being
escorted out of the country.

Trinidad moves to hang alleged drug kingpin, despite opposition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad says it will hang an
alleged drug kingpin and eight of his gang members next week,
defying international and local opposition.
	   They would be the first executions in the Caribbean nation since
1994, following a regional trend favoring the harshest punishment
to deter increasingly violent criminals connected to the illicit
drug trade.
	   The Prisons Commission of Trinidad and Tobago said death
warrants were issued Thursday for Dole Chadee and eight others
convicted in the January 9, 1994, murder of a family of four in a
reported drug dispute.
	   At the trial, a gang member testified that the killers had asked
Chadee what to do if there were children in the house and Chadee
had repeated an order to ``kill everyone.''
	   The gang shot Hamilton ``Mice'' Baboolal, his parents and his
sister, but spared two young children in the house.
	   In a statement, the Prisons Commission said the nine had
exhausted all avenues of appeal and their petitions had been denied
by the U.N. Commission on Human Rights as well as London's Privy
Council, which acts as a supreme court for several former British
colonies in the Caribbean.
	   Nevertheless, the lead attorney for the convicted men, Frank
Solomon, was expected to seek a stay of execution.
	   Trinidad and Tobago has been trying to execute dozens of
convicted murderers. In June, it resumed reading death warrants on
almost a weekly basis. But in every case, courts have postponed the
executions while they investigate conditions in the prisons.
	   Assistant Prisons Commission Mervyn Harris refused to tell The
Associated Press on Friday how many prisoners remained on death row
and when the last executions were carried out.
	   The local press has reported there are 109 people awaiting
execution, including Chadee's gang, and the last execution was in
1994.
	   The Trinidadian government has introduced a bill in Parliament
to amend the constitution by eliminating the right of convicts to
fight execution by arguing they already have suffered ``cruel and
inhumane'' conditions in prison.
	   Opposition leader Patrick Manning said his party would only
support the bill if the government rejoins a U.N. protocol on the
death penalty in the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.
	   Trinidad withdrew from the protocol this year, as did Jamaica
and Guyana, saying the international tribunal was purposely
dragging its feet on appeals. Those countries also want to set up a
Caribbean Supreme Court to replace the Privy Council. In a legal
ploy to stop hangings, the council in 1993 ruled that it was
inhumane to execute people who had waited on death row more than
five years. Hundreds of convicted murderers were spared as a
result.

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Sachin Tendulkar blasted
his 21st century in one-day international cricket Friday to help
India thrash Zimbabwe by 10 wickets in the final of the Coca Cola
Trophy.
	   Tendulkar, who benefited from a collision of two Zimbabweans
trying to catch him, wowed the crowd with his magnificent batting,
which took India past Zimbabwe's 196 for 9 in a mere 30 overs.
	   Tendulkar's 124 not out off 92 balls included half a dozen
sixes. He reached his 50 runs in just 28 balls and his 21st one-day
century in 71 deliveries.
	   Left hander Ganguly, who came on with Tendulkar as opener,
joined in the fun, clobbering 63 off 90 balls, including three huge
sixes which soared to the roof of the flood-lit stadium.
	   However, Tendulkar, who earned the man of the series and man of
the match award, was lucky to survive a comical blunder between
Zimbabwean keeper Andy Flower and Strang.
	   The two collided while going for a Tendulkar catch when the
batsman was on 53 runs.
	   After the match, Tendulkar told reporters: ``The ball came
really on the bat ... helping us to play the ball well.''
	   Earlier when fielding, India's bowlers reduced Zimbabwe to 196
for 9 in 50 overs, giving their team a modest score to beat in the
final of the three-nation tournament.
	   Opting to field after winning the toss, Indian bowlers wreaked
havoc with Zimbabwe's pacemen. Ajit Agarkar and Javagal Srinath
sent back to the clubhouse Alistair Campbell (2), Grant Flower (18)
and Murray Goodwin (2) for only 44 by the 11th over.
	   The Indian spin trio of Anil Kumble, Nikhil Chopra and Sunil
Joshi then tightened the noose to leave Zimbabwe at 81 for 6.
	   Kumble dismissed Andy Flower for 19. Off-spinner Chopra bowled
Neil Johnson after he had made a neat 34 off 46 balls.
	   Eddo Brandes (33 off 46 balls) and Paul Strang (46 off 91 balls)
rescued Zimbabwe from complete collapse. The pair put on 58 in 83
balls for the eighth wicket, taking the score to 174.
	   Brandes hit a straight six off Kumble and two boundaries before
he miscalculated a delivery from part-time bowler Tendulkar that
shattered his stumps.
	   Strang, who hit three boundaries, was given leg before to
Srinath in the final over.
	   Kumble had superb figures of 2 for 29 from 10 overs, while
Srinath took 3 for 40 in equal number of overs.
	   India bagged the first prize of dlrs 40,000 while runner up
Zimbabwe got dlrs 30,000. Sri Lanka, the third nation, collected
dlrs 15,000.

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Sachin Tendulkar blasted
his 21st century in one-day international cricket Friday to help
India thrash Zimbabwe by 10 wickets in the final of the Coca Cola
Trophy.
	   Tendulkar, who benefited from a collision of two Zimbabweans
trying to catch him, wowed the crowd with his magnificent batting,
which took India past Zimbabwe's 196 for 9 in a mere 30 overs.
	   Tendulkar's 124 not out off 92 balls included half a dozen
sixes. He reached his 50 runs in just 28 balls and his 21st one-day
century in 71 deliveries.
	   Left hander Ganguly, who came on with Tendulkar as opener,
joined in the fun, clobbering 63 off 90 balls, including three huge
sixes which soared to the roof of the flood-lit stadium.
	   However, Tendulkar, who earned the man of the series and man of
the match award, was lucky to survive a comical blunder between
Zimbabwean keeper Andy Flower and Strang.
	   The two collided while going for a Tendulkar catch when the
batsman was on 53 runs.
	   After the match, Tendulkar told reporters: ``The ball came
really on the bat ... helping us to play the ball well.''
	   Earlier when fielding, India's bowlers reduced Zimbabwe to 196
for 9 in 50 overs, giving their team a modest score to beat in the

Wilander edges childhood idol Borg, McEnroe entertains crowd
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Youth and resilience were the deciding
factors as Mats Wilander edged Bjorn Borg Friday in a battle of
former World No. 1 players in the dlrs 150,000 Delta Airlines ATP
Senior Tour of Champions tournament.
	   Wilander, 34, exploited the advantage he held over his Swedish
compatriot in speed, power and agility to win 6-2, 3-6 and 10-6.
	   A five-time consecutive champion at Wimbledon, Borg rallied back
in the second set, lashing out a host of winners, as if to show
there was still plenty of sting left in his forehand and that he
was still far from the rust pile.
	   But Wilander, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, was able to chase
loose balls more aggressively and attack the net with greater vigor
to wrap up the match against his childhood idol.
	   In the second pool of the round-robin tournament, Iranian
Mansour Bahrami, who had never won a title in his career nor ranked
better than 192nd in the world, turned on a show against another
all-time great, John McEnroe.
	   Outclassed 6-1, 6-4, Bahrami imitated the American in his heyday
as tennis' ``bad boy,'' slamming his racket to the floor and
ranting about line calls.
	   McEnroe, whose competetitive nature recognizes no bounds,
refused to be outdone and humored his opponent, imitating
contemporary stars in their anticipation of a shot or whistling as
he served aces.
	   A 77-title winner, McEnroe even jumped into the drink cooler
after a heated exchange of shots.
	   In the opening match, home favorite Goran Prpic, who received a
wildcard for his debut in the event, defeated the oldest player and
four-time Grand Slam champion, 48-year-old Guillermo Vilas, 6-3,
6-4.
	   Henri Leconte and fellow Frenchman Guy Forget were to meet in
the late match Friday. The winner of each pool meets in a final
showdown on Monday.
	   The Delta Airways Champions is the 14th event on the ATP
Tour-sanctioned worldwide senior tennis circuit.

UEFA bans Polish club from Europe in ``knife'' incident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Polish team appealing in 3rd graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA said Friday it has banned Polish
club Wisla Krakow from European soccer for one season over an
alleged knife-throwing incident in a UEFA Cup match last month.
	   The club will be banned from the next UEFA competition in the
next five years for which it qualifies due to the ``reprehensible
act of a Wisla Krakow supporter,'' European soccer's governing body
said in a statement.
	   Wisla president Ludwik Mietta-Mikolajewicz called the decision
``too severe and harmful'' and said immediatley the club would
appeal to UEFA.
	   Police on Friday detained a 19-year-old man in the Oct. 20
incident, in which Italian midfielder Dino Baggio was struck by an
object thrown from the stands. He needed five stitches to close a
head wound.
	   UEFA identified the weapon as a flick knife.
	   UEFA's control and disciplinary committee also suspended Ryszard
Czerwiec of the Polish club for one European match.
	   ``Czerwiec, who was standing next to Baggio at the time of the
incident, picked up the knife and through it back into the crowd,
to prevent the Italian players showing the knife to the referee,''
the statement said.
	   Private Radio Zet said the Wisla fan, identified as Pawel
Michalski, 19, could face up to 10 years in prison for injuring
Baggio. The radio reported prosecutors saying he threw a
switch-blade knife.
	   Krakow prosecutors were not immediately available to confirm the
report and the prosecutor's office was closed Friday afternoon.
	   The teen-ager was also wanted for beating a police officer.
	   Baggio was struck in the 80th minute of the second-round,
first-leg match between AC Parma and Wisla Krakow. The teams tied
1-1. Parma won the second game 2-1 at home to advance 3-2 on
aggregate.
	   Wisla officials, who deny Baggio was struck by a knife, have
offered a zloty 5,000 (dlrs 1,470) reward in the case.

Three Russian officials jailed, one dismissed for corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Three former top Russian officials have recently
been sentenced to prison terms for corruption and presidential
envoy has been fired for questionable activities, news reports said
Friday.
	   Yevgeny Roitman, former chief of the organized crime department
in the central Russian region of Tver, was sentenced to seven years
in prison for attempted fraud and trying to bribe a government
official during his time in office.
	   The Tver regional court also ordered the confiscation of
Roitman's property, the Interfax news agency reported Friday,
citing the prosecutor general's office.
	   In another case, the former deputy chief for supplies at the
Russian Military Air Academy, Maj. Gen. Vladimir Solomonov, was
sentenced to four years in prison for fraud and attempting to bribe
an official.
	   The Moscow region's military tribunal also stripped Solomonov of
his rank and awards, said military prosecutor Maj. Gen. Alexander
Ivanov.
	   At the same trial, a former official in charge of apartment
distribution at military aviation command, Col. Vasily Shchegolkov,
was sentenced to one year in prison for taking a bribe, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Separately, President Boris Yeltsin has dismissed his envoy to
the Siberian republic of Khakasia, identified as V.A. Strig, for a
``single incident of harsh violation of official duties,'' the
presidential press service said Friday. It provided no additional
details.
	   Corruption has long become endemic in the Russian military and
other state structures.

UEFA bans Ince for three European matches, McManaman for two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Liverpool stars Paul Ince and Steve
McManaman have been suspended for three and two European matches
respectively for violent conduct in a UEFA Cup match against
Valencia, UEFA said Friday.
	   Amedeo Carboni of the Spanish side was also suspended for two
European club matches.
	   All three were sent off as the sides tied 2-2, with Liverpool
advancing on away goals to the competition' third round.
	   Another Spanish club, Real Mallorca, had Iovan Stankovic
suspended for four matches following violent conduct in his team's
Cup Winners Cup match against Genk of Belgium.
	   In other decisions, Real Madrid and the Hungarian soccer
association were both fined 15,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 11,000) for
repeatedly selling stadium places beyond the authorized capacity.
	   UEFA confiscated a further 40,000 francs (dlrs 29,500) from Real
and 50,000 francs (dlrs 37,000) from Hungary, which it said
corresponds to the additional revenue from the extra places.
	   The control and disciplinary committee also rejected a protest
by PSV Eindhoven, which wanted to replay a Champions League match
against Germany's Kaiserslautern.
	   Ince recently received an international ban from UEFA over his
sending-off for England against Sweden in September.
	   He received an automatic two match international ban, but UEFA's
disciplinary committee extended the ban to three matches when it
found Ince guilty of making inappropriate comments to the referee.

 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Iraqi prodding, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has no plans to mediate the latest crisis with Iraq and
is still waiting for Baghdad to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors, his spokesman reiterated Friday.
	   As the U.S. military buildup continues amid speculation about
possible American airstrikes, the secretary-general's office and
the U.N. Security Council made clear again that ``the ball is in
Iraq's court'' and the resumption of unfettered weapons inspections
is non-negotiable.
	   The secretary-general spoke to U.S. President Bill Clinton for
10 minutes Friday morning about Iraq's confrontation with the
council, spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   Annan was scheduled to meet the 15-member Security Council later
Friday after a private session with the ambassadors of Russia,
China and France _ who have been sympathetic to Iraq's call for
lifting crippling U.N. economic sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War.
	   Under the cease-fire that ended Gulf War in 1991, sanctions
cannot be lifted until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq
has has been disarmed.
	   While the Security Council remains divided over the use of force
against Iraq, it has unanimously demanded that Baghdad rescind its
Oct. 31 decision to cut all cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors. And it strongly backed an appeal from Annan to Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to let the inspectors to return to work
immediately.
	   ``At the meeting with members of the council this afternoon
they'll exchange views on Iraq, but the secretary-general's
position remains the same: He has no plans at this time to go to
Baghdad,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
	   The five permanent members of the Security Council _ the United
States, Britain, France, Russia and China _ met Friday morning to
discuss the crisis.
	   Diplomats who attended the closed meeting said there was a brief
discussion about the possibility of Annan flying to Baghdad _ but
no proposal or initiative for him to do it because the council
doesn't see anything to mediate or negotiate.
	   ``What is missing here is any positive reaction from the Iraqi
authorities,'' Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current
council president, said Friday. ``The responsibility is theirs to
come forward and come back into compliance.''
	   Iraq has also not responded positively to separate appeals from
many Security Council members, he said.
	   In his first statement since the start of the dispute, Saddam
said Friday that he was not trying to create a crisis and would
accept ``positively any initiative'' that would lift U.N.
sanctions.
	   Earlier, Burleigh was asked what the council would accept from
Iraq to end the crisis.
	   As a first step, Burleigh said, the council would accept ``a
public and official rescinding'' of the Oct. 31 announcement and an
Aug. 5 ban on spot weapons inspections.
	   ``The council has made very clear that it also requires
cooperation on the ground to be demonstrated,'' he said, which
would mean the immediate resumption of unfettered inspections.
	   During the last Iraqi crisis, in February, the secretary-general
flew to Baghdad and secured an agreement to allow unfettered
weapons inspections that averted U.S. and British airstrikes. Iraq,
however, has been reneging on its part of the bargain for months.
	   Burleigh said the secretary-general and the council have ``bent
over backwards'' to respond to Iraq's request for a comprehensive
review of its compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   Iraq cut off dealings with the inspectors after a letter from
the council to Annan outlining the framework for a review did not
include a timetable for lifting sanctions.

Twelve AC Milan players in tax evasion probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: ADDS comment by AC Milan club &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italian tax police alleged Friday that 12
present and past players of major league soccer club AC Milan
evaded taxes over a seven-year period.
	   According to news reports those under investigation are the trio
of Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco Van
Basten, past team captain Franco Baresi, present captain Paolo
Maldini and defender Christian Panucci, now with Real Madrid in the
Spanish league.
	   Others mentioned in the case were former French striker Jean
Pierre Papin and Montenegrin star Dejan Savicevic.
	   The other players mentioned in the reports were Mauro Tassotti,
Gianluigi Lentini, Nando De Napoli and Stefano Eranio.
	   Court sources indicated that Milan prosecutors must now decide
whether to recommend indictment of players or officials.
	   The Milan club is owned by media mogul and former premier Silvio
Berlusconi.
	   The club, in a statement Friday evening, ``contested the
veracity of the news'' and said it had not been informed about the
investigation. It insisted that the club ``has always acted with
all its own employees and collaborators in full respect of laws,
including tax law.''
	   The Italian news agency ANSA reported that the investigation
focused on possible tax evasion via under-the-table, multimillion
dollar contracts between 1991 and 1997.
	   Gullit, Van Basten and Rijkaard were part of the Milan soccer
powerhouse which dominated the national and international scene in
the early 90s.
	   Gullit moved to the English Premier League as player-coach of
Chelsea at the end of his Italian career.
	   Rijkaard was recently hired as coach of the Dutch national
soccer team.
	   The case is part of a broad investigation of soccer, rugby and
volleyball teams now or formerly in Berlusconi's business empire
Fininvest.

trying to catch him, impressed the crowd with his half dozen sixes
and 12 boundaries in his 124-run stand off 92 balls.
	   Having been set a target of 196, which Zimbabwe struggled to
reach for nine wickets in 50 overs, India raced to 197 for no loss
in only 30 overs.
	   Tendulkar reached his 50 runs in just 28 balls and his 21st
one-day century in 71 deliveries.
	   Lefthander Ganguly hit three sixes, which soared to the roof of
the flood-lit stadium, in his stand.
	   However, Tendulkar, who earned the man of the series and man of
the match award, was lucky to survive a comical blunder between
Zimbabwean keeper Andy Flower and Paul Strang.
	   The two collided while trying to catch a Tendulkar ball when the
batsman was on 53 runs.
	   ``The ball came really on the bat ... helping us to play the
ball well,'' Tendulkar said.
	   Earlier, Javagal Srinath took three wickets including opener
Grant Flower for 18 to hold down Zimbabwe's innings.
	   Opting to field after winning the toss, Indian bowlers wreaked
havoc with the top of Zimbabwe's order. Ajit Agarkar erased
Alistair Campbell for two on the seventh ball and Srinath claimed
Flower and Murray Goodwin (2) to drop Zimbabwe to 44 for three by
the 11th over.
	   The Indian spin trio of Anil Kumble, Nikhil Chopra and Sunil
Joshi then joined to leave Zimbabwe at 81 for six.
	   Kumble dismissed Andy Flower for 19. Off-spinner Chopra bowled
Neil Johnson after he had made 34 off 46 balls.
	   Eddo Brandes (33 off 46 balls) and Strang (46 off 91 balls)
rescued Zimbabwe from complete collapse. The pair put on 58 in 83
balls for the eighth wicket, taking the score to 174.
	   Brandes hit a straight six off Kumble and two boundaries before
he miscalculated a delivery from Tendulkar that shattered his
stumps.
	   Strang, who hit three boundaries, was given leg before to
Srinath in the final over.
	   Kumble took two for 29 from 10 overs, while Srinath took three
for 40 in 10 overs.
	   India earned the first prize of dlrs 40,000 while runner-up
Zimbabwe received dlrs 30,000. Sri Lanka, the third nation,
collected dlrs 15,000.

New Brunswick authorities wary as new abortion clinic opens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREDERICTON, New Brunswick (AP) _ Authorities worried about
possible anti-abortion violence Friday closed a junior high school
next to a clinic being opened by the doctor who was pivotal in
decriminalizing abortion in Canada.
	   About 10 anti-abortion protesters picketed the clinic, but the
opening ceremonies proceeded peacefully, and Dr. Henry Morgentaler
said the one-day closure of the neighboring school was an
overreaction.
	   Morgentaler has acknowledged, however, that he considers himself
a prime target for possible violence as police hunt for whoever has
been carrying out a string of sniper attacks on abortion-providing
doctors in Canada and the United States.
	   The latest attack, on Oct. 23, killed Dr. Barnett Slepian at his
home near Buffalo, New York.
	   Another upstate New York doctor and three Canadian doctors have
been wounded in similar attacks since 1994, always in late October
or the first half of November.
	   Morgentaler, leader of a long campaign that finally overturned
Canada's anti-abortion laws in 1988, has now established eight
clinics across Canada.
	   ``I think I've contributed to a change of public opinion in
Canada,'' he said. ``If I had to die tomorrow by an assassin's
bullet at least I've achieved something in life.''

Tendulkar leads India to clinch Coca Cola Trophy

<TEXT>
	   SHARJAH, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Sachin Tendulkar blasted
his 21st century in one-day international cricket Friday to help
India thrash Zimbabwe by 10 wickets in the final of the Coca Cola
Trophy.
	   Tendulkar, who benefited from a collision of two Zimbabweans
trying to catch him, wowed the crowd with his magnificent batting,
which took India past Zimbabwe's 196 for 9 in a mere 30 overs.
	   Tendulkar's 124 not out off 92 balls included half a dozen
sixes. He reached his 50 runs in just 28 balls and his 21st one-day
century in 71 deliveries.
	   Left hander Sauruv Ganguly, who came on with Tendulkar as
opener, joined in the fun, clobbering 63 off 90 balls, including
three huge sixes which soared to the roof of the flood-lit stadium.
	   However, Tendulkar, who earned the man of the series and man of
the match award, was lucky to survive a comical blunder between
Zimbabwean keeper Andy Flower and Paul Strang.
	   The two collided while going for a Tendulkar catch when the
batsman was on 53 runs.
	   After the match, Tendulkar told reporters: ``The ball came
really on the bat ... helping us to play the ball well.''
	   Earlier when fielding, India's bowlers reduced Zimbabwe to 196
for 9 in 50 overs, giving their team a modest score to beat in the
final of the three-nation tournament.
	   Opting to field after winning the toss, Indian bowlers wreaked
havoc with Zimbabwe's pacemen. Ajit Agarkar and Javagal Srinath
sent back to the clubhouse Alistair Campbell (2), Grant Flower (18)
and Murray Goodwin (2) for only 44 by the 11th over.
	   The Indian spin trio of Anil Kumble, Nikhil Chopra and Sunil
Joshi then tightened the noose to leave Zimbabwe at 81 for 6.
	   Kumble dismissed Andy Flower for 19. Off-spinner Chopra bowled
Neil Johnson after he had made a neat 34 off 46 balls.
	   Eddo Brandes (33 off 46 balls) and Strang (46 off 91 balls)
rescued Zimbabwe from complete collapse. The pair put on 58 in 83
balls for the eighth wicket, taking the score to 174.
	   Brandes hit a straight six off Kumble and two boundaries before
he miscalculated a delivery from part-time bowler Tendulkar that
shattered his stumps.
	   Strang, who hit three boundaries, was given leg before to
Srinath in the final over.
	   Kumble had superb figures of 2 for 29 from 10 overs, while
Srinath took 3 for 40 in equal number of overs.
	   India bagged the first prize of dlrs 40,000 while runner up
Zimbabwe got dlrs 30,000. Sri Lanka, the third nation, collected
dlrs 15,000.

President says U.S. should have advised Colombia about drug plane

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana said Friday
that U.S. authorities should have warned Colombia that one of its
air force planes was taking off for Florida carrying almost a ton
of cocaine.
	   ``Why, if they knew about this cargo...didn't they tell us
first?'' Pastrana told reporters. They were his first public
comments on what has been an international embarrassment for his
three-month old administration.
	   ``We're truly sad that an incident like this once again
blemishes the image of an entire country, '' said Pastrana, who
took office vowing to step up Colombia's fight against drug
trafficking.
	   In 1996, Colombian authorities seized eight pounds (3 1/2
kilograms) of heroin in an air force plane preparing to take
then-President Ernesto Samper to a U.N. General Assembly meeting in
New York.
	   In the latest scandal, U.S. Customs officials disclosed Tuesday
they had discovered 1,639 pounds (743.5 kilos) of cocaine hidden in
a Colombian air force cargo plane at Fort Lauderdale's
international airport. The C-130 Hercules was on a routine supply
run, officials said.
	   U.S. Customs officials, who did not return calls seeking a
reaction to Pastrana's complaints, have not said whether they knew
the cocaine was on board before it left Colombia, or whether they
informed Colombia's government.
	   U.S. drug agents in the past have been loathe to share
information with some of Colombia's authorities, fearing the
intelligence would be leaked to drug traffickers.

Israel does not expect warning of U.S. attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to update with statement by defense minister, and
UPDATES with Clinton message to Arafat, 9th graf, Edits, Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is acting on the assumption that the
United States will not give it advance warning before launching a
military strike against Iraq, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai said Friday.
	   ``We are preparing for a situation ... in which we will be taken
by surprise,'' he told Channel 2 television.
	   However he believed even if Washington did not send express
warning to Israel, it would send ``some sort of signals.'' It was
in response to signals of this kind from Washington that he had
ordered the army to open gas mask distribution centers for
civilians.
	   A senior adviser to Mordechai said Friday that the delivery of
American Patriot missiles to Israel is being delayed to avoid
creating the impression that Israel is a party to the dispute
between the U.S. and Iraq.
	   ``If Patriots are brought here, it means we are once again a
little more involved in the conflict, when one of our aims is not
to be involved in the conflict,'' said David Ivri, who is a retired
air force general.
	   Ivri said if the situation in the Gulf deteriorates a decision
may be taken to bring the Patriots to Israel
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Friday that Israel ``will
know how to defend its people'' against a possible Iraqi attack
does not consider itself a player in the confrontation.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he hoped for a
``peaceful solution through the terms of Kofi Annan,'' the U.N.
secretary general who cut short a trip to Africa to deal with the
crisis. Arafat has said that a U.S. strike against Iraq could
hinder the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel.
	   Arafat received a letter from President Clinton Friday, the
Palestinian news agency WAFA said Friday. The letter dealt with the
Gulf crisis and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, the agency
said. However the agency did not elaborate.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, gas mask distribution centers shut down
Friday afternoon for the Jewish Sabbath. Israel began distributing
gas masks to its citizens in the months leading to the 1991 Gulf
War when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein threatened to attack Israel
with chemical weapons.
	   During the war, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional
warheads at Israel in an attempt to draw it into the fighting and
break up the Arab coalition against Iraq. Patriot anti-aircraft
missiles sent to Israel at the time by the United States proved
ineffectual against the Scuds.
	   At the request of the United States, Israel did not retaliate at
the time against Iraq.
	   Asked Friday whether Israel would strike back this time, if
attacked by Iraq, Sharon said: ``I think it's well-known in the
Middle East, that Israel will know how to defend its people,''
Sharon said.
	   However he downplayed the threat to Israel.
	   ``I think we have have to continue to lead our normal lives. I
would like to encourage tourists to come. As you will see, it is
beautiful here, wonderful weather. Life is normal,'' he said.
	   Nevertheless British tour operators cut short the vacations of
hundreds of British tourists in the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat
and brought them home.
	   In addition, the European Under-18 Championships qualifying
soccer tournament scheduled to take place in Israel next week was
canceled because of security concerns. England, Israel, Andorra and
Spain were to compete in the tournament.

Trinidad takes steps to halt piracy of music
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad and Tobago has turned to
U.S. and international officials to help stem the flow of pirated
recordings that Legal Affairs Minister Kamla Persad Bissesar said
are stealing up to 20 percent of local musicians' income.
	   ``Between Carnival 1997 and January 1998, it's estimated that
some 50,000 pirated CDs from Trinidad and Tobago artists alone had
been sold in North America and Europe,'' the minister said
recently.
	   Another 18 percent of the recordings sold locally are pirated by
``organized crooks and criminals who leech on the lifeblood of
genuinely creative people,'' he said.
	   In addition to seeking help from the FBI and U.S. Customs, the
Caribbean nation has passed a copyright law allowing pirates to be
fined up to TT dlrs 100,000 (dlrs 16,600 U.S.) and sentenced to up
to 10 years in prison.
	   The government has also received assistance from the World
Intellectual Property Organization, which will provide training for
the local police and customs officers.
	   The government and local music producers have also agreed to
include a holographic sticker on original recordings so purchasers
can distinguish a pirated version from the original.

Economists: IMF rescue package will aggravate recession
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With IMF-Brazil &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund rescue
package to stop the global financial crisis from spreading to
Brazil will aggravate the country's already sluggish economy and
cause unemployment to rise, economists said Friday.
	   But they made clear, however, that things would get much worse
without it, which could lead to a ``complete collapse'' of the
Brazilian economy.
	   The IMF package makes dlrs 41.5 billion available to Brazil over
the next three years, with about dlrs 37 billion ready if needed in
the next 12 months.
	   The IMF will put up dlrs 18 billion, while multilateral
development banks will chip in with dlrs 9 billion. The remaining
dlrs dlrs 14.5 billion will come through credits extended by the
Bank of International Settlements from 20 different countries.
	   In a news conference shortly after the announcement, Finance
Minister Pedro Malan said: ``It was a preventive operation and we
hope we won't need all the funds being made available.''
	   He said the agreement did not include any changes in the
country's foreign exchange policy and stressed that Brazil had no
plans to devalue its currency, the real.
	   Brazilian economists said the IMF package rubber stamped the
government's economic policies and recently announced austerity
measures that they say will fuel recession and unemployment.
	   That the package was an endorsement of Brazil's economic program
was underscored by IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus when he
said in Washington: ``The way is now open for the international
community to provide financial support to Brazil that will enhance
market confidence in the government's economic policies.''
	   ``The IMF package was only made possible thanks to the austerity
measures that will slow down the country's economy even further and
swell the ranks of the unemployed,'' said Sao Paulo economist
Bernard Appy.
	   He predicted that unemployment that now stands at a record 7.8
percent will ``surely grow to double digit figures early next
year.''
	   But other economists said the package would eventually help the
country to fix its economy.
	   ``The funds being made available serve to uphold the
recessionary economic policies currently in place,'' said Luciano
Coutinho, an economist at the University of Campinas. ``All
agreements with the IMF demand sacrifices, but things would get
much worse without the rescue package. There would be an exchange
crisis and a complete collapse of the economy.''
	   Coutinho said the package should help reduce Brazil's
high-interest rates down to 21 percent a year, helping Brazil
jump-start its ailing economy.
	   The measures that helped secure the IMF agreement were unveiled
on Oct. 28, when the government announced a mix of new taxes and
spending cuts to save dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and dlrs 80 billion
by 2002. The measures must be approved by Congress.
	   Earlier this week, the Central Bank lowered the annual interest
rate from 49.75 percent to 42.25 percent.
	   Brazil nearly doubled its key lending rate in September to halt
the flight of investors after Russia's August devaluation raised
fears of emerging markets. The country's foreign reserves have
since fallen to around dlrs 43 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the
end of July.
	   For Congressman Marcelo Deda of the leftist Worker's Party, the
agreement with the IMF ``guarantees the survival of the
government's economic policies and its austerity measures that have
straight-jacketed the economy.''
	   ``The population will once again have to foot the bill, paying
with recession and unemployment,'' he added.

Withdrawal of inspection agents could disrupt Iraqi relief aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-UN-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A British company unexpectedly withdrew
independent inspection agents from Iraq's borders Friday, a move
that could disrupt the flow of badly needed humanitarian aid and
spare parts for the country's oil sector, a U.N. spokesman said.
	   The U.N. trade embargo imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait requires that all goods entering the country must be
approved by the U.N. Iraq Sanctions Committee. The inspectors
verify that the relief aid and spare parts meet the committee's
conditions.
	   The U.N. allows Iraq to export limited amounts of oil for food
and medical supplies, as well as spare pipeline parts to boost its
oil exports.
	   The inspectors play a crucial role because the certificates they
issue are required before vendors can be paid from the U.N.'s Iraq
account.
	   ``Any food shipments that go in will not be paid for, because
without the certification by these people at the border, the
suppliers cannot be paid,'' U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said. ``So
I don't think there will be many deliveries under those
circumstances.''
	   Lloyds Register took the decision without consulting U.N.
officials, according to a statement issued by Benon Sevan,
executive director of the Office of the Iraq Program.
	   The British company, which has a contract with the United
Nations to monitor goods entering Iraq, apparently pulled out the
inspectors in response to Iraq's decision to end weapons
inspections and threats of U.S. airstrikes.
	   ``The Office of the Iraq Program is examining various options
with a view to restoring inspection services with the least
possible delay in order to maintain the flow of food, medicine and
other essential humanitarian supplies into Iraq,'' Sevan said.
	   The Lloyds Register pullout surprised U.N. officials, who
consider the inspectors essential personnel.
	   Sevan met with the Sanctions Committee on Friday afternoon to
discuss options to ensure that deliveries continue.
	   ``There are stockpiles of food and medicines inside Iraq, so
there's not going to be an immediate shortage, but we'll have to
see what steps need to be taken,'' said Acting U.S. Ambassador
Peter Burleigh, the current Security Council president.
	   Lloyds Register withdrew its inspectors from the Umm Qasr port,
the Trebil border crossing with Jordan, the al-Waleed border
crossing with Syria, and the Zakho border crossing with Turkey,
Sevan said.
	   Earlier this week, the United Nations withdrew all weapons
inspectors and non-essential humanitarian staff as the likelihood
of airstrikes increased.

WASHINGTON: her allegations.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Also Friday, Starr's grand jury filed a 15-count indictment
against Webster Hubbell, a Clinton friend and former third-ranking
official in the U.S. Justice Department. Starr has for months been
investigating whether money Clinton's friends gave Hubbell while he
was under investigation were designed as ``hush money.''
	   Congressional impeachment investigators have been waiting to see
if action Starr might take in the Hubbell matter would have an
impact on their inquiry.
	   The Associated Press reported last week that Starr had won the
cooperation of John Huang, a former executive in Indonesia's Lippo
Group and fund-raiser for Clinton's Democratic party, in exchange
for a grant of immunity from prosecution. Sources said Huang told
Starr that a $100,000 payment Hubbell received from a Lippo entity
in summer 1994 was designed to help Hubbell, and Huang was unaware
that Hubbell did any substantial work to earn it.
	   By sending the Willey evidence to Congress, Starr may be
signaling he plans no further action against possible targets in
the investigation.
	   Mrs. Willey accused Clinton of making an unwanted, crude sexual
advance in the White House in 1993, when she came to talk to him
about her financial troubles. At the time, she was an unpaid White
House volunteer.
	   She later became a witness in a sexual harassment lawsuit
against Clinton and testified before Starr's grand jury
investigating Clinton's affair with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
	   Mrs. Willey told her story in a nationally televised interview
on CBS' ``60 Minutes'' last March, in which she graphically
described an alleged advance made by Clinton. The president has
adamantly denied the allegations, and the White House released
letters showing Mrs. Willey remained friendly with the president
after the day she said the incident occurred.
	   In his grand jury testimony, Clinton said Mrs. Willey didn't
tell the truth.

Scientists defend U.S. doctor's experimental cancer approach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with researchers defending
scientist. No pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOSTON (AP) _ Researchers came to the defense Friday of a U.S.
scientist whose much-publicized strategy of wiping out cancer
tumors by cutting off their blood supply is facing increasing
skepticism.
	   The researchers said that they can make the approach work, even
if others cannot.
	   The strategy, developed by Dr. Judah Folkman of Children's
Hospital in Boston, involves natural proteins that destroy cancer
by choking off its blood supply.
	   Folkman's work came to wide attention in May after an upbeat
page-one story in The New York Times. On Thursday, The Wall Street
Journal reported that a number of experts _ including those at the
National Cancer Institute _ had not been able to reproduce
Folkman's findings.
	   One of those cited by the Journal as a skeptic was Harvard
biologist Bjorn Olsen. On Friday, however, Olsen said that he is in
fact highly enthusiastic about the approach.
	   At issue are endostatin and angiostatin, substances that in
Folkman's hands appear to make tumors shrink and disappear in lab
mice. Neither has been tested in people.
	   Olsen said that he did have trouble replicating one test of
endostatin's ability to stop blood vessels from growing into
neighboring tissue. But he said he developed another test that
powerfully showed the same effect.
	   Olsen has produced what he says is an especially potent form of
endostatin that dramatically shrank aggressive brain tumors in
rats, cutting their blood supply in half after just 10 days of
treatment.
	   ``We think that is very exciting,'' he said.
	   At Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, researchers
said they, too, have had success with endostatin. Dr. Vikas
Sukhatme found it could suppress the growth of kidney tumors in
mice.
	   ``The information suggests that not only are Folkman's studies
essentially capable of being corroborated, but they can be extended
as well,'' said Dr. Barry Eisenstein, Beth Israel's vice president
for science and technology.
	   Among those that have been unable so far to reproduce Folkman's
findings are researchers from the National Cancer Institute in
Bethesda, Maryland.
	   ``We are frustrated by this, but we are certainly not knocked
over and surprised by it. It just needs more work,'' said Dr.
Robert E. Wittes, director of the NCI's Division of Cancer
Treatment.
	   Possible reasons include differences in the way the protein is
stored, transported and injected.
	   He said scientists from Folkman's lab and the NCI have been
working together to figure out what's wrong, ``and we will get to
the bottom of this as expeditiously as possible.''
	   At EntreMed Inc. in Rockville, Maryland, which is developing the
human version of endostatin, spokeswoman Mary P. Sundeen said the
company hopes to begin testing in people next year. Bristol-Myers
Squibb Co. is developing angiostatin, and spokesman Bill Dunnett
said human testing could begin late in 1999.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ India chided the industrial world
Friday for asking developing nations to do more to cut greenhouse
gases, saying wealthier nations should take the lead under a 1997
global warming treaty.
	   At the close of a U.N. climate summit, India's environmental
minister said some countries would like to evade their obligations
under the Kyoto protocol to scale back carbon dioxide emissions.
	   ``When it comes to the act of taking responsibilities, some
countries would like to shirk'' their responsibilities while
raising ``new ideas,'' said Shri Suresh Prabhu.
	   ``That's not acceptable to us.''
	   He didn't identify countries by name. But his criticism appeared
to be an attack against a U.S.-backed campaign for developing
nations to take on emissions targets like those laid out for
industrialized nations under the Kyoto treaty.
	   India and China are the biggest opponents of that proposal.
	   The 38 major industrialized nations agreed last December in
Kyoto, Japan to sharply cut their greenhouse gas emissions by 2012.
That accord merely called for developing nations to do their best
to fight global warming.
	   The U.S. Senate has said it won't ratify the Kyoto treaty unless
it leads to emissions reductions in the developing world. In
signing the Kyoto treaty on Thursday, the Clinton administration
promised it wouldn't present it for Senate ratification until it
had greater developing world participation.
	   Speaking at a news conference here, India's negotiator charged
that industrialized countries must meet their emissions targets
before offering new initiatives. ``What's been agreed upon has not
been acted upon. So how do we talk about new ideas?'' he asked.
	   Negotiations have been going on nearly around the clock in the
waning hours of the two-week climate summit, the biggest since the
treaty that was reached last December.
	   Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense
Fund, said Kyoto gave 2012 as the deadline for major industrial
nations to cut their greenhouses gases by 5 percent below 1990
levels.
	   ``Now we need interim deadlines for defining the rules so
entrepreneurs, business and private citizens can get on with the
job of beginning to reduce emissions,'' he said.
	   Many scientists believe the Earth is gradually warming because
of what are known as greenhouse gas emissions _ mainly carbon
dioxide from factories, power plants and automobiles.
	   Critics say global warming scenarios have not been proven and
that the pact threatens American industry. Proponents of the treaty
say it won't force costly measures on American companies to cut
pollution.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to Chechnya was
freed Friday, more than six months after he was taken hostage in
the breakaway southern region.
	   Looking haggard and pale, Valentin Vlasov, arrived in Moscow on
Friday morning following successful negotiations carried out by
Russia's Interior Ministry.
	   ``What should have happened, did happen,'' Vlasov, dressed in a
black raincoat, said in a brief interview shown on Russian
television. ``I don't bear a grudge against anyone, even those who
held me in captivity.''
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin greeted Vlasov at a Moscow
airport and said that no ransom was paid for his release. But
Chechen officials immediately countered that claim, saying that
Russian officials had paid.
	   ``By doing that, they once again financed the Chechen criminal
groups,'' Nasrudi Bazhiyev, Chechnya's deputy security minister,
said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   The Chechen officials also said that Vlasov had been kept
outside Chechnya, though he was abducted in Chechnya in May after
holding talks with Chechen officials. Russian officials refused to
give details of how Vlasov was released.
	   Ruslan Yeshugayev, the chief of Russia's anti-organized crime
squad in the region, said Vlasov was brought from Chechnya to
neighboring region of Ingushetia early Friday and then flown to
Moscow, the Interfax news agency said.
	   Vlasov lost 15 kilograms (33 pounds) while in captivity, but was
``in a vigorous and constructive mood,'' said Russian presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. Vlasov will spend a week recovering at
Russia's Central Clinical Hospital, officials said.
	   Vlasov was the most prominent of the hundreds of people have
been kidnapped in and around Chechnya following its 1994-96 war
with Russia.
	   Deputy Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, who has helped
negotiate several hostage releases, estimated that 700 people were
being held in captivity in Chechnya. He spoke on the television
program ``Hero of the Day.''
	   Most kidnappings are carried out by criminal gangs seeking
ransom, and have no political motive. The Russian media reported
that Vlasov's kidnappers were seeking millions of dollars.
	   Chechen officials have said that ransoms have been paid in some
cases, though the parties involved in the negotiations rarely, if
ever, provide details.
	   Meanwhile, five residents of a village in the nearby republic of
North Ossetia were kidnapped late Thursday, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported Friday.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew in the fall of 1996, but Moscow still considers it a part
of Russia and no country has recognized its independence.

Parliamentarian's immunity lifted for vandalism charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ The parliament on Friday lifted
immunity for one of its members so she could be prosecuted for
vandalism.
	   In March, Jette Gottlieb of the Red-Green Alliance was part of a
group of six actvists who painted a yellow line on a streetcorner.
The activists were upset that drivers were ignoring a law banning
parking within 10 meters (33 feet) of streetcorners.
	   All the activists were charged with vandalism, except for
Gottlieb, who held parliamentary immunity.
	   Gottlieb's alliance, which holds five seats in parliament, was
among those voting for lifting her immunity, on the grounds that
the alliance members believed that having her charged would show
solidarity with the other activists.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Yugoslav soldiers were killed
Friday in a new outbreak of violence, further fueling tensions in
the strife-torn Kosovo province.
	   Duncan Bullivant, an international official, said according to
information from the Yugoslav Army and foreign Ministry, an
incident occurred at around 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) in the village of
Dulje on the road connecting Pristina, the capital, and Prizren
near the Albanian border.
	   Bullivant, a spokesman for the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, quoted the Yugoslav officials
as saying that one soldier died on the spot and the other succumbed
to his injuries. Another two wounded soldiers were taken to a
hospital in Pristina.
	   Though details were still unclear Friday night, a crew for
Associated Press Television News said earlier they had heard bursts
of gunfire coming from the region, between Suva Reka and Stimlje
villages. Traffic was backed up in the area. The APTN crew saw two
tanks and several trucks full of soldiers in the vicinity.
	   Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness
said Friday Serb police on Thursday opened fire on a group of
ethnic Albanian men and children, killing one of the men and
injuring another. The Kosovo Information Center, close to the
Albanian leadership, also carried the report.
	   Journalists visiting Mlecane Friday saw two pools of blood amid
15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident reportedly
took place. Male villagers, who only recently returned to the homes
they left earlier, said all the women and children had fled again.
	   The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry reported Friday that ethnic
Albanian rebels opened fire Thursday at a police vehicle traveling
the main road, near Mlecane. No causalities were reported and it
was not immediately clear the incident was linked to the shooting
in the village.
	   The continued shootings have chipped away at hopes for a
solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and Albanians, ushered
in by an Oct. 12 agreement.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province has left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made
refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   Meanwhile, a statement issued by Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic and
carried by the Tanjug news agency excluded participation of the
militant Kosovo Liberation Army in the peace process, saying
``there is no place for extremists, terrorism, abductions,
killings, armed attacks.''
	   Alluding to the Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb
police forces from Kosovo, he said: ``An agreement respected only
by one side stands no chance.''
	   At talks in Belgrade with European Union envoy Wolfgang
Petritsch, Lilic said authorities are abiding by the agreement,
meant to set up a deal designed to restore autonomy to Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Also in Belgrade, U.S. envoy Christopher Hill handed Serbian
President Milan Milutinovic ``a new and updated draft paper'' but
that this is a daily, ongoing process, his spokesman said.
	   Earlier Friday, armed Serb civilians swapped hostages with
ethnic Albanian guerrillas, defusing a local standoff.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, sources said.
Members of a still-forming 2,000-strong team meant to monitor the
October agreement mediated in the releases.
	   In Brussels Friday, NATO ambassadors approved plans Friday for a
French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand ready to
rescue the unarmed civilian ``ground verifiers'' in Kosovo should
they come under threat.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A tractor driver uncovered a 100-kilogram
(220-pound) World War II-era bomb Friday outside an apartment
building in central Siberia, a news report said.
	   The area was cordoned off, and explosives experts were to study
the bomb Saturday, Alexei Buravtsov, head of the Novosibirsk
emergency department, was quoted by the ITAR-Tass news agency as
saying.
	   The tractor driver was moving piles of sand in a construction
zone when he uncovered the bomb late Friday, the report said. It
gave no other details.
	   It was the second World War II-era bomb found in Novosibirsk,
about 2800 kilometers (1,750 miles) east of Moscow, in recent
weeks. The other was safely destroyed at a military air base. There
are several bases in and around Novosibirsk that were used by the
Soviet military.

NATO approves plan for Kosovo extraction force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO ambassadors approved plans Friday
for a French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand ready
to rescue unarmed civilian verifiers in Kosovo should they come
under threat.
	   The political approval of the military's operations plans means
Gen. Wesley Clark, supreme allied commander in Europe, can begin
calling up troops from nations who have volunteered to participate
in the 1,200-1,800-strong all-European force, which will be based
in neighboring Macedonia.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe is in
the process of putting 2,000 civilian verifiers into Kosovo. These
observers will insure Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic lives
up to the agreement he made with American negotiator Richard
Holbrooke Oct. 12.
	   Hundreds of people have died and hundreds of thousands have been
displaced in the conflict between ethnic Albanians, who make up 90
percent of Kosovo, and Serb police and military forces. Ethnic
Albanians are seeking independence for the southern Serb province.
	   The cease-fire declared in Kosovo last month is shaky at best,
with a low level of violence continuing nearly every day. NATO
ambassadors discussed the compliance issue again on Friday and once
again expressed concern that the simmering violence could flare
into a major conflict, officials said.
	   The NATO ``extraction force,'' called Joint Guarantor, will be
on standby in Macedonia and prepared to rescue any of the civilian
verifiers that might find themselves under attack or in a
threatening situation.
	   The force will be in the normal NATO chain of command under the
headquarters for Allied Forces in Southern Europe, in Naples,
Italy, and under Clark's overall authority.
	   France has not been a part of NATO's integrated military command
since President Charles de Gaulle withdrew his forces from it in
1966.
	   However, the French are expected to make up about half the
force. Germany, Britain and the Netherlands also have volunteered
troops, and NATO officials said the force also would be open to
non-NATO members, including Russia.
	   Officials said they expected the NATO ``activation order'' to
come sometime next week, which would begin actually putting Joint
Guarantor into place.

Sioux descendants petition for return of Wounded Knee battle shirt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) _ Descendants of Sioux warriors pleaded
with the city of Glasgow Friday to return a shirt believed to have
been taken from a body of a man killed on the battlefield of
Wounded Knee in 1890.
	   The ``ghost'' shirt, which warriors believed would protect them
in battle, is on display at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery. It
is said to be stained with the blood of a warrior from the infamous
battle, which was the last major conflict between Indians and U.S.
troops.
	   The shirt should be brought home to help the people heal their
grief, Marcella Le Beau, secretary of the Wounded Knee Survivors'
Association, said at a hearing held in another of the city's
museums. A working group is scheduled to make a recommendation to
the city council Nov. 19.
	   ``For the remaining descendants it will bring closure to the sad
and horrible event in the history of our people and the return of
the ghost dance shirt would bring about some healing,'' said Mrs.
Le Beau, who lives in South Dakota.
	   ``The sacred shirt was stolen from the back of a warrior whose
body was buried naked in a mass grave,'' she said. ``No culture in
the world would do this. It is not the proper thing to do.''
	   Along with other American Indian artifacts, the shirt was
brought to Glasgow in 1891 with Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West
traveling show and was taken to the art gallery, where it has
remained ever since.
	   The effort to have the religious artifact repatriated to the
Lakota Sioux began when Georgia lawyer John Earl, of Cherokee
descent, saw it in the art gallery six years ago and informed the
Wounded Knee Survivors' Association of his find.
	   ``The shirt is not really the issue, it is about the treatment
of the Lakota people by the U.S.,'' Earl told the hearing. ``It is
about the rebuilding of self esteem and of a nation suppressed. I
think it would be the honorable thing for the shirt to be
returned.''
	   The Lakota people wish to build a museum at Wounded Knee and the
South Dakota Historical Society has also agreed to store the shirt.
	   But Mark O'Neill, head of curatorial services for Glasgow
Museums and Art Galleries, said the city wants to keep the shirt
and that it is among very few objects with a Wounded Knee
provenance in Europe.
	   ``There are few other objects in our collections which can
communicate so powerfully the bloody consequences of the encounter
between Europeans and first people all over the world.''
	   But he said he could understand the argument for returning the
shirt.
	   ``While history in general cannot be unraveled, it may be the
right thing to do to unravel this particular part and return the
shirt,'' he said. ``It may make a genuine contribution to the
search of the Lakota people for healing which will enable them to
move forward to find a new identity.''

French president inaugurates trade fair
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac on Friday
urged both Mexico and his own country to defend their own cultures
against the onslaught of a global culture as he inaugurated a fair
promoting French culture and education here.
	   It was a reference to complaints by some intellectuals and
officials in both countries that U.S. music, film and computer
culture, together with the English language, threaten their own
cultures.
	   ``By defending our cultures and managing to export them beyond
our borders, we struggle against uniformity and standardization,''
Chirac said.
	   ``In this way we avoid the cultural impoverishment of the world,
which if we are not careful, could emerge as the hidden face of
globalization.''
	   Chirac's second morning in the Mexican capital was devoted more
to culture than to commerce _ though the visit takes place as
Mexican and European negotiators are starting talks on a free trade
pact.
	   Opening a French cultural center in Mexico City on Thursday
night, Chirac praised the host nation.
	   ``Your country,'' he said,`` has managed to join the genius of
the Mesoamerican and Latin civilizations with the most advanced
technologies, achieving political and economic reforms that have
impressed the world.''

	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Four journalists with an Azerbaijani
opposition newspaper were injured Friday when they clashed with
police during a protest of a libel lawsuit against the paper, its
editor said.
	   The head of the presidential administration, Ramiz Mekhtiyev,
has sued the newspaper Yeni Musavat for what he said were articles
damaging to his reputation.
	   Dozens of employees of the newspaper and their supporters
protested Friday outside the Supreme Court in Baku, capital of this
former Soviet republic on the Caspian Sea, editor Rauf Arifogly
told a news conference.
	   Police dispersed the protesters, and four were injured in the
clash, Arifogly said. He didn't give details of the injuries.
	   Human rights groups have criticized Azerbaijan's authoritarian
President Geidar Aliev for cracking down on the press, though he
lifted eased censorship laws this summer ahead of presidential
elections.

to his injuries. Another two wounded soldiers were taken to a
hospital in Pristina. He spoke of ``a clear breach of the spirit of
the peace agreement.''

U.S. commerce secretary promotes business on first Lebanon visit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES last graf with Daley's arrival in Egypt
 &UR; AP Photos BEI-101-2-3
 &UR; By HUSSEIN DAKROUB &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley on
Friday urged American businesses to get more involved in the
multibillion dollar postwar reconstruction of Lebanon, a country
once synonymous with hijackings and hostage-taking.
	   ``The message I brought is that the United States is back and
wants to do more business in Lebanon,'' Daley said after a meeting
with President-elect Emile Lahoud on his one-day visit.
	   U.S. companies have been virtually shut out of major
reconstruction projects after the 1975-90 civil war because of a
decade-old U.S. government travel ban that was lifted last year.
Most contracts went to European and Asian companies.
	   But private American business involvement in the Lebanese
free-market economy has surged in the last few years. The United
States is Lebanon's second-biggest trading partner, selling goods
worth dlrs 550 million and importing dlrs 80 million worth of
merchandise.
	   In a speech to U.S. and Lebanese business executives, Daley
delivered a veiled criticism of the way contracts have been awarded
in the dlrs 13 billion program of reconstruction.
	   ``When American companies bid on projects, whether they win or
lose, they expect the bidding process to be transparent and to be
fair and open,'' he said.
	   Lebanese politicians have frequently leveled charges of
kickbacks and underhand tactics in the awarding of contracts.
	   Daley is the first senior American trade official to visit
Lebanon. As with previous trips by senior U.S. government
officials, security was tight. Instead of landing at Beirut's
gleaming new international airport, Daley took a U.S. military
helicopter from Cyprus to the fortified U.S. Embassy compound north
of Beirut.
	   This is the route taken by U.S. diplomats for more than a
decade. The United States banned travel to Lebanon after a series
of bombings of military and diplomatic compounds in the 1980s that
killed about 270 Americans, including 241 troops. Seventeen
Americans were kidnapped and held hostage during that period.
	   The State Department replaced the ban in July 1997 with an
advisory warning Americans to stay away from Lebanon as it remains
dangerous. American aircraft have been forbidden to land at Beirut
airport since the TWA hijacking in 1985.
	   Asked whether the embargo of Beirut airport was not giving a
negative signal to potential American investors, Daley told The
Associated Press: ``We are trying to give a positive signal. At the
same time, there are difficulties and they have to be acknowledged
and we have to be frank about them.''
	   He said there had been a ``tremendous improvement'' in security
in Lebanon.
	   Among the immediate fruits of Daley's visit was a dlrs 7.5
million deal signed Friday between Continental Electronics Corp. of
Dallas, Texas, and the Lebanese government to build a new radio
station. The U.S. Export-Import Bank will finance the contract.
	   Daley welcomed a parliamentary committee's approval Thursday of
an intellectual property bill on piracy of computer software. The
bill, long demanded by the United States, now goes to the full
legislature for a vote.
	   Daley arrived in Egypt late Friday. He will be visiting Israel
and the Palestinian areas on his tour, which aims to promote
regional economic cooperation. He has already been to Jordan.

Henman wins quarterfinal to clinch Hanover berth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Henman beating Gustafsson. &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Tim Henman blanked Magnus Gustafsson in
a third-set tiebreak to reach the semifinals of the Stockholm Open
Friday night and a berth in the ATP Tour World Championships.
	   Henman, ranked 10th in the world and the highest seed (3) left
in this tournament, won 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-0) before a sellout crowd
at the Royal Tennis Hall.
	   ``It was very close as the scoreboard shows, it was a very good
tiebreak,'' Henman said. ``That was the difference between us. It
put me in the Championships. It's been on my mind for the past six
weeks. I'm really, really pleased.''
	   Henman broke for 4-2 in the third set. But the Swede, cheered on
by his home fans, broke right back in the next game. Both players
then held their serves, setting up the tiebreak.
	   Henman, who clinched the seventh and penultimate berth in the
ATP Tour World Championships in Hanover, Germany, later this month,
will play Todd Martin in the semifinals.
	   Martin stopped Takao Suzuki's run in the Stockholm Open, beating
the Japanese qualifier 6-3, 6-4 in the first quarterfinal.
	   Two British players are now in the opposite side of the draw
going into Saturday's semifinals. The only British player to win
the tournament, one of the world's oldest indoors, was Mark Cox in
1976 after a stunning semifinal win over Jimmy Connors.
	   Greg Rusedski outlasted Daniel Nestor in a quarterfinal clash
between two Canadian-born players 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 6-3.
	   In the semis, Rusedski will play Thomas Johansson or Jason
Stoltenberg, who upset top-ranked Pete Sampras in the opening
round.
	   Rusedski hurt a gluteal muscle during the match and was treated
by a trainer in the second set, won by Nestor after ripping off 10
straight points and taking the last two games to love.
	   ``I got painkillers,'' Rusedski said. ``It felt like I pulled it
a little bit. But he (the trainer) said it was basically an overuse
of the muscle. He doesn't feel that it's anything that will cause
me damage. I'll just go out and play tomorrow. I'm pleased it's too
serious.''
	   Rusedski, the fourth-seed, broke Nestor's serve for the only
time in the decisive set to take a 4-2 lead. A marathon game that
lasted more than 10 minutes, Rusedski won it on his fifth break
point when Nestor netted a volley.
	   ``I just had to forget about it (the injury) in the third set
and go for it,'' Rusedski said. ``Fortunately for me I managed to
get the only break in the third set. That was the key game. It
could have gone either which way.''
	   It was the Briton's 32nd victory indoors this year, tops on the
ATP Tour. Last week, Rusedski beat Sampras to win the Paris Open,
his biggest tournament victory.
	   Rusedski, who is looking to qualify for the ATP Tour World
Championship for the second consecutive year, also reached the
semis here last year but lost to Jan Siemerink.
	   Martin broke Suzuki twice in game seven and nine to win the
first set. After trading service breaks early in the second set,
Martin broke Suzuki again in the last game.
	   Suzuki fell behind 15-40 after two superb crosscourt returns by
Martin. The American clinched the match with a perfect lob.
	   ``The key point of the game came at 15 all in the last game,
when I hit a passing shot for a winner,'' Martin said. ``That gave
me a boost and took the wind out of him.''
	   ``I feel I'm playing great, better than a few years ago. That's
more than I can ask for. I just hope it continues for the rest of
the week and that it doesn't vanish come 1999.''

UEFA bans Ince for three European matches, McManaman for two
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ Liverpool stars Paul Ince and Steve
McManaman have been suspended for three and two European matches
respectively for violent conduct in a UEFA Cup match against
Valencia, UEFA said Friday.
	   Amedeo Carboni of the Spanish side was also suspended for two
European club matches.
	   All three were sent off as the sides tied 2-2, with Liverpool
advancing on away goals to the competition' third round.
	   Another Spanish club, Real Mallorca, had Iovan Stankovic
suspended for four matches following violent conduct in his team's
Cup Winners Cup match against Genk of Belgium.
	   In other decisions, Real Madrid and the Hungarian soccer
association were both fined 15,000 Swiss francs (dlrs 11,000) for
repeatedly selling stadium places beyond the authorized capacity.
	   UEFA confiscated a further 40,000 francs (dlrs 29,500) from Real
and 50,000 francs (dlrs 37,000) from Hungary, which it said
corresponds to the additional revenue from the extra places.
	   The control and disciplinary committee also rejected a protest
by PSV Eindhoven, which wanted to replay a Champions League match
against Germany's Kaiserslautern.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In his first statement since the start of
the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections, President Saddam Hussein
said Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and would accept
``positively any initiative'' that would lift U.N. sanctions.
	   But U.S. President Clinton declared the standoff would end only
with a decision by Iraq to resume its cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now
by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM,'' Clinton said.
	   His warning came shortly after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Iraq to ``reverse course or face the
consequences.''
	   The statements suggested that both sides were no closer to a
compromise that would avert a threatened U.S. attack on Iraq. They
mirrored past declarations made since the crisis began in August _
and offered little room for compromise.
	   In Baghdad, there were widening fears that a U.S. military
strike was imminent. Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations and
shoppers found some prices up in Baghdad's crowded markets Friday.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, selling
vegetables in downtown Baghdad. ``But it's not about any kind of
aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money to buy
food.''
	   Still, the mood seemed defiant, reflecting the government's
efforts to forge a united front against the U.N. sanctions, which
were imposed eight years ago after it invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her
four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   Preachers at Friday prayers in the nation's mosques called on
Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss of
support in its confrontation over the inspections.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   A second dissident group, the London-based Iraqi Broadcasting
Corp., said brigades of the elite Republican Guards have been
dispersed around Baghdad and in provinces further north. It also
said the government had ordered several intelligence and security
departments, such as Military Intelligence and the Special Security
Organization, to move to the outskirts of the capital.
	   ``All their offices are empty now,'' the group said in a fax
sent to Cairo.

Wilander edges childhood idol Borg, McEnroe entertains crowd
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Youth and resilience were the deciding
factors as Mats Wilander edged Bjorn Borg Friday in a battle of
former World No. 1 players in the dlrs 150,000 Delta Airlines ATP
Senior Tour of Champions tournament.
	   Wilander, 34, exploited the advantage he held over his Swedish
compatriot in speed, power and agility to win 6-2, 3-6 and 10-6.
	   A five-time consecutive champion at Wimbledon, Borg rallied back
in the second set, lashing out a host of winners, as if to show
there was still plenty of sting left in his forehand and that he
was still far from the rust pile.
	   But Wilander, a seven-time Grand Slam winner, was able to chase
loose balls more aggressively and attack the net with greater vigor
to wrap up the match against his childhood idol.
	   In the second pool of the round-robin tournament, Iranian
Mansour Bahrami, who had never won a title in his career nor ranked
better than 192nd in the world, turned on a show against another
all-time great, John McEnroe.
	   Outclassed 6-1, 6-4, Bahrami imitated the American in his heyday
as tennis' ``bad boy,'' slamming his racket to the floor and
ranting about line calls.
	   McEnroe, whose competetitive nature recognizes no bounds,
refused to be outdone and humored his opponent, imitating
contemporary stars in their anticipation of a shot or whistling as
he served aces.
	   A 77-title winner, McEnroe even jumped into the drink cooler
after a heated exchange of shots.
	   In the opening match, home favorite Goran Prpic, who received a
wildcard for his debut in the event, defeated the oldest player and
four-time Grand Slam champion, 48-year-old Guillermo Vilas, 6-3,
6-4.
	   Henri Leconte and fellow Frenchman Guy Forget were to meet in
the late match Friday. The winner of each pool meets in a final
showdown on Monday.
	   The Delta Airways Champions is the 14th event on the ATP
Tour-sanctioned worldwide senior tennis circuit.

Russian ship rescues North Koreans drifting in storm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian ship rescued six North Koreans whose
tugboat was ripped from a barge during a storm in the Sea of Japan,
a news report said Friday.
	   The three men, one woman and two children were brought to the
Russian port of Nakhodka and were working with Korean authorities
to return to North Korea, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The barge was going from one North Korean port to another when
it hit a storm and the tugboat broke loose. The Russian ship Ivan
Vernigorenko was on its way to Nakhodka when it spotted the
drifting boat and rescued the Koreans, city officials said.
Nakhodka is about 250 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of the North
Korean border.
	   The report did not say when the rescue took place.

	   LEON, Nicaragua (AP) _ Red dots scattered across the map on
Margarita Clark's wall show villages still not heard from two weeks
after Hurricane Mitch rampaged across Nicaragua and other parts of
Central America.
	   ``I believe that they have food,'' said the Save the Children
charity worker. ``I am worried that they have been drinking
contaminated water and we'll have outbreaks of disease.''
	   Even with massive reconstruction efforts under way following
storms that killed about 10,000 people in four countries, the full
scale of devastation remains unclear: Hundreds of villages remain
unaccounted for.
	   Even in the best of times, it could take a horse or ox to reach
many settlements in the dirt-poor countryside of Honduras and
Nicaragua. Now, with major highways and many phone lines cut, there
has been no way to reach those tiny settlements at all.
	   ``It has not been possible to send aid to more than 300 small,
remote communities which remain incommunicado,'' said Col.
Guillermo Pinel, president of the National Emergency Committee.
	   ``The government is making efforts to rehabilitate the roads,
the bridges, the telephones and the drinking water systems in many
places, but it lacks resources enough to carry out urgent work.''
	   Pinel said Honduras' own 14 military helicopters had been
supplemented by 16 from Mexico and 12 from the United States.
	   But they were not sufficient to both ferry aid and survey damage
in a country whose road system was almost destroyed and where
10,000 people remain missing in addition to almost 7,000 known
dead.
	   Clark said nothing had yet been heard from about 10 percent of
the 148 villages the organization serves in two northwestern
provinces of Nicaragua.
	   ``The access roads are still very full of mud and one village,
Versailles, is surrounded by the mudslide'' from the Casitas
Volcano, which collapsed during the storm, overwhelming several
villages and killing hundreds of people.
	   Nicaragua has confirmed almost 2,000 dead, with hundreds more
missing. Several hundred people also died in Guatemala and El
Salvador.
	   The Roman Catholic Bishop of Leon, Bosco Vivas Robelo, appealed
Thursday night for people to come forward if they were aware of any
towns still isolated.
	   ``After 15 days, practically since the hurricane, they think of
themselves as abandoned brothers,'' the bishop told a news
conference. ``Yes, we are very worried.''
	   Honduras announced Friday that it had received dlrs 67 million
worth of aid from 20 nations _ though President Carlos Flores
Facusse said Thursday that the cost of rebuilding could top dlrs 4
billion.
	   Two or three aid flights were arriving each hour, and one or two
ships with supplies each day.
	   Among those arriving to survey damage on Friday was Spanish
Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon, who met with Flores shortly after
arriving.
	   He flew by helicopter to survey several areas damaged by Mitch
in its Oct. 25-Nov. 2 passage through Honduras.
	   Honduran officials say the storm destroyed about 60 percent of
their road and utility network and about 70 percent of their
agriculture.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Two Yugoslav soldiers were killed
Friday in a new outbreak of violence, further fueling tensions in
the strife-torn Kosovo province.
	   Duncan Bullivant, an international official, said according to
information from the Yugoslav Army and foreign Ministry, an
incident occurred at around 2 p.m. (1300 GMT) in the village of
Dulje on the road connecting Pristina, the capital, and Prizren
near the Albanian border.
	   Bullivant, a spokesman for the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, quoted the Yugoslav officials
as saying that one soldier died on the spot and the other succumbed
to his injuries. Another two wounded soldiers were taken to a
hospital in Pristina. He spoke of ``a clear breach of the spirit of
the peace agreement.''
	   Though details were still unclear Friday night, a crew for
Associated Press Television News said earlier they had heard bursts
of gunfire coming from the region, between Suva Reka and Stimlje
villages. Traffic was backed up in the area. The APTN crew saw two
tanks and several trucks full of soldiers in the vicinity.
	   Meanwhile, in the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness
said Friday Serb police on Thursday opened fire on a group of
ethnic Albanian men and children, killing one of the men and
injuring another. The Kosovo Information Center, close to the
Albanian leadership, also carried the report.
	   Journalists visiting Mlecane Friday saw two pools of blood amid
15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident reportedly
took place. Male villagers, who only recently returned to the homes
they left earlier, said all the women and children had fled again.
	   The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry reported Friday that ethnic
Albanian rebels opened fire Thursday at a police vehicle traveling
the main road, near Mlecane. No causalities were reported and it
was not immediately clear the incident was linked to the shooting
in the village.
	   The continued shootings have chipped away at hopes for a
solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and Albanians, ushered
in by an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb police
forces from Kosovo.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy to the October
agreement, it says it is respecting a de-facto cease fire it
created and responding only when attacked. Authorities claim the
guerrillas are provoking fights, hoping for a massive response
which will revive the threat of NATO airstrikes against Yugoslav
targets.

The Full Monarchy: Charles keeps clothes on at birthday tribute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details of birthday party at Buckingham Palace in
grafs 10-13 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ The difference between ``The Full
Monty'' and ``The Full Monarchy'' is elemental: Prince Charles
keeps his clothes on.
	   But the heir to the throne was a hit nonetheless Friday at a
50th birthday party staged in his honor featuring cast members from
the hit film about unemployed Sheffield men who turn to stripping.
	   The icing on a birthday cake in the shape of a security guard's
cap proclaimed ``The Full Monarchy.''
	   Taking a lead from Hugo Speer, who played ``Lunchbox'' in the
1997 film, Charles quickly mastered the steps and joined in
recreating the scene where the men start dancing while waiting in
line at a job center.
	   ``I've even been given a bit of choreography on how to do things
in a queue,'' Charles said.
	   ``He's a cinch _ a natural,'' Speer said of the prince. ``He
asked for a few tips but didn't need them. It looks like he's been
practicing in his bedroom.''
	   During an earlier visit to a drug rehabilitation center in
Sheffield, Charles encountered a warm admirer in 78-year-old Elaine
Glaza.
	   ``Can I kiss you?'' she asked.
	   ``Absolutely,'' said Charles, and some bystanders shouted ``Go
on, Charlie!'' Mrs. Glaza also gave him cufflinks and a carnation.
	   Later Friday night, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a glittering party
at Buckingham Palace, attended by royals and VIPs for the worlds of
architecture, science, farming, politics and poetry.
	   She toasted his ``vision, compassion and leadership.''
	   ``Here Here,'' the guests exclaimed as the palace ballroom
echoed with applause.
	   Referring to the queen as ``Mummy, coupled with your Majesty,''
the prince replied he did not know how either of his parents had
``put up with'' him.
	   Charles, who reaches the half-century mark Saturday, began his
birthday celebrations Thursday night with a private party at
Hampton Court Palace.
	   Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' longtime love, was among the
guests Thursday, but the event produced no pictures of the two of
them together. She is hosting a party for Charles on Saturday at
Highgrove, his country home.

Battery case reopened against LA Lakers star Shaquille O'Neal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ The battery case against Shaquille
O'Neal of the Los Angeles Lakers was reopened Friday after his
accuser resurfaced and spoke to authorities again.
	   Kim Grant, a 23-year-old worker at Walt Disney World, said last
month the basketball star grabbed her neck outside Disney's
Pleasure Island nightclubs after she tried to end a conversation
with him.
	   Police investigators later tried at least six times to get in
touch with Grant, by telephone and letter, said Cmdr. Steve Jones,
a spokesman for the Orange County sheriff's office. When she
couldn't be contacted, the complaint was shelved.
	   But she came to the sheriff's office Friday. She said she hadn't
known officials were looking for her until newspapers reported last
week that her complaint wasn't being processed because she couldn't
be found.
	   Charges of simple battery will be filed with the state
attorney's office, Jones said.
	   No one was immediately available for comment Friday at
Management Plus, which represents O'Neal. But his agent, Leonard
Armato, said after the complaint was filed that the accusations are
``completely false and without factual support.''
	   In her complaint, Grant said she was on duty at the entrance to
Disney's Pleasure Island when the 7-foot-1 (2.16-meter) center
asked her name and if she had friends.
	   The woman said the men told her they were ``going to look for
girls,'' and she tried to end the conversation with the comment,
``Be my guest.''
	   At that point, the suit says, O'Neal grabbed her by the neck,
pulled her to him and said, ``I was just playing. Can't you take a
joke?'' according to the complaint.
	   O'Neal originally played for the Orlando Magic and still owns a
home in Isleworth, a gated community outside Orlando.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Iraqi prodding, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has no plans to mediate the latest crisis with Iraq and
is still waiting for Baghdad to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors, his spokesman reiterated Friday.
	   Annan met the 15-member Security Council on Friday to discuss
the standoff after a private session with the ambassadors of
Russia, China and France _ who have been sympathetic to Baghdad's
call for lifting crippling economic sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War.
	   The three ambassadors did not respond to shouted questions about
the meeting as they walked into the Security Council chamber,
followed minutes later by Annan.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov indicated that there were no
new initiatives to get Baghdad to rescind its ban on weapons
inspections.
	   ``We are discussing the diplomatic efforts to end the crisis,''
Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun said.
	   As the U.S. military buildup continued amid speculation about
possible American airstrikes, the secretary-general's office and
the U.N. Security Council made clear again Friday that ``the ball

Earthquake in southwest Iran causes landslides

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A relatively strong earthquake jolted
southwest Iran late Friday, causing landslides that blocked roads
to the area, the official Iranian news agency reported.
	   The quake of magnitude 5.7 shook the Khonj-e Lar area of Fars
province for 16 seconds, the Islamic Republic News Agency said in a
report monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp.
	   No information was immediately available about possible
casualties and damage because the landslides had cut off the
affected area, said the report received in Cairo.
	   Iran is periodically stricken by earthquakes, which often cause

32 hurt in bus crash in Mexico

<TEXT>
	   OJINAGA, Mexico (AP) _ A busload of Americans on a day trip to
Mexico were injured Friday when the driver swerved to avoid another
accident and the bus flipped onto its side.
	   Most of the 32 passengers sustained minor injuries, including
cuts, bruises and neck and back pain. A dozen were in serious
condition at Big Bend Regional Medical Center in Alpine, Texas,
said Mike Cox, a spokesman with the Texas Department of Public
Safety.
	   Sherry Prewitt, chief nurse executive at the hospital, said
three or four victims were in critical condition.
	   The accident happened about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of
Ojinaga, U.S. Customs spokesman Roger Maier said. The bus may have
been headed to Copper Canyon, he said.
	   Ms. Prewitt said the driver swerved to avoid an accident on the
road ahead, glimpsed through rain and fog, and lost control of the
bus.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Despite Iraqi prodding, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan has no plans to mediate the latest crisis with Iraq and
is still waiting for Baghdad to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors, his spokesman reiterated Friday.
	   Annan met the 15-member Security Council on Friday to discuss
the standoff after a private session with the ambassadors of
Russia, China and France _ who have been sympathetic to Baghdad's
call for lifting crippling economic sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War.
	   The three ambassadors did not respond to shouted questions about
the meeting as they walked into the Security Council chamber,
followed minutes later by Annan.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov indicated that there were no
new initiatives to get Baghdad to rescind its ban on weapons
inspections.
	   ``We are discussing the diplomatic efforts to end the crisis,''
Chinese Ambassador Qin Huasun said.
	   As the U.S. military buildup continued amid speculation about
possible American airstrikes, the secretary-general's office and
the U.N. Security Council made clear again Friday that ``the ball
is in Iraq's court'' and the resumption of unfettered weapons
inspections is non-negotiable.

Israel does not expect warning of U.S. attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with contents of Clinton letter to Arafat, 9th-10th
grafs &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG LANGLOIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel is acting on the assumption that the
United States will not give it advance warning before launching a
military strike against Iraq, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai said Friday.
	   ``We are preparing for a situation ... in which we will be taken
by surprise,'' he told Channel 2 television.
	   However he believed even if Washington did not send express
warning to Israel, it would send ``some sort of signals.'' It was
in response to signals of this kind from Washington that he had
ordered the army to open gas mask distribution centers for
civilians.
	   A senior adviser to Mordechai said Friday that the delivery of
American Patriot missiles to Israel is being delayed to avoid
creating the impression that Israel is a party to the dispute
between the U.S. and Iraq.
	   ``If Patriots are brought here, it means we are once again a
little more involved in the conflict, when one of our aims is not
to be involved in the conflict,'' said David Ivri, who is a retired
air force general.
	   Ivri said if the situation in the Gulf deteriorates a decision
may be taken to bring the Patriots to Israel
	   Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Friday that Israel ``will
know how to defend its people'' against a possible Iraqi attack
does not consider itself a player in the confrontation.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, meanwhile, said he hoped for a
``peaceful solution through the terms of Kofi Annan,'' the U.N.
secretary general who cut short a trip to Africa to deal with the
crisis. Arafat has said that a U.S. strike against Iraq could
hinder the peace process between the Palestinians and Israel.
	   Arafat received a letter from President Clinton Friday, the
Palestinian news agency WAFA said Friday. Clinton assured Arafat
that the United States is trying to avoid military action against
Iraq, Nabil Shaath, a senior aide to Arafat, said.
	   However Clinton also stressed the dangerous situation caused by
Iraq's refusal to cooperate with the United Nations weapons
inspectors, Shaath told reporters after the Palestinian cabinet
meeting.
	   In Israel, meanwhile, gas mask distribution centers shut down
Friday afternoon for the Jewish Sabbath. Israel began distributing
gas masks to its citizens in the months leading to the 1991 Gulf
War when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein threatened to attack Israel
with chemical weapons.
	   During the war, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with conventional
warheads at Israel in an attempt to draw it into the fighting and
break up the Arab coalition against Iraq. Patriot anti-aircraft
missiles sent to Israel at the time by the United States proved
ineffectual against the Scuds.
	   At the request of the United States, Israel did not retaliate at
the time against Iraq.
	   Asked Friday whether Israel would strike back this time, if
attacked by Iraq, Sharon said: ``I think it's well-known in the
Middle East, that Israel will know how to defend its people,''
Sharon said.
	   However he downplayed the threat to Israel.
	   ``I think we have have to continue to lead our normal lives. I
would like to encourage tourists to come. As you will see, it is
beautiful here, wonderful weather. Life is normal,'' he said.
	   Nevertheless British tour operators cut short the vacations of
hundreds of British tourists in the Israeli Red Sea resort of Eilat
and brought them home.
	   In addition, the European Under-18 Championships qualifying
soccer tournament, scheduled to take place in Israel next week, was
canceled because of security concerns. England, Israel, Andorra and
Spain were to compete in the tournament.

Italy's health institute brands treatment a failure
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's national institute of health on Friday
branded a failure a cocktail of hormones and vitamins prescribed as
a cancer cure by an Italian doctor who was seen as a hero by many
patients.
	   Earlier this year hundreds of cancer patients streamed to Dr.
Luigi Di Bella's office in the northern city of Modena for
prescriptions, and they and their relatives and friends
demonstrated by the thousands in cities throughout Italy to push
for clinical trials.
	   The treatment centers on the natural hormone of somatostatin,
coupled with vitamin A derivatives.
	   A study of 386 patients who were being treated with Di Bella's
formula found that 57 percent of them died and 33 percent saw their
cancer advance. In 3 percent of the patients the cancer stayed as
it was, while in 1 percent the tumors shrunk by at least 50
percent.
	   The health institute said it lost track of the remaining six
percent of the patients in the study.
	   Di Bella had lobbied the government for years for permission to
use his treatment.
	   Permission was turned down a total of four times in 1996 and
1997 by the government cancer and pharmaceutical commissions, but
public clamor for the treatment was so strong that the health
minister decided to have the national health institute conduct
trials using patients who voluntarily took the Di Bella treatment.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ In his first statement since the start of
the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections, President Saddam Hussein
said Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and would accept
``positively any initiative'' that would lift U.N. sanctions.
	   But U.S. President Bill Clinton declared the standoff would end
only with a decision by Iraq to resume its cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``Saddam Hussein has it within his hands to end this crisis now
by resuming full cooperation with UNSCOM,'' Clinton said.
	   His warning came shortly after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warned Iraq to ``reverse course or face the
consequences.''
	   The statements suggested that both sides were no closer to a
compromise that would avert a threatened U.S. attack on Iraq. They
mirrored past declarations made since the crisis began in August _
and offered little room for compromise.
	   In Baghdad, there were widening fears that a U.S. military
strike was imminent. Queues of hundreds formed at gas stations and
shoppers found some prices up in Baghdad's crowded markets Friday.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, selling
vegetables in downtown Baghdad. ``But it's not about any kind of
aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money to buy
food.''
	   Still, the mood seemed defiant, reflecting the government's
efforts to forge a united front against the U.N. sanctions, which
were imposed eight years ago after it invaded Kuwait.
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, as she shopped for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her
four children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   Preachers at Friday prayers in the nation's mosques called on
Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss of
support in its confrontation over the inspections.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   A second dissident group, the London-based Iraqi Broadcasting
Corp., said brigades of the elite Republican Guards had been
dispersed around Baghdad and in provinces further north. It also
said the government had ordered several intelligence and security
departments, such as Military Intelligence and the Special Security
Organization, to move to the outskirts of the capital.
	   ``All their offices are empty now,'' the group said in a fax
sent to Cairo.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two days of local and Senate
elections began Friday in the Czech Republic, testing the nation's
political stability after a leftward shift in the government
earlier this year.
	   No dramatic changes are expected, but the voting for the upper
chamber of parliament are a test of support for Prime Minister
Milos Zeman's government.
	   Polls closed at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT). They will reopen again at 7
a.m. (0600 GMT) on Saturday as Czechs choose their local
governments and one third of the 81-member Senate.
	   The first day of voting was without incident, and the turnout
reported from all over the country was low, the official news
agency CTK reported.

Brazil's president speaks out on corruption allegations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BY JACK EPSTEIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Cardoso angrily
denied allegations he hid millions of dollars in an overseas bank
and warned journalists Friday to show him more respect by not
asking more questions.
	   Police said Thursday they would look into the charges that
Cardoso and three political allies diverted dlrs 368 million to a
Cayman Islands corporate account.
	   ``At the exact moment that I spend days and nights defending our
currency, the dignity of the presidency is indispensable,'' Cardoso
said.
	   The president is trying to narrow an enormous budget deficit and
avoid a currency crisis. On Friday, the International Monetary Fund
announced approval of a long-expected dlrs 41.5 billion rescue
package for Brazil.
	   The allegations emerged in documents sent to authorities over
the weekend implicating Sao Paulo Gov. Mario Covas, Health Minister
Jose Serra and ex-Communications Minister Sergio Motta, who died
last April. While the president is not mentioned specifically, the
name Fernando appears in one letter.
	   It is unclear where the documents came from. The original
documents have not been released; only copies have been seen.
	   Cardoso claims the letters were fabricated by political rivals
who ``lack credibility'' _ an apparent reference to ex-President
Fernando Collor de Mello and Paulo Maluf, the former mayor of Sao
Paulo and a failed gubernatorial candidate in last month's general
elections.
	   Both Collor, who was impeached in 1992 on charges of influence
peddling, and Maluf have denied knowledge of the documents.
	   ``It's sad that space is given (in the press) to those who
should be in jail for making false accusations,'' Cardoso said.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ A British company unexpectedly withdrew
independent inspection agents from Iraq's borders Friday, a move
that could disrupt the flow of badly needed humanitarian aid and
spare parts for the country's oil sector, a U.N. spokesman said.
	   If the move slows the delivery of humanitarian aid, Iraq is
likely to cut off oil exports, Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said.
	   ``If the incoming supplies stop because of this action, there is
no reason for Iraq to keep pumping oil,'' he said. ``I believe this
is going to happen.''

	   OJINAGA, Mexico (AP) _ A busload of Americans on a day trip to
Mexico were injured Friday when the driver swerved to avoid another
accident and the bus flipped onto its side.
	   Most of the 32 passengers sustained minor injuries, including
cuts, bruises and neck and back pain. A dozen were in serious
condition at Big Bend Regional Medical Center in Alpine, Texas,
said Mike Cox, a spokesman with the Texas Department of Public
Safety.
	   Sherry Prewitt, chief nurse executive at the hospital, said
three or four victims were in critical condition.
	   The accident happened about 30 miles (50 kilometers) south of
Ojinaga, U.S. Customs spokesman Roger Maier said.
	   Ms. Prewitt said the driver swerved to avoid an accident on the
road ahead, glimpsed through rain and fog, and lost control of the
bus.
	   The victims, who are members of Elderhostel, an educational
travel program for older people, left the Davis Mountains
Environmental Education Center in Fort Davis area on a Mexican tour
bus en route to Copper Canyon, said John Mitchell, a spokesman for
center.

Henman wins quarterfinal in Stockholm to clinch Hanover berth
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Johansson winning last quarterfinal &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Tim Henman blanked Magnus Gustafsson in
a third-set tiebreak to reach the semifinals of the Stockholm Open
Friday night and a berth in the ATP Tour World Championships.
	   Henman, ranked 10th in the world and the highest seed (3) left
in this tournament, won 6-3, 3-6, 7-6 (7-0) before a sellout crowd
at the Royal Tennis Hall.
	   ``It was very close as the scoreboard shows, it was a very good
tiebreak,'' Henman said. ``That was the difference between us. It
put me in the Championships. It's been on my mind for the past six
weeks. I'm really, really pleased.''
	   Henman broke for 4-2 in the third set. But the Swede, cheered on
by his home fans, broke right back in the next game. Both players
then held their serves, setting up the tiebreak.
	   But Henman was in trouble with the score 4-4 in the decisive
set, falling behind both 0-30 and 30-40 with serve. Gustafsson
netted a return on break point and then Henman aced the Swede.
	   Henman, who clinched the seventh and penultimate berth in the
ATP Tour World Championships in Hanover, Germany, later this month,
will play Todd Martin in the semifinals.
	   Martin stopped Takao Suzuki's run in the Stockholm Open, beating
the Japanese qualifier 6-3, 6-4 in the first quarterfinal.
	   Two British players are now in the opposite side of the draw
going into Saturday's semifinals. The only British player to win
the tournament, one of the world's oldest indoors, was Mark Cox in
1976 after a stunning semifinal win over Jimmy Connors.
	   Greg Rusedski outlasted Daniel Nestor in a quarterfinal clash
between two Canadian-born players 7-6 (7-2), 1-6, 6-3.
	   In the semis, Rusedski will play Thomas Johansson, who edged
Jason Stoltenberg 7-5, 7-5. Stoltenberg had upset top-ranked Pete
Sampras in the first round.
	   Rusedski hurt a gluteal muscle during the match and was treated
by a trainer in the second set, won by Nestor after ripping off 10
straight points and taking the last two games to love.
	   ``I got painkillers,'' Rusedski said. ``It felt like I pulled it
a little bit. But he (the trainer) said it was basically an overuse
of the muscle. He doesn't feel that it's anything that will cause
me damage.''
	   Rusedski, the fourth-seed, broke Nestor's serve for the only
time in the decisive set to take a 4-2 lead. A marathon game that
lasted more than 10 minutes, Rusedski won it on his fifth break
point when Nestor netted a volley.
	   ``I just had to forget about it (the injury) in the third set
and go for it,'' Rusedski said. ``Fortunately for me I managed to
get the only break in the third set. That was the key game. It
could have gone either which way.''
	   It was the Briton's 32nd victory indoors this year, tops on the
ATP Tour. Last week, Rusedski beat Sampras to win the Paris Open,
his biggest tournament victory.
	   Rusedski, who is looking to qualify for the ATP Tour World
Championship for the second consecutive year, also reached the
semis here last year but lost to Jan Siemerink.
	   Martin broke Suzuki twice in game seven and nine to win the
first set. After trading service breaks early in the second set,
Martin broke Suzuki again in the last game.
	   Suzuki fell behind 15-40 after two superb crosscourt returns by
Martin. The American clinched the match with a perfect lob.
	   ``The key point of the game came at 15 all in the last game,
when I hit a passing shot for a winner,'' Martin said. ``That gave
me a boost and took the wind out of him.''

Britain withraws 400 more troops from Northern Ireland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with release of IRA prisoner in grafs 5-7 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Britain is withdrawing another
400 troops from Northern Ireland because of the reduced threat from
paramilitary groups, Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said Friday.
	   The troops from the Royal Artillery had been based in County
Armagh.
	   The withdrawal leaves 15,000 soldiers in Northern Ireland, the
lowest level since 1970 and down by 2,000 from this summer, the
army said.
	   Irish Foreign Minister David Andrews said the troop removal and
the dismantling of borderside vehicle checkpoints were ``important
steps on the way to the normalization of security arrangements,''
following the Northern Ireland peace accord.
	   Later on Friday, an Irish Republican Army prisoner was freed in
Ireland under the terms of the Good Friday peace agreement,
	   Peter Sherry, 43, was jailed for life in 1985 for explosive
offenses in England.
	   More than 200 of an eligible 450 prisoners have been paroled as
part of April's agreement outlining how Protestants and Catholics
should jointly govern Northern Ireland.

Russians lead opening events

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - Russians led the opening three
events Friday at the Nations Cup with men's world champion Alexei
Yagudin showing juggling skills as well as skating.
	   Ice dance world champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov
made their season's debut and comfortably led after the opening
sections of their event. Pair skaters Maria Petrova and Alexei
Tikhonov were also in first.
	   Yagudin used a circus theme that included portions of juggling
motions while entering into jumps to leap into first in the men's
event after the short program.
	   Yagudin did all his elements cleanly -- including a high triple
axel-triple toe loop -- to score marks between 5.7 and 5.9 despite
being the first skater.
	   ``It wasn't difficult for me to skate first,'' Yagudin said.
``It is never difficult for me to skate. First or last it doesn't
matter.''
	   Another Russian, Alexander Abt, was second. Abt had a more
difficult routine than Yagudin but missed a triple axel-triple loop
slightly and two footed a quadruple attempt. Quads are now allowed
in the short program. which is one-third of the total mark.
	   ``It was the first time I showed this short program and I was
nervous but I wanted to risk everything,'' Abt said. ``I say `The
sooner you try something the sooner you will be successful.'''
	   Still he took second with Andreas Vlacenko of Germany third.
	   The men have their long program Saturday night and it will be
hard for Yagudin to better his performance at Skate America when he
did nine triple jumps -- one more than legal.
	   With three-time world champion Elvis Stojko of Canada still slow
in coming back from a groin injury, Yagudin looks to dominate the
season.
	   Yagudin is now coached by Tatiana Tarasova, who guided Ilia
Kulik and ice dancers Pasha Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov to Olympic
gold medals in Nagano, Japan.
	   In the compulsory dance, the Tango Romantica, Krylova and
Ovsianikov skated first and scored marks mostly of 5.7 and 5.8 with
a pair of 5.9s, unusually high with the rest of the field to come.
	   In the original dance later Friday, Krylova and Ovsiannikov
stayed in the lead with a fast-flowing presentation to the music
from La Traviata.
	   Canadians Shae-Lynn Bourne and Victor Kraatz were in second,
despite an softer interpretation of a waltz to an Irish song in
Gaelic by Clannad. They got firsts from two of the nine judges --
the German and Canadian. Kraatz was born in Berlin.
	   Third was the German couple of Kati Winkler and Rene Lohse.
	   The women's competition begins Saturday with Russians looking to
continue winning. European champion Maria Butyrskaya is the
favorite.
	   With Olympic champion Tara Lipinski leaving the eligible ranks
and world champion Michelle Kwan taking the year off from these
competitions the women's field is wide open this year.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Lalique Trophy in Paris next week.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

The Full Monarchy: Charles keeps clothes on at birthday tribute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more details of party at Buckingham Palace in
graf 9 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ The difference between ``The Full
Monty'' and ``The Full Monarchy'' is elemental: Prince Charles
keeps his clothes on.
	   But the heir to the throne was a hit nonetheless Friday at a
50th birthday party staged in his honor featuring cast members from
the hit film about unemployed Sheffield men who turn to stripping.
	   The icing on a birthday cake in the shape of a security guard's
cap proclaimed ``The Full Monarchy.''
	   Taking a lead from Hugo Speer, who played ``Lunchbox'' in the
1997 film, Charles quickly mastered the steps and joined in
recreating the scene where the men start dancing while waiting in
line at a job center.
	   ``I've even been given a bit of choreography on how to do things
in a queue,'' Charles said.
	   ``He's a cinch _ a natural,'' Speer said of the prince. ``He
asked for a few tips but didn't need them. It looks like he's been
practicing in his bedroom.''
	   During an earlier visit to a drug rehabilitation center in
Sheffield, Charles encountered a warm admirer in 78-year-old Elaine
Glaza.
	   ``Can I kiss you?'' she asked.
	   ``Absolutely,'' said Charles, and some bystanders shouted ``Go
on, Charlie!'' Mrs. Glaza also gave him cufflinks and a carnation.
	   Later Friday night, Queen Elizabeth II hosted a glittering party
at Buckingham Palace, attended by royals and VIPs from the worlds
of architecture, science, farming, politics and poetry.
	   Rock music mixed with classical; jugglers and ``aliens'' mingled
with celebrities; street theatre collided with harpists, a military
band and an opera company. Representatives of the 400 organizations
Charles has been associated with were also in attendance.
	   The queen toasted her son's ``vision, compassion and
leadership.''
	   ``Here Here,'' the guests exclaimed as the palace ballroom
echoed with applause.
	   Referring to the queen as ``Mummy, coupled with your Majesty,''
the prince replied he did not know how either of his parents had
``put up with'' him.
	   Charles, who reaches the half-century mark Saturday, began his
birthday celebrations Thursday night with a private party at
Hampton Court Palace.
	   Camilla Parker Bowles, Charles' longtime love, was among the
guests Thursday, but the event produced no pictures of the two of
them together. She is hosting a party for Charles on Saturday at
Highgrove, his country home.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A top Yugoslav official ruled out
involving separatist Albanian guerrillas Friday in peace plans for
Kosovo, where two Yugoslav soldiers were killed in a new outbreak
of violence.
	   The soldiers died after fighting near the village of Dulje on
the road connecting Pristina, the capital, and Prizren near the
Albanian border, said Duncan Bullivant, a spokesman for the
54-nation Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
	   Though details were still unclear Friday night, a crew for
Associated Press Television News said they had heard bursts of
gunfire coming from the region and saw two tanks and several trucks
full of soldiers.
	   The continued shootings have chipped away at hopes for a
solution to the Kosovo crisis between Serbs and Albanians, ushered
in by an Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb police
forces from Kosovo.
	   In the central Kosovo village of Mlecane, eyewitness said Friday
that Serb police opened fire on a group of ethnic Albanian men and
children Thursday, killing one of the men and injuring another. The
Kosovo Information Center, close to the Albanian leadership, also
carried the report.
	   Journalists visiting Mlecane on Friday saw two pools of blood
amid 15-20 scattered machine gun shells where the incident
reportedly took place.
	   The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry reported Friday that ethnic
Albanian rebels opened fire Thursday at a police vehicle traveling
the main road near Mlecane. No causalities were reported and it was
not immediately clear the incident was linked to the shooting in
the village.
	   While the Kosovo Liberation Army was not privy to the October
agreement, it says it is respecting a de-facto cease fire it
created and responding only when attacked. Yugoslav authorities
claim the guerrillas are provoking fights, hoping for a massive
response which will revive the threat of NATO airstrikes against
Yugoslav targets.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the
province has left hundreds dead, mostly ethnic Albanians, and made
refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   Earlier Friday, a statement issued by Deputy Premier Zoran Lilic
and carried by the Tanjug news agency excluded participation of the
militant Kosovo Liberation Army in the peace process, saying
``there is no place for extremists, terrorism, abductions,
killings, armed attacks.''
	   Alluding to the Oct. 12 agreement signed by Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic pledging a pullback of Yugoslav army and Serb
police forces from Kosovo, he said: ``An agreement respected only
by one side stands no chance.''
	   At talks in Belgrade with European Union envoy Wolfgang
Petritsch, Lilic said authorities are abiding by the agreement,
meant to set up a deal designed to restore autonomy to Kosovo, an
Albanian-majority province of Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav
republic.
	   Earlier Friday, armed Serb civilians swapped hostages with
ethnic Albanian guerrillas, defusing a local standoff.
	   The Serbs seized as many as 100 Kosovo Albanians starting
Wednesday, by stopping vehicles on a road from neighboring
Montenegro, which along with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia.
	   The exchanges took place at Leposavic, a village close to the
boundary with Montenegro, shortly after midnight, sources said.
Members of a still-forming 2,000-strong team meant to monitor the
October agreement mediated in the releases.
	   In Brussels Friday, NATO ambassadors approved plans Friday for a
French-commanded rapid reaction force that will stand ready to
rescue the unarmed civilian verifiers in Kosovo should they come
under threat.

	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The looming confrontation in Iraq and the
Middle East peace process will top the agenda of Russia's defense
minister and Austria's foreign minister who arrived for separate
talks with Syrian officials Friday.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev would also look at ways of
``boosting military cooperation with Damascus,'' a Russian official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said Russia expected to cut arms deals with Syria,
but did not elaborate.
	   Russia has strong influence in Syria, which had close military
ties to the former Soviet Union.
	   Sergeyev will fly to Egypt on Saturday.
	   Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel told reporters on
his arrival that Iraq should cooperate with U.N. inspectors charged
with overseeing the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened to attack Iraq if
it does not rescind its decisions of August and October that block
U.N. arms inspectors and monitors.
	   Schuessel, who will spend two days here, said Syria had a
``major role'' to play in peace in the Middle East.
	   Israeli-Syrian peace talks have been stalled since early 1996.
Syria insists on the unconditional return of the Golan Heights,
which Israel captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. Israel says the
plateau is essential to its security.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Two days of local and Senate
elections began Friday in the Czech Republic, testing the nation's
political stability after a leftward shift in the government
earlier this year.
	   No dramatic changes are expected, but the voting for the upper
chamber of parliament are a test of support for Prime Minister
Milos Zeman's government.
	   Polls closed at 10 p.m. (2100 GMT). They will reopen again at 7
a.m. (0600 GMT) on Saturday as Czechs choose their local
governments and one third of the 81-member Senate.
	   The first day of voting was without incident, and the turnout
reported from all over the country was low, the official news
agency CTK reported.
 &UR; Following two years, pick up 3rd graf pvs.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A relatively strong earthquake jolted
southwest Iran late Friday, killing at least 4 people and injuring
about 80, the official Iranian news agency reported.
	   The quake of magnitude 5.7 shook the Khonj-e Lar area of Fars
province for 16 seconds at 4:33 p.m. local time (1303 GMT), the
Islamic Republic News Agency said in a report monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp.
	   The tremor provoked landslides that prevented rescuers from
reaching the area by road, said the report received in Cairo.
	   The agency said its casualty toll was preliminary.
	   The greatest damage appeared to be in the village of Beyghard,
20 kilometers (13 miles) east of Khonj town, the agency said. The
villages's water and electricity supplies were severed.
	   Houses and shops in Khonj itself were damaged.
	   Iran is periodically stricken by earthquakes, which often cause
wide scale damage and loss of life.

Moenchengladbach ends losing streak with Rainer Bonhoff
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Rainer Bonhoff, the club's only link to the famous
teams of the seventies, led bottom-of-the-table Borussia
Moenchengladbach to a Bundesliga draw in his debut as coach.
	   Visiting Moenchengladbach played Hansa Rostock 1-1, snapping a
six-match losing streak that had plummented the two-time UEFA Cup
holder into its deepest crisis in 35 Bundesliga years.
	   ``We can use the point, but to get out of the cellar is the
important thing,'' said Bonhoff, who played on Germany's 1974 World
Cup champions.
	   But the draw was a step up for Moenchengladbach, which won five
Bundesliga titles in the seventies, following 7-1 and 8-2 blowouts
in its last two matches that led to the firing of the team's coach
and manager.
	   Karlheinz Pflipsen, setup on a counter by Austrian teammate Toni
Polster, put Moenchengladbach ahead 1-0 in the 35th minute.
Poland's Slavomir Majak equalized 16 minutes later for Rostock,
also struggling through six outings without a win.
	   Another German coach, Otto Rehhagel, also enjoyed a sucessful
homecoming as FC Kaiserslautern edged his former club, Werder
Bremen 1-0.
	   Kaiserslautern, climbing into second, beat Werder Bremen 1-0
behind Egyptian defender Hany Ramzy's 75th-minute header.
	   Rehhagel won for the first time in Bremen since resigning there
in 1995 after coaching the club 16 years and winning a UEFA Cup.

	    &UR; Couple builds thousands of birdhouses for love, not money
	   CEDARVILLE, Michigan (AP) _ Harry and Helen Harris build houses
for the birds and sell them for a song _ or give them away, if
you're short of cash. After all, what's a few dollars between
friends of fowls?
	   ``I tell people if you'll put 'em up and take care of them and
take them down in the fall and not let them stand there and rot,
you can have all you need,'' says Harry Harris, who at age 81 can
still assemble one of his creations in a few minutes.
	   By their reckoning, the Harrises have made more than 5,000
birdhouses in 35 years and have given away 4,000 of them. But if
their project hasn't been a golden egg, neither has it cracked
their bank account, for they craft the houses entirely from
secondhand wood and nails.
	   The houses, designed mostly for tree swallows and bluebirds, are
a common sight around the village of Cedarville, where the Harrises
have lived since 1956.
	   They mount dozens each spring along the two-lane highway that
runs through town, including one outside the post office, and
remove them in fall. Harris and a friend place more than 100 on
poles in shallow Lake Huron waters around the Les Cheneaux Islands.
	   ``You see them along the road, in the marshes, everywhere. It's
unbelievable,'' says Bob Sherlund, manager of Cedarville Foods.
Harris visits the store regularly to retrieve its castoff fruit
crates, a primary source of wood for birdhouses.
	   Over the years, others in the area have donated materials.
Builders provide scrap lumber. One day an anonymous donor left 20
pails of paint at their house.
	   ``We never did find out who left it. Nobody ever hinted,'' says
Mrs. Harris, 77, who paints fancy designs on the houses meant for
sale.
	   ``Harry's one of those people who has to be doing something, and
he loves birds, so it works out all the way around,'' says Michigan
Aububon Society spokesman Bob Whiting.
	   The Harrises provide unassembled birdhouse components to
Southview Elementary School in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, where
fifth-grade students put them together and sell them to support a
wetlands restoration project.
	   ``They're a big hit with the kids. It's a fun way for them to
gain an appreciation for the environment,'' said teacher Ruth
Wilson, whose father is a friend of Whiting and arranged for the
shipments.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Use information from the story to answer the following
questions:
	   1. For the past 35 years, what have Harry and Helen Harris been
building?
	   2. What does the writer mean when he says that the Harrises'
birdhouse hobby hasn't ``cracked their bank account.''
	   3. Where do the bird-loving couple get most of the wood needed
for their construction project?
	   4. How long does it take Harris to put together his creation?
Who decorates the houses?
	   5. Of the 5,000 birdhouses built by the Michigan couple, how
many did they sell?
	   6. Why do you think that the Harrises didn't mind giving away so
many of the houses?
	   7. Why does the 81-year-old craftsman request that the wooden
structures be taken down in the fall?
	   8. Name two types of birds that inhabit Cedarville, Michigan.
	   9. If you lived in Cedarville, where might you spot the
birdhouses?
	   10. Why do you think that the fifth-graders at Southview
Elementary School had so much fun assembling birdhouses?
	   ___ &QC; 
	   BIRDHOUSE BUSINESS:
	   If the Harrises taught you how to build and decorate birdhouses,
you could go into the birdhouse business! Design an advertisement
for your local newspaper offering birdhouses by mail. Include a
picture of the house, its price, and an order form. Is assembly
required?
	   ___ &QC; 
	   Answer Key: (Wording may vary)
	   1. For 35 years, the Harrises have been building houses for
birds.
	   2. Answers will vary.
	   3. The Michigan couple craft the birdhouses mainly out of wood
from castoff (discarded) fruit crates.
	   4. Harry Harris can put together one of his wooden structures in
a few minutes. His wife paints fancy designs on the houses that
will be offered for sale.
	   5. The hobbyists sold 1,000 houses and gave away 4,000.
	   6. Answers will vary.
	   7. If the houses are not removed in the fall, the wood will rot.
	   8. Tree swallows and bluebirds can be found in the town.
	   9. The houses can be seen along the highway, in marshes and near
the post office. They are mounted in the spring.
	   10. Answers will vary.

Gov't opts for Moneo's discreet design in Prado Museum extension

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain, (AP) _ Hoping to ease the Prado museum's severe
space problems, Spain's Culture Ministry has chosen a discreet and
restrained extension plan designed by the prize-winning Spanish
architect Rafael Moneo.
	   The scale model of Moneo's design, unveiled to the public
Friday, demonstrates the architect's intention not to interfere
with the austere and majestic design of the Prado's 18th century
main building located along Madrid's Paseo del Prado boulevard.
	   Architects from around the world were invited to design the best
way to annex a church located at the back of the Prado to the
museum itself.
	   Moneo, who was born in the northern Spanish town of Tudela in
1937, plans to link the Prado and the reformed cloister of the
Jeronimos church with a glass and steel underground passage which
will serve as the main entrance to the museum.
	   Moneo also intends to have the church and reconstructed cloister
serve as space for special exhibitions, thus alleviating space
pressure at the museum's main building.
	   The cloister is also to hold the museum's 200,000-volume library
as well as the museum's restoration workshops.
	   Moneo's final plan is to be presented within three months and
the construction, estimated at 3.5 billion pesetas (dlrs 2.5
million), is to take two years to complete.
	   ``The Prado must continue to be the Prado,'' Moneo told the
leading daily El Pais this week.
	   Moneo won the prestigious Pritzker Prize for architecture in
1996 and is to design the Los Angeles Roman Catholic cathedral
which is expected to be the biggest Roman Catholic church in the
United States.
	   Spain's Prado was opened as a public museum in 1819 and is
ranked among the world's top three museums for Old Master and
19th-century art.

Officials discover tunnel dug by prison inmates in escape attempt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Corrections officials discovered a
tunnel more than 40 feet (12 meters) burrowed by inmates attempting
to escape a maximum-security prison, Corrections Administrator Zoe
Laboy confirmed Friday.
	   The tunnel was discovered Thursday by guards at the Western
Detention Center in Mayaguez, on Puerto Ricos' west coast. The
tunnel proceeded in the direction of a minimum-security camp
nearby.
	   A violent riot occurred in late 1997 at the same prison, leaving
two buildings heavily damaged and forcing officials to relocate the
230 inmates. The prisoners were later returned to the facility,
however.
	   Officials said nobody escaped and no charges have been filed yet
against any inmates.

Kofi Annan has no plans to mediate the latest crisis with Iraq and

weapons inspectors, his spokesman reiterated Friday.

the Iraqi standoff after a private session with the ambassadors of
Russia, China and France _ who have been sympathetic to Baghdad's
call for the lifting of crippling economic sanctions imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, triggering the Gulf War.

Jordanian opposition party denounces U.S. threat to strike Iraq

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan's largest opposition group condemned
Friday the U.S. threats to strike Iraq, saying such an attack would
be a ``Crusader-Zionist'' blow against Arabs and Muslims.
	   The fundamentalist Islamic Action Front urged Arab and Muslim
countries ``to refuse and condemn the American aggression and
prevent the use of their territories as bases for American
forces.''
	   In Cairo, the top Islamic authority, the Grand Sheik Al-Azhar,
Mohammed Sayyed Tantawi, called for ``holy war in case of an
American attack against Iraq.''
	   ``We should support our brothers, the Iraqis, against the
American aggression with all the power we have and with weapons, if
necessary,'' the government-run newspaper Al-Gumhuriya quoted
Tantawi as saying in a Friday prayers sermon.
	   The U.S. and Britain have moved forces to the Gulf and
threatened to attack Iraq if it does not reverse its decision to
block the work of U.N. inspectors charged with overseeing the
elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Islamic Action Front, the political arm of Jordan's Muslim
Brotherhood Movement, said in a statement said that these threats
were ``a joint Crusader-Zionist war on all Arab and Muslim
resurrection forces.''
	   The front appealed to Muslims to ``confront the coming assault''
and called on Arab legislatures to press their governments to
``defy the American scheme which aims to destroy the nation and its
fortunes.''
	   The statement stopped short of calling for pro-Iraqi
demonstrations. This week the Jordanian government issued a ban on
such protests.
	   During the previous Iraq-U.N. standoff in February, the front
and other groups defied a government ban and staged pro-Iraq
protests in southern Jordan that turned violent. One person was
killed and 24 others were injured in the riots.
	   The front is highly critical of U.S. policy in the Middle East,
saying it is biased towards Israel and bent on controlling Arab oil
wealth.

	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) _ Indianapolis Colts fullback Craig Heyward
was alert and talking after a 12-hour operation that failed to

	   Heyward, listed in serious but stable condition Friday, is
expected to remain in Methodist Hospital's intensive care unit for
several days, said spokeswoman Jennifer Farley.
	   The shrimp-sized tumor, known as a chordoma, was entwined with
vital brain structures, said neurosurgeon Dr. Troy Payner. Doctors
said they removed as much of the tumor as they could.
	   The 32-year-old Heyward had complained of blurred vision in his
right eye last week, prompting a series of tests that showed a
tumor pressing on the optic nerve.
	   Most patients require further surgery and radiation treatment
after the initial surgery, the hospital said.
	   Mitesh Shah, a neurosurgeon with the Indiana University School
of Medicine, said that because chordoma tumors grow slowly, most
people can lead normal lives for a long time even if the tumor
returns.
	   Heyward, who has played 11 years in the North America's National
Football League, was placed on the non-football injured list
Monday, ending his season. The Colts signed fullback Kantroy Barber
off Buffalo's practice squad to fill the roster spot.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A relatively strong earthquake jolted
southwest Iran late Friday, killing at least 4 people and injuring
about 80, the official Iranian news agency reported.
	   The quake of magnitude 5.7 shook the Khonj-e Lar area of Fars
province for 16 seconds at 4:33 p.m. local time (1303 GMT), the
Islamic Republic News Agency said in a report monitored by the
British Broadcasting Corp.
	   The tremor provoked landslides that prevented rescuers from
reaching the area by road, said the report received in Cairo.
	   The agency said its casualty toll was preliminary.
	   The greatest damage appeared to be in the village of Beyghard,
20 kilometers (13 miles) east of Khonj town, the agency said. The
villages's water and electricity supplies were severed.
	   Houses and shops in Khonj itself were damaged.
	   Iran is periodically stricken by earthquakes. In May 1997 a
tremor of 7.1 magnitude killed 1,500 people in the north of the
country. In June 1990 two quakes of magnitudes 7.3 and 7.7
destroyed a northwestern town, killing 50,000 people.

Hurricane victims determined to rebuild village

<TEXT>
	   CRISTO REY, Nicaragua (AP) _ Spared the deaths Hurricane Mitch
wrought elsewhere in Central America, residents in this hillside
village nevertheless know that life may never be the same.
	   More than 1,200 people _ a quarter of them children _ have been
crowded into a primary school for two weeks, sleeping on the floor
of the building's dozen rooms, surviving on aid from charity
groups.
	   Villagers say they are determined to rebuild after the storm
destroyed their houses and their crops, but there is no land
available away from the flood zone, and they have no money to buy
it with.
	   Their fields of bean, corn and wheat were all washed away, even
the small garden plots by the houses. Their land is now a barren
sand field.
	   And their future, like that of hundreds of thousands in the
region, is in limbo.
	   ``If God permits, we'll be able to go on,'' said Maria de los
Angeles Sanchez.
	   Hillside remnants of the town along the foothills near the
Casitas Volcano looks like a small paradise. Lush green plants and
tropical trees hang over the narrow dirt road leading toward the
cluster of small concrete buildings.
	   Children play in the streets without worry; others ride horses
into the village from their homes.
	   But two weeks ago came a hellish flood. The lake atop the
volcano broke open, spilling mud down a wide swath of the hillside,
wiping out entire towns nearby and killing more than 1,000.
	   Days later, more rain caused a hillside behind Cristo Ray to
give way, sending a flood of mud, rocks, sand and water gushing
through the southern part of the village.
	   The roar of the mudslide gave families time only to grab their
children and run to safety, Sanchez said. No lives were lost, but
life may never be the same.
	   ``There are people who lost everything, every little bit of
clothing,'' said shelter coordinator Marcelino Guido. ``They have
not even a sheet. They are suffering.''
	   The government has sent only a little medicine _ not enough to
treat the respiratory and skin infections, coughs, diarrhea,
conjunctivitis and fever.
	   Isabel Gomez, a tall woman wearing a donated dress, pulls off
her shoes to show the open sores on her feet caused by the
floodwater.
	   ``Almost all of us are like this,'' she said. ``When they come
to treat us, they only put a little medication on their finger and
then touch all of us with that one drop.''
	   About 800 residents living on higher ground escaped most of the
disaster, and the victims say they want to rebuild outside the
flood channel. But to do so, they need land on the north side of
Cristo Rey, Spanish for Christ King.
	   ``But with what are we going to buy it?'' Lazaro Hernandez
asked. Pointing to other flood victims, he said, ``She, she and he
can't tell them `Let me have a piece of your land to build my new
house.'''
	   ``And even if we did, we don't have roofs or wood, or even a
palm frond to make a roof.''
	   Having given up hope that the Nicaraguan government will help,
the villagers said their only chance is for relief from other
countries or aid groups.
	   ``Please, tell them that we need help,'' said Magdelia Campo
Romero, a mother of seven. ``I have family in Miami. They don't
know the situation we're in. If they only knew they would send us
help.''
	   The one thing the victims are sure of is that they do not want
to leave their peaceful village.
	   ``The place here is healthy,'' said Maria Teresa Aguome, an
elderly woman who has lived here more than 30 years. ``There is
friendship. You can come to my house in confidence, or I can go to
yours.''
	   Guido said the victims hope to resolve their crisis before
April, when the rainy season begins again.
	   ``All of those from Cristo Rey want to continue living in Cristo
Rey. ... If you were to come stay here awhile, not even you would
want to leave,'' he said as others laughed and nodded in agreement.
	   ``We may end up having to eat sticks, but we'll stay right
here.''

Norman's game returns quickly in Shark Shootout
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   THOUSAND OAKS, California (AP) _ No need to worry whether Greg
Norman still has it.
	   Forced out of golf for seven months because of shoulder surgery,
Norman wasted no time Friday showing that his left shoulder is just
fine _ and his game isn't too far behind.
	   ``This was a very, very good step,'' Norman said after he and
Steve Elkington posted a 5-under-par 67 in a modified
alternate-shot format to trail the John Daly-Fuzzy Zoeller team by
two strokes in the Shark Shootout. ``I felt it was a successful
day.''
	   It was Norman's first competitive round since April 10, when he
missed the cut in the Masters and had innovative shoulder surgery
12 days later that caused him to miss the next three major
championships and the rest of the PGA Tour season.
	   He wasn't under the gun like he will be in the Presidents Cup
next month or on the PGA Tour early next year. Still, he felt some
degree of anticipation when he arrived on the first tee at Sherwood
Country Club.
	   ``I wouldn't say I was nervous and I wouldn't say I was
anxious,'' he said. ``I wanted to get off to a solid start, and it
happened that way. I felt like I played a lot of solid shots.''
	   His drive on the 531-yard (485-meter) second hole was even with
Davis Love III. And on the par-3 third hole, Norman's 4-iron from
200 yards (180 meters) covered the flag the entire way and stopped
five feet behind the pin.
	   ``He's back on his game,'' caddie Tony Navarro said.
	   ``I think he's going to be OK,'' Brad Faxon said after another
Norman drive split the fairway.
	   It was a perfect place to return for someone out of golf for the
longest stretch of his professional career. The atmosphere of the
Shark Shootout, a 54-hole team event in its 10th year, is relaxed
and informal.
	   Standing on the par-3 15th, Norman teed up his ball and looked
for Navarro, who wasn't aware it was Norman's turn to hit.
	   ``I know it's been a long time,'' Norman joked to him.
	   And at times, it showed.
	   While Norman swings as hard as ever with no pain in his
shoulder, it was clear his touch on and around the green was a
little off. He left his first putt about 12 inches (30 centimeters)
off line, and he failed to get a delicate shot from the 16th bunker
out of the sand.
	   ``Those are the type of shots you forget about,'' Norman said.
``Those are the feel shots, the imagination shots. I haven't felt
that shot for a while. I couldn't picture it, and that's why I left
it in the bunker.''
	   Norman set up three of his team's six birdies _ the 4-iron at
No. 3 and two well-played bunker shots on par-5s that left
Elkington with 3-footers for birdies. Norman used the driver 11
times and missed only one fairway.
	   ``It was good to have the old man back,'' Elkington said. ``It
was almost like he hadn't been away. I've known Greg Norman for
more than 20 years, and I've never seen him not ready. He didn't do
anything I didn't expect.''
	   Zoeller and Daly proved to be a perfect combination in the
opening round. Once Zoeller put the ball in play, he turned to Daly
and told him to ``Hit it hard,'' the same message the late Squeaky
Medlen gave Daly when he won the PGA Championship in 1991.
	   Daly missed only two fairways and cleared two creeks on the
par-5 16th with a 390-yard (356-meter) drive.
	   ``It's a pleasure to hit my second shot from where he hits his
first one,'' said Zoeller, who rarely hit more than a wedge all
day.
	   Norman's next text comes Saturday in the best-ball format, when
he'll play his own ball on every shot.
	   ``I'm still searching for rhythm,'' he said.
	   But he found something more important on Friday _ the thrill of
competing, even in one of golf's ``silly season'' events, the
feeling of standing over a 4-foot (1.2-meter) birdie putt on the
18th hole with 1,000 people watching, the pleasure of hitting an
iron stiff at the flag.
	   It will mean more in the Australian Open the week before the
Presidents Cup, and in the matches at Royal Melbourne when the
International team tries to take the cup from the United States for
the first time.
	   ``If I'm not nervous there, then I'm going to be worried,''
Norman said. ``But I don't see that happening.''

	   TIGUIDIT, Niger (AP) _ In a move bizarre even for the world of
haute couture, flamboyant fashion designers and teen-aged models in
body-hugging tights and tube tops blitz the Sahara Desert.
	   International runway successes parade the latest clothing
creations at an outdoor fashion show Friday in the craggy cliffs
and shifting dunes of Niger, a mainly Muslim country of goat
herders and nomads recovering from a rebellion.
	   Hairdressers, diplomats and cigarette and liquor executives
stood alongside a lanky mix of turban-clad soldiers and miniskirted
models in a sprawling tent city of Tiguidit, about 100 kilometers
(60 miles) south of the desert town of Agadez.
	   The fashion show itself, held Friday evening on a 100-foot
(30-meter) stage at the base of a spotlit cliff, was the brainchild
of Alphadi, a Nigerien designer who has found a niche in the elite
circles of Paris.
	   A few of the best-known names in the fashion business including
Paris-based Japanese designer Kenzo and Sudanese-born model Alek
Wek were among the chaotic influx. Also descending on fashion
figures in Agadez were battalions of beggars _ men with twisted
limbs and children tugging on sleeves for coins or pens.
	   Wek, who has been billed by some as the next ``face'' of African
fashion succeeding supermodels like Iman, believed that Africa's
small but growing group of designers need a place to show their
strengths.
	   ``I think that if outsiders will see what there is here in Niger
and Africa as a whole and that can only be good,'' Wek said of
trying raise the profile of designers such as Pepita D from Benin
and retired modeling star Katoucha from Guinea.
	   Other models said they felt shocked by the poverty in the region
and embarrassed by the opulence of the show.
	   The cost of the spectacle was expected to top dlrs 2.5 million _
in Niger, where the average person lives on less than 50 cents a
day _ even though most participants stayed in modest hotel rooms
with no hot water and later tents with sand floors and no showers
at all.
	   A liquor company imported 12 tons of ice from Sweden and served
vodka in glasses carved from the ice to invited guests. Other
enormous blocks of dripping ice were shaped to form a desert bar
and two huge models of liquor bottles.
	   The inspiration was to showcase African designers in a beautiful
African setting. But the audience included as many European
sponsors, journalists and African diplomats as Tuareg nomad leaders
and other local figures who arrived late in the evening spectacle.
 &UR; Corporate sponsors came, pick up 10th graf pvs.

General Assembly committee calls for ban on nuclear weapons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. General Assembly's disarmament
committee adopted a resolution Friday calling for the elimination
of nuclear weapons, but the United States and all other nuclear
states except China voted against it.
	   China abstained along with several NATO countries, including
Canada, Germany, Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands. Japan also
abstained.
	   The committee approved the resolution declaring an ``unequivocal
commitment to the speedy and total elimination'' of nuclear weapons
by a vote of 97-19, with 32 abstentions.
	   The resolution, which is not legally binding, also calls on
countries with nuclear weapons to fulfill their obligations under
the nuclear non-proliferation treaty.
	   The United States, Russia, France, Britain, India and Pakistan
and Israel were among countries that voted against the resolution.
India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in May, and Israel is
widely believed to have nuclear weapons.
	   Mark Moher, Canada's ambassador for disarmament, said the
Canadian people are committed to nuclear disarmament and nuclear
non-proliferation.
	   He noted that the Canadian Parliament has undertaken a study of
the country's nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation policy
which is expected to be tabled in the next few weeks.
	   ``Ultimately, the Canadian government did not wish by today's
vote to prejudge that process,'' Moher told the committee after the
vote.
	   Moher noted that some countries objected that the resolution did
not adequately credit progress made in nuclear disarmament _ ``and
that it makes no mention of the nuclear tests in India and
Pakistan.''
	   At the same time, he said, Canada is deeply concerned that the
disarmament and non-proliferation regime ``is now under serious
strain.''

Nothing doing in efforts to end NBA's first regular season work
</HEADLINE>
stoppage &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The union leader for American basketball players
gave the silent treatment Friday to the National Basketball
Association commissioner, in a sign of how difficult it will be to
resolve the NBA's labor dispute and get an already-delayed season
going.
	   Union leader Billy Hunter again refused to place a telephone
call to David Stern, the NBA commissioer, reneging on a vow he made
Wednesday to touch base with his adversary on how to end the NBA
lockout.
	   Instead, Jeffrey Kessler, the outside lawyer for the union,
called NBA chief legal officer Jeffrey Mishkin to say that the
union saw no point in a meeting.
	   ``If they say there's no point, then not much is likely to
happen for a while,'' deputy commissioner Russ Granik said.
	   The lack of progress was mind-boggling to many. There have been
no meetings between the sides since last Friday, and there have
been no full negotiating sessions since Oct. 28.
	   The start of the season has already been pushed back to
mid-December at the earliest in the first regular-season work
stoppage in NBA history.
	   The lockout is essentially a strike by the owners. Without a
contract, owners can prohibit _ or lock out _ players from working
until a deal is reached.
	   The biggest issue in this work stoppage is the owners insistence
on maximum salary costs and the union's refusal to accept a
``hard'' salary cap.
	   ``I think they need to lock themselves in a room, put a
port-o-potty in there and don't open the door until they come out
with a deal,'' said Aaron Goodwin, a member of the union's agents'
advisory committee. ``At some point you've got to get something
done. I think we're at that point.''
	   Some new details about the Oct. 28 session emerged Friday,
including the fact that Michael Jordan moved right to the top of
the bargaining team on the first day he joined the fracas.
	   During that session, small groups from each side went off to a
separate room.
	   Jordan, Hunter and Patrick Ewing represented the union team, and
Stern, deputy commissioner Russ Granik and Hall of Famer Bob Lanier
represented the owners.
	   ``I don't think we were that close in an objective sense,''
Granik said, ``but we were heading in the right direction.''
	   After unofficial offers were tossed about by both sides, Stern
and Granik left the room to speak to several owners. When they
returned, the deal could not be closed.
	   Since then, the process has slowed almost to a halt.
	   One of the few lockout-related events that took place this week
was the union's status meeting on Wednesday, after which Hunter
said he would call Stern.
	   A rumor spread after the meeting that some conciliatory players,
including Steve Kerr, had been shouted down. Even Stern said that
was what he had heard.
	   ``I don't think anybody got shouted down,'' countered agent Mark
Bartelstein, who represents Kerr and 28 other players. ``I think
the whole idea of the meeting was for everybody to throw out all
their thoughts and ideas, no matter how radical or conservative.
That was the whole idea. They didn't want it to be a cheerleading
session.''

Leave Estonia wreckage in peace, many say

 &UR; By MATTI HUUHTANEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ A new controversy over the Estonia
ferry disaster swelled with wide opposition from Finns and
Estonians to a Swedish proposal to recover bodies from the
wreckage.
	   The proposal may end up prolonging the agony of victims'
relatives rather than assuaging their pain, the critics say.
	   The criticisms came in the wake of a Swedish
government-appointed panel's recommendation Thursday that divers
bring up as many bodies as possible from the wreck of the ferry,
which sank Sept. 28, 1994, killing 852 people.
	   Only 95 bodies were recovered from the ferry, which went under
when heavy Baltic seas ripped off the ferry's bow door en route
from Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm, Sweden.
	   Shortly after the sinking, Swedish officials promised the bodies
would be recovered, but that decision was reversed, to the dismay
and anger of many relatives.
	   Relatives had also criticized Sweden's plan, put on hold in
1996, to cover the wreckage with hundreds of tons of sand and
rocks, saying they could not complete their mourning if the bodies
were not brought to land.
	   Despite the Swedish panel's recommendation, the Finnish
government said in a statement Friday that there is ``no need to
change the agreement ... to protect the shipwreck. The Estonia and
the surrounding seabed should, in the future as well, be respected
as the final resting place of the victims.''
	   Estonia has not taken an official position on the proposal, but
President Lennart Meri was clearly resistant to the idea. ``The
place where a person has had his life taken by the sea is just as
sacred as any graveyard next to a church,'' he said Thursday.
	   The Swedish government has not yet said whether it will go along
with the panel's recommendation. Even if Sweden wants to begin
recovering the bodies, Finland and Estonia also would have to
approve the project.
	   The aftermath of the sinking, which only 137 people survived,
has tormented Sweden, Finland and Estonia for years. The three
countries formed a joint commission to investigate the cause of the
disaster, but its work was widely criticized and public trust was
undermined by the resignations of several commission members.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ As an expanded force of U.S. bombers, warships
and troops prepared for the Gulf, President Bill Clinton told Iraq
Friday how it could avert a devastating air attack: Resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, in his first statement since halting the monitoring of all
weapons sites Oct. 31, insisted his ``just and balanced demands''
must be met _ an apparent reference to lifting an 8-year-old U.N.
trade embargo and other economic sanctions. Saddam did say,
however, that ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative'' that
satisfied its ``legal demands.'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
dismissed Saddam's overture as ``nothing new and nothing positive
or productive.'' But Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and Defense Secretary William Cohen all lowered their rhetoric a
little. (US-IRAQ)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ President Bill Clinton agreed Friday to pay
Paula Jones dlrs 850,000 to drop her sexual harassment lawsuit _
with no apology or admissions _ ending a lengthy legal battle that
spurred the impeachment proceedings against him. ``Paula is very
pleased that it's finally over,'' said her lawyer, Bill McMillan.
Clinton lawyer Robert Bennett said the president ``remains
certain'' that Mrs. Jones' allegations are baseless but wanted to
get the dispute behind him. Mrs. Jones alleged that Clinton, as
Arkansas governor, made a crude advance in a room at a Little Rock
hotel. Clinton has denied her accusation, and her lawsuit was
dismissed last spring. An appeal of that dismissal was pending.
(US-CLINTON-JONES)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Students prepare to bury their friends
Saturday after a day of protest and mayhem as Indonesia's military
maintained tight security around the capital. Friday's violence,
the worst since riots toppled President Suharto in May, left at
least six people dead when Indonesian security forces battled
rock-throwing protesters and street mobs attacked suspected police
informers. Pressed by the bloody protests raging outside,
Indonesia's highest legislative body endorsed a new government
blueprint for the troubled nation. The 1,000-member People's
Consultative Assembly also named Suharto in a decree demanding a
massive government crackdown on corruption under his 32-year rule.
Local media reports said the death toll could climb.
(INDONESIA-POLITICS)
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A dlrs 41.5 billion rescue package for
Brazil announced Friday by the International Monetary Fund is
designed to prevent the world financial maelstrom from pulling in
other Latin American nations and even the United States. The fate
of Brazil's economy, Latin America's largest, is considered crucial
to whether the American economy is drawn into the financial
turbulence. Brazil is an important trading partner with the United
States, and analysts estimate that some 2,000 U.S. businesses
operate there. ``The stakes are high,'' said Allen Sinai, chief
global economist at Primark Decision Economics in New York. ``Any
kind of collapse, economic or financial, (of Brazil) would endanger
Argentina and all of Latin America and in turn the United States.''
(BRAZIL-IMF)
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ India chided the industrial world
Friday for asking developing nations to do more to cut greenhouse
gases, saying wealthier nations should take the lead under a 1997
global warming treaty. At the close of a U.N. climate summit,
India's environmental minister said some countries would like to
evade their obligations under the Kyoto protocol to scale back
carbon dioxide emissions. ``When it comes to the act of taking
responsibilities, some countries would like to shirk'' their
responsibilities while raising ``new ideas,'' said Shri Suresh
Prabhu. ``That's not acceptable to us.'' He didn't identify
countries by name. But his criticism appeared to be an attack
against a U.S.-backed campaign for developing nations to take on
emissions targets like those laid out for industrialized nations
under the Kyoto treaty. India and China are the biggest opponents
of that proposal. (GLOBAL WARMING)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Blue chip stocks rose sharply Friday after a
long-awaited international financial aid package was approved for
Brazil. But the technology-laden Nasdaq fell slightly as investors
took profits for a third consecutive day amid worries that the
Federal Reserve might not lower interest rates again this year. The
Dow Jones industrial average finished up 89.85 points _ or by 1
percent _ at 8,919.59. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar rose against the most major
currencies Friday on expectations that the Federal Reserve will not
cut interest rates at its policy-making meeting next week. Also
lifting the dollar was speculation that U.S. military forces might
soon initiate airstrikes against Iraq. During economic or political
turmoil, investors frequently turn to the dollar as a safe haven
investment. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at 122.72 yen in
late New York trading, up from 121.98 late Thursday. The U.S.
currency also was changing hands at 1.6841 marks, up from 1.6832.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund announced
approval Friday of a long-expected dlrs 41.5 billion rescue package
for Brazil designed to stop global financial turmoil from spreading
to Latin America. Under the program, Brazil becomes the first
recipient of a new sort of aid proposed by U.S. President Bill
Clinton in which countries following IMF-approved policies can get
access to large lines of credit they can draw on as needed. The
package is to assure financial markets that Brazil will have
sufficient funds to pay its international obligations as it puts
its fiscal house in order. ``The Brazilian authorities and an IMF
team have successfully concluded negotiations on a strong
three-year program of economic and financial reform,'' said IMF
Managing Director Michel Camdessus. (IMF-BRAZIL, BRAZIL-ECONOMY)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ No quick end to the economic crisis is in sight,
and the Russian economy, which has shrunk 5 percent this year, will
drop another 3 percent to 9 percent in 1999, the Finance Ministry
said Friday. Ministry analysts estimate that the crisis will last
through most or all of next year. The Russian economy has been
shrinking throughout the 1990s in one of the most painful and
prolonged recessions ever suffered by an industrialized nation. It
showed signs of stabilizing late last year, but took another
devastating plunge after Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on
domestic debts this August. Prominent liberal economist Grigory
Yavlinsky has estimated that Russia's gross domestic product will
drop 10 percent next year if the government goes ahead with its
latest economic program. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a hopeful sign for holiday sales, Americans
spent briskly on cars and clothing in October, shrugging off the
plunging stock market at home and economic turmoil overseas. Retail
sales, which account for roughly a third of the U.S. economic
activity, rose 1 percent to a seasonally adjusted dlrs 227 billion
last month, the Commerce Department said Friday. It was the biggest
increase in five months. Though the number was supported by a 2.6
percent surge in auto purchases, the largest in 15 months, all
broad categories of goods managed at least modest gains and most
did better. Excluding autos, sales rose 0.5 percent. (US-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A nasty fight broke out Friday
among Pacific Rim nations, including the United States and Japan,
trying to reach a deal to lower trade barriers. The dispute
threatened to derail one of President Clinton's main objectives for
his 10-day Asia trip _ an agreement to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5
trillion in global trade. The United States believes such a step to
promote freer trade would send a strong signal that Asian nations
are not turning inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50
years. But over two days of negotiations, Japanese officials have
just as adamantly argued they are in no position to cut border
taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and fish _ at a
time when their economy is in recession. (APEC)

semis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Lindsay Davenport, the top-ranked
women's tennis player in the world, overcame a slow start to defeat
Amy Frazier 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 and join fifth-seeded Monica Seles and
sixth-seeded Nathalie Tauziat in the semifinals of the Advanta
Championships.
	   Davenport, a point away from being down a set and a service
break, rallied to a 5-7, 6-3, 6-3 victory Friday to ensure a
meeting with Seles in the next round of the dlrs 450,000 tournament
at Villanova University. Seles had little trouble with her doubles
partner, Natasha Zvereva of Belarus, in a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
	   ``She played some great tennis,'' Davenport said of Frazier.
``Luckily it didn't continue.
	   ``I kind of toughed her out. That's something I've learned to
do. The better players when they're not playing their best have to
dig down deeper to pull it through.''
	   Frazier was on a hot streak until meeting Davenport. She came
through qualifying, then beat Croatia's Iva Majoli and upset No. 7
seed Patty Schynder of Switzerland to make the quarterfinals.
	   ``I know one set means nothing,'' Frazier said. ``She's
(Davenport) a great player and it's never over with her. But I'm
happy with the way I played this week.''
	   So is Seles, who needed just 40 minutes to win her match.
Zvereva claimed she wasn't bothered by a strained left thigh which
was heavily wrapped.
	   ``I just got on Natasha from the beginning and played really
well,'' said Seles, avenging a crushing defeat to Zvereva at
Wimbledon. ``She never had a chance to get into the first set.
	   ``In the second set I didn't give her too many free points and
was able to win pretty easily. But Lindsay should be a really good
test for me,'' he added.
	   The 31-year-old Tauziat, a Wimbledon finalist this year,
outlasted Coetzer 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 in a match featuring seven
second-set service breaks. She will play the winner of Friday
night's match between No. 2 seed Martina Hingis and Steffi Graf,
unseeded in this tourney.
	   After splitting sets, Tauziat gained the decisive advantage when
she broke Coetzer's serve at 2-2 in the final set, then served it
out. Tauziat screamed in delight when Coetzer netted a backhand
return on her third match point.
	   ``This was a tough match for me, because Amanda fights so
hard,'' said Tauziat, who like Graf, flew straight from Leipzig,
Germany to this tournament. ``I played pretty well, but I'm a
little bit tired.''

<TEXT>
	   LUANDA, Angola (AP) _ Angolan troops tracking gunmen who raided
a Canadian-owned mine have found three corpses believed to be those
of three kidnapped expatriate workers, an army spokesman said.
	   ``We found three white men floating in a river,'' Brig. Jose
Joao Manuel said by telephone phone Friday.
	   ``It seems that they drowned, but we don't know the specific
cause of death yet,'' he added.
	   The identities of the three men hadn't yet been ascertained, but
they were believed to be from the group of 10 workers _ including
two Filipinos, a Briton and a South African, as well as Angolans _
who were abducted during an attack Sunday on the Yetwene mine, he
said.
	   The bodies were awaiting identification by officials from the
mine, owned by Vancouver-based DiamondWorks Ltd., he said.
	   However, a company official said he had received no official
word that the army had found any bodies. ``I can't confirm that,''
said Bruce Walsham, the company's chief executive officer, at a
news conference in Luanda.
	   Gunmen attacked the mine at Yetwene, a remote mining village
about 600 kilometers (370 miles) east of the capital Luanda, before
dawn Sunday, killing eight employees and wounding 24 others.
	   Two Britons and a South African were among those killed.
	   Brig. Manuel said troops found the corpses on Thursday in a
river ``dozens of kilometers (miles)'' from the mine, but he could
not give an exact location.
	   Troops were still pursuing the gunmen, estimated to number about
200, towards the northern border with Congo, he said.
	   However, the gunmen had split up into smaller groups, making it
difficult to catch them all, he said.
	   Officials have blamed the former rebel group UNITA for the raid,
claiming it wanted to destabilize the country as part of its
continuing hostility towards the government despite signing a 1994
peace pact to end a two-decade civil war.
	   However, gangs of armed bandits, mostly demobilized soldiers,
roam the countryside of the vast southwest African nation and
regularly have pillaged outlying towns in recent months.
	   Walsham said the attack ``has seriously undermined the
confidence of the international investor community'' in the diamond
sector.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana accused the
United States of mishandling a cocaine and heroin bust on a
Colombian air force plane, saying U.S. officials should have told
his government before the plane left Colombia that it was carrying
drugs.
	   Customs officials at the international airport in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, reported Tuesday they found 1,639 pounds (743
kilograms) of cocaine hidden aboard the C-130 cargo plane and
detained the six-man crew. Also stashed on board were 13 pounds (6
kilograms) of heroin, Colombia's government said Friday.
	   ``Why, if they knew about this cargo ... didn't they tell us
first?'' Pastrana said in his first public comments on the
incident, which has been an international embarrassment for his
3-month-old administration.
	   Customs officials did not immediately return calls seeking
comment and have not said whether they knew about the cocaine
before the plane left Colombia, or whether they informed Colombia's
government.
	   U.S. drug agents in the past have been loathe to share
information with Colombia, fearing the intelligence would be leaked
to drug traffickers.
	   Pastrana also questioned why U.S. authorities seized the plane
at the Florida airport, rather than trying to gain more information
by tracking the shipment to its final destination.
	   ``We're truly sad that an incident like this once again
blemishes the image of an entire country,'' said Pastrana, who took
office vowing to step up Colombia's fight against drug trafficking.
	   In Colombia, the seizure has led to multiple arrests and a
command shakeup in the 12,000-member air force.
	   Federal prosecutor's agents on Thursday detained six air force
members, including Maj. Gonzalo Noguera, the intelligence chief of
the Bogota military airport from which the plane took off, as well
as a lieutenant and four aviation technicians.
	   Noguera and two other officers were forced into retirement. Air
force commander Gen. Jose Manuel Sandoval resigned.

Rescue plan for Brazil aimed at halting spread of financial crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ A dlrs 41.5 billion rescue package for
Brazil is designed to prevent the world financial maelstrom from
pulling in other Latin American nations and even the United States.
	   The assistance, announced Friday by the International Monetary
Fund, was hailed by U.S. President Bill Clinton as an important
measure in coping with the crisis that began more than a year ago
in Asia.
	   ``A strong Brazil makes for a stronger United States,'' Clinton
said in a brief statement issued in Washington.
	   The fate of Brazil's economy, Latin America's largest, is
considered crucial to whether the American economy is drawn into
the financial turbulence. Brazil is an important trading partner
with the United States, and analysts estimate that some 2,000 U.S.
businesses operate there.
	   ``The stakes are high,'' said Allen Sinai, chief global
economist at Primark Decision Economics in New York. ``Any kind of
collapse, economic or financial, (of Brazil) would endanger
Argentina and all of Latin America and in turn the United States.''
	   Brazilian economists worry, though, that the new program, which
requires the government to follow through on pledges of tough
budget-cutting, will cause the economy to weaken further and send
unemployment soaring.
	   The rescue package makes dlrs 41.5 billion available to Brazil
over the next three years. About dlrs 37 billion will be on tap if
needed in the next 12 months.
	   The IMF will put up dlrs 18 billion, while other international
aid agencies will chip in dlrs 9 billion. The remaining dlrs 14.5
billion will come from industrial countries in North America,
Europe and Asia. The United States will contribute dlrs 5 billion.
	   The U.S. contribution will come from a Treasury Department fund
originally established to protect the dollar. The United States
used the fund to help Mexico in 1995 and South Korea and Indonesia
last year.
	   At a news conference, Brazilian Finance Minister Pedro Malan
described the program as ``a preventive operation'' and added, ``We
hope we won't need all the funds being made available.''
	   He said the agreement would not require any changes in the
country's foreign exchange policy and stressed that Brazil had no
plans to devalue its currency, the real.
	   The assistance was offered after Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso announced on Oct. 28 a series of measures to curb
government spending and raise taxes.
	   ``The IMF package was only made possible thanks to the austerity
measures that will slow down the country's economy even further and
swell the ranks of the unemployed,'' said Sao Paulo economist
Bernard Appy.
	   He predicted that unemployment, now at a record 7.8 percent,
will ``surely grow to double-digit figures early next year.''
	   The government measures, which must be approved by Congress,
would save dlrs 24 billion in 1999 and dlrs 80 billion by 2002.
	   ``All agreements with the IMF demand sacrifices, but things
would get much worse without the rescue package,'' said Luciano
Coutinho, an economist at the University of Campinas. ``There would
be an exchange crisis and a complete collapse of the economy.''
	   Coutinho said the package should lead to lower interest rates,
which in turn would revive the economy. Earlier this week, the
Central Bank lowered the annual interest rate from 49.75 percent to
42.25 percent.
	   Brazil nearly doubled its key lending rate in September to halt
the flight of foreign investors after Russia devalued its currency
and its economy was caught up in the financial turmoil. Brazil's
foreign reserves have fallen to around dlrs 43 billion from dlrs 70
billion at the end of July.
	   For Congressman Marcelo Deda of the leftist Worker's Party said
the IMF accord ``guarantees the survival of the government's
economic policies and its austerity measures that have
straight-jacketed the economy.''
	   ``The population will once again have to foot the bill, paying
with recession and unemployment,'' he said. The Brazil package is
among largest put together by the 182-nation IMF.
	   Last year, the Washington-based lending agency arranged a dlrs
58 billion package for South Korea, a dlrs 42 billion-plus deal for
Indonesia and a dlrs 17 billion loan arrangement for Thailand.
	   In August, the IMF established a dlrs 23 billion safety net for
Russia that later was suspended after the Kremlin devalued the
ruble and defaulted on government debt.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Czechs are choosing tens of
thousands of local leaders and a third of the seats in the Senate
in two days of voting.
	   At stake in the election that ends Saturday are more than 60,000
local posts and 27 seats in the 81-member Senate. The senatorial
vote is considered a test of support for Prime Minister Milos
Zeman's government.
	   Following two years of political deadlock, the country's early
general election in June produced a one-party minority government
of Social Democrats led by Zeman. His government survived in
Parliament thanks to a pact struck with the runner-up, the
center-right Civic Democratic Party.
	   The two larger parties are expected to maintain their majority
in the Senate. Their main challenger is a four-party coalition led
by Christian Democrats and the center-right Freedom Union favored
by President Vaclav Havel.
	   The first day of voting was without incident, and the turnout
reported from all over the country was low, the official news
agency CTK reported.
	   In the Senate races, candidates must get a 50 percent majority
to win the election outright or face a run-off between the top two
vote-getters. The run-offs are scheduled for Nov. 20-21.
	   Independent candidates are expected to dominate the local
elections, which have little bearing on the balance of political
power in the country. Final results from the local races are
expected Tuesday.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHTIS, Finland (AP) _ After putting the shot aside for a few
months, Karoliina Lundahl brought a first-ever women's medal to
Finland at the World Weightlifting Championships.
	   Lundahl won the 75 kilos (165 pounds) class Friday, while Tang
Weifang of China took her third consecutive world title, winning
the 69 kilos (152 pounds).
	   Olympic 1996 men's champion Pyrros Dimas of Greece won the 85
kilos gold, setting a world record of 178.0 kilos (392.4 pounds) in
the snatch. Dimas, who had a 387.5 kilos (854.3 pounds) total, was
challenged by Marc Huser of Germany, who had 385.0 kilos (848.8
pounds), with Yuri Myshkovets of Russia in third, only a further
2.5 kilos (5.5 pounds) back.
	   In women's competition, Tang Weifang had a total of 240 kilos
(529.1 pounds) in the lighter 69 kilos (152 pounds) class, ten 10
(22.1 pounds) more than Lundahl in the next weight category. Tang
Weifang's 110.5 kilos (243.6 pounds) in the snatch was a new world
record, but it counted as 110.0 (242.5 pounds) in the championship
competition.
	   Lundahl had a total of 230 kilos (507.1 pounds) and also won the
snatch. Gao Xiaoyan of China, Lundahl's main threat, failed to get
a snatch result, but she won the clean-and-jerk medal with 130
kilos (286.6 pounds), five (11) more than Lundahl.
	   The Finnish woman made the shot put final, placing 12th at the
European track Championships in Budapest, Hungary, in August. She
also competed in the shot at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta.
	   Cara Heads of the United States lost a bronze medal in the 75
kilos (165.4 pounds) on the scales, as she did also last year.
Heads was over two kilos heavier than Maria Takacs of Hungary. Both
had a total of 217.5 kilos (479.50 pounds), 2.5 (5.5 pounds) behind
Sule Sabbas of Turkey.

Charles as King
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A new opinion poll published Saturday, Prince
Charles' 50th birthday, indicates that three quarters of the
British public believe the heir to the throne would be a ``very
good,'' or ``fairly good'' king.
	   In the telephone poll of about 1,200 people, published in the
Daily Telegraph, 61 percent of respondents said they consider the
prince a ``well-intentioned but troubled man who seems to be
looking for a role.''
	   While 24 percent said they think he will be a very good king,
half the respondents predicted he would make a ``fairly good''
monarch.
	   A majority of people, 86 percent of those questioned, said they
believe he is proving to be a good father, and large majorities
think he has been a positive influence on issues ranging from the
environment (86 percent) and youth (78 percent) to race relations
(66 percent) and architecture (68 percent).
	   Survey respondents were divided over whether he should marry his
longtime companion, Camilla Parker Bowles.
	   While 60 percent said she has had a positive influence on him,
only 40 percent said he should marry her. Another 46 percent said
he should not.
	   And 72 percent said that if he did marry her, Mrs. Parker Bowles
should not have any official position.
	   The poll also suggested there is increased support for the
monarchy, compared to a year ago.
	   The number of those polled wanting a monarchy rather than a
republic has increased from 70 percent last year to 87 percent this
year, according to the Telegraph.
	   But among monarchists, the number wanting a ``more democratic
and approachable'' royal family has risen from 51 to 62 percent.
	   The poll was conducted earlier this month by Gallup and has a
margin of error of 3 percent.
	   It reflects similar findings in polls conducted earlier this
year that have suggested increased support for Charles and more
openness to his relationship with Mrs. Parker Bowles. But previous
polls have also indicated resistance to his marrying her and her
becoming queen.

Key issues that brought about Suharto's downfall remain unresolved
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QC; 
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Six months ago, student protesters
helped end the 32-year iron-fisted rule of Indonesia's President
Suharto.
	   Now thousands are back in the streets, fighting bloody battles
with security forces in downtown Jakarta. As plastic bullets and
tear gas canisters fly, they are once more demanding democratic
change and an end to corruption.
	   Suharto may be out of office, but the key issues that brought
about his downfall remain unresolved.
	   Despite allegations that he made his family and cronies into
billionaires through corruption, Suharto remains free at his home
in Jakarta and denies any wrongdoing.
	   Former Suharto subordinates, such as President B.J. Habibie, are
in control of the government.
	   Moreover, the military, which battled with students on Friday,
continues to play a dominant role in politics even after admitting
widespread human rights abuses under Suharto _ including mass
executions, torture, kidnappings and murders.
	   Discontent and anger remain dangerously high as casualties from
the protests mount.
	   The world's fourth-most populous nation has been hit hard by
Asia's financial meltdown and is still fighting its worst economic
crisis in decades. Inflation and unemployment have soared. About
half the nation's 202 million people have sunk below the official
poverty line.
	   The violence that exploded on the streets of Jakarta on Thursday
and Friday represents a disastrous setback for Habibie, who came to
power promising to end his old mentor's legacy of authoritarianism.
	   He freed some political prisoners, promised freedom of
expression, lifted bans on the media and labor unions, and followed
a tough internationally backed economic reform package.
	   He then set about revamping the tightly controlled political
system that had kept Suharto in power for so long.
	   Sticking to a constitution that had allowed him to take over
from Suharto without facing election, he called a special session
of the People's Consultative Assembly this week to push through his
changes.
	   Most of the assembly's 1,000 members are old Suharto appointees
or lawmakers elected under his non-democratic electoral system.
	   But Habibie's plans angered tens of thousands of students, who
tried repeatedly to march to the Parliament, where the assembly
sat. The protesters were blocked by 30,000 troops and police.
	   Students and other opponents say Habibie and the assembly, all
products of Suharto's era, have neither the will nor the ability to
deliver truly democratic reform.
	   As the protests raged Friday night, the assembly passed 12
decrees that it said would be a new blueprint for Indonesian
politics.
	   But disgruntled students and opposition figures have derided the
reform program as a sham that will only serve to bolster the
positions of Habibie, the military and the ruling Golkar Party.
	   Habibie wants to hold parliamentary elections in May, and plans
to run for the presidency at the end of 1999.
	   Many now wonder whether student protests will translate into a
``people power'' movement against Habibie _ and for how long he
will be able to count on the support and protection of his
generals.

Saddam says open to 'any initiative' that would end sanctions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos BAG101-106 &QL; 
 &UR; By EILEEN ALT POWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Statements by the U.S. and Iraqi presidents
about the crisis over U.N. arms inspections suggest the two sides
are no closer to a compromise that would avert a threatened U.S.
military attack.
	   The comments Friday by Saddam Hussein and Bill Clinton mirrored
past declarations made since the crisis began in August _ and
offered little room for compromise.
	   In his first public statement since the latest dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections, Saddam made it clear that nothing less than a
pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.
	   Saddam insisted Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and
would accept ``positively any initiative'' that would lift the
sanctions.
	   But Clinton declared the standoff would only end when Iraq
resumed its cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   They spoke amid widening fears in the Iraqi capital that a U.S.
military strike was imminent. Motorists jammed their cars by the
hundreds into gasoline stations, forming long lines to fill up
their tanks. Shoppers found some prices rising in Baghdad's crowded
markets.
	   At Friday prayers in the nation's mosques, preachers called on
Arabs and Muslims to rally behind Iraq, despite signs of a loss of
support for its confrontation over the inspections.
	   ``I call upon you _ all Arabs and Muslims in the world _ to
declare war on America and its allies,'' said Abdul-Latif Humeim,
sheik of the Abdel-Khader al-Gaylani Mosque in downtown Baghdad.
``Do not let their airplanes use your airspace or bases.''
	   While many Baghdad residents prepared for the worst, their mood
was pragmatic, even defiant _ reflecting the government's efforts
to forge a united front against the U.N. sanctions, imposed eight
years ago after Iraq invaded Kuwait, leading to the Persian Gulf
War.
	   ``Of course we are worried,'' said Hamza Ali Turki, 38, selling
vegetables in downtown Baghdad. ``But it's not about any kind of
aggression. We are all having trouble getting enough money to buy
food.''
	   ``If they want to attack us, let them do it,'' said Naima Aidan,
40, shopping for sugar and coconut to make sweets for her four
children. ``I am not worried. God will keep us safe.''
	   No information was available in Baghdad about military
preparedness. But the opposition Iraqi Communist Party said in a
statement faxed to Cairo, Egypt, that troops had been moved north
to protect oil fields near Kirkuk and deployed along major
highways.
	   A second dissident group, the London-based Iraqi Broadcasting
Corp., said brigades of the elite Republican Guards had been
dispersed around Baghdad and in provinces further north. It said
several intelligence and security departments, such as Military
Intelligence and the Special Security Organization, had been
ordered to move to the outskirts of the capital.
	   ``All their offices are empty now,'' the group said in a fax
sent to Cairo.
	   Saddam's statement was his first public one on the subject since
the crisis began.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency quoted him as saying his
decisions on Aug. 5 and Oct. 31 to restrict the work of U.N.
inspectors ``were intended to get responses to Iraq's legal
demands.''
	   He didn't elaborate, but apparently was talking about Iraq's
often-stated demand for a U.N. Security Council statement pledging
an end to sanctions.
	   ``Iraq will accept positively any initiative that meets these
just and balanced demands,'' he said.
	   This, he added, required the Security Council and the United
States to ``commit themselves to the letter and spirit of the
resolutions as Iraq has done over the past eight years.''
	   The agency said Saddam spoke with the Russian ambassador,
Nikolai Kartouzov, who delivered letters from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Russia and China have urged the U.N. Security Council to ease
the sanctions to reward Iraq for its compliance to date with U.N.
resolutions enacted after the 1991 Gulf War that call for the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The Security Council says the trade sanctions, which limit the
sale of Iraqi oil, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify
that Iraq has destroyed those weapons.
	   Iraq insists it has done so, and since Aug. 5, has restricted
the activities of weapons inspectors as a way to press its demands
for lifting the sanctions.
	   The agency quoted Saddam as telling Kartouzov that Iraq took the
action ``not to create a crisis or stop cooperating with the
Security Council but to get responses to Iraq's legal demands.''
	   In other developments:
	   _ Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf criticized a U.N.
decision to evacuate 103 weapons inspectors and about a third of
its 450 relief workers because of growing fears of a U.S. strike.
	   In a letter Friday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, he said
the evacuation ``contributed to the negative atmosphere'' and the
United States was preparing for an attack.
	   _ U.N. spokesman Eric Falt said oil was being exported normally
and ships carrying Vietnamese rice and Australian wheat were being
unloaded at the southern Iraqi port of Mina al-Bakr.
	   _ Hans von Sponeck, the director of U.N. humanitarian programs
in Iraq, said Friday that food distribution under an exemption to
U.N. sanctions has continued despite the evacuation of aid workers.

	   CRISTO REY, Nicaragua (AP) _ Spared the deaths Hurricane Mitch
wrought elsewhere in Central America, residents in this hillside
village nevertheless know that life may never be the same.
	   More than 1,200 people _ a quarter of them children _ have been
crowded into a primary school for more than a week, sleeping on the
floor of the building's dozen rooms, surviving on aid from charity
groups.
	   Villagers say they are determined to rebuild after the storm
destroyed their houses and their crops, but there is no land
available away from the flood zone, and they have no money to buy
it with.
	   Their fields of bean, corn and wheat were all washed away, even
the small garden plots by the houses. Their land is now a barren
sand field.
	   And their future, like that of hundreds of thousands in the
region, is in limbo.
	   ``If God permits, we'll be able to go on,'' said Maria de los
Angeles Sanchez.
	   Hillside remnants of the town along the foothills near the
Casitas Volcano looks like a small paradise. Lush green plants and
tropical trees hang over the narrow dirt road leading toward the
cluster of small concrete buildings.
	   Children play in the streets without worry; others ride horses
into the village from their homes.
	   But two weeks ago came a hellish flood. The lake atop the
volcano broke open, spilling mud down a wide swath of the hillside,
wiping out entire towns nearby and killing more than 1,000.
	   Days later, more rain caused a hillside behind Cristo Rey to
give way, sending a flood of mud, rocks, sand and water gushing
through the southern part of the village.
	   The roar of the mudslide gave families time only to grab their
children and run to safety, Sanchez said. No lives were lost, but
life may never be the same.
	   ``There are people who lost everything, every little bit of
clothing,'' said shelter coordinator Marcelino Guido. ``They have
not even a sheet. They are suffering.''
	   The government has sent only a little medicine _ not enough to
treat the respiratory and skin infections, coughs, diarrhea,
conjunctivitis and fever.
	   Isabel Gomez, a tall woman wearing a donated dress, pulls off
her shoes to show the open sores on her feet caused by the
floodwater.
	   ``Almost all of us are like this,'' she said. ``When they come
to treat us, they only put a little medication on their finger and
then touch all of us with that one drop.''
	   About 800 residents living on higher ground escaped most of the
disaster, and the victims say they want to rebuild outside the
flood channel. But to do so, they need land on the north side of
Cristo Rey, Spanish for Christ King.
	   ``But with what are we going to buy it?'' Lazaro Hernandez
asked. Pointing to other flood victims, he said, ``She, she and he
can't tell them `Let me have a piece of your land to build my new
house.'''
	   ``And even if we did, we don't have roofs or wood, or even a
palm frond to make a roof.''
	   Having given up hope that the Nicaraguan government will help,
the villagers said their only chance is for relief from other
countries or aid groups.
	   ``Please, tell them that we need help,'' said Magdelia Campo
Romero, a mother of seven. ``I have family in Miami. They don't
know the situation we're in. If they only knew they would send us
help.''
	   The one thing the victims are sure of is that they do not want
to leave their peaceful village.
	   ``The place here is healthy,'' said Maria Teresa Aguome, an
elderly woman who has lived here more than 30 years. ``There is
friendship. You can come to my house in confidence, or I can go to
yours.''
	   Guido said the victims hope to resolve their crisis before
April, when the rainy season begins again.
	   ``All of those from Cristo Rey want to continue living in Cristo
Rey. ... If you were to come stay here awhile, not even you would
want to leave,'' he said as others laughed and nodded in agreement.
	   ``We may end up having to eat sticks, but we'll stay right
here.''

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's trip to
Moscow produced a Russian promise to work toward speedy settlement
of a 53-year-old territorial dispute _ and a Japanese promise to
give Russia nearly a billion dollars in aid and loans.
	   Obuchi and Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed an agreement
released Friday in which they pledged to resolve their differences
over the Kuril islands by the end of next year.
	   A settlement would pave the way for the two countries to finally
end World War II. The dispute over ownership of the tiny islands
has stopped them from ever signing a formal peace treaty.
	   The declaration gave no hint of how the conflict might be
settled but set up a new mechanism _ and a new resolve _ for doing
it.
	   ``I think we have made significant progress at this meeting,''
Obuchi said at a news conference before he left Friday. ``It is
necessary to expand cooperation, while creating conditions for
concluding a peace treaty and resolving the territorial question.''
	   The declaration was issued at the outset of talks between Obuchi
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Friday. The two had been
expected to focus on the details of when and how Japan will hand
over an dlrs 800 million installment of a loan it promised last
summer.
	   ``All of us gained something,'' said Yeltsin's spokesman, Dmitry
Yakushkin.
	   There was no immediate indication that the loan details had been
resolved.
	   The Japanese loan is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer. The IMF
and the World Bank put their loans on hold after Russia effectively
defaulted on foreign loans at the outset of its economic crisis in
August.
	   Obuchi, who arrived in Moscow on Nov. 11, offered to free up the
Japanese loan and give Russia another dlrs 100 million to promote
economic development on the Kuril islands, dlrs 10 million to
medical assistance and dlrs 20 million to support youth exchange
programs.
	   The two prime ministers signed an agreement on guarantees of
capital investments and on a joint investment company that would
promote direct investments in Russia by Japanese companies.
	   Relations between the two countries have long been clouded by
the Kuril dispute.
	   Tokyo claimed title to the islands _ Etorofu, Kunashiri,
Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty with Russia in 1875.
The Soviet Union took them back in the closing days of World War
II, a move Japan has protested ever since as illegal.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 poor and restive residents,
nearly all Russians, many of whom would welcome Japanese
administration. The Kurils are important to both countries for
symbolic reasons and because they are surrounded by prime fishing
waters.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica on
Friday upset top seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 7-5
to reach the semifinals of the Chevrolet Cup tennis tournament.
	   The defeat blocked Rios' hopes of recovering the Nr. 1 ATP
ranking, which he would have reached by winning his hometown
tournament for the first time ever.
	   Second-seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain also advanced to
semifinals by beating Jim Courier of the United States 3-6, 6-3,
7-6 (8-6).
	   Also advancing was Youni El Eynaoui of Morroco with a victory
over Mariano Puerta. El Eynoui was ahead 6-1, 2-0 when his
Argentine rival withdrew with an unjured waist.
	   Francisco Clavet of Spain gained his spot in the semifinals with
a 6-4, 6-4 victory over Nicolas Lapenti of Ecuador.

council's non-negotiable demand that Baghdad must resume

British movie star wife of disgraced 1960s politician dies at 81
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Valerie Hobson, a British movie star who stood by
her disgraced politician husband in a 1960s sex scandal that
brought down a Conservative government, has died at the age of 81.
	   Hobson died suddenly in a London hospital Friday, according to a
death notice published in the Daily Telegraph.
	   Her best known film roles were opposite Alec Guinness in ``Kind
Hearts and Coronets'' and as Estella in David Lean's version of
``Great Expectations.'' She also appeared with Laurence Olivier and
Ralph Richardson.
	   Born in Larne, Northern Ireland, in 1917, the daughter of a
Royal Navy Captain, she went on to work for charities for leprosy
and mentally disabled children.
	   Her husband, John Profumo, resigned from his post as Minister
for War in 1963 after a call-girl ring scandal that tarnished the
Conservative party and brought down Prime Minister Harold
Macmillan's government in 1962.
	   During the thick of the Cold War, Profumo was exposed has having
an affair with Christine Keeler _ who was conducting a simultaneous
affair with a Soviet military attache.
	   The scandal was the subject of the 1989 movie ``Scandal,''
starring John Hurt, Ian McKellen, Bridget Fonda and Joanne
Whalley-Kilmer.
	   Lord Denning, the judge in charge of the inquiry said in his
report that when Profumo confessed to his wife she told him: ``Oh,
darling, we must go home now as soon as we can and face up to it,''
the telegraph reported Saturday.
	   Hobson is survived by Profumo, three sons and six grandchildren.
	   A private funeral was scheduled for Nov. 23.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A jailed member of a leading drug
trafficking clan was assassinated Friday by the paraplegic
half-brother of a former top Cali drug boss killed a week ago,
authorities said.
	   Orlando Henao Montoya was shot with a 38-caliber revolver by
Juan Manuel Herrera in a maximum-security Bogota prison where both
were awaiting sentencing for drug trafficking, said national prison
service spokeswoman Rocio Devia.
	   The wheelchair-bound assailant was wounded with a knife,
although not seriously, she said.
	   Montoya, 45, was a member of the Northern Valley cartel, a
cocaine trafficking group operating in the same area as the
now-defunct Cali cartel, whose top leaders were jailed beginning in
1995.
	   Herrera is the half-brother of Helmer ``Pacho'' Herrera, the
former third-ranking member of the Cali drug cartel who was shot
five times in the face on Nov. 5 while watching a prison-yard
soccer game.
	   U.S. officials believe ``Pacho'' Herrera _ who turned himself
over to authorities in 1996 _ had continued to traffic cocaine from
prison and may have been killed by a business competitor.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Political violence and disappearances have
virtually ended in Peru, but basic democratic and legal rights are
still not respected, members of a visiting human rights delegation
said Friday.
	   A six-member mission from the Washington-based Inter-American
Human Rights Commission ended a five-day visit to Peru Friday,
after visiting prisons, and meeting with government officials and
human rights groups.
	   The mission criticized the government of President Alberto
Fujimori for trampling the Constitution, undermining the
independence of its courts, harassing the opposition news media and
letting secret military courts try civilians.
	   The mission also criticized Peru for not investigating and
punishing human rights violations committed during its war against
leftist rebels in the 1980s and early 1990s, which left 30,000 dead
and thousands missing.
	   ``The mission has observed a growing concern among broad sectors
of the population about what the state's ombudsman himself called
'the unraveling of Peru's constitutional system,''' mission
president Carlos Ayala told a news conference.
	   Fujimori shut down Peru's court in 1992 and fired most of the
judges. Since then he has hand-picked provisional judges who now
form 70 percent of Peru's magistrates.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac on Friday
urged both Mexico and his own country to defend their own cultures
against the onslaught of a global culture as he inaugurated a fair
promoting French culture here.
	   It was a reference to complaints by some intellectuals and
officials in both countries that U.S. music, film and computer
culture, together with the English language threatens their own
cultures.
	   ``This way we can avoid the cultural impoverishment of the
world, which if we are not careful, could emerge as the hidden face
of globalization,'' said Chirac.

	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ Colima, Mexico's most explosive
volcano, is likely to erupt soon and officials have warned local
residents to avoid approaching the smoking, 3,850-meter
(12,700-foot) mountain peak.
	   ``The possible activity expected is similar to that of 1991,''
when the mountain spewed lava and ash, said Melchor Ursua Quiroz,
operations director for the Colima state civil defense department.
	   The volcano, located about 280 miles (450 kms) west of Mexico
City, also erupted rocks and ash in 1994.
	   Some 300,000 people live within 25 miles (40 kms) of the
volcano's peak, and Colima city, the capital of Colima state, is
within 20 miles (32 kms) away.
	   Experts consider Colima to be the most dangerous volcano in
Mexico.

	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Reports an ill American woman serving a life
sentence for terrorism in Peru will be returned to a frigid prison
high in the Andes mountains have angered her father who fears for
his daughter's health.
	   Lori Berenson was transferred from the 12,700-foot-high
(3,870-meter-high) Yanamayo prison to the lower-lying Socabaya
prison, 465 miles (750 kilometers) southeast of Lima, on Oct. 7 for
medical tests.
	   Doctors say Berenson suffers from swollen, arthritic hands,
bronchial and throat problems, and chronic gastritis from the
prison food.
	   The local newspaper Expreso on Friday reported that prison chief
Raul Ibanez said Berenson was ``80 percent recovered'' and would be
returned to Yanamayo prison, where she had spent three years, as
soon as possible.
	   A National Penitentiary Institute spokesman confirmed that
Berenson would be moved out of Socabaya when her treatment was
completed, but would not say if it would be back to Yanamayo.
	   ``This is an outrage. Yanamayo prison is inhumane and should be
shut down,'' said her father Mark Berenson in a telephone interview
from his New York home on Friday.
	   Berenson, who turned 29 on Friday, was convicted by a military
judge in 1996 for helping leftist rebels of the Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement plan a thwarted assault on Peru's Congress.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Eight women, who were recruited as
waitresses but forced to work as prostitutes in Tel Aviv, returned
to Brazil on Friday after being freed by Israeli authorities.
	   ``I was duped and lived the worst moments of my life,'' Katia
Regina Fernandes told reporters. The 19-year-old Rio native spent
18 months in confinement.
	   The women, ages 19-34, are expected to give details next week to
Brazilian police about the international crime gang that enlisted
them and the slaying of their colleague Kelly Fernandes Martins.
	   Martins, 26, was found dead last month in Tel Aviv, reportedly
beaten to death after an escape attempt. Her mother, Selma Martins,
has given police photos of the men who enlisted her daughter in
Rio.
	   Israeli authorities are reportedly looking for another 12
Brazilian women believed to be working as prostitutes against their
will.

	   LEON, Nicaragua (AP) _ Red dots scattered across the map on
Margarita Clark's wall show villages still not heard from two weeks
after Hurricane Mitch rampaged across Nicaragua and other parts of
Central America.
	   ``I believe that they have food,'' said the Save the Children
charity worker. ``I am worried that they have been drinking
contaminated water and we'll have outbreaks of disease.''
	   Even with massive reconstruction efforts under way following
storms that killed about 10,000 people in four countries, the full
scale of devastation remains unclear: Hundreds of villages remain
unaccounted for.
	   Even in the best of times, it could take a horse or ox to reach
many settlements in the dirt-poor countryside of Honduras and
Nicaragua. Now, with major highways and many phone lines cut, there
has been no way to reach those tiny settlements at all.
	   ``It has not been possible to send aid to more than 300 small,
remote communities which remain incommunicado,'' said Col.
Guillermo Pinel, president of Honduras' National Emergency
Committee.
	   ``The government is making efforts to rehabilitate the roads,
the bridges, the telephones and the drinking water systems in many
places, but it lacks resources enough to carry out urgent work.''
	   Pinel said Honduras' own 14 military helicopters had been
supplemented by 16 from Mexico and 12 from the United States.
	   But they were not sufficient to both ferry aid and survey damage
in a country whose road system was almost destroyed and where
10,000 people remain missing in addition to almost 7,000 known
dead.
	   Clark said nothing had yet been heard from about 10 percent of
the 148 villages the organization serves in two northwestern
provinces of Nicaragua.
	   ``The access roads are still very full of mud and one village,
Versailles, is surrounded by the mudslide'' from the Casitas
Volcano, which collapsed during the storm, overwhelming several
villages and killing hundreds of people.
	   Nicaragua has confirmed almost 2,000 dead, with hundreds more
missing. Several hundred people also died in Guatemala and El
Salvador.
	   The commander of the U.S. Army's Southern Command, Gen. Charles
E. Wilhelm, announced on Friday that the U.S. government will set
up a base at El Salvador's international airport to aid in the
relief effort.
	   An initial contingent of U.S. military engineers was set to
arrive Saturday to begin rebuilding roads and bridges destroyed by
the storm.
	   Wilhelm arrived in El Salvador on Friday to coordinate delivery
of 175 tons of food, clothing, medicine and water collected by the
nongovernmental organization Fischer House in New York City.
	   In Nicaragua, the Roman Catholic Bishop of Leon, Bosco Vivas
Robelo, appealed Thursday night for people to come forward if they
were aware of any towns still isolated.
	   ``After 15 days, practically since the hurricane, they think of
themselves as abandoned brothers,'' the bishop told a news
conference. ``Yes, we are very worried.''
	   Honduras announced Friday that it had received dlrs 67 million
worth of aid from 20 nations _ though President Carlos Flores
Facusse said Thursday that the cost of rebuilding could top dlrs 4
billion.
	   Two or three aid flights were arriving each hour, and one or two
ships with supplies each day.
	   The Dutch public pledged dlrs 8.8 million dollars for survivors
during a televised appeal Thursday, and the government said it
would match that.
	   Japan sent six C-130 transport planes filled with medical
supplies and a 185-member disaster-relief team to Honduras on
Friday. An 80-strong medical team will leave Saturday. The planes
are expected to reach Honduras on Monday.
	   Among those arriving to survey damage on Friday was Spanish
Crown Prince Felipe de Borbon, who met with Flores shortly after
arriving.
	   He flew by helicopter to survey several areas damaged by Mitch
in its Oct. 25-Nov. 2 passage through Honduras.
	   Honduran officials say the storm destroyed about 60 percent of
their road and utility network and about 70 percent of their
agriculture.

	   In his first public statement since the latest dispute over U.N.

	   Saddam insisted Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and

from Annan later Friday evening.

Climate talks deadlocked as discussions drag late into the night

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ U.N. climate talks dragged on as
more than 160 nations struggled to work out some of the thorniest
issues left out of last year's historic global warming treaty.
	   Reports late Friday indicated the marathon discussions were
unlikely to conclude before Saturday morning as negotiators sought
an action plan for rolling back greenhouse gas emissions as they
pledged in 1997.
	   Issues facing the delegates during the two weeks of talks came
down to a flurry on specifics, most notably timetables for deciding
ways countries could work to reduce their pollution output.
	   Another sticking point was how these emission cuts would be
tracked.
	   There is no clear consensus on methods countries should adopt to
attack the problem of global warming, and the difference was
evident in the final hours of the two-week summit.
	   India chided the industrial world earlier Friday for asking
developing nations to do more to cut greenhouse gases, saying
wealthier countries should take the lead under the 1997 global
warming treaty.
	   During the final hours of a U.N. climate summit, India's
environmental minister contended some countries would like to evade
their legal obligations under the Kyoto protocol to scale back
emissions of the heat-trapping gases.
	   ``When it comes to ... taking responsibilities, some countries
would like to shirk'' their obligations while raising ``new ideas''
about how the agreement should be implemented, said India's
environmental minister, Shri Suresh Prabhu. ``That's not acceptable
to us.''
	   He did not name any countries. But his statement appeared aimed
at a U.S.-backed campaign for developing nations to take on
emissions targets like those laid out for industrialized nations
under the Kyoto treaty.
	   India and China are the biggest opponents of that proposal.
	   The 38 major industrialized nations agreed last December in
Kyoto, Japan, to sharply reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by
2012. That accord merely called for developing nations to do their
best to fight global warming.
	   The U.S. Senate has said it won't ratify the Kyoto treaty unless
it leads to emissions reductions in the developing world. In
signing the treaty on Thursday, the Clinton administration promised
not to send it for Senate ratification until it had greater
developing-world participation.
	   Speaking at a news conference Friday, Prabhu insisted
industrialized countries must meet their emissions targets before
offering new initiatives. ``What's been agreed upon has not been
acted upon. So how do we talk about new ideas?'' he asked.
	   Negotiations have been going on nearly around the clock in the
final hours of the 2-week-old climate summit, the biggest since the
treaty was reached last year.
	   Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense
Fund, said Kyoto gave 2012 as the deadline for major industrial
nations to cut their greenhouse gases by 5 percent below 1990
levels.
	   ``Now we need interim deadlines for defining the rules so
entrepreneurs, business and private citizens can get on with the
job of beginning to reduce emissions,'' he said.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
what are known as greenhouse gas emissions _ mainly carbon dioxide
from factories, power plants and automobiles.
	   Critics say global warming scenarios have not been proved and
that the pact threatens American industry. Proponents of the treaty
say it won't force costly measures on American companies to cut
pollution.

Japan, South Korea to mull bilateral investment treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR (AP) _ Trade representatives from Japan and South
Korea agreed to look into ways to strengthen their economic ties,
including forming a new investment pact.
	   Japan's trade minister, Kaoru Yosano, and his South Korean
counterpart, Han Duck-soo, met in Kuala Lumpur late Friday as part
of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum meeting.
	   The two leaders agreed to establish a joint study group to
deepen economic ties and to consider setting up a bilateral
investment treaty, an official from Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said.
	   Under the proposed pact, the countries would likely drop
barriers on cross-border investment, the official said.
	   Such a treaty would be more effective than a multilateral pact
backed by member countries of the Organization of Economic
Cooperation and Development, the official, speaking on condition of
anonymity.

Charles uses six birdies to beat Nelson
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PALM DESERT, California (AP) _ Bob Charles used six birdies to
upset third-seeded Larry Nelson 2 and 1 in Friday's first round of
the Senior Match Play Challenge.
	   Charles, seeded 14th, closed it out when he matched Nelson's par
at the 17th hole.
	   Charles, 62, became the oldest player left in the field after
63-year-old Gary Player was defeated 3 and 2 by top seed Hale
Irwin.
	   ``It's encouraging at the age of 62 to be competitive, to be
able to play well, and I feel very fortunate to be invited to this
tournament,'' Charles said. ``I think that match play fits my style
of play.
	   ``I don't have the power of the other players so I rely on some
iron shots in the green and good putting.''
	   The top 12 money leaders from the seniors' season, plus four
invited players, made up the starting field for the challenge.
	   Second-seeded Gil Morgan downed Bob Murphy 2 and 1.
	   Jay Sigel began his match against George Archer with two birdies
to go ahead quickly and went on to a 6 and 4 victory when Archer
conceded the 14th hole. Sigel finished with six birdies.
	   Bruce Summerhays and Dave Stockton were tied after 16 holes, but
Summerhays went 1-up after he birdied the 17th and held on for a
1-up victory when both parred the 18th at Big Horn Golf Club.
	   Also, Dana Quigley defeated Jose Maria Canizares 1-up, Jim
Colbert defeated Vicente Fernandez 2 and 1 and David Graham
defeated Hugh Baiocchi 5 and 3.

Trinidad judge delays hanging of alleged drug kingpin
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROBERT HOFFMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ A judge granted a stay of
execution to a convicted drug kingpin and eight of his gang
members, sparing them from the gallows for at least another two
weeks.
	   Judge Carlyle Bharrat gave lawyers time to present a motion
claiming that the state has been arbitrarily executing convicts and
that their clients have been targeted in a discriminatory manner
for the death sentence.
	   Prior to Friday's stay, Trinidad officials said they were ready
to proceed with the hangings on Tuesday despite international and
local opposition.
	   The executions would be the first in the Caribbean nation since
1994, following a regional trend favoring the harshest punishment
to deter increasingly violent criminals connected to the illicit
drug trade.
	   The Prisons Commission of Trinidad and Tobago said death
warrants were read Thursday to Dole Chadee and eight others
convicted in the January 9, 1994, murder of a family of four in a
reported drug dispute.
	   The gang shot Hamilton ``Mice'' Baboolal, his parents and his
sister, but spared two young children in the house.
	   In a statement, the Prisons Commission said nine had exhausted
all avenues of appeal, and that their petitions had been denied by
the U.N. Commission on Human Rights as well as London's Privy
Council, which acts as a supreme court for several former British
colonies in the Caribbean.
	   Trinidad and Tobago has been trying to execute dozens of
convicted murderers. In June, it resumed reading death warrants on
almost a weekly basis. But in every case, courts have postponed the
executions while they investigate conditions in the prisons.
	   The Trinidadian government has introduced a bill in Parliament
to amend the constitution by eliminating the right of convicts to
fight execution by arguing they already have suffered ``cruel and
inhumane'' conditions in prison.

Ghana's Contradictions: Slave castles and friendly people

<TEXT>
	   ELMINA, Ghana (AP) _ The aged stone, the darkness, the sudden
gloom _ all should have been welcome respites from West Africa's
blistering sun. But standing there, my back against the cool brick,
I felt only vague nausea and echo of a misery centuries old.
	   For this was a cell, one of many in a place called Elmina
Castle, a striking white fortress on an ocean bluff that evokes
images of grand battles and sweeping history. At Elmina and the
nearby Cape Coast Castle, however, reality is more ignominious.
	   Ghana was known as the Gold Coast in the 17th and 18th
centuries, the center of the gold, ivory and slave trade, with the
mighty Ashanti empire in control. That legacy is punctuated by the
many colonial forts that dot Ghana's proliferate beaches.
	   Elmina Castle, built by Portuguese traders 516 years ago, became
a slave castle where captured Africans waited, stuffed in dank
stone holes without hope, bound for the plantations of the New
World. Atop it all, Dutch officers _ and later British soldiers _
drank and caroused.
	   That was one side of a visit to coastal Ghana _ very intense
and, as a white American, not without guilt. But this country's
south-central region offers personality and beauty ad infinitum;
almost, but not quite, enough to offset history's harsh legacy.
	   I'd had no real experience in Africa. Most of my time abroad had
been in Asia. I had gone to the neighboring Ivory Coast, or Cote
d'Ivoire, to visit American friends who work there. They'd promised
me a journey to at least one other African country. I'm glad it
turned out to be this one. The Ghanaian people are delightful _
friendly, engaging, willing to interact.
	   The 17 million people in Ghana have reason to be happy.
	   In 1957, the former British colony became the first African
nation to achieve independence. Though it was battered by a series
of military coups through the 1970s, it has become one of the more
stable countries in the region.
	   President Jerry Rawlings, who seized power in a bloody coup in
1979, has shifted the country toward democracy. He was elected to a
second term as president in 1996.
	   One of the region's economic success stories, Ghana has an
economy largely based on cocoa and gold production.
	   The country stretches from rain forests in the coastal south to
arid scrub in the North. In 1964, the Volta River was dammed,
creating the enormous Lake Volta, which covers a large portion of
the Southeast.
	   And hospitality abounds.
	   There are several hostels and hotels around Cape Coast and
Elmina catering to foreigners at rates ranging from dlrs 40 (96,000
cedi) to about dlrs 90 (216,000 cedi) a night. There are a variety
of restaurants, from inexpensive roadside cafes and ``spots'' to
upscale hotel dining rooms.
	   We stayed at a relaxing lodge called the Biriwa Beach Hotel on a
ridge overlooking the sea, the sort of place where perfect moments
happen. (It cost dlrs 75 per night, double occupancy.)
	   The owners, Germans, have been around for three decades and are
in the midst of renovating. The quality of the hotel was comparable
to a clean roadside motel. But the true joy was in the locale and
the trappings.
	   Dinner was served outdoors on a terrace overlooking the
palm-lined beach and the verging Gulf of Guinea beyond. (Take your
malaria medication before coming; mosquitoes are fierce.)
	   We passed most evenings listening to the British Broadcasting
Corp. on shortwave, drinking Schweppes Bitter Lemon or Flag, the
local beer, and demolishing grilled lobster, heaping platters of
crustacean that cost roughly dlrs 4 a plate. Then we retired to our
rooms for sleep made deeper by the sound of crashing waves. Had we
wanted TV, the only stations were Ghanaian state television and,
inexplicably, The Cartoon Network.
	   By day we walked the busy streets of Elmina and Cape Coast,
relishing the nontourist feel. Most visitors to the slave castles
are driven to the gate, inspect the inside, snap photos and hop
back into the car with nary a minute spent in town.
	   Visually, these walks were a treat. They revealed customs and
facets of the culture we could not find anywhere else: the use, in
the absence of newspapers, of posted bills as obituaries; the
popularity of ``Malta,'' a nonalcoholic beverage that tastes like
carbonated molasses; the skinny kid with only two possessions _ an
empty metal bowl and a Nike tank top; the amazing ability of
Ghanaians to walk with intricate piles of goods balanced upon their
heads. I saw not one spill.
	   And the language _ so fluid. English, but foreign nonetheless.
Ghanaians have an odd, charming approach to language. Sounds are
grouped in rhythmic ways, like two wonderfully memorable
establishments outside Cape Coast: For a little something to eat,
try the roadside Vicky Nicky Snacky Spot. For libations, stop down
the road at Uncle Father's Nippy Spot.
	   But the biggest joy of the walk was the children. We played
street foosball with them at a ramshackle table in Elmina and
watched them play Nintendo using an electrical outlet that seemed
to run right into the dirt.

<TEXT>
	   In Cape Coast, a thicket of boys led by two named Justice and
Ebenezer walked us around town, accepting the Cokes we bought them,
handing us dog-eared scraps of paper with their addresses and
imploring us to write.
	   On the final day, our driver took us 20 miles (30 kilometers)
north to Kakum National Forest, which features rope-and-wood
bridges 100 yards (90 meters) high that offer beautiful views of
the treetops and industrial-strength feelings of vertigo. The
forest is worth the trip, but avoid the tour and opt for a solo
hike instead. Our guide, while knowledgeable, hurried us through
and expected a large tip.
	   There was no shortage of activities, and our four-day stay was a
full one. But the slave castles, of course, tower over the coastal
region physically, metaphorically and emotionally.
	   If there are such things as ``real'' places, here they sit. Even
with minor renovations for authenticity (and even that much
renovation upsets some visitors), the slave castles at Elmina and
Cape Coast remain rough enough, stark enough to evoke the horrors
they witnessed.
	   A restoration project is continuing, funded partly by dlrs 10
million from the United States. One of the few visible nods to
modern tourism, a walk-through museum display at the Cape Coast
castle, is informative but ultimately works to the detriment of the
experience; you somehow don't WANT the feel of a packaged tour.
	   ``Departed descendants that come back to this castle shouldn't
have to pay. We feel offended by history and by touristical
thoughts. That's as materialistic as our ancestors,'' a woman named
Monette from Martinique wrote in the guest book at Cape Coast
Castle. (Admission to the castle costs dlrs 5, or 12,000 cedi.)
	   Tourism, of course, is political in any form, and nowhere more
so than here. I was well aware that we and a few Europeans were the
minority. Every look, every glance from a Ghanaian visitor, however
benign, made me wonder what they thought about me.
	   The guest book is a cultural document unto itself, and flipping
through it is a worthwhile part of the castle experience.
	   ``The whites should be banned from touring this castle because
they are very wicked,'' a Ghanaian named Elanger wrote.
	   ``It wouldn't be out of place to ask for their descendants to be
hanged, too,'' wrote GEA Baidem, another Ghanaian.
	   Then there was Freece, a Ghanaian who offered an absolution of
sorts, a call to defer hatred in a place where no one knows just
how many bones lie at the bottom of the sea.
	   ``If there is any heaven,'' Freece wrote, ``we will all meet
there to sort things out.''

U.N. chief urges Saddam to cooperate before it's too late

 &UR; Eds: Combines urgent series, and UPDATES with new quotes from
Russian ambassador; adds that council will meet again Saturday at
2030 GMT &QL;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan urged
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein Friday to make ``a wise decision''
and resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors before it's too
late.
	   After a 4 1-2-hour meeting with the U.N. Security Council, he
said all 15 members ``stress the desirability of a peaceful and
diplomatic solution but events on the ground may be running away
from us.''
	   Before the council meeting, Annan met with the ambassadors of
Russia, France and China, who appealed to him to intervene to find
a diplomatic solution and avert U.S. airstrikes.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein responded Friday to a letter from Russia's president and
prime minister by declaring that he was ready to rescind Iraq's
decision to end weapons inspections.
	   But Saddam laid out several conditions, including that the
council agree to start a comprehensive review of Baghdad's
compliance with U.N. resolutions that would lead to the lifting of
economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1991.
	   ``We believe that this is a constructive shift, which we hope
would be followed by a decision from Iraq in response to the appeal
by the secretary-general,'' Lavrov said.
	   But Iraq has laid out these conditions in the past and it wasn't
clear what led Lavrov to believe there had been a shift in
Baghdad's stance. The Security Council has declined to make any
promises about lifting sanctions until after a compliance review is
completed.
	   Annan's brief statement after the council meeting reiterated its
non-negotiable demand that Baghdad must resume cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged with
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   He did not mention any possibility of flying to Baghdad to
mediate.
	   Iraq's ambassador to the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon, who met
with Annan after the security council meeting, said Annan planned
to send a letter to the Iraqi government later Friday evening.
Hamdoon said he did not know what the letter would say.
	   ``We still hope there will be a diplomatic solution but it
doesn't look like the U.S. is ready for a diplomatic solution,''
Hamdoon said.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current Security
Council president, announced that the council would meet Saturday
afternoon to discuss the humanitarian situation in Iraq but that
the discussion might encompass wider issues.
	   Annan, in his statement after the meeting, said: ``I would use
this opportunity once again to urge President Saddam Hussein and
the Iraqi leadership to take the wise decision of resuming
cooperation with UNSCOM and (the) atomic agency.''
	   ``I hope that this appeal which has been made by many people,
many in the region and myself, will be listened to by the Iraqi
authorities,'' the secretary-general said.
	   ``I hope they will be in a position to act, and act as soon as
possible,'' he said.
	   Annan reiterated the Security Council's offer to hold a
comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions
once it resumes cooperation with the weapons inspectors.
	   ``Once that is done, I trust the council will be in a position
to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   In his first public statement since the latest dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections, Saddam made it clear that nothing less than a
pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff _ and he
didn't get it.
	   Saddam insisted Friday he was not trying to create a crisis and
would accept ``positively any initiative'' that would lift the
sanctions.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ President Andres Pastrana accused the
United States of mishandling a cocaine and heroin bust on a
Colombian air force plane, saying U.S. officials should have told
his government before the plane left Colombia that it was carrying
drugs.
	   U.S. officials suggested Friday Pastrana was misinformed.
	   Customs officers at the international airport in Fort
Lauderdale, Florida, reported Tuesday they found 1,639 pounds (743
kilograms) of cocaine hidden aboard the C-130 cargo plane and
detained the six-man crew. Also stashed on board were 13 pounds (6
kilograms) of heroin, both governments reported Friday.
	   ``Why, if they knew about this cargo ... didn't they tell us
first?'' Pastrana said in his first public comments on the incident
_ an international embarrassment for his 3-month-old
administration.
	   U.S. drug agents in the past have been loathe to share
information with Colombia, fearing the intelligence would be leaked
to drug traffickers.
	   Pastrana also questioned why U.S. authorities seized the plane
at the Florida airport, rather than trying to gain more information
by tracking the shipment to its final destination.
	   A spokesman for the U.S. Customs Service in Miami, Mike Sheehan,
told The Associated Press the drugs were discovered in ``a routine
inspection, like those we have conducted many times in the past.''
	   Sheehan said the heroin wasn't detected until a search Friday of
a Colombian air force warehouse at the airport. There, agents found
heroin packets sewn into cargo netting taken off the plane on
Monday.
	   The plane's six-man crew was released Monday after questioning
turned up no leads, said Sheehan. ``We could make no association
between them and the drugs,'' he said.
	   In Colombia, the seizure has led to multiple arrests and a
command shakeup in the 12,000-member air force.
	   ``We're truly sad that an incident like this once again
blemishes the image of an entire country,'' said Pastrana, who took
office vowing to step up Colombia's fight against drug trafficking.
	   Federal prosecutor's agents on Thursday detained six air force
members, including Maj. Gonzalo Noguera, the intelligence chief of
the Bogota military airport from which the plane took off, as well
as a lieutenant and four aviation technicians.
	   Noguera and two other officers were forced into retirement. Air
force commander Gen. Jose Manuel Sandoval resigned.

Serendipity on a bumpy ride across the frontier

<TEXT>
	   TAKORADI, Ghana (AP) _ It was raining slightly, a spritzing,
refreshing rain altogether befitting this part of West Africa. We
slung our packs over our shoulders and sloshed out of Cote d'Ivoire
across a shabby bridge over the mud-swollen Ehi Lagoon and into
Ghana.
	   Behind us, from the Ivorian side of the border, a youth trying
to get us to hire a car yelled in our direction. ``You walk?'' he
said. ``Crazy.''
	   If you're going to cross a border, this is the way to do it. Not
by plane. Not by boat. Not even by train, though that is quite an
attractive option. The way to cross a border is to walk.
	   We had set out from the Ivorian capital, Abidjan, from a section
of town called Treichville, where small white hatchbacks hire out
to go almost anywhere. For about dlrs 45 (108,000 cedi), we got a
car to take us on the 2 1-2 -hour ride to the border. (This was far
better than the ride back to Abidjan days later, on a public bus,
where the driver admonished me to ``be safe and keep your elbow
in'' _ as he took a swig from an airline bottle of Smirnoff.)
	   The Ivorian border town, Noe, bustled with the organized chaos
of a frontier. Cars awaited hire and vendors hawked all manner of
odd items. One kept thrusting a soccer ball and a basketball
through our open car window, as if such items were natural impulse
purchases there: ``Hey, we're crossing into Ghana; maybe we need a
soccer ball!''
	   After passing the Ivorian departure point _ an open hut with a
stamp-wielding immigration officer sitting imperiously under a
thatched roof _ we made our way across the bridge.
	   On the Ghanaian side, a mesh-enclosed corridor shepherded us
into an immigration building with peeling paint and hand-lettered
signs, something any director of an Africa adventure flick would
have loved.
	   We waded through a thicket of humanity, got our passports and
health cards stamped (yellow fever vaccinations are required for
many West African nations) and were left to haggle for a taxi. A
smiling man with a tiny mobile phone that doubled as a calculator
affixed himself to us. ``I,'' he declared, ``will get you a ride.''
	   He spoke broken English _ Ghana, a onetime British colony,
speaks English when its citizens aren't using tribal languages _
and led us to a driver who audaciously) quoted a price of 115,000
CFA (about dlrs 210), the currency of West Africa's Francophone
nations. We scoffed. Finally we hired a van driver to take us to
Biriwa Beach, three hours away, for 115,000 Ghanaian cidi (about
dlrs 55).
	   The van was a rickety Nissan of the sort that exists in all the
world's off-the-beaten-path places _ no shock absorbers and an
engine that wheezed like John Goodman on a Stairmaster. If it ever
had upholstery, it was during the Eisenhower administration. The
driver's brother and his friend piled in with us.
	   At first, the road to Biriwa Beach featured remnants of what may
have been pavement and potholes brimming with brown water. We
tackled it like a game of Pole Position, winding a serpentine
helix, sometimes veering off into the brush to avoid fissures that
could have swallowed us whole.
	   But the scenery was stunning. Ghana's landscape bristles with
life. Lush palms jostle for space, and green growth pushes toward
the road in continuous renewal.
	   One doesn't slow down, it seems, when one comes to a
pedestrian-packed town in Ghana. One simply honks and hopes all
comers _ car, person, child, goat _ will make way. And everywhere
we looked, Ghanaians' vans were decorated with decals of Christ and
religious iconography. Ours had a Madonna, but it was the other
Madonna from her ``Strike the Pose'' period.
	   One of the great treats of the trip east is Takoradi, a coastal
market and maritime town that bustles like a casbah and even has,
off the cracked road, a tiny Chinese restaurant. Shack shops crowd
the dusty roads with vibrant hand-lettered signs: ``Ebo's House of
Lotteries.''
	   ``Lovable Soap Factory.'' ``Black Cat Food and Meat
Distribution.'' ``Washington DC Cassettes.'' ``Auntie Mercy Blood
Tonic _ giver of energy and long life and reliever of menstrual
pain.'' ``Duncan Yawson Fashion Home.''
	   And, since God is such a huge part of daily life here, the
sacred and the corporate sit in jarring juxtaposition: ``Jesus Is
the Winner/Enjoy Coca-Cola.'' ``God First Cassette and Electrical
Parts.'') ``In God We Trust Stationery.'' My favorite: ``Christ
Within Poultry.''
	   The serendipity of the trip to the beach rivaled the beach
itself. Takoradi is an observer's jewel _ a rough-and-tumble
explosion of unfettered adolescent capitalism. It is anarchic
enough to unsettle even a taxi driver from Cape Coast, a Jersey
Shore-sized beach town just 1 1-2 hours east. Procuring us another
cab to the Ivorian border, he got out, spoke to someone, looked
around and hurried back into the car.
	   ``This,'' he said, head shaking and eyes wide, ``is nothing like
Cape Coast.''

	    &UR; IF YOU GO ...
	   GETTING THERE: Traveling to the slave castles in Cape Coast and
Elmina and the Kakum National Forest just north of there can be
done by hiring a car either from the Ghanaian capital, Accra, or
from Abidjan in neighboring Ivory Coast. Both cities are accessible
by major air carriers, including KLM, Air Afrique, Swissair and
British Airways. Ghana Airways has thrice-weekly flights between
Accra and New York's JFK airport, and from Accra to London and to
other points in West Africa.
	   Car travel within Ghana is often procured by bargaining (most
Ghanaians speak English). Roads outside Accra can be spotty and
bumpy, but those in the Cape Coast region usually are passable.
	   MEDICAL: Proof of vaccination for yellow fever is required to
enter Ghana, as is a visa, available through the Ghanaian embassy
in Washington. Vaccinations for tetanus and typhoid are
recommended, as is antimalarial medication. Because malaria is
carried by mosquitoes, it is important to wear insecticide,
long-sleeve shirts and long pants after dark.
	   ACCOMMODATIONS: There are several hostels and hotels around Cape
Coast and Elmina that cater to foreigners, ranging from dlrs 40
(96,000 cedi) to about dlrs 90 (216,000 cedi) a night. Meals
usually are not included.
	   RESTAURANTS: Cape Coast and Elmina have a variety of inexpensive
restaurants, from roadside cafes and ``spots'' to somewhat more
upscale hotel eating places that cater to foreign visitors. Seafood
is a specialty.
	   WEATHER: Ghana's climate is tropical, so year-round visits are
possible. High temperatures the year around average in the 80s
Fahrenheit (upper 20s Celsius) with lows in the 70s Fahrenheit
(lower 20s Celsius). The rainiest months are April through
September.
	   INFORMATION: Tourist information about Ghana is available on the
Internet at www.undp.org/missions/ghana/	   or www.interknowledge.com/ghana/index.html.

Fresco messages for the Romanian Orthodox
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GURA HUMORULUI, Romania (AP) _ The colorful frescoes on the
outside walls of 16th-century monasteries in this remote corner of
Romania warn of fire and brimstone.
	   Tens of thousands of tourists visit each year to digest scenes
of The Last Judgment, the Fall of Constantinople and Jacob's Ladder
to Heaven, which represent a blend of history, biblical truths and
great art.
	   Seven painted monasteries are among the 200 here in the cradle
of Romanian culture, where the world of Eastern Orthodoxy collided
with Roman Catholicism and Islam for centuries.
	   Thousands of monks and nuns inhabit these monasteries in the
impoverished northeastern Moldova region, one of the most fervently
religious corners of the Orthodox Christian world.
	   Moldova is known for producing writers, musicians and artistic
works. None inspire more than the monasteries, located at the base
of wooded mountains and at the edge of forests where bears, wolves
and lynx roam. The aim of the frescoes was to educate Moldovans,
many of them illiterate, about Christianity. As today, people
gathered outside the monastery, rather than in it, for services.
	   Painted with vegetable dyes _ emerald green, blood red and
bright blue dominate _ the frescoes have withstood hundreds of
harsh winters and outlived the whims of many rulers.
	   For Romanians who live here, the message of this Orthodox art is
as alive today as it was 500 years ago when they were fending off
the Turks.
	   ``Our faith gives us hope in God, that the next world will be
better and more just than this one,'' said Constantin Fodor, a
38-year-old worker, attending a four-hour consecration of a new
church.
	   At the ceremony, Daniel Ciobotea, the leader of the Orthodox
Church in Moldova, said, ``When we go into a painted monastery ...
we think we are going into heaven. The church is heaven on earth.''
	   Moldovans are drawn to icons they believe can cure disease and
bring rain. Saints' days are faithfully honored and saints' bones
are kissed in the hope they will bring blessings.
	   On Sundays, people put on their best clothes and go to churches
or monasteries for lengthy services. The anniversaries of dead
relatives are celebrated in public. Monasteries hold at least three
services every day, starting at dawn and ending after midnight.
	   To this mystical and almost medieval world come visitors from
Japan, Europe and the United States, although tourist services are
rudimentary and highways poor.
	   ``It is admirable that these paintings have held up all these
years,'' said Kenneth Honeycutt of Knoxville, Tennessee, visiting
the Humor monastery 350 kilometers (220 miles) north of Bucharest,
the capital.
	   A 10-minute drive away is Voronet monastery, possibly the most
stunning of all the monasteries with outside painted walls. The
blue so brilliant in the frescoes here and elsewhere has become
known as Voronet blue. A secret formula for the color is still
passed from one abbot to the next on his deathbed.
	   The Last Judgment fresco at Voronet vividly illustrates sins
such as adultery and overindulgence. Good people such as Romanian
rulers went to heaven and bad people, Turks, headed to hell.
	   Victoria Clark, a London-based Orthodoxy expert, said the
painted monasteries are the best way to understand the central
themes of Orthodoxy, which focus on the beauty of heaven and the
damnation of hell.
	   ``It makes you understand why Romanians take so little trouble
with the world as it is,'' she said. ``Their real focus is
heaven.''

Clinton's Asian trip plagued by numerous potholes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ President Clinton's star-crossed
Asian trip is already plagued by a nasty dispute over trade
barriers, a looming military showdown with Iraq and political
distractions at home.
	   The dispute threatened to derail what had been one of Clinton's
primary objectives for his 10 days of travel through Asia: an
agreement among Pacific Rim countries to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5
trillion worth of global trade.
	   The United States believes such a bold step to promote freer
trade would send a strong signal that Asia is not turning inward
despite its worst economic crisis since World War II.
	   But over two days of negotiations, Japanese officials have just
as adamantly argued they were in no position to offer to cut border
taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and fish _ at a
time when their economy is mired in recession.
	   Frustrated negotiators finally threw up their hands and punted
the whole issue over to meetings Saturday and Sunday between the
trade and foreign ministers of the 21-member Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   That group will consider a variety of compromise proposals which
would water down the U.S. goals by allowing nations longer time to
reduce tariffs or greater flexibility in deciding what products to
cover.
	   Whatever the ministers agree to will then be forwarded to
Clinton and the other Pacific leaders during their summit Tuesday
and Wednesday. This year's group will grow from 18 to 21 with the
addition of three new members -- Russia, Peru and Vietnam.
	   Clinton is scheduled to leave Washington Saturday for an Asian
trip that will include not only the APEC summit but visits to
Japan, South Korea and Guam.
	   With a growing possibility of U.S. air strikes against Iraq, the
administration has been wavering on whether Clinton should even
make the trip.
	   He'd also be away when Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr lays
out a case next week for impeaching the president.
	   Also of concern were the anti-free market views of Malaysian
Prime Mahathir Mohamad, this year's host, and Mahathir's handling
of the sacking and later jailing of his former top deputy, Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir has openly attacked the U.S. supported approach to the
Asian crisis, which requires crisis countries to pursue economic
reforms in return for receiving multibillion-dollar bailouts from
the International Monetary Fund.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff cuts in the nine sectors
fully effective by 2002, as a down payment toward APEC's ultimate
goal of free trade in the Pacific by 2020.
	   Malaysian trade minister Rafidah Aziz, who was chairing the
weekend negotiating sessions, suggested that one possible way to
narrow the differences might be to allow Japan to offer only token
cuts on a few items in the wood and fish sectors.
	   But Barshefsky flatly rejected this idea.
	   ``Token participation at the end of the day by the world's
second largest economy doesn't cut it,'' she said late Friday.
	   Despite the various potholes, the White House insists Clinton's
travel plans were proceeding as scheduled for Asia.
	   ``The president very much wants to go,'' said White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart. After all, it was Clinton who elevated APEC
five years ago to the head-of-government level.
	   The administration sees APEC as a good opportunity to deal with
the Asian financial crisis. But it also will put Clinton in the
ticklish position of shaking hands with Mahathir, whose recent
handling of Anwar -- the sacked finance minister was much admired
by the West -- has infuriated Washington.
	   To demonstrate U.S. displeasure, Clinton will not hold the
customary one-on-one meeting with the summit host and will avoid
all contact with Malaysian officials outside of APEC, White House
aides said.

Troops remain on streets after bloody student protests in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Thousands of troops and riot police
remained on the streets of the Indonesian capital Saturday after
fighting bloody street battles with pro-democracy students.
	   Human rights groups said as many as 16 people were killed in
overnight clashes between security forces and demonstrators. The
Jakarta Post newspaper reported that 12 people were dead.
	   Jakarta's main morgue at Cipto Mungunkusomo Hospital said it had
received eight bodies.
	   Most of the victims were students, although some were reported
to have been volunteer security guards and government supporters
beaten to death by mobs.
	   President B.J. Habibie expressed his condolences, describing the
dead as ``victims of the reform process.''
	   Opposition groups and student leaders said that Habibie had lost
his credibility as a leader and demanded the military return to
barracks.
	   ``The government has lost any legitimacy it had,'' Sarwono
Kusumaatmadja, a former Suharto Cabinet was quoted by the Post
newspaper as saying. ``It has lost its moral right to govern and
can only stay in power by force.''
	   By Saturday morning, the violence had subsided, although squads
of troops remained on duty at strategic intersections across the
city.
	   Friday's clashes were the worst violence to hit the city of 11
million since 1,200 were killed in three days of rioting that
forced former authoritarian President Suharto to quit last May.
Those riots erupted after troops shot dead four student protesters.
	   The students are protesting the meetings by the legislature,
People's Consultative Assembly, which Habibie has promised will
deliver democracy and respect for human rights.
	   They say the 1,000-member assembly is dominated by former
supporters of Suharto, ensuring that its decrees will only serve to
entrench Habibie, the military and the ruling Golkar Party.
	   The decrees passed by the assembly Friday backed a plan by
Habibie to hold parliamentary elections in either May or June and
to open the ballot to a wide range of new political parties.
	   But the students don't think the decisions are enough and want
Suharto put on trial on charges of enriching himself and his family
during his 32-year rule.
	   A government anti-corruption investigation, rejected by critics
as a whitewash, has yet to uncover any evidence of wrongdoing.
	   The assembly has also passed a decree that called for the
gradual reduction of military representation in the 500-seat
Parliament, from 55 to the current 75 lawmakers directly appointed
by the military. Students want the military banned from the
legislature altogether.
	   Hundreds of students were injured Friday night when soldiers and
police fired plastic bullets, tear gas and water cannons at tens of
thousands of protesters who threw back rocks and firebombs.
	   Military chiefs had ordered their troops not to carry live
ammunition. But plastic bullets can be lethal at short range.
	   Hospitals said their emergency rooms were full with bleeding
students. And doctors feared the toll would rise as some of the
injured had been seriously wounded by gunshots.
	   Earlier, two people, a student protester and police officer,
died after clashes on Thursday night.
	   Witnesses said a marine was shot and wounded in the leg by an
unidentified assailant on Saturday morning.
	   Thousands of students were gathering at the University of
Indonesia Saturday morning, raising the possibility of more street
protests later in the day.
	   Thousands of people were also gathering at Atma Jaya Catholic
University, the scene of some of the heaviest fighting.
	   Funerals were expected to be held Saturday as families of the
victims claimed their bodies.

	   NEWPORT NEWS, Virginia (AP) _ Bureaucrats trying to clean up
Norfolk's red-light district in the 1940s were dismayed that
thousands of sailors were flocking to Cap'n A.B. Coleman's tattoo
shop.
	   These days the sailors would have plenty of company. Tattoos
have become so accepted that soccer moms sport them almost as
readily as athletes and rock stars.
	   By 1950, efforts to clean up Norfolk's image as a seedy town had
chased Coleman to nearby Portsmouth.
	   Now, with the growing popularity of tattooing, Coleman's famous
World War II-era Norfolk parlor has been re-created as part of the
exhibit ``Skin Deep: The Art of the Tattoo'' at The Mariners'
Museum in Newport News. It will run through March 30, 1999.
	   Part of the exhibit is devoted to tattoos in modern pop culture.
The section includes vivid photographs of people with tattoos,
video clips of people talking about why they got their tattoos, and
posters from movies such as ``The Illustrated Man.''
	   ``There's a kind of pattern we see happening over and over
again,'' says museum director Claudia Pennington. ``There's
repulsion, then interest. It works its way into being something
people want.''
	   The exhibit includes more than 500 images and artifacts such as
tattoo flashes (designs), needles, artwork, photographs, and a
traveling tattoo kit in a trunk.
	   ``Tattooing has been going on 5,000 years in practically every
culture,'' Ms. Pennington says. ``It's a way of expressing
individuality, and it's a personal decoration.
	   ``A lot of people will swallow hard and ask, `Is it art?' Yeah,
it is. Maybe not for you.''
	   Tattoos are a fitting subject for a museum dedicated to the
seafaring life because tattooing long has been associated with the
military, especially sailors.
	   The tattoo's popularity among sailors developed quickly after
the English explorer Capt. James Cook traveled to the South Pacific
in the 1760s.
	   James Banks, a scientist and sailor aboard Cook's ship, used the
native term ``tattow'' (to mark, or strike), to describe in his
journals the way Tahitian natives stained their bodies with
decorative marks.
	   Banks and other members of Cook's crew returned home with
tattoos. The practice grew, and by the 1800s getting a tattoo was
very much a part of being a sailor.
	   By the end of the 19th century, an estimated 90 percent of all
U.S. sailors had tattoos.
	   Sailors would visit tattoo parlors in port cities and even
tattoo each other aboard ship.
	   ``At first it was an exotic souvenir. Then tattoos began to take
on newer meanings,'' says museum curator Thomas Moore.
	   Sailors sported tattoos of roosters on their feet as charms to
protect against drowning and crosses to represent their Christian
faith, as well as the ever-popular anchor and other military
symbols.
	   Naked women also were popular images, prompting the U.S.
government to issue a flyer in 1909 warning that applicants with
obscene tattoos could be rejected by the military unless the
tattoos were altered. The cover of the flyer reads, ``Those Airy
Tattooed Girls _ Dress 'em Up, says Uncle Sam.''
	   But sailors weren't the only people drawn to tattoos.
	   Lady Randolph Churchill, Winston Churchill's mother, had an
image of a snake around one of her wrists. Queen Victoria also
supposedly had a tattoo.
	   Still, the practice flourished mainly in the lower echelons of
society. For many decades, Americans could obtain tattoos only in
port cities.
	   But while ``sailors took tattoos to port cities, carnivals took
tattoos out to the heartland,'' Moore says.

Influence of European culture lingers in Charleston
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ The European influence in
Charleston is remarkable in its subtlety.
	   Settlers from Spain, France and England in the 1500s brought
ideas more than objects.
	   Many homes, plantations, museums and churches retain those
influences, which sometimes conflicted with the pride of an
independent Charleston.
	   The Europeans who shaped the city wanted it to be a place of
their own, not a reprise of their homelands, says Anne Fox,
administrator at the Joseph Manigault historic home.
	   ``This was the new Republic, and they were really proud of their
Republic,'' she says.
	   Still, they carried many of their tastes and habits across the
Atlantic, and those cultural souvenirs still can be seen.
	   ``This is an English city,'' Ms. Fox says. ``When you've walked
about the streets downtown, you feel like you're in a European
city.''
	   The Manigault home is typical of the shared tradition. The
design came from Scottish architect Robert Adam and was brought
back to Charleston by Gabriel Manigault, who was of French origin.
Manigault built the home in 1803 for his brother, Joseph.
	   Ms. Fox calls it ``neoclassic with French influence.''
	   Wound around a circular staircase, the house brings together
elements of the new Charleston and classic European design. Porches
and high ceilings combine perfectly with delicately crafted window
frames and borders lining the light-colored walls.
	   There is a clock from Paris, dating to 1725. The silver
collection is primarily English. An elegant partition in the main
hall came from the Orient, and the dining room furniture was made
in Charleston.
	   T. Fairbairn, a tour guide at the house, says the Charleston she
has known since she was a child has always been a haven for myriad
cultures.
	   The European ones, she says, influenced, ``just about
everything.''
	   But Ms. Fairbairn says things have changed since her childhood,
when Chinese laundries were common and the Greek, Italian and
French presences seemed to be more prominent than they are today.
	   ``I think the people that have concerns, interest and power are
trying to keep the origins as much as possible,'' she says. ``It's
kind of impossible with all of the hotels and motels.''
	   Yet even as development encroaches, churches provide a sanctuary
for that multicultural past.
	   There is the French Huguenot Church, built in 1845, that houses
the only remaining independent Huguenot congregation in the nation.
There is a French service at the church each spring.
	   The former French Huguenot Church Rectory, a brick Georgian
structure, remains as it was when it served the church in 1871.
According to the Preservation Society of Charleston, the building
probably predates the American Revolution.
	   A block north is St. Philip's Episcopal Church that has anchored
Church Street since 1838. When Hurricane Hugo left the steeple
askew and its clock motionless in 1989, repairs included a trip to
England for the clock.
	   Low, pastel-colored residences lining much of Church Street
bring to mind the small towns in the South of France. Cobblestones
on nearby Chalmers Street are reminiscent of the streets that cut
through some of the oldest European villages.
	   It is this delicate resemblance to Europe that attracts
Europeans and keeps the history alive, says Guillaume Petin,
general manager of Beaumont's Cafe.
	   Petin, a native of France's Cote d'Azur, has spent most of his
life in the United States, first in New York City, then in
Charleston.
	   He says the French culture in the city is based on the past.
``It's not based on the French culture now.''
	   And those looking for a European experience often are attracted
to the bazaar on Market Street, the Saturday fruit and vegetable
market, and the quaint area between lower Church and Market streets
sometimes called the ``French Quarter.''
	   ``Europeans are used to having a center of town,'' Petin says,
``the heart of the city.''

Celebrate the millennium all year at sea

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Folks planning ahead for an extravagant party to
celebrate the New Year 2000 will be one-upped by a shipload of
adventurers setting sail for a year minus four days at sea
exploring the world.
	   A 361-day cruise to all seven continents, 55 countries and 103
ports will circle the globe three times. Available side trips
include an African safari and several islands that can only be
reached by rubberized motor craft.
	   The cruise aboard Ocean Explorer I leaves Athens, Greece, Nov.
19, 1999. Those who want to bail out early can debark in Trinidad
and fly to New York April 14, 2000.
	   Other shorter stays aboard can also be arranged, according to
the Toronto-based World Cruise Co., which owns the Ocean Explorer.
	   The company said prices for the 361-day cruise start at dlrs
35,947 per person (under dlrs 100 a day), based on double
accommodations.
	   For more information call 1-888-558-0887 or visit the Web site:

 &UR; Can one enjoy luxury at dlrs 5 a minute?
	   BEVERLY HILLS, California (AP) _ With a rack rate of dlrs 7,500
for one of two presidential suites, roughly dlrs 5 a minute for a
full 24 hours, the newly renovated Regent Beverly Wilshire is the
most expensive hotel in Southern California.
	   That dlrs 7,500 buys 5,000 square feet (464 square meters) of
luxury space including three bedrooms and 3 1-2 baths in the
hotel's contemporary Beverly Wing. If that's too steep for you,
dlrs 5,000 a night will get you into the two-bedroom presidential
suite in the classic Wilshire Wing. It has 1 less bedroom and
doesn't have the 1-2 bath.
	   ``The Regent receives the highest price in Southern California
for its presidential suites and the presidential suites are among
the best in the nation,'' says a recent publicity release.
	   The hotel, at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Rodeo
Drive, recently underwent a dlrs 35 million renovation and now
offers 120 suites among its 393 guest rooms.

 &UR; First smoke-free cruise liner to set sail
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Fresh-air fanatics now have their own
ship. America's first totally smoke-free cruise liner is about to
go into service.
	   Carnival Cruise Lines says not even the ship builders were
allowed to smoke on the Paradise, its new 70,000-ton liner. As for
passengers and crew, there will be no smoking. Period. Not even on
deck.
	   The dlrs 300 million ship, designed to carry 2,600 passengers
and 900 crew members, carries a large red nonsmoking sign on its
stern. It was delivered to Carnival in early November by
shipbuilder Kvaerner and will begin cruising the Caribbean from
Miami in late November.
	   Carnival president Bob Dickinson said the ban extends to the
line's fleetwide policy which prohibits smoking in dining rooms and
the main show lounge.

Trade dispute shows no sign of easing up at APEC meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Cabinet ministers from Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5
trillion in global trade, but Japan and the United States remained
deeply divided over a key provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and
fish _ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   The dispute between the world's two largest economies comes at
an embarrassing time for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, which was created nine years ago to promote free trade.
	   Leaders of the 21-member forum are to meet in Kuala Lumpur on
Tuesday and Wednesday for their sixth annual summit, and a tariff
cutting deal would be a landmark agreement for APEC.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff cuts in nine sectors
effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal of a free
trade area in the Pacific by 2020.
	   On Thursday and Friday, APEC officials were unable to resolve
disputes over the deal. On Saturday, they turned the issue over to
their countries' finance and trade ministers, who were scheduled to
meet for two days.
	   The group was considering compromise proposals that would water
down the pact by allowing nations a longer time to cut tariffs, or
allow them more flexibility in deciding which sectors to cover.
	   But the United States and Japan remained at odds on the forum's
liberalization pact, Japanese officials said Saturday.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Japan's
foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, met privately just before the
ministerial meeting began.
	   A Japanese government official quoted Barshefsky as saying that
not only does Japan refuse to open its forestry and fisheries
markets, it also is discouraging other APEC member nations from
moving toward trade liberalization.
	   Komura repeated that Japan can't cut tariffs on fishing and
forestry because they are politically sensitive sectors that could
shake the government's political base. Tokyo remains willing to
participate in the other seven sectors, he said.
	   Another official involved in Saturday's meeting said that Japan
was not budging from its stand and still trying to reach a
compromise with the 20 other APEC members that would preserve some
form of the agreement. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Other officials still seemed to hold out hope.
	   ``I am always optimistic. We will try to find a way out,'' said
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alata.
	   ``I hope APEC doesn't let trade liberalization down. It is the
number one priority on our trade agenda,'' said Andrei Denisov, the
director of Russia's department of economic cooperation.
	   On Friday, Barshefsky insisted the United States was willing to
compromise, but said any agreement must include Japanese
participation in all nine areas.

Oil spill in China threatens highly endangered white dolphins
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An oil spill in south China threatens the Chinese
white dolphins, a mammal already on the verge of extinction in the
waters off Hong Kong.
	   The spill, which occurred when two ships collided Friday, left
an oil slick about 10 kilometers (six miles) long and 5 meters to
50 meters (16 feet to 165 feet) wide off the mouth of the Pearl
River in Guangdong province, about 5 kilometers (three miles) from
habitat of the white dolphins, the China Daily reported Saturday.
	   The white dolphins are actually a bubble-gum pink in nearby Hong
Kong. They also are found off South Africa and Australia, where
their colors are blue, gray or green.
	   So few remain in the heavily polluted waters of south China and
Hong Kong that experts have predicted they will be extinct in a few
years. Hong Kong's new multibillion-dollar airport was built on an
island in the middle of dolphin habitat.
	   Research shows the dolphins are being killed by chemicals
discharged in China into the Pearl River, which runs through the
heavily industrialized province of Guangdong.
	   The oil was leaking from two 1,000-ton oil tanks on the Jinyou
No. 6 tanker, the newspaper reported. The other tanker was only
slightly scratched. No estimate of economic losses was immediately
available, the report said.

U.N. chief urges Saddam to take ``wise decision'' and cooperate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from China's ambassador, details on
council meeting, some diplomats saying U.S. airstrikes are
imminent; edits to trim &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has
urged Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to take ``a wise decision''
and resume cooperation with weapons inspectors before it's too
late.
	   After a 4 1/2-hour meeting Friday with the Security Council, he
said all 15 members ``stress the desirability of a peaceful and
diplomatic solution, but events on the ground may be running away
from us.''
	   The council scheduled another meeting Saturday afternoon,
primarily to focus on humanitarian issues.
	   Before Friday's meeting, Annan met with the ambassadors of
Russia, France and China who appealed to him to intervene to find a
diplomatic solution and avert U.S. airstrikes, which some diplomats
believe are imminent.
	   ``We still hope there will be a diplomatic solution but it
doesn't look like the U.S. is ready for a diplomatic outcome
according to our reading,'' Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon
said.
	   Hamdoon met Annan after the council meeting and said the
secretary-general planned to send a letter to the Iraqi government.
He said he didn't know the contents, but Western diplomats said it
would repeat Annan's urgent appeal to Saddam on Wednesday to resume
cooperation with the inspectors immediately.
	   Russian Ambassador Sergey Lavrov said Saddam told Russian
leaders Friday that he was ready to rescind Iraq's decision to end
weapons inspections.
	   But Saddam laid out several conditions _ that the council agree
to start a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions that would lead to the lifting of sanctions.
	   ``We believe that this is a constructive shift, which we hope
would be followed by a decision from Iraq in response to the appeal
by the secretary-general,'' Lavrov said.
	   But Iraq has laid out these conditions in the past, and it
wasn't clear what led Lavrov to believe there had been a shift in
Baghdad's stance. The Security Council has rejected Iraq's
conditions because it refuses to promise that sanctions will be
lifted at the end of a comprehensive review.
	   U.S. diplomats said they did not see any ``constructive shift''
in Saddam's position.
	   China brought a draft letter to the meeting reiterating
Wednesday's appeal by Annan, diplomats said, but this was overtaken
by Lavrov's contention that there had been a ``constructive shift''
in the Iraqi position.
	   Council members not directly involved with Iraq responded by
saying that Iraq had not said it was going to rescind its decision
to end inspections _ and only that would be a ``constructive
shift,'' Western diplomats said.
	   Annan's brief statement reiterated the council's non-negotiable
demand that Baghdad must immediately resume unfettered cooperation
with the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which is charged
with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   Annan did not mention any possibility of flying to Baghdad to
mediate, and diplomats said the idea of a trip to Iraq was never
mentioned. Because of the widespread belief that U.S. military
action is imminent, much of the debate focused on whether Annan
should telephone Baghdad or send a letter, diplomats said.
	   ``I would use this opportunity once again to urge President
Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi leadership to take the wise decision
of resuming cooperation with UNSCOM and (the) atomic agency,''
Annan told reporters. ``I hope that this appeal which has been made
by many people, many in the region and myself, will be listened to
by the Iraqi authorities.''
	   ``I hope they will be in a position to act, and act as soon as
possible,'' he said.
	   Annan reiterated the Security Council's offer to hold a
comprehensive review once Iraq resumes cooperation.
	   ``Once that is done, I trust the council will be in a position
to lift the sanctions,'' he said.
	   Hamdoon said Iraq appreciates Annan's efforts ``in trying to
find a diplomatic solution to the crisis.''
	   China's Ambassador Qin Huasen urged the parties to solve the
crisis through diplomatic means.
	   ``We are deeply concerned over the recent developments and
military threat,'' he said. ``We believe there's still some hope
for peaceful solution of the crisis.''
	   In his first public statement since the latest dispute over U.N.
weapons inspections, Saddam made it clear that nothing less than a
pledge to lift U.N. sanctions would end the standoff.

French president calls for diplomatic solution to Iraq crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac has called
for a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis, but said it was up to
Saddam Hussein's government to take the first step.
	   Iraq ``must say if it is ready to go back to the beginning and
engage in a diplomatic process,'' he told a news conference Friday,
the second day of an official visit to Mexico.
	   Chirac said any possible military action to force Iraq to allow
in weapons inspectors should have the support of the U.N. Security
Council.
	   As the United States prepares militarily for a possible strike,
France, Russia and China have been pushing to solve the latest
showdown through diplomacy.
	   Chirac, who heads to Guatemala on Saturday to begin surveying
damage from Hurricane Mitch, also called Frisay on Mexico to
implement a 1996 peace accord to end a simmering conflict with
indigenous rebels in the southern state of Chiapas.
	   The government signed the accord giving Indians a measure of
self government, but failed to enact it into law.
	   ``If the 1996 accords can be implemented into law, I think the
negotiating process can lead to a solution,'' Chirac said.
	   The Zapatista rebels staged a brief armed uprising in Chiapas in
January 1994, demanding greater democracy and Indian rights.
Periodic violence has erupted ever since, including the massacre
last December of 45 Tzotzil Indians by a pro-government
paramilitary squad.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac has called
for a diplomatic solution to the Iraq crisis, but said it was up to
Saddam Hussein's government to take the first step.
	   Iraq ``must say if it is ready to go back to the beginning and
engage in a diplomatic process,'' he told a news conference Friday,
the second day of an official visit to Mexico.
	   Chirac said any possible military action to force Iraq to allow
in weapons inspectors should have the support of the U.N. Security
Council.
	   As the United States prepares militarily for a possible strike,
France, Russia and China have been pushing to solve the latest
showdown through diplomacy.
	   Chirac, who heads to Guatemala on Saturday to begin surveying
damage from Hurricane Mitch, also called Friday on Mexico to
implement a 1996 peace accord to end a simmering conflict with
indigenous rebels in the southern state of Chiapas.
	   The government signed, 6th graf pvs.

New Jersey Devils win 4-3 over Pittsburgh Penguins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Randy McKay scored his second
goal of the game with 5:07 to play to lead the New Jersey Devils to
a 4-3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins on Friday night in referee
Paul Stewart's first NHL game since beating colon cancer.
	   Brian Rolston and Jason Arnott also scored as the Devils blew a
3-0 lead and lucked out on a couple of goal posts before winning
for the eighth time in 10 games.
	   Chris Terreri stopped 17 shots in winning his third game in as
many starts. A last-second pass through the crease by Jaromir Jagr
glanced off the goal post.
	   The night also belonged to Stewart, who was diagnosed with
cancer in February, underwent surgery in June and then
chemotherapy. He started his comeback with some work in the minor
leagues before making his reappearance in the NHL on Friday night.
 &UR; Rangers 3, Bruins 3
	   In New York, Dmitri Khristich scored with 1:22 remaining in the
third period to lead the Boston Bruins to a comeback tie against
the New York Rangers.
	   Don Sweeney intercepted a clearing pass from Ulf Samuelsson and
flipped a shot from the side boards that Kristich redirected with
his stick past Rangers goaltender Mike Richter for his seventh
goal.
	   Steve Heinze took advantage of a turnover by Niklas Sundstrom to
pull the Bruins within 3-2 with his sixth goal of the season at
13:31 of the third period.
	   John MacLean scored a pair of goals for the Rangers.
 &UR; Stars 5, Red Wings 1
	   In Detroit, Joe Nieuwendyk's goal just seven seconds into the
game _ the fastest in franchise history _ started Dallas to victory
over Detroit in a matchup of NHL Western Conference powers.
	   Nieuwendyk also had two assists in a four-goal first period for
the Stars, now 2-0 this season against the two-time defending
Stanley Cup champion Red Wings.
	   Derian Hatcher, Darryl Sydor, Grant Marshall and Mike Modano
also scored as the Stars won for just the second time in their last
21 games at Joe Louis Arena. Darren McCarty scored for Detroit,
which beat Dallas in six games for last season's conference title
before sweeping Washington in the Stanley Cup finals.

Graf upsets Hingis, joins Davenport, Seles and Tauziat in Advanta
</HEADLINE>
semis &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with Graf beating Hingis &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Unseeded Steffi Graf, already
rebounding from wrist surgery, overcome a sore leg Friday to beat
second-seeded defending champion Martina Hingis and move into the
semifinals of the Advanta Championships.
	   Graf defeated Hingis 6-2, 4-6, 6-0 after having to leave the
court momentarily for medical treatment on a pulled leg muscle.
When she returned, Graf regained command, allowing Hingis only
eight points in the final five games.
	   Graf will meet sixth-seed Nathalie Tauziat, who downed Amanda
Coetzer 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, in one semifinal up Saturday. No. 1 seed
Lindsay Davenport, the top-ranked player in the world, and
fifth-seeded Monica Seles, also winners Friday, will face off in
the other.
	   Graf's victory continues an impressive streak since returning to
the tour last week in the Leipzig Open after a two-month layoff
from wrist surgery. Graf beat Tauziat 6-3, 6-4 on Sunday to win the
tournament.
	   Davenport had to overcame a slow start to defeat Amy Frazier
5-7, 6-3, 6-3. A point away from being down a set and a service
break, the 22-year-old Davenport rallied to victory to ensure a
meeting with Seles in the next round of the dlrs 450,000 tournament
at Villanova University.
	   Seles had little trouble with her doubles partner, Natasha
Zvereva of Belarus, in a 6-0, 6-1 victory.
	   ``She played some great tennis,'' Davenport said of Frazier.
``Luckily it didn't continue.
	   ``I kind of toughed her out. That's something I've learned to
do. The better players when they're not playing their best have to
dig down deeper to pull it through.
	   Frazier was on a hot streak until meeting Davenport. She came
through qualifying, then beat Croatia's Iva Majoli and upset No. 7
seed Patty Schnyder of Switzerland to make the quarterfinals.
	   ``I know one set means nothing,'' Frazier said. ``(Davenport's)
a great player and it's never over with her. But I'm happy with the
way I played this week.''
	   So is Seles, who needed just 40 minutes to win her match.
Zvereva claimed she wasn't bothered by a strained left thigh which
was heavily wrapped.
	   ``I just got on Natasha from the beginning and played really
well,'' said Seles, avenging a crushing defeat to Zvereva at
Wimbledon. ``She never had a chance to get into the first set.
	   ``In the second set I didn't give her too many free points and
was able to win pretty easily. But Lindsay should be a really good
test for me,'' he added.
	   After splitting sets, Tauziat, a Wimbledon finalist this year,
gained the decisive advantage when she broke Coetzer's serve at 2-2
in the final set, then served it out. Tauziat screamed in delight
when Coetzer netted a backhand return on her third match point.
	   ``This was a tough match for me, because Amanda fights so
hard,'' said Tauziat, who like Graf, flew straight from Leipzig,
Germany to this tournament. ``I played pretty well, but I'm a
little bit tired.''

Trade dispute shows no sign of easing up at APEC meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Subs 13th graf, ``Another official...'' with 2 grafs to UPDATE
with Thai minister saying talks remain stalled.
 &UR; By DAVID THURBER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Cabinet ministers from Pacific Rim
nations met Saturday to discuss a deal to cut tariffs on dlrs 1.5
trillion in global trade, but Japan and the United States remained
deeply divided over a key provision, officials said.
	   The United States believes such a step to promote freer trade
would send a strong signal that Asian nations are not turning
inward, despite their worst economic crisis in 50 years.
	   But Japan has just as adamantly argued that it is in no position
to cut border taxes in two sensitive areas _ forestry products and
fish _ at a time when its economy is in recession.
	   The dispute between the world's two largest economies comes at
an embarrassing time for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, which was created nine years ago to promote free trade.
	   Leaders of the 21-member forum will meet in Kuala Lumpur on
Tuesday and Wednesday for their sixth annual summit, and a tariff
cutting deal would be a landmark agreement for APEC.
	   The original aim was to have the tariff reductions in nine
sectors effective by 2002, as a start toward APEC's ultimate goal
of a free trade area in the Pacific by 2020.
	   APEC officials who met in Malaysia last Thursday and Friday were
unable to resolve disputes over the deal. So on Saturday they
turned the issue over to their countries' finance and trade
ministers, who were scheduled to meet for two days.
	   The group was considering compromise proposals that would water
down the pact by allowing nations a longer time to cut tariffs, or
more flexibility in deciding which sectors to cover.
	   But the United States and Japan remained at odds on the forum's
liberalization pact, officials said.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Japan's
foreign minister, Masahiko Komura, met privately just before the
ministerial meeting began.
	   A Japanese government official quoted Barshefsky as saying that
not only does Japan refuse to open its forestry and fisheries
markets, it also is discouraging other APEC member nations from
moving toward trade liberalization.
	   Komura repeated that Japan can't cut tariffs on fishing and
forestry because they are politically sensitive sectors that could
shake the government's political base, the official said on
condition of anonymity. Tokyo remains willing to participate in the
other seven sectors, he said.
	   Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan said Japan was not budging
during Saturday's talks, and that little progress was made during
the morning session. He also said that some officials wanted to
turn the discussion away from the stalled free-trade pact and spend
more time discussing Asia's financial crisis.
	   On Friday, Barshefsky insisted the United States was willing to
compromise, but said any agreement must include Japanese
participation in all nine areas. ``Token participation...by the
world's second largest economy doesn't cut it,'' she said.

Philippines to push `multilateral diplomacy' in Spratlys conflict:
</HEADLINE>
Estrada

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Saturday the Philippines will urge nations claiming the Spratly
Islands to come together to resolve the dispute.
	   Estrada, who is scheduled to meet Chinese President Jiang Zemin
in Malaysia next week during a meeting of Pacific leaders, said the
Spratlys would top the agenda in the meeting.
	   The Chinese have expanded their structures on the Spratlys,
believed rich in oil and other natural resources and also claimed
by Manila.
	   ``We will use multilateral diplomacy. It will not be just the
two of us talking to each other. All the claimants will have to
talk about this,'' he said in his weekly radio program.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.
	   But Estrada said the Philippines had no intention of starting a
confrontation.
	   ``We cannot take on China whatever we say, so we should not
provoke or be confrontational. Let us do it through diplomacy,'' he
said.
	   Last week, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with Beijing for
the construction of large barracks on Mischief Reef, which the
Philippines believes could be easily put to military use.
	   China says the structures are shelters for Chinese fishermen and
the construction photographed by Philippine reconnaissance planes
was just repair work.
	   The Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam belong to the
regional grouping, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations,
along with Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Myanmar and Laos.
	   A 1992 declaration by the ASEAN called for peaceful settlement
of the conflicting claims and joint development of the Spratlys.
	   A 1995 accord between the Philippines and China called for
building confidence on both sides by not stirring further
controversy over the Spratlys.
