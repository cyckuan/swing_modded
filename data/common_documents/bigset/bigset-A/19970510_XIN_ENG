<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries achieved a positive
economic growth of 4.3 percent in 1996 over the 2.1 percent of the
previous year, a U.N. report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report, the first ever released by the U.N. Economic and
Social Commission for West Asia (ESCWA) after a two-day
ministerial meeting in Beirut, said that in the Arab world Syria's
economy was the fastest to grow at a rate of 5.9 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwait's economy achieved a growth of 5.7
percent. Oman and Jordan witnessed a 5.2 percent economic growth,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's economy grew by 4.9 percent, Yemen by 4.7 percent,
Lebanon by 4 percent and the six states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council by an average rate of 4.1 percent, the report added,
</P>
<P>
No world was made about the situations in Iraq and the Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
However, it predicted that the average growth rate of the Arab
economies would slow down to 3.7 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
It said oil prices of the world, economic reforms in the
Arab countries and developments of the Middle East peace process
will greatly affect the economic performance of the countries in
the region in the rest months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Positive developments in the peace process will encourage
foreign and local investments and lead to an increase of
imports," the report underlined.
</P>
<P>

report quoted preliminary assessments as saying that Bahrain,
Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates lowered their
deficits to less than 1.5 percent of the total output value in
1996.
</P>
<P>
The ESCWA pointed out that in spite of the remarkable economic
growth in the last year, the unemployment was still a major
problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
The highest unemployment rate, 28 percent, was in the West bank
and Gaza strip because of a high population increase and a border
closure imposed by Israel, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Yemen, among the Arab countries, suffered the worst inflation
of 25 percent in 1996, which was followed by Syria 20 percent,

CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
Tarawneh arrived here today on a two-day visit for talks with his
Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa on efforts to push forward the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement upon his arrival, Tarawneh said he was carrying
a verbal message from King Hussein of Jordan to Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak within constant consultation between the two
countries, but he did not reveal the content, Egyptian MENA
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It was Tarawneh's first visit to Egypt since he took office

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Progress Made with King Hussein </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu said today progress has been made on the water dispute
during his overnight secret meeting with Jordan's King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu flew to the Jordanian resort city of Aqaba Thursday
night to hold the unscheduled meeting with King Hussein to
discuss ways of resolving the dispute over distributing the
Jordan River water and reviving the stalled Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan and Israeli Infrastructure
Minister Ariel Sharon, who is in charge of water matters, also
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In today's weekly cabinet session, Netanyahu described the
Aqaba meeting as "positive and useful". He added he and King
Hussein agreed that water experts from both sides would meet in
the coming days to sort out the differences on the water issue.
</P>
<P>
The crisis erupted when secret talks held in Tel Aviv early
this week between Israeli and Jordanian water officials broke
down over differences in interpreting the 1994 peace treaty
concerning the issue of water sharing.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace treaty, Israel should allocate 50 million
cubic meters of water to Jordan immediately after the
agreement's signing, and another 100 million cubic meters
through international-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
The treaty also called for the solution of water dispute within
one year.
</P>
<P>
Israel said it had already allocated 50 million cubic meters
of water to Jordan, and is insisting that the remainder should
come from desalinization and a new dam. Jordan is demanding
Israel's serious fulfillment of the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
The dispute led to the cancellation of a scheduled Tuesday
meeting between Netanyahu and Hassan in the border enclave of
Naharayim, where they were to attend a memorial ceremony for the
seven Israeli schoolgirls killed by a Jordanian border guard on
March 13.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Hussein also canceled a visit to Israel
scheduled for next month to receive a honorary doctorate from
the famous Israeli technological university of Techion in
Haifa.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, the second Arab country to sign peace treaty with
Israel, has been complaining about the lack of tangible economic
benefits from its peace with Israel. And the current crisis in
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process fanned further discontent
in Amman, a major Arab mediator in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians collapsed
after Israel started construction of Jewish housing in Arab East
Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> France Renews Appeal to French Nationals to Leave Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- France today renewed its appeal to
French nationals staying in Zaire to leave the country
immediately, and welcomed the result of the mini-summit of central
African states on Zaire held Thursday in Libreville.
</P>
<P>
"We renew our appeal to all French nationals who are not for
indispensable purposes in Zaire to quit the country," said French
Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He added that the declaration issued at the regional summit in
Libreville "holds our attention because it opens the new
perspectives of orderly and peaceful transition (in Zaire),
founded on a normal functioning of institutions."
</P>
<P>
The six African heads of state, including President Mobutu Sese
Seko, called on Zairian political parties to elect a parliament
speaker who will lead the country in a transitional period before
the holding of free elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the European Union's commissioner for humanitarian
aid, Emma Bonino, said today at a press conference in Barcelona,
Spain, that Zaire has returned to a state of barbarity in which
international humanitarian aid workers are subjected to great
dangers.
</P>
<P>
She blamed the rebels of Laurent-Desire Kabila for "ridiculing
and scorning" humanitarian workers, because they don't want people
to witness their atrocities against refugees.
</P>
<P>
She said that 96 Europeans, most of them humanitarian workers,
have been killed so far in the war in Zaire, and called for the
creation of a "humanitarian passport" allowing members of
non-governmental organizations to move around freely in Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-four refugees were drowned today in the Zaire-Congo
River after two over-loaded boats carrying the refugees trying to
enter Congo collided with each other.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The anti-Taliban forces claimed
today that they have captured 100 Taliban fighters in the fighting
along the strategic Salang Highway north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Fighters loyal to the ousted government's military commander
Ahmad Masood took hilltop and valley positions in the highway,
reports reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
"We cut off some Taliban on the road and captured around 100 of
them," the reports quoted a Masood's spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban soldiers admitted losing some ground but claimed
they held off a potentially crippling attack by foiling a
mountain-top advance towards the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
They said only three of their fighters were taken prisoner.
</P>
<P>
The Salang highway links Kabul with northern Afghanistan and
central Asia, and its close proximity to a key opposition valley
stronghold means Taliban advances here have so far been repelled.

TOKYO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's economy in May is still on a
recovery trend, which signals the country's economic expansion for
the 43rd month running, a report issued by Japan's Economic
Planning Agency (EPA) said today.

"The economy is continuing its recovery move. Although the
tempo of the recovery was gradual, private-sector demand was
firm," the EPA said in a monthly report submitted to the cabinet.

It added that there was a "change" stemming from the April 1
increase of the consumption tax, charged on most goods and
services, from three to five percent.
</P>
<P>
The corporate capital spending showed a tendency of recovery
and industrial output, especially vehicles, iron and steel and

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian security
officials held talks today in Tel Aviv to discuss ways of
security cooperation between the two sides, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the first between the two sides in weeks,
was held at the Embassy of the United States in Tel Aviv and
attended by officials from the Israeli General Security Service
(GSS) and the Palestinian Preventive Security Forces, as well as
representatives from the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday following a meeting with Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat, Israeli President Ezer
Weizman announced that the PNA had agreed to resume security
cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, PNA officials later explained that any
Israeli-Palestinian security meeting would request the presence of
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the Palestinian side was headed by Jibril
Rajoub and Mohammed Dahlan, chiefs of the Palestinian Preventive
Security Forces in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
But GSS Chief Ami Ayalon was noticeably absent.
</P>
<P>
Both political and security contacts between Israel and the
PNA stopped in March after Israel started to build a
controversial new Jewish neighborhood at Har Homa (Jabal Abu
Ghneim) on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks resume, while Israel is insisting that the PNA crack
down on terrorism and reestablish full security cooperation with
it.

<HEADLINE> 3 US Sailors Charged With Raping Australian Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Three American sailors were
remanded in custody in a Perth court today, facing a charge of
raping a 15-year-old girl in a hotel room two days before their
warship was due to leave.
</P>
<P>
The sailors from the visiting aircraft carrier USS
Constellation were charged with 15 sexual offenses against the
girl in the inner-city Princess Hotel on Monday, according to
local TV reports.
</P>
<P>
Damian Hargrave, 19, Darrell Benson, 20, and Timothy Tolbert,
24, appeared in the court of Perth and were remanded in custody
until May 19 when they will apply for bail.
</P>
<P>
The commanding officer had ordered the three to remain on
Garden Island until the West Australian police sexual assault unit
had completed their investigation. The warship left the island
Wednesday without the three sailors, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The sailors were arrested and charged yesterday, he said.
</P>
<P>
The sailors will be held at Perth's Canning Vale remand center
until their next court appearance.
</P>
<P>
The US consulate general in Perth is believed to be making
arrangements for their bail application.

<HEADLINE> House Speaker Calls for Return of "Family Hour" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Speaker of the U.S. House of
Representatives Newt Gingrich has urged broadcasters to revive
"family hour" programming, as a study finds that the first 60
minutes of prime time is full of vulgarities and sexual innuendos.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the heads of the major broadcast networks,
Gingrich suggested a return to general-interest programming
between 8 p.m. and 9 p.m. -- the family hour segment of prime
time.
</P>
<P>
"This voluntary covenant with the viewing public has
disintegrated to the point where the former family hour now
features sitcoms and dramas promoting promiscuity and obscene
language," wrote Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a study released Thursday by the Media Research
Center of one month of prime-time shows during the 8 p.m.-9 p.m.
hour found almost one-third of the programs contained foul
language or suggestive sexual remarks or situations.
</P>
<P>
The study was cited as another argument in favor of legislation
encouraging the TV industry to establish a code of conduct.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 House and Senate members have signed a petition urging
the networks to bring back the family hour.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the National Association of Broadcasters declined
to comment on the report.

<HEADLINE> Tripartite Meeting to Address Working Conditions  in Hotels, Catering, Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 80 delegates representing
workers, employers and governments will have a tripartite meeting
next week in Geneva to discuss ways to further improve working
conditions in the industries of hotels, catering and tourism.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting to be held at the International Labor
Organization (ILO) headquarters in Geneva from May 12 to 16, the
delegates will be presented with an ILO report, New Technologies
and Working Conditions in the Hotel, Catering and Tourism Sector.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates cited in the report, over 200 million
people, nearly 11 percent of the global workforce, were either
directly or indirectly employed in the hotel, catering and tourism
industries in 1995, a figure that is expected to rise to nearly
340 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
China and South Asia account for over half of all travel and
tourism workers, with nearly 108 million employed. The combined
figure for Australia, Japan and New Zealand is around 8 million.
In the European Union, over 18 million are employed in this
sector. In North America, there are 16 million employees in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the sector produced 10.9 percent of the world's gross
domestic product and contributed 1.6 trillion U.S. dollars in
wages and salaries, according to the World Travel and Tourism
Council.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2010, tourism, measured in terms of international
arrivals, is expected to double to more than 1 billion. Forecasts
of international tourism suggest the fastest growth in East Asia
and the Pacific, followed by South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Major features of work in the sector include low wage growth,
overtime, irregular working hours (for example, nights and
weekends) and the part-time or seasonal nature of much hotel,
catering and travel work, the bulk of which is done in small to
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The report says that this leads to high levels of employee
turnover, which is "certainly one of the most important
difficulties faced by employers and employees alike in the
sector."
</P>
<P>
These factors, combined with the challenge of new technologies
and increasingly diversified services, mean that higher salaries
are increasingly on offer for skilled workers in modern, well
equipped hotels, kitchens and travel agencies, while wages for
less skilled workers stagnate.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that workers organizations are thus concerned
that productivity improvements "may not translate into
improvements in employment and working conditions or could lead to
reductions in salary and job opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it says, employers stress that new technologies can
"raise the skill profile of the labor force, and allow a flatter
organization of enterprises, thus empowering more workers."

<P>
PARIS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac and
visiting Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima today agreed upon "the
absolute necessity" for European Union (EU) countries to launch
its single currency, euro, on schedule.
</P>
<P>
French presidential spokesperson Catherine Colonna said that
the two leaders agreed that the European monetary union should
rally as many European countries as possible, under the condition
that they meet the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Klima, who is former finance minister of Austria, said that
Austria is committed to the building of the European economic and
monetary union, said the spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that France and Austria "are on the same
track" of working toward a compromise in negotiations of the
Intergovernmental Conference of the EU on the reform of the EU
institutions.
</P>
<P>
France wishes a tightened EU institutional structure to make it
more efficient, while Austria prefers a compromise between the
reduction of EU commissions and the concern of smaller EU
countries to be represented.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told Klima that British Prime Minister Tony Blair has
promised him in a telephone conversation this week that London
will fully participate in the debate over European construction.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that France will also help ratify an agreement
on the admission of Austria into the Schengen convention on free
trans-frontier movement in Europe.

PARIS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Zairian rebel leader Laurent-Desire
Kabila has asked a French humanitarian official to supervise the
repatriation of Hutu refugees to Rwanda and provide
recommendations on it, reported the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the gesture by Kabila is aimed at improving
relations with France, which has been very bad since the beginning

<HEADLINE> Iraq Seeks Support from Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia today expressed its sympathy
with Iraq under economic sanctions after its foreign minister held
talks visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tarik Aziz.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Moscow, Aziz met Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Maksimovich Primakov, the second time in two months.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said that Russia appreciates Iraq's willingness to continue
"constructive cooperation" with the U.N. Security Council to pave
the way for the lift of U.N.-imposed oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was expelled out of the international oil market in August
1990 when its troops invaded neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.N. Security Council should consider
prolonging the validity of the resolution 986, which enabled Iraq
to export limited amount of oil to pay food and medicines bills.
</P>
<P>
Iraq resumed its oil export last December. According to the
resolution, Iraq can export oil worth up to 2 billion U.S. dollars
in six months to buy necessary food and medicine. The resolution
expires by June.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stopped over in Moscow on his way back from a visit to
China.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been seeking support from Russia, one of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Aziz visited Russia and held talks with Primakov only two
months ago after Russia proposed that restrictions on Iraq's oil
export be lifted this year.
</P>
<P>
Russia also expressed the hope that its economic relations with
Iraq would be further strengthened after the lift of the
sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Stresses Cooperation of Mutual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIBREVILLE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
stressed here today that China and Gabon should develop their
cooperation of mutual benefit in various areas in line with the
internationally accepted practice, so as to push their friendly
relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
At a brief press conference jointly held with Gabonese
President El Hadj Omar Bongo here this morning, Li Peng said
China and Gabon are both developing countries and both have
arduous tasks of economic construction.
</P>
<P>
He said China had provided economic aid to African countries
including Gabon, but the amount was modest and a big increase is
not likely in the future. Therefore, he said, new ways of
cooperation between China and African countries need to be
explored under the new international situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the model of purely giving economic aid should be
gradually changed into a model of cooperation in multiple forms
so that the scope of economic and trade cooperation between China
and African countries could be expanded to benefit the immediate
and long-term interests of both parties.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said he and Bongo agreed during their talks that their
two countries will develop cooperation in agriculture, fishery,
timber processing and trade.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the main problem confronting Africa is to
speed up development under conditions of stability. "There exists
now an unjust political and economic order in the world and the
gap between the north and the south is becoming increasingly
wide. I have a deep impression that Africa has rich resources
which provide it with many favorable conditions for development,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his confidence that the African economy will be
reactivated through the efforts by people in various countries in
the continent and cooperation with other regions in the world. He
said China is willing to participate in such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the brief press conference, Bongo said he had paid eight
visits to China and is now pleased to welcome the Chinese premier
to come to his country, which he said demonstrates the good
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said his talks with Premier Li Peng covered issues of
bilateral cooperation in such areas as road construction,
agriculture, public health, fishery, timber processing and
pharmaceutical production. He said bilateral cooperation in such
areas embraces good prospects.
</P>
<P>
Africa is now confronted with many problems but the main one
is how to speed up development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, "If we can engage in construction under normal
conditions of stability and have enough funds for developing our
resources, we can solve the problem of economic development
conveniently. With the development of the economy, peace can be
guaranteed. The conflicts in some areas in Africa have impeded
development in the continent and this problem should be
resolved."

<HEADLINE> SAARC Foreign Secretaries Prepare for Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The foreign secretaries
of the seven member countries of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC) ended their two-day meeting after
preparing groundwork for what will be decided at the grouping's
summit next week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, Maldivian deputy foreign
minister Solah Shihaab gave little details of what had been
discussed at the foreign secretaries' meeting, but said they were
doing some "necessary preparatory groundwork" for the leaders of
the SAARC member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers, which begins its two-day meeting
tomorrow, will follow up the activities and the leaders of the
member countries will make decisions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of criticism about what SAARC may have
achieved. We are trying to address that," he added.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC summit will be held in Male on May 12-14.
</P>
<P>
He also said the foreign secretaries discussed in detail how to
make SAARC more effective through making the group's secretariat
streamlined and more functional so that it can play a more
effective role in providing and coordinating assistance to the
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Shihaab said all the seven countries are firmly committed to
the SAARC process and do not want any deviations to affect SAARC
unity and solidarity. There is total agreement among them, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said SAARC's Inter-Government Expert Group will meet in
Bhutan next month to help determine what needs to be done to
improve the process of the South Asian Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA).
</P>
<P>
SAARC launched SAPTA in 1995 in its first step towards creating
a free trade zone in the region -- the South Asian Free Trade Area
(SAFTA) by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The group will "look at what are the factors that need to be
addressed to move in that direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in December 1985 to promote regional cooperation,
groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan
and Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> APEC Trade Ministers Meet in Montreal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREAL, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Trade ministers of Asia and Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) met here today in a bid to further
facilitate trade in the vast region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was officially kicked off today, is the
first in a series of ministerial meetings that Canada will chair
to advance preparations for the APEC Leaders' Meeting in November.
</P>
<P>
At the plenary session this morning, the delegates discussed,
among other things, simplification of customs procedures.
</P>
<P>
Some suggested that APEC member economies adopt a kind of
business travel card so as to facilitate business travel in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also touched upon the region's infrastructure
sector, according to a media briefing by the Canadian side.
</P>
<P>
The region's infrastructure market is estimated to be worth 1.5
trillion U.S. dollars in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, APEC trade ministers are expected
to focus on their individual and collective plans for trade and
investment liberalization and begin to identify possible sectors
for early voluntary liberalization.
</P>
<P>
APEC ministers responsible for trade have met jointly with
foreign affairs ministers once annually since November 1989. In
addition, they have begun meeting semi-annually to sustain the
momentum toward APEC's goal.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1989, the APEC forum is a group of Pacific Rim
economies working together to promote open trade, investment and
economic and technical cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It comprises 18 member economies -- Australia, Brunei
Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the
Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New
Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Members Urged to Abide by Production Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Issa Mohammad
al-Mazidi today called on OPEC member countries to abide by their
production quotas in order to stabilize world oil price.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti minister said that "Members of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries should honor the decisions to be
made at the upcoming session of the OPEC oil ministers and try
not to be swayed in the direction of sudden surge of demand and
supply on the oil market."
</P>
<P>
Al-Mazidi made the statement while attending a seminar in the
ancient city of Isfahan on Middle East oil and gas on the
threshold of the third millennium.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian, Nigerian, Libyan, Qatar, Kuwait and Venezuelan oil
ministers were attending the seminar.
</P>
<P>
On the upcoming session of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna, he
said possible higher ceiling is a subject to be discussed at the
session and it is hard to predict what would turn out in the end.
</P>
<P>
He said the fluctuation of oil prices is likely to continue,
and Kuwait is keen on attaining a definite level of oil price,
which would be favored both by producers and consumers.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that based on facts
and figures aired at the OPEC production supervisory committee
session, many OPEC members do not observe their official
production quota and violate the devised limit.
</P>
<P>
The report said that OPEC members have risen their production
ceiling up to 2.2 million barrels per day from 2.1 million
barrels per day, some 25 million barrels more than the official
quota in total.
</P>
<P>
Some OPEC members have even increased their production up to
more than 27 million barrels per day, the report asserted without
giving names.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Vazri, director of Klinorth Benson Company, predicted
that under normal oil market conditions, oil price would be forced
down in the next two years in view of the overproduction both by
OPEC and non-OPEC oil producers.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Middle East might not be capable of
maintaining its status by the next 10 or 15 years, unless changes
were seen in its policies.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that OPEC should pay attention to such issues as
absorption of domestic and foreign investments, speedy growth of
demand in East Asia and contribution to world's dynamic economy.
</P>
<P>
The financial condition and regulations in the Middle East
region need improvement so as to attract foreign investment and
import related technology, he said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Sells Arms to 73 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African government has
sold arms to 73 countries, including Russia and the United States,
the Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
A list of countries released by South Africa's Defense Ministry
does not include nations that the United States accuses of sponsoring
state terrorism, SABA said.
</P>
<P>
Those which allegedly have been practising "state terrorism"
include Iran, Iraq, Libya and Syria.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic row erupted between South Africa and the United
States early this year when Denel, the South Africa state-owned arms
manufacturer, tried to sell Syria military equipment to upgrade its
tanks.
</P>
<P>
South Africa earned 314 million U.S. dollars from arms exports
in 1995 alone, SABA said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Germans Remain World Champion in Alcohol Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Germans are still the world
champion in drinking alcohol, with each of them consuming about 12
liter pure alcohol every year on average, German media reported
today.
</P>
<P>
According to a study of the Guttempler-Ordens, an association
campaigning worldwide against alcohol abuse, there are about 3.5
to 4 million German people who are suffering from alcoholism at
present, and 500,000 among them are youngsters.
</P>
<P>
About 40,000 to 50,000 people in Germany died from
alcohol-related cirrhosis of the liver every year. In comparison,
the annual death toll for illegal drug abuses in Germany stands at
only about 3,000 people, the Guttempler said.
</P>
<P>
To combat alcoholism in the country, the group called for
establishment of alcohol free zones in areas such as youth
centers. It also demanded a sharp reduction in prices of
alcohol-free beverage.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU) should be actively involved in resolving
conflicts in the southern African region rather than live the
Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) to go it alone.
</P>
<P>
This was said today by OAU Head of Conflict Managedment Division
Chris Bakwesegha when he addressed SADC ministers of defence,
security and foreign affairs in Harare.
</P>
<P>
''SADC, as a member of the OAU and U.N. should establish a
partnership with these organisations,'' said Bakwesegha.
</P>
<P>
''This partnership should not be used to marginalise others, but
to shared responsibilities and vision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The regional ministers are meeting to negotiate and draft a
protocol on politics, defence and security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Bakwesegha said there should be effective networking and resources
management among the organisations for the benefit of people of
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the same meeting, Regional Researcher Ibbo Manadaza
said the SADC Organ on Politics, Defence and Security is faced with
many challenges.
</P>
<P>
''There is a need at this stage to manage the economic and
political issues differently,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The organ, established last June under the chairmanship of
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, seeks to enhance and maintain
peace in the region.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A 25-member French business

<P>
The ambassador said the delegation of the Confederation of

Most of the companies represented in the delegation have an

</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the visit is prompted by the celebration

<HEADLINE> Iraq Grunts with Turkey on Joint Maneuver with U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 9 (Xinhua) - Turkey should not help the United
States realize its containment policy towards Iraq by deciding to
join the U.S. and Israel in military maneuvers east of the
Mediterranean, an official Iraqi newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The Arabic Ath-thawra daily, mouthpiece of the ruling Arab
Ba'ath Socialist Party, asked Ankara to refrain from participating
in the joint navy exercises scheduled for this summer, and to make
use of its geographical advantage and historical links to further
develop its political and economic relations with Arab States.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's involvement in the military exercises would deeply
harm Turkish relations with the Arab states, the newspaper
warned.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite sea war games were part of the U.S. strategy to
enhance its military presence in the region to contain Iraq, Iran
and Syria, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish involvement in the war games would arouse "a great
deal of concern and seriousness" among the Arab countries, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Early on Thursday, Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf
said in a statement that the games were a "provocative and hostile
action against the Arabs and Muslims."
</P>
<P>
The exercises were also an "insult to the Arab Mediterranean
countries whose sovereign rights are still usurped by Israel," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister lashed out at Turkey for its decision,
saying the involvement of Muslim people in war games with Israel
"is an action out of the ordinary."
</P>
<P>
He called upon Ankara to reconsider its participation in the
war games.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's criticism coincides with a current visit by Turkish
Minister of Energy and Natural Resources Recai Kutan to Baghdad
for talks on a projected Iraqi-Turkish oil pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have argued that the joint maneuvers "will be
of a humanitarian nature and focus on search-and-rescue scenario."
</P>
<P>
They dismissed the reports that the planned war games were
aimed at Iran and Syria, two long-time foes of Israel.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Reduces Taxes in Mining Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania has
reduced taxes in the mining industry in a move to boost local
and foreign investment in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Minerals Minister Abdallah Kigoda told reporters
here today that effective today tax on imported mining equipment and
supplies has significantly been reduced.
</P>
<P>
He said export tax and stamp duty have been scrapped off from
proceeds of minerals sold abroad, while taxes related to profit and
capital expenditure have been reviewed.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said the fiscal changes were being adopted as a strategy to
boost the contribution of the mining sector to the country's gross
domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
He, however, said the fiscal measures were still inconsistent with
the government's revenue needs.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the measures were drawn up by his ministry in
collaboration with the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA), the Treasury
and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
He said import duty, sales tax and excise duty exemption for mining
equipment and supplies directly related to the operations of the
project would be granted up to one year after the start of production.
</P>
<P>
"Thereafter import duty and sales tax will be limited to five
percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda said there would be a full sales tax exemption for purchases
of inputs for products that were meant for exports. "This will prevail
even after introduction of the Value Added Tax (VAT) system in the
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced exemption from domectic withholding tax
to mineral rights holders on goods and services supplied by them.
"They will, however, be subjected to withholding tax on domestic goods
and services purchased by them," he clarified.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will move in the national assembly the bill
listing the new fiscal measures in the mining sector during the budget
session scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed Tanzania has proved to be a viable
destination for investment in the mineral sector, taking into account
its abundant reserves of gold, diamonds and many other base metals.
</P>
<P>
"In order to beneficially exploit this potential, it is imperative
that a conducive and enabling environment be created.
</P>
<P>
"The government is no striving to do that to facilitate productive
and efficient operations as well as to build up the confidence of
local and foreign investors," the minister added. enditem

<HEADLINE> Bank Robberies Sharply Increase in South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 164 bank robberies have
been committed in South Africa this year, netting robbers more than
30 million Rand (6.81 million U.S. dollars), according to statistics
released by the Council of South African Banks (COSAB) on Friday.
</P>
<P>
COSAB head Bob Tucker said this reflected a projected increase of
25 percent in the number of robberies since last year.
</P>
<P>
Some 105.3 million Rand (23.93 million U.S. dollars) was stolen
in bank robberies in 1996. A further 10.3 million Rand (2.34
million dollars) was stolen from automatic teller machines and in
after hours thefts from banks.
</P>
<P>
The total monitary loss had increased by 38 percent from 1995
figures, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's bank robbery statistics rank among the highest in
the world. Only 250,000 Dollars were lost in branch robberies in
Britain during 1996, Tucker revealed.
</P>
<P>
Tucker said he had met Safety and Security Minister Sydney
Mufamadi over the increasing bank robberies.

<HEADLINE> British, Dutch Prime Ministers Meet in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's new Prime Minister Tony
Blair held talks with his Dutch counterpart, Wim Kok, here today
to exchange views on the coming European Union (EU) summit to be
held in Amsterdam next month.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing after the talks, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook said that the Labor government was being
taken seriously once more in Europe after it abandoned the
"sterile and negative" attitude of the previous Conservative
government.
</P>
<P>
"I now believe that it will be possible for us to reach an
agreement in Amsterdam," Cook said. "I'm happy to tell you that
we're already making substantial progress to getting our
objectives."
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Prime Minister Kok, whose country is
holding the rotating EU presidency, said that a number of "burning
issues" remained to be resolved before a new treaty could be
signed at the Amsterdam summit.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that all sides should make concessions by
saying, "Without compromises... there will be no treaty of
Amsterdam. We call upon the political will of all member states to
compromise."
</P>
<P>
It would be impossible for the 15-nation bloc to admit new
members from Eastern Europe without a new treaty, which would
redefine some EU powers and reform its institutions, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Labor government's decision to sign the EU's Social
Chapter, Kok said that it was an enormous step forward.
</P>
<P>
"It would really have been impossible to come to further
agreement on all the other issues... so this is already something
to be very happy about," he said.

<HEADLINE> No Progress Made in Ross' Shuttle Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu told his cabinet today no progress was made in talks
with Dennis Ross, special U.S. Mideast coordinator, on renewing
the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu said
that "the possibility of renewing negotiations (with the
Palestinians) is still being examined."
</P>
<P>
Ross held talks today with Netanyahu and Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, and he is due to meet for the second
time in two days with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat later today.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy's visit came a day after Israeli President Ezer
Weizman met with Arafat at the Erez checkpoint between Israel and
the Gaza Strip Tuesday, in an effort to break the deadlock in the
talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks came to a halt in March
after Israel started to construct a new Jewish neighborhood at Har
Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim) on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Ross Thursday, Netanyahu reportedly
spoke mainly of Israel's security demands and its insistence on
the building of 6,500 homes for the Jews at Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat told Ross in Gaza Thursday that there must be a
halt to settlement building before peace talks resume.
</P>
<P>
This had pointed to Ross' failure to narrow the gap between the
two sides, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ross said after meeting Arafat that "we are looking at all
matters to see what can be done to find ways to restore
confidence, which is really crucial if we are going to be able to
put the peace process back on track."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians reportedly made clear that they were not
willing to accept the Har Homa project in return for any
concessions.
</P>
<P>
There were speculations that concessions would include building
more homes for the Palestinians in Jerusalem or the restoration
of permanent resident status to those Palestinians who left
Jerusalem to live elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Those Palestinians entitled to return to live in the holy city
were said to number more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
Another concession would possibly be to expand the announced
first phased 2 percent Israeli redeployment from Area C in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to placate the Palestinians outraged at the
settlement expansion, Israel announced in March a decision to
withdraw troops from 7 percent of Area B and 2 percent of Area C,
still falling far short of the Palestinian expectation.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians claimed the first phased Israeli redeployment
should be 30 percent of the Israeli-controled Area C and the Area
B jointly policed with the Palestinians in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ross, on his third shuttle diplomacy in the region in less than
two months, is scheduled to go to Egypt and Jordan over the
weekend in an attempt to seek help for reactivating the deadlocked
peace process.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Women Lack Reproductive Knowledge: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 98 percent of Ethiopian
women in their prime age lack the knowledge of their reproductive
activity, Ethiopian Minister Tadelech Haile-Michael said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a gathering here in connection with the
International Nurse Midwives Day, the minister in charge of
women's affairs at the Ethiopian prime minister's office said
lack of access to education and health services leads most
Ethiopian women to frequent and unwanted pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
Tadelech said most Ethiopian women also lack employment
opportunities, property ownership rights and are denied
participation and decision making on matters directly affecting
their survival.
</P>
<P>
She, however, said that measures are being taken by the
government and non-governmental bodies to remedy the situation
especially to address the need of maternal health by providing
health facilities.
</P>
<P>
"In order for women to gain from the improved health policies
and services, their opportunity to use the available facilities
and other access to information on reproductive health must be
regarded highly," she added.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Health said malnutrition,
early marriage, abortion and other causes of health disorders
mainly affect women in Ethiopia. He called on government and
non-governmental organizations and professional associations to
implement the women's health policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Africans were urged to abandon
the severe physical and psychological damage circumcision
inflicted on African women.
</P>
<P>
The call came from Nahid Toubia, a Swedish public health
expert at a world net discussion between Addis Ababa, Ndjamena
and Freetown on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a report here today, Toubia underlined the need
to devise a system to raise public awareness on the traditional
harmful practice, saying that schools have a big role to play in
raising awareness of young women on the dangers of circumcision.
</P>
<P>
She also called for an integrated international effort to curb
the harmful practice.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics available, about two million young
girls suffered the genital mutilation each year and about 120
million African women have already been mutilated for life.

<HEADLINE> Conservation Experts on Illegal Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries
pushing for limited trade in ivory did not have sufficient
controls to prevent illegal trade, conservation experts said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In a survey conducted by a panel of experts from a wildlife
monitoring fund, three southern African states, Namibia, Botswana
and Zimbabwe are seeking permission to have the international ban
on ivory sales, which in force since 1989, waived so they can
sell their ivory stockpiles to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Experts said Japan should not be considered as a recipient of
any resumed sales of ivory because its controls are incapable of
differentiating between legal and illegal ivory, and the country
continues to be the destination of illegal shipments.
</P>
<P>
The request to lift the ban will be considered at next month's
meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered
Species in Harare, capital of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that although the three countries have
managed their elephant herds reasonably well, neither Botswana
nor Zimbabwe is in a position to control or regulate the sale of
their stockpiles.

<HEADLINE> Swazi PM Defends Govt's Media Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland Prime Minister
Sibusiso Dlamini today defended his government's new media policy
as a necessary means to ensure the media to serve the interests
of the public.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini announced last week that his government was planning
to formulate an editoral policy for the state-owned media.
</P>
<P>
At a function to congratulate local media award winners in the
capital Mbabane, Dlamini denied any intention to impose
censorship on the media, pledging it should remain free, reported
the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
The planned policy, which would affect the country's radio and
television media and the Swazi Observer newspaper, has been
sharply criticised by all Swazi journalists as a government move
to censor the media.
</P>
<P>
Dlamini said, however, the media, having the considerable
power in shaping the views and behavious of the people, should
always keep in mind its responsibility for responsible, honest,
accurate and unbiased reporting.
</P>
<P>
To this end, there was a need for government to formalise its
approach to achieving this uniformity, said the Prime Minister,
adding there was definitely a need in the media for editorial
policy so they can respect the public they serve.
</P>
<P>
"This is not muzzling the media," said Dlamini.

<HEADLINE> IRA Leaders Urge Probe in N.Irish Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), today called on
the British government to investigate the beating to death of a
Roman Catholic man by pro-British Protestant mobs.
</P>
<P>
Adams told the BBC radio that Britain's new Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam should investigate the killing in the bitterly
divided town of Portadown, 40 km south of Belfast, the capital of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"What I am calling for is for Mo Mowlam to authorize an inquiry
into that incident and I am calling for the RUC officers involved
to be suspended from duty pending the outcome of that inquiry,"
Adams said. The RUC, or Royal Ulster Constabulary, is Northern
Ireland's police force.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin McGuinness also told the BBC
that Irish people expected Labor to apply "new thinking, new
language, new imagination to the search for peace" in the British
province.
</P>
<P>
A group of protestants beat two Catholic nationalist men
fatally on April 27 in Portadown and one of them died Thursday
night in a Belfast hospital.
</P>
<P>
Police explained they were outnumbered by the mobs in the
incident until they could get assistance. They also said they have
already questioned some people about the attack, which was the
latest in a spate of sectarian attacks in Northern Ireland, where
the IRA is fighting against the British rule of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The IRA hopes the newly elected Labor government could boost
the peace process in Northern Ireland, but the government said
Sinn Fein will not be allowed to join the peace talks unless IRA
guerrillas abandon their fight against British rule.

<P>
KINSHASA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zairian government confirmed
this evening that violent fighting was going on between government
troops and rebels in the region of Bandundu on the axis between
Kinshasa and Kenge, a town 200 kilometers east of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Information Kin-Kiey Mulumba said that the Zairian
Armed Forces (FAZ) operated from River Wamba, west of Kenge, and
forced the rebels to "fight to withdraw up to Kenge."
</P>
<P>
He said that 88 rebels and three FAZ soldiers were killed in
the fighting, and that the rebels sent three planes from eastern
Zaire to evacuate their wounded and abandoned the bodies of their
dead in the field.
</P>
<P>
Western sources said that 85 rebels and 15 FAZ soldiers were
killed in Thursday's fighting alone.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Zairian government is doing all it
can to hold the front against the rebels, and that all "useful
measures have been taken to ensure the security" in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
On the perspective of a second meeting between President Mobutu
Sese Seko and the rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila, he said that
it would go forward as part of the plan conceived by United
Nations envoy Mohammed Sahnoun.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the regional summit on Zaire held Thursday in
Libreville was "the logic follow-up of the meeting of
Pointe-Noire" between Mobutu and Kabila Sunday on a South African
navy vessel anchored at the Congolese port.

<HEADLINE> Pope's Visit Triggers Controversy in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Pope John Paul II will arrive here
Saturday for his first ever visit to the Mideast country amid a
controversy among varied religious sects.
</P>
<P>
Christian and Muslim leaders have aired conflicting views on
the visit, giving rise to fears about further division in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is the only Arab country where the Christian population
matches the Muslim one. The state power has been shared by
different sectarians.
</P>
<P>
Maronite Christian Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said here
today that the visit by the 77-year-old Pope would serve to
affirm the importance of coexistence of different confessions and
religions.
</P>
<P>
"The Holy Sea comes to say that this nation deserves to live,
and this nation has proved the ability of its own to live freely,
sovereignly and independently," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Walid Jumblatt, a leftist leader of Lebanon's Druze
minority, launched a scathing attack on the "rightwing leanings"
of the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt, also a minister in Premier Rafik Hariri's
government, said the Pope's visit was "ill-timed" because the
"climate (in Lebanon) is electrified."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the visit "will fuel sectarianism on both
Muslim and Christian sides."
</P>
<P>
"Why the visit now? Was his visit to Bosnia successful? What
influence does the Pope have on the Maronite Church here?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Jumblatt has long been critical of the Christian Maronite
community from which Lebanon's heads of state always come.
</P>
<P>
Muslim leaders usually hold the portfolios as Parliament
speaker and prime minister in the country.
</P>
<P>
It is feared that the controversy, in case of gaining momentum,
might cast shadow on the Pope's tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The British government said today it
intended to replace the prime minister question sessions held
twice every week with just one session.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said new Prime Minister Tony Blair hoped
to change the 15-minute sessions Tuesday and Thursday to a single
30-minute session Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Blair believed "this will produce far more effective scrutiny
of the prime minister," one official said.
</P>
<P>
But Conservatives, now in opposition after 18 years in power,
reacted angrily at what they saw as an attempt by Blair to give
himself an easier ride.
</P>
<P>
Former Prime Minister John Major said it was sensible to
consider improvements but Blair should have consulted first with
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that PMQs is a burden to any prime minister. But
that is the point of it. It makes the prime minister directly
accountable to parliament. The size of the government's majority
in the House at present makes that accountability more important
and not less," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But government officials said Blair had informed Major and
Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown of the changes but did not
consult them.

</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation
Mission registered three violations against Kuwaitis last
month. However, no details were given.
</P>
<P>
The demilitarized zone stretches along a 240-kilometer land and
sea border between the two countries and extends five kilometers
into Kuwait and 10 kilometers into Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mulla explained that no military personnel are allowed
inside the five-kilometer demilitarized zone except policemen who
are also not allowed to carry heavy weapons.
</P>
<P>
There are 50 farms in the demilitarized zone. Farm owners are
allowed in while farm workers also given permits to go inside the
area after passing through certain procedures, Al-Mulla said.
</P>
<P>
Al-Mulla earlier this month ruled out any possibility of
removing the Kuwaiti border farms into the inlands in response to
a request by the parliamentary Agricultural Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said "any action at removing such farms will be rejected
because it will go against Kuwait's sovereignty over her
dominions."
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti border security administration's duties are to check
infiltration cases and monitor the security situation in the
demilitarized zone, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq sent troops to its bordering Sheikhdom in 1990, triggering
off a devastating war against Baghdad by the U.S.-led western
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has so far refused to forgive Iraq for the military
incursion with no sign in sight of resuming ties between the two
neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Police Urged to Maintain Law and Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
today called on law enforcement agencies to maintain law and
order during the countdown time to the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
The president asked the Kenyan police to be extra vigilant and
curb unlicensed political rallies as the countdown to the general
elections begins, the Kenyan News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking in Kakamega, northwestern Kenya, where he
helped raise more than five million Kenyan Shillings (about
90,000 U.S. Dollars) in aid of the Kakamega High School.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that some politicians in the country might choose
to ignore the law and convene unlicensed meetings, Moi advised
opposition parties convening political rallies to have their
meetings licensed.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the opposition parties in the east African
country are planning to hold a series of meetings, some of which
are unlicensed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the role of the police is to maintain law and
order at the licensed rallies.
</P>
<P>
At the fund-raising occasion, the president suspended all fund
raising meetings during the voter registration exercise which is
to start on May 19.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the exercise which is scheduled to end on
June 22 is so important that no other functions should be mixed.

CAIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs from
Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The UN Economic and Social Commission for West Asia
said that the Arab economies achieved 4.3 percent growth in 1996,
up from 2.1 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Syria's economy was the fastest to grow at a rate of 5.9
percent while the Gulf Arab countries witnessed an average 4.1
percent economic growth.
</P>
<P>
However, unemployment is still a serious problem besetting the
region, the commission said in a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Kuwaiti Oil Minister Tssa Mohammad Al-Mazidi called
today on OPEC member countries to abide by decisions to be made by
their organization so as to stabilize oil prices.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian official said meanwhile that some OPEC countries
were violating their production quotas set by the organization,
pumping out millions of more barrels of oil per day.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official predicted that oil prices might be forced
down if there is no change in oil policies.
</P>
<P>
ALGIERS -- A national symposium on research and use of solar
energy will be held in the Algeria's capital in a bid to raise
fund for the solar system.
</P>
<P>
Algeria has an area of over 2 million square kilometers where
sun rays run some 2000 hours a year.
</P>
<P>
It has actually embarked on financing a project for the
generation of electricity through solar energy in southern Algeria
where more than 20,000 families reside.

AMMAN -- The European Union decided to grant Jordan some 66
million US dollars this year in confirmation of the EU political
and economic support for the Kingdom, said an EU official today.
</P>
<P>
About 50 million dollars of the grant will be allocated for
bolstering up the Jordanian economic reform program, the official
said.
</P>

<HEADLINE>   E.U. Decides to Grant $66m to Jordan in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has decided to
grant Jordan 66 million U.S. dollars to help the kingdom tide over
an economic recess and contribute to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The current grant, although 9 million dollars less than last
year, came in confirmation of Jordan's drive to fight economic
woes and remove obstacles hampering Arab-Israeli peace talks, said
Yvis Ghazo, chief of a visiting EU mission, here toady.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Jordan's official News Agency, Petra,
the EU official said that about 50 million dollars of the grant
would be allocated to shore up Jordan's economic reform program
and, especially, help the country balance its payment.
</P>
<P>
Some 8 million dollars of the EU grant was earmarked for
boosting the Jordan's exports, which mainly flow to Saudi Arabia,
Syria and Kuwait, according to the EU official.
</P>
<P>
The EU would also plan to help peace reach the ordinary people
by channeling its grant into the civilian institutions in Jordan,
a country that ever helped bring about the Hebron accord between
Israel and the Palestinians in January.
</P>
<P>
The EU would like to see the establishment of friendly ties
among different peoples involved in the peace process and to
enable them to live, work and trade with each other in a secure,
harmonious atmosphere, Ghazo noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the grant would contribute to regional cooperation
and enhancement of women's role in economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, scarce of natural resources and without major
industries, has been for decades relying on foreign aids and
foreign currency remittances from the Jordanians working abroad.
</P>
<P>
Since the Gulf crisis in the early 1990s, Jordan's economy has
been ravaged for most of the traditional contributors turned away
on Jordan's close ties with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
As the Gulf crisis ended in 1991, Jordan distanced itself from
Iraq and began to make efforts to reactivate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Among the major aid-providers for the kingdom are the United
States, the EU, Saudi Arabia and Japan.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Continue to Surge Strongly in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Britain continued to
grow strongly in April, with sale volumes expanding at the fastest
pace since last November, raising the possibility of a further
increase in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said Thursday in
its monthly distributive trades survey for April that a positive
balance of 42 percent of retailers reported higher sale volumes
than a year ago, compared with only 33 percent in March and 24
percent in February.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said that the growth was expected to continue at a
similar pace this month.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 15,000 retailing, wholesaling and motor trade
companies said that furniture and carpet retailers, booksellers,
hardware, grocers and clothing shops reported the sharpest rises
in sales.
</P>
<P>
The result of the survey backed the new Chancellor of the
Exchequer Gordon Brown's decision to raise interest rates by 0.25
percent earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts warned that if the trend of rising consumer demand
continued, the Bank of England may be ready to exercise its new
powers over the level of interest rates once again in the coming
month.

<P>
LIBREVILLE, Gabon, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier

talks today, both believing that Chinese premier's first trip to
Gabon would effect a long-term cooperation and promote the common
development of the two countries.

countries, Obame-Nguema said.
</P>

Li Peng said that his talks with President Bongo was fruitful
and the two leaders had identical or similar views on many
issues. In the new situation, the two countries are required to
seek new ways of cooperation by strengthening specific
cooperation in forestry, fishery and resources development, on
the basis of equality and mutual benefit. He was confident that
the two countries could pioneer new channels to bring closer the
economic relations and enrich and invigorate the two-way trade
and economic cooperation, thus accelerating their common
development.

HONG KONG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Australians Jason Harper and
Jackie Gallagher won the men's and women's open titles
respectively at the 1997 Nautica ASTC International Triathlon Race
here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Competing for the first time in Hong Kong, Harper broke away
from the leading group on the run and won the event in one hour 26
minutes nine seconds.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's hot newcomer Kris Gemmell was second in 1:26:47
and Australia's Jason Metters, runner-up in last year's race,
finished third in 1:26:59.
</P>
<P>
Also in her first appearance in Hong Kong, reigning world
champion Gallagher led all the way in the women's open category to
win in 1:36:30, followed by compatriot Belinda Chency in 1:38:49
and China's Xing Lin in 1:40:02.

Under horrific weather conditions, some 250 athletes from 13
countries and regions braved the torrential downpour and made
their way over the course, which included 1.5 kilometers'
swimming, 30 kilometers' cycling and 10 kilometers' run.
</P>
<P>
As the bad weather was going to make the cycling leg of the
race pretty dangerous, the organizers decided to shorten the leg
by 10 kilometers to 30. The Olympic Games standard distance for
the leg is 40 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Demands Balanced U.S. Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
warned today that any U.S. proposal for reactivating the stalled
Mideast peace talks should not tip towards one party while
disregarding the other.
</P>
<P>
Following talks between U.S. Peace Coordinator Dennis Ross and
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Sharm el-Sheikh, Moussa told
reporters that Ross presented "a number of ideas" on reviving the
Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Those ideas are "not an integrated visualization or an already
crystalized initiative," he said, adding that Ross will hold
talks with the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in a bid to reach
that.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. coordinator flew to the Egyptian Red Sea resort this
morning as part of his renewed rescue-peace diplomacy since
Wednesday that so far appeared to make little headway.
</P>
<P>
Using measured words, the top Egyptian diplomat called
the U.S. role "quite necessary" but cautioned that it has to be
fair.
</P>
<P>
"The American side as a key mediator should come up with a
balanced solution and take into consideration the dangers felt by
the two parties and not by only one party," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross did not speak of any results as his shuttle has not come
to an end, neither Moussa gave any details about the
U.S. initiative. The ideas are still under study, the Egyptian
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Active contacts are underway, but final results have not yet
crystallized," Moussa said, adding that the proposals presented
by Ross on reactivating the Palestinian-Israeli talks are being
discussed by the two sides and consulted with Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting, Ross said that he described as
"fruitful" the discussions with Mubarak and briefed him on
aspects of his mission to surmount obstacles blocking the peace
process and to get it back on its right track.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of Egypt's effective role in the
peace process, the U.S. envoy said that "it was necessary to come
to Egypt and meet Mubarak."
</P>
<P>
Ross, who has been shuttling between Israel and Palestinian
self-rule areas in the past two days, stressed that he works with
both parties to bring the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's Political Advisor Osama el-Baz, who was present at
the meeting, told reporters that the U.S. is aware of "the present
impasse in the area" as a result of the stalled peace process and
has come to understand more of a European role.
</P>
<P>
Whether or not there is a need for an initiative, however, he
said, depends on the contacts to be held by Ross in the coming
fews days.
</P>
<P>
Making his third trip to the region in less than two months,
the U.S. envoy met twice with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
in Gaza and held talks with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks broke down two months ago after
Israel started the construction of 6,500 houses for Jews on a
hilltop in Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected Israel's offer to build housing
for East Jerusalem Palestinians and to discuss speeding up talks
on building a seaport and opening an airport in Gaza as part of a
compromise to revive peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, in a move likely to anger Palestinians, told his
cabinet Friday that Israel will act to strengthen Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish
state, has been acting as an important mediator in the peace
process.

<P>
SHANGHAI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who is here to continue his China trip, delivered a
speech here today, expressing his thanks to the Chinese government
and people for their support and contributions to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing some 300 local scholars and university students, he
said that China will continue to have a politically important role
to play in the Organization and in the world.
</P>
<P>
Describing Shanghai as a new city, Annan, who visited Shanghai
in 1984, said that new buildings are going up everywhere, and
there is a palpable sense of dynamism. "This really is a city on
the move," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many states look with admiration towards China's remarkable
social, economic and cultural achievements," he said, adding,
"since your market-oriented reforms began in 1978, your average
annual growth rate has averaged over nine percent per year."
</P>
<P>
"That is why people in developing countries see in China an
encouraging example," he said, adding that in addition to China's
political influence, her role as an economic engine-house has
engaged the interest of the world.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China's political weight and economic
dynamism give her "a unique opportunity to play a distinctive role
in the shaping of the post cold-war political order."
</P>
<P>
On globalization, the UN chief said that developing countries
have participated extensively in the acceleration of global
integration, and they are receiving more direct foreign investment
and taking an increasing share of world trade.
</P>
<P>
"China has greatly benefited from the global economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan noted that there is no alternative to the United Nations
as an instrument for joint action by states. "But, if it is to
perform effectively and efficiently, the United Nations will need
to be strengthened. That is why we have embarked on the reform
process," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China has a long-standing commitment to south-south
cooperation, he said, adding that China has provided generous
support to developing countries in the form of capital investment,
and the provision of experts, fellowships and other training
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
This evening, Shanghai Vice-Mayor Chen Liangyu met with Annan,
who flew here from Xi'an at noon.

<HEADLINE> Revenue Losses from Software Piracy Increasing in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Revenue losses from software piracy
in the Philippines increased by 77 percent to hit 71 million U.S.
dollars in 1996 as the piracy rate rose from 91 percent to 92
percent.
</P>
<P>
This was in stark contrast to the overall drop in the piracy
rate in the Asia-Pacific region, which declined by 9 percent to 55
percent in the same period, the Philippine News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the above were the findings of a new
independent study of global software piracy by the Business
Software Alliance and the Software Publishers' Association.
</P>
<P>
The latest study just underlined how much work remained to be
done in the Philippines, says Ron Eckstrom, vice president of the
Business Software Alliance, a worldwide piracy watchdog.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, the watchdog intensified its anti-piracy
campaigns in the Philippines. In a recent press conference held in
the country, it called on the public to help stop the rampant
theft of copyrights and launched a series of reward campaigns.
</P>
<P>
The study also showed that of the 523 million new business
software applications in use throughout the world last year, some
225 million units -- nearly one in every two -- were pirated.
</P>
<P>
This represented a 20 percent increase over the 1995 estimate
of 187 million units, although revenue losses decreased to 11.2
billion U.S. dollars, the study said.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The suburban branch of Jingshan
School, China's first full-time public school sponsored by a
non-governmental entity, celebrated its anniversary this week,
with its operation methods highlighted by education experts here.
</P>
<P>
Located in the city's northern suburbs, the affiliate of
Jingshan School in downtown Beijing, was jointly funded by the

sponsored by the Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Though uninvolved in the school's operation, the Fazheng
company has invested 160 million yuan in the infrastructure of the
school.
</P>
<P>
The affiliate school with an area of 10 ha started its first
academic year on September 1, 1996, and has enrolled more than 300
students.
</P>
<P>
Cui Mengming, president of Jingshan School, said that the
affiliate school now is the sister school of the Alsace School of
France, and has established long-term cooperation with Newton
Public School in the US.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhaoguang, vice mayor of Beijing, said that to pursue
financial support from companies with the administrative function
of government unchanged could be a good solution to the money
shortage in the city's primary and middle schools.

<P>
SHENZHEN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people are likely to
enjoy three additional holidays in the second half of 1997, when

</P>
<P>
The bill, introduced by the Chief Executive's Office of the

legislature. It will get through a confirmation process
immediately after the founding of the HKSAR on July 1, 1997, and

<HEADLINE> First Consignment of Medicine Arrives in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The first consignment of medicine
bought under a memorandum of understanding with the U.N. has
arrived in Baghdad, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
INA quoted an unnamed Health Ministry official as saying that
four trucks loaded with more than 61.5 tonnes of various drugs
reached the Iraqi capital Friday.
</P>
<P>
More shipments of medicine are expected to arrive in the coming
days, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iraqi-U.N.memorandum known as "oil-for-food" deal
signed last May, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars
worth of oil over six months on a renewable basis.
</P>
<P>
The oil sales are designed to exchange for food and medicine
urgently needed in the country, which was severely hit by
sanctions imposed by the U.N. in 1990 after Iraq invaded Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since the oil-for-food agreement went into effect last
December, Iraq has been complaining about the slow speed of
implementation, particularly in regard to medicine supply.
</P>
<P>
Health Minister Omed Medhat Mubarak said Friday that of the 550
contracts for medicine Iraq submitted to the U.N. for approval
only 86 were given the green light so far.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad accused the U.S. of obstructing the approval process.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has requested the U.N. for doubled oil sales of 4 billion
dollars for another six months when the oil-for-food memorandum
expires in June.
</P>
<P>
However, the renewal of the deal must be approved by the
15-member U.N. Security Council upon recommendation by
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.

<P>
-- A retired school teacher was arrested Tuesday this week in
Nevers, central France, for having raped dozens of school girls
over the past 30 years. The latest rape he committed took place a
few weeks ago. The inquiry into the case was triggered by the
accusation by one of his former pupils -- a 27-year-old
police-woman who committed suicide soon after she filed the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States Friday sent 116 155mm cannons to the
Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation, despite the risk of resumption of
war in Bosnia between the Serbs and the federation. The artillery
pieces, which are of the strongest type, were delivered under the
program of "equipment and training" decided unilaterally by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:

<P>
-- Fifteen days from the holding of the legislative elections
in France, the duo-debate between Prime Minister Alain Juppe and
Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin is dominating the legislative
campaign. Other political parties of both the right and left
camps have criticized the two men for "hegemonism" in the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meet U.S. Mideast Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today met with U.S. Mideast coordinator Dennis Ross, who has been
shuttling between Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who flew to the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh this
morning, is also expected to meet with Egyptian and Jordanian
foreign ministers Amr Moussa and Fayez Tarawnah in a bid to seek
their help to reactivate the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross' visit to Egypt came as part of his shuttle diplomacy
that so far appeared to make little headway.
</P>
<P>
Making his third trip to the region in less than two months,
the U.S. envoy met Palestinian National Authority President Yasser
Arafat in Gaza twice and held talks in Jerusalem with Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
As Ross acknowledged after three hours of talks with Arafat
Thursday that there were "difficult problems to solve," Israeli
and Palestinian officials also played down Ross' mission.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a late night meeting with Ross in Ramallah
Friday, Arafat said no progress is made to promote the deadlocked
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have rejected Israel's offer to build housing for
East Jerusalem Palestinians and to discuss speeding up talks on
building a seaport and opening an airport in Gaza as part of a
compromise to revive peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, in a move likely to
anger Palestinians, told his cabinet Friday that Israel will act
to strengthen Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, stone-throwing Palestinians battled
with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank Friday in clashes that
underscored the hardships facing Ross' rescue-peace mission.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks broke down two months ago after
Israel started construction of 6,500 houses for Jews on a hilltop
in Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with the Jewish
state, has been playing an important role in mediating between the
parties concerned.
</P>
<P>
However, President Mubarak and other senior Egyptian officials
haved repeatedly expressed frustration over the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
They urged Israel to change its policy of settlement expansion
and contribute to the resumption of peace talks.

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Raise Oil Prices by One Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) has decided to cut production and
raise oil prices by one U.S. dollar, an official report said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio quoted Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh as saying "the OPEC meeting was instrumental
in raising the oil prices by one dollar per barrel."
</P>
<P>
The report said that the decision was made at a meeting of
OPEC Production Supervision Committee held in Iran's ancient city
of Isfahan, 435 kilometers south of the Tehran, which came to an
end Friday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian, Nigerian, Libyan, Qatar, Kuwait and Venezuelan oil
ministers attended the session.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister said that the representatives of all
the member states expressed concern and worries about the
existing excess production and over-supply in the oil market.
</P>
<P>
He said that the committee gave him the responsibility of
conveying the decisions to those countries which did not take
part in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the oil price increase measure would be
instituted toward curbing the oversupply upon the agreement of
all the OPEC members.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, Kuwait Oil Minister Issa Mohammad al-Mazidi called
on OPEC member countries to abide by their production quotas
in face of the pressure on world oil price.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwait minister said that "members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries should honor the decisions to
be made at the upcoming session of OPEC oil ministers and
try not to be swayed in the direction of sudden surge of
demand and supply on the oil market".
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that based on
facts and figures aired at the OPEC production supervisory
committee session, many OPEC members do not observe their
official production quota and violate the devised limit.
</P>
<P>
The report said that OPEC members have been producing over
their ceiling by 2.2 million barrels per day to reach more than 27
million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Vazri, director of Klinorth Benson Company, predicted
that under normal oil market conditions, oil price would be
put under pressure by the next two years in view of the
extent of oil production both by OPEC and non-OPEC oil
producers and there would be a surplus in supply of oil
compared to its demand.
</P>
<P>
However, Vazri said, one should be careful that the Middle
East might not be capable of maintaining its status by the
next 10 or 15 years, unless changes were seen its policies.

<HEADLINE> Computer Market Sees More Rigorous Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The competition in China's
fledgling PC market is heating up for computer makers, domestic
and overseas, as the domestic PC sales surpassed that of overseas
companies last year and thus triggered a nation-wide price war.
</P>
<P>
The US computer firms have taken the lead in the new round of
market competition. DEC, one of the largest US PC makers, launched
a roadshow in major Chinese cities last Thursday, with the first
stop in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Chan, president of the PC division of DEC (China) Co.,
said that the company introduced a full range of computer products
including the latest model desktops, laptops, and servers. The
show will also be held in Shanghai, Wuhan, Xi'an, and Nanjing
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Chan said that the China roadshow is being held simultaneously
with the US exhibition, which indicates DEC's close interest to
the emerging PC market here.
</P>
<P>
China's PC companies sold more than one million computers on
domestic market in 1996, with their market share increasing to 56
percent, topping the overseas rivals for the first time, To pursue
its own market advantage, DEC retreated from the family-used PC
market and fixed its focus on the commercial PC products. As a
reward, the company's sales volume reached 80,000 PCs in China
last year, up 37 percent over that of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two PC sales leaders, China's Legend Group and
IBM of US, have strengthened their market exploitation of the
rapidly rising PC demand in the country.
</P>
<P>
IBM launched a roadshow in eight Chinese cities since last
Tuesday; and Legend signed a cooperation agreement with Microsoft,
the global leader of software industry, to install the Windows 95
operating system to the mainstream Legend products.
</P>
<P>
Other major PC manufacturers, including China's Great Wall and
Tongtru, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard of US, and Toshiba of Japan,
are also considering new product launches in China.
</P>
<P>
According to industrial analysts here, though the PC market is
not fully expanded yet, its potential capacity will always be an
attraction to the computer makers from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Electronic Industry said that the capacity of
the domestic market for PCs will stand at six million to eight
million machines in the year 2000, with the sales volume
approximately 40 billion to 50 billion yuan. These figures
represent one of the fastest growing rates for PC markets in the
world.

<HEADLINE> All Issues of Common Concern Would be Discussed at </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALE, the Maldives, May 10 (Xinhua) -- There would be no agenda
for the May 12 meeting between the prime ministers of India and
Pakistan, but they will discuss all issues of mutual concern, a
senior Indian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Salman Haidar, India's foreign ministry secretary, told Xinhua
that he had had a number of brief exchanges with his Pakistani
counterpart Shamshad Ahmed in the past two days on matters
concerning the bilateral summit meeting, but they had no
"structural discussions."
</P>
<P>
Haidar said there would be no agenda for the meeting between
Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif. The meeting, which will be held on the
sidelines of a summit of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation (SAARC) to be held in Male on May 12-14, would be the
first between the prime ministers of the two countries in four
years.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on the prospects of the meeting, but
added, "We expect the meeting to provide the occasion for the two
prime ministers to meet and discuss all matters of mutual
interest."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Shamshad said on Thursday that the two prime
ministers would discuss the whole range of outstanding issues
between the two countries, including the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Haidar also expressed the hope that the bilateral summit
meeting would create a "congenial atmosphere" for future talks in
a constructive manner and contribute to the improvement of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Asked when the next round of the foreign secretary-level talks
will take place, Haidar said no date had been decided, but some
details of the talks would become clearer after the summit.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary-level talks between the two countries
were resumed in New Delhi in late March after a break of three
years. The next round would take place in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan, who is
attending a meeting of the SAARC's Council of Ministers comprising
the foreign ministers of the seven member countries, said the
Kashmir issue must be discussed at the bilateral summit.
</P>
<P>
There is no quick fix for the dispute, but it must be settled,
Khan said, adding that a move has to be made towards the "core
issue" of Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Pusan Cheers For Second East Asian Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- As the fireworks blew up and blossomed
overhead, hundreds of Pusan teenagers flew to the Kudok Stadium with
shining colorful satinette as the second East Asian Games unveiled its
curtains here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the mottos of "Peace, Unity, New East Asia", 788 students in
yellow and white, including 48 members of the municipal dance group,
queued up a map of South Korea and depicted scenes of the sea and
earth with rivers and plains by rolling the satins up and down.
</P>
<P>
Nine skydivers flew in the stadium with colorful ballons
representing the participating delegations for the 10-day sports
gathering where some 1,800 athletes and officials will vie for the 201
gold medals at stake.
</P>
<P>
In A Day of Joy, a mass callisthenics of six hundred lassies waves
their slim arms, kicked up slender legs and jumped to the pinpointed
spots for a full-scale scenery of "WELCOME" in Korean and English
versions as the stadium turned into an active volcano to welcome the
power of the 1.5 billion East Asian people.
</P>
<P>
With the sonorous sound of a band, athletes marched in along the
track in a sequence of Macau, Mongolia, Japan, China, Kazakhstan,
Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Guam and the hosts South Korea as the
courtside electronic screen transmitted brief shows depicting the
colorful folkway, scenic spots, traditional sports and industries
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The torch was carried into the Kudok Stadium by a disabled athlete
in armchair and relayed to paddler Ryu Nam-kyu and runner Kwon
Sun-jung who ran to the platform through two queues of lassies in
white satin before Paek Sung-yon, a budding Korean girl student in a
primary school, ignited the Sacred Flame on a rotating crane to the
cheers and applauses of the enthusiastic audience.
</P>
<P>
As the athletes corps paraded away, drums and the band returned
back to induce the festive atmosphere with a harmonious sound as a
shout of hope for the brighter future.
</P>
<P>
The sword dance created images by shiny steel plates and jangling
sound as the reflection of sunlight began to stripe the dark space of
the Orient and the Orient began to make motion with no sign of
violence and aggression, symbolizing cosmic harmony of all beings in
the universe.
</P>
<P>
Five hundred Korean youths performed their traditional martial art
of Taekwondo by jumping up and kicking off thin wooden plates overhead
to manifest the "Dynamic Power of the Orient".
</P>
<P>
"In a Day of Festival", three hundred Pusan children running and
cheering on the ground with Mandarin ducks, colored fans and saddle in
a traditional Korean wedding ceremony, symbolizing the seeds which
unfold their beautiful, pure dreams as a promise of the revival of the
human civilization.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred of lassies in red and green aboarded "the Ship of the
Orient", starting its voyage toward the future, as colored balloons
flew over the stadium and long satins fluttered in a harmonious chorus
with the audience and the people in East Asia.

<HEADLINE> HK Law Amendments Fully Respect Public Opinion: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Public opinions to the
Consultation Document on Civil Liberties and Social Order are
fully listened to and respected, a spokesman for the Chief
Executive's Office of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the Provisional Legislative Council
(PLC), Secretary for Policy Co-ordination of the SAR Chief
Executive's Office Michael Suen told the PLC members that over the
three-week consultation period, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa and
his colleagues had met over 70 representatives from all walks of
life and organized two briefings.
</P>
<P>
On April 9, the Chief Executive's Office published the
consultation document to solicit public opinions on the proposals
to amend the Societies Ordinance and the Public Order Ordinance
under the resolution of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"The public response to the consultation document has been very
encouraging and forthcoming. We will fully consider their
concerns and make appropriate amendments to the original
proposals, so that a balance could be struck between civic
freedoms and social stability, individual rights and social
responsibility, personal interest and public interest," he said.
</P>
<P>
He made some explanations to the PLC members concerning the
definitions of National Security, Political Organization and
Foreign Connections which are contained in the Consultation
Document.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Consultation Document is in line with both
the Basic Law and the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, as well as the interests of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the basic direction put forward by these
proposals will be able to strike a suitable balance between the
respect for civil liberties and the maintenance of social
order. There is no intention to inhibit civil liberties or the
establishment of political organizations, or the rights of certain
societies and political bodies," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said amendments will be made to the proposals according to
the opinions expressed by the public during the consultation
period.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Blames Western Intelligency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Libyan Leader Colonel Muammar
Gaddafi friday accused western intelligency agencies of inciting
terrorism, violence and extremism in Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi arrived in Nigeria on Friday morning for a two-day
official visit, after concluding his visit to Niger.
</P>
<P>
His arrival aboard a Libyan airline Boeing 727, together with
three other Libyan airplanes conveying security personnel and
government officials, was in apprent defiance of a United Nations
air embargo.
</P>
<P>
The embargo was imposed on Libya in 1992 after it failed to
surrender two Libyans wanted in connection with the 1988 bombing
of a Pan Am jet that killed 270 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The Libyan leader, accompanied by Nigerien President Colonel
Ibrahim Baare Mainasara, was met by Nigerian Head of State,
General Sani Abacha at the Kano International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders later held a two-hour closed-door talk in
the Africa House of the Kano State Government House, according to
local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a special service marking the beginning of the
Muslem new year, the Libyan leader said "Islam is the religion of
peace, tolerance and understanding."
</P>
<P>
The notion that Islam is synonymous with terorism, violence
and extremism is a sheer propaganda aimed at destroying the
religion by the western media and their allies.
</P>
<P>
He cited the example of Algeria, saying that the massacres
there is the handiwork of the American Central Intelligence
Agency and other western imperialists.
</P>
<P>
"Muslems and the Islamic religion are facing a serious threat,
it's our duty to porect and safeguard it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Gaddafi promised to establish an Islamic scientific
center in Kano to cater for the culture and religion of Islam. He
said the center will be an affiliate of the Islamic University in
Tripoli, Libya.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Hails Jordanian, Egyptian Peace Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian and Jordanian mediation
in the Mideast helps to boost the Palestinian cause and the peace
process, visiting Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez al-Tarawnah
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Egyptian and Jordanian efforts are necessary to support the
Mideast peace process and endorse the Palestinian stance at the
current negotiations with the Israeli side," said Tarawnah, who
arrived on Friday evening on his first visit to Egypt since taking
office in March.
</P>
<P>
"It also complement efforts of the U.S. Peace Coordinator
Dennis Ross and EU envoy Miguel Moratinos and all other
peace-lovers," he told reporters following talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, he delivered a verbal message from King
Hussein to Mubarak, who also handed him a reply message to the
Jordanian monarch on his conviction of the need to promote
coordination between Egypt and Jordan, the Egyptian MENA news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who held talks with his Jordanian
counterpart Friday evening on efforts to push forward the Mideast
peace process, also attended today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
There will be continued meetings at the highest levels between
the two sides for consultations, said the top Jordanian diplomat,
adding that a date for Hussein-Mubarak summit will be set at the
convenience of both leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tarawna ruled out a so-called "crisis in
Jordanian-Israeli relations," when commenting on a secret meeting
on Thursday night between King Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu that failed to resolve a dispute over water
rights.
</P>
<P>
"The main issue of the meeting in question is water, which is
included in the agreement in the Israeli-Jordanian peace treaty,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has yet to implement the items stipulates the search for
water resources, he said, adding that differences on the water
issue has been contained.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will soon be over," he said. The King and Netanyahu
flew to the Jordanian Sea port of Aqaba to talk about the stalled
Mideast peace process and their disagreements over the water
supplies Israel promised the Arab kingdom under their 1994 peace
deal.
</P>
<P>
Tarawnah during his two-day visit will also hold talks with
U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, who is in Egypt as part of his
shuttle diplomacy between the Israelis and Palestinians to end the
two-month impasse in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to visit Amman soon to seek the Jordanian help
when his third trip to the region in less than two months appeared
to make little headway.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks came to a halt in March
when the Israeli government carried out the construction of Jewish
housing in Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem despite worldwide
condemnation.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Threatens Tough Action Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dhaka, May 10 (Xinhua) - The opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party (BNP) will go for a tough action program after the ongoing
about one-month-long Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC)
examinations are over, party sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The BNP would hold rallies and launch an anti-government
campaign all over the country during the HSC examinations to
prepare the people for launching the strong movement.
</P>
<P>
BNP chairperson Khaleda Zia was quoted Friday as telling her
party activists that there is no alternative to launching a mass
movement for the sake of protecting the country's independence and
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't call for any greater action program against this
government during its 10-month misrule, considering the plight of
the people, but their activities against the nation compelled us
to go for a tougher movement to save the nation," said Khaleda
Zia, whose party was defeated in the last June elections.
</P>
<P>
"We will no longer tolerate torture on us. The time has come to
protest against the government's misdeeds," said Khaleda Zia, the
former Prime Minister, urging her party members to strengthen the
party at every village and stand beside the people at the time of
their need.

<P>
Meanwhile, 40 percent of ECPI shares, namely 1.2 million

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt has spotted 107 cases of tax evasion valued at

<HEADLINE> Vietnam, U.S. Likely to Sign agreement on MFN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and the United States are
likely to reach agreement on commerce and the most-favored nation
(MFN) status by August this year, the Vietnam News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The news agency carried the report when Douglas Peterson, the
first U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam since the Vietnam War, arrived in
Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a draft commercial agreement between the
two countries has been completed after three rounds of
negotiations at the experts level.
</P>
<P>
Despite the absence of a bilateral commercial agreement, the
two-way trade between Vietnam and the U.S. expanded rapidly in
recent years from 225 million U.S. dollars in 1994 to more than 1
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
However, both Vietnamese officials and media believe a
U.S. delay in granting Vietnam the MFN status is a great obstacle
to further trade development.
</P>
<P>
They said the delay has not only reduced the competitiveness of
Vietnamese goods on the U.S. market but also caused losses to the
U.S. business interests and investors as they cannot take the
advantage of producing goods in this Asian country and sell them
on the U.S. market.

<HEADLINE> Policeman Shot Dead in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- An off-duty policeman was shot dead
Friday night in a bar near Belfast's city center, press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) as saying
that the policeman was shot with several bullets by two armed men
in the Parliament Bar and died instantly.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer at the scene said the attack looked
like the work of anti-British guerrillas but did not speculate
which group was responsible.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) has been fighting against the
British rule of Northern Ireland for nearly three decades, with
thousands of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The killed policeman was the first RUC member to be murdered
since the IRA ended a 17-month ceasefire in February 1996. It was
barred from the current peace talks on Northern Ireland and was
responsible for the latest explosions and bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers have reportedly been killed in Northern Ireland by
IRA guerrillas since the ceasefire ended, and a policewoman was
shot and wounded on April 10. Three people have been killed by
alleged IRA bombings on the British mainland since the end of the
ceasefire.

Secretary Robin Cook said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A remarkable week in Britain's financial markets ended
Friday with sterling down sharply, share prices at an all-time
high and gilts basking in their new-found attractiveness to
international investors.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Delivers Message to Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister Fayez
al-Tarawnah delivered a verbal message from King Hussein of Jordan
to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during their meeting here this
morning, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But MENA did not divulge the content of the message conveyed
two-day visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who held talks with his Jordanian
counterpart Friday evening on efforts to push forward the Mideast
peace process, also attended today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was Tarawnah's first visit to Egypt since he took office
in March.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, the top Jordanian diplomat told reporters
that a secret meeting on Thursday night between King Hussein and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu did not resolve a
dispute over water rights.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting ended without a deal on the main issue in
question, which is the agreement in the Israeli-Jordanian peace
treaty about water," he said.
</P>
<P>
The King and Netanyahu flew to the Jordanian Sea port of Aqaba
to talk about the stalled Mideast peace process and their
disagreements over the water supplies Israel promised the Arab
kingdom under their 1994 peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Tarawnah is also expected to hold talks with U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross, who is due in Cairo today on part of his shuttle
diplomacy between the Israelis and Palestinians to end the
two-month impasse in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ross is also expected to visit Amman to seek the Jordanian help
when his third trip to the region in less than two months appeared
to make little headway.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks came to a halt in March
when the Israeli government carried out the construction of Jewish
housing in Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem despite worldwide
condemnation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Rejects Ending Torture of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Israel today rejected a United
Nations committee's call to stop using methods of torture in
interrogating the Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Justice Ministry was quoted by Israel
Radio as denying the charges that Israel tortured and
abused the Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she justified that with the "use of moderate
physical pressure" in interrogating the Palestinian detainees,
Israel had succeeded in foiling 90 planned terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
She did not elaborate the meaning of "moderate physical
pressure", but added that Israel is fighting a consistent battle
to find a balance between the need to protect its citizens from
terrorism and the need to protect the rights of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said these one day following the U.N. Committee
Against Torture made a statement in Geneva to call on Israel to
stop the use of torture against detainees.
</P>
<P>
The committee listed at least seven methods of torture used
by Israeli police in interrogating the Palestinian detainees,
including violent shaking and sleep deprivation.
</P>
<P>
In its non-stop crackdown on terrorism, Israel frequently
detains Palestinian suspects for interrogation, especially after
every terrorist attack.
</P>
<P>
While imposing the closure on the Palestinian territories,
Israeli border police also often detain Palestinians for illegal
entry.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police came under loud criticism from the world late
last year when two border policemen at a northern Jerusalem
checkpoint were filmed torturing several Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Israeli television channels broadcasted the video film, which
showed the policemen freely kicking the detainees' heads,
slapping their faces, and sitting on their heads while forcing
them to do push-ups.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Going All Out to Tap Oceanic Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in east China's
Zhejiang Province are attempting to research into using
shark's cartilage to make medicine for treatment of tumors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they are experimenting with preparing medicine from
algae, shells, fish and sea slugs.
</P>
<P>
The research of oceanic medicine is an important part of
Zhejiang's marine resources development plan, according to Zhou
Yucheng, deputy director of the Zhejiang Provincial Oceanic
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the provincial oceanic administration
sponsored Zhejiang's first seminar on the development of marine
resources. Some 20 schools of higher learning and research
institutions and a dozen enterprises engaged in the development of
marine biological resources attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government attempted to encourage science
research organs and enterprises to tap marine biological resources
by sponsoring such activities, an official of the Provincial
Oceanic Administration said.
</P>
<P>
The government efforts prove worthwhile, and there are now more
than 70 projects awaiting development.
</P>
<P>
Local officials expressed the hope that the science research
institutes and enterprises will increase exchanges and cooperation
in cultivation of marine animals and plants with economic value
and treatment and control of their diseases, the development of
algaes with high economic value, use of oceanic by-products,
oceanic pharmaceuticals and petrochemical raw materials, and the
making of cosmetics and new-type fodder.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, later last year and earlier this year, the provincial
oceanic society set up an Oceanic Engineering Subcommittee and
Oceanic Biological Resources Development and Utilization
Committee, consisting a total of 73 experts.

vehicles in March to a record 569 in April.
</P>
<P>
According to Traffic Chief Grace Turyagumanawe, most accidents
occurred in evenings at weekends when few officers are on duty.
''This gave those without driving permits a chance to come to the
roads,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the rise in accidents on Ugandan taxi operators and
the Drivers Association which he said, frustrated the crackdown
on forged driving permits.
</P>

He told that the crackdown would resume next Thrusday.
" Every person behind a driving wheel must with immediate effect
carry his original driving permit," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Earns Record Price in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A 50-Kg bag of coffee fetched a
record 593 U.S. Dollars during this week's auction at the Nairobi
Coffee Exchange, compared with 500 Dollars last week.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the coffee industry confirmed that the new prices
were the highest over the past two years, and coffee price could
be in a brighter future.
</P>
<P>
The Coffee Board of Kenya predicted last March that the world
demand for coffee was expected to outstrip supply this year,
keeping prices high on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The board pointed out that the main coffee producing countries
tightened supplies while the major consuming countries had a
record low stock.
</P>
<P>
The prices are expected to be kept high by a smaller crop from
Brazil, the world biggest coffee producer.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya the previous drought would reduce its coffee production to
the lowest level in four years with the latest estimate standing
at 78,000 tons for the 1996/97 crop year, down from 97,575 tons in
1995/96.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, which exported 109,372 tons of coffee in 1995/96, is
Africa's fourth largest coffee producer after Uganda, Cote
d'Ivoire and Ethiopia.

KAMPALA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Over 12,000 Ugandans returned home
last week from Yei in southern Sudan, ''The New Vision'' reported

United Nations officials visiting Yei said that only 280
Ugandans remained in the city, and most of the remaining are sick

The Ugandans in Yei started their trek in the wake
of a series of heavy bombadments by the Sudanese government
troops. some 2,000 Zaireans and 240 west Africans joined them in
the movement.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Ugandans stranded in Yei had left their country
for Zaire in 1979 when Idi Amin was replaced. They fled Zaire for
Sudan when the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire took eastern Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Down in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate in Kenya
dropped from four percent in March to 2.8 percent in April,
despite the impact on food supplies by drought, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) said in its May edition of
Monthly Economic Review issued Friday that overall inflation
continued to remain high, but on a declining trend, in April.
</P>
<P>
The CBK said that a further decline in the underlying
inflation rate is expected as the normal food supply resumes with
the advent of the long rains.
</P>
<P>
The underlying average annual inflation also fell to 8.9
percent in April, down from nine percent in March, partly due to
the continued strengthening of the Kenya Shilling exchange rate
in the second half of last year and early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The fall trend was strengthened by the adjustments in the
prices of petroleum and petroleum-related products which have
adversely affected transport charges and indirectly influenced
the pricing of wide-ranging manufactured goods and services.
</P>
<P>
The drop is also attributed to the continuing tight monetary
and fiscal policies that have resulted in a significant slow-down
in the expansion of the money supply.
</P>
<P>
The moderation in the expansion of the money supply has
restrained aggregate demand and eased the upward pressures on
prices. enditem

HANGZHOU, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More and more Chinese university
students are actively involved in science research, and this is
epitomized by students of Hangzhou University in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
At present, about two thirds of the post-graduate and
undergraduate students of the university are members of student
organizations that focus on science research.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, the university's students have presented
more than 1,000 academic papers, some 600 of which are published
in academic journals above the provincial level.
</P>
<P>
Yao Chengwei, a sophomore of the School of Computer Science,
was invited to participate in a provincial science research
program. His two pioneering achievements were awarded national
prizes.
</P>
<P>
As part of their effort to develop the students' interest in
science research and encourage them to take part in science
research activities, the university authorities have resorted to a
series of measures. Such courses as Students' Researches and
Trans-Century Talents and Methods for Science Researches are
opened for low-grade students at various departments. And
students' meetings on science and technology and seminars are held
annually.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has said it will
not allow foreigners to hijack jobs from local workers in the
privatized companies.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted Labor Deputy Minister Syacheye
Madyenkuku as saying on Friday that his Zambianization Committee will
not offer work permits to foreigners who held qualifications inferior
to their Zambian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He said his committee scrutinizes all applications from expatriates
and monitors the situation twice a week.
</P>
<P>
The government will strictly adhere to the provisions of the
Investment Act, which restricts the number of expatriate workers in
a privatized firm to five and provides for three expatriate directors,
said the deputy minister.
</P>
<P>
He said "it must be said without any apologies that privatization
does not mean loss of employment for our people and we will make sure
their positions are secured and not unnecessarily taken over by their
expatriate competitors who may not even possess superior
qualifications."
</P>
<P>
He made the promise in a reaction to reports that some bidders of
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) are recruiting workers outside
Zambia. enditem

ADDIS ABABA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. mining company, America
Mineral Fields Inc., said it has signed contracts of 21 billion
dollars with the Zairean rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the
Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADLF), under which it will work with
the local Gecamines company to mine zinc at Kipushi and copper at
Kolwezi in the southern Shaba region.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, the American company's
Director of Finance, Earl Young is leading a group of inter-
national financiers interested in investing in Zaire's mining
industry.
</P>
<P>
Young said in Lubumbashi, Zaire, that the contract was part of his

bouring countries.
</P>
<P>
He said his company has also won an exploration contract of
minerals in Solwezi in northwestern Zambia, close to the
Zairean Kipushi zinc mine.
</P>
<P>
If the Zambian reserves proved to be viable, the American company
would consider the launching of cross-border mining projects, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Young's group of financiers has come to examine further
prospects of investment in Zaire's vast mineral industry, which
includes copper and cobalt in Shaba, diamonds in Kasai and Kivu

<HEADLINE> Non-Financial Chinese Firms to Be Allowed to Issue Bonds Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China will select a batch of
non-financial entities for experimental overseas bond issue,
according to an official from its State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
These firms will be in the country's pillar industries and have
good records in debt repayment, profits earning and assets
structure, said the official, adding that the selected firms will
be subjected to regular examinations for official qualification.
</P>
<P>
Issuing bonds overseas will help ease the demand for funds
required by major national construction projects, and the bond
issue by non-financial bodies is conducive not only to attracting
foreign capital, but to the cutting down of the fund-raising cost
as compared with the former practice of relying solely on
financial institutions for foreign fund, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing State foreign-debt managerial system, the
Ministry of Finance and a dozen qualified financial institutions
alone are authorized to issue overseas debt notes, and the funds
will then be channeled into key construction projects and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Since the practice was first introduced in 1982, China has
floated 110 sums of overseas bonds by April this year, raising a
total of 18.7 billion US dollars in foreign capital.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market, May South ended the week at 1,350
ringgit (about 540 U.S. dollars) per ton, 15 ringgit (about 6
dollars) down from 1,365 ringgit (about 546 dollars) per ton last
week.
</P>
<P>
May South opened the week at 1,360 ringgit (about 544 dollars)
per ton but eased to 1,345 ringgit (about 538 dollars) per ton the
next day and climbed up throughout the week to close at 1,350
ringgit (about 540 dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The CPO physicals market is expected to maintain its uptrend on
strong buying interest and to experience some short covering
activities next week despite the lack of leads in the market,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
During the week, tin price on the Kuala Lumpur tin Market
(KLTM) was in the uptrend in line with the bullish performance of
the London Metal Exchange (LME) and heavy buying support.
</P>
<P>
The metal price kicked-off the week at 14.17 ringgit (about
5.668 dollars) per kg and increased gradually to 14.43 ringgit
(about 5.772 dollars) per kg at the week's close.
</P>
<P>
Turnover for the week increased sharply to 635 tons from 434
tons last week with buyers mostly from Europe, Japan and local
dominating the transactions in the market.
</P>
<P>
The price differential between the KLTM and that of the LME was
at a premium of 15 dollars against 90 dollars the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is expected to maintain its uptrend next week with
heavy bids and increased turnover, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Malaysian rubber market was bad during
the week as prices slid gradually from the opening prices of
275.50 sen (about 110.2 U.S. cents) per kg for June RSS One and
259.00 sen (about 103.6 U.S. cents) per kg for SMR 20 to close the
week at 269.50 sen (about 107.8 U.S. cents) per kg and 255.00 sen
(about 102 U.S. cents) per kg for June RSS One and SMR 20
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The poor performance during the week was also in line with the
downtrend performance of the regional markets, dealers said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting among the regional producers held in Haadyai,
Thailand on Monday which discussed on the declining rubber prices
failed to lift the local market.
</P>
<P>
Even the rainy season could not help improve the downtrend
market.
</P>
<P>
The gradual slide of the prices began on March 17 with the
prices of the spot month RSS One at 305.50 sen (about 122.2 U.S.
cents) per kg while SMR 20 at 292.50 sen (about 117 U.S. cents)
per kg.
</P>
<P>
Rubber producers were concerned with the sliding prices as this
might affect the raw material supply, a dealer said, adding that
the low prices are already affecting the production of some
producers.
</P>
<P>
The five-day moving average stood at 207.91 cents per kg from
208.51 cents per kg the previous Friday.
</P>
<P>
The local rubber prices are expected to drift further next week
as buyers continued to be reluctant to take up positions in the
market, the dealers said, adding buyers would be sidelined
awaiting for the prices to slip further before committing on
buying decision.

agreements.''

<HEADLINE> Hebei Solicits Foreign Funding for Expressway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Hebei Province, north China,
is striving to seek 800 million US dollars of funding for the
building of five expressways in the province.
</P>
<P>
The expressways, totalling 1.3 billion US dollars in
investment, have a combined length of 540 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
They include the second-phase construction of a super highway
between Beijing and Zhangjiakou, Tianjin and Tangshan, and links
between Datong and Xuanhua, Shijiazhuang and Cangzhou, and
Tangshan and Jingtang Port.
</P>
<P>
The construction is believed to be economically important not
only to the province but to north China and the country as a
whole, since all these expressways will be incorporated into the
national road network.
</P>
<P>
For example, the Beijing-Zhangjiakou section, totaling over 200
kilometers long, will be connected with an expressway leading to
the coal producer of Datong City, and will become a trunk line for
transporting the coal to other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The 203 km-long Shijiazhuang-Cangzhou section will traverse the
Northern China Plain before finally reaching Huangye Port by the
Bohai Sea.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin-Tangshan section will become a hub linking several
other super highways including the Beijing-Shenyang, and
Beijing-Fuzhou links.
</P>
<P>
The engineering difficulty is expected to be low since most
parts will be built on plain areas, with estimated cost for per
kilometer ranging from 1.9 million to three million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The daily flow of vehicles on each expressway averages around
20,000, representing an optimistic prospect for the recouping of
the investment, provincial officials claimed.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) market closed the week stronger with expectation
that the stocks on the market are to trend sideways next week
ahead of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's two-month leave
starting May 19.
</P>
<P>
This week, the Composite Index rose 9.41 points to 1,107.37 due
to the marked increase in the price of financial stocks on
Wednesday while the Emas Index was 0.98 of a point steadier at
316.75 and the Industrial Index gained 20.27 points to 2,047.68.
But, the second board index lost 11.94 points to 546.17.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said during the next week, although there could be a
few institutional buyings in support of key blue chips, any sharp
rise was expected to be trimmed by profit taking shortly after.
</P>
<P>
They said basically there is no change in the country's
economic fundamentals to attract new fund coming into the market.
</P>
<P>
Any movement in share prices would continue to be centered on
individual stocks next week based on their strengths and those
which were badly battered in the recent sell-down.
</P>
<P>
However, Mahathir's long leave is not expected to cause panic
among investors as the prime minister had made it clear that his
health is not the reason for him taking the leave.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir has also said that there would be no major plans to be
implemented by the government during his absence.
</P>
<P>
But, one possible lead that could determine the sentiment of
the stock market would be a cabinet change, one analyst said,
adding a minor change is not expected to shake the market, "But a
major cabinet reshuffle could."
</P>
<P>
This week, two new counters entered the market with Paracorp
Bhd recording a 1.65 ringgit (about 66 U.S. cents) premium on its
debut on the main board over its share offer price of 3.65 ringgit
(about 1.46 dollars) and Sapura Motors Bhd chalking a 4.20 ringgit
(about 1.68 dollars) premium on its debut on the second board over
its initial share offer price of 2.10 ringgit (about 84 U.S.
cents).

two sen with 20.710 million shares traded, Sinora down 1.10
ringgit to 13.40 ringgit with 15.051 million shares traded and CP
Bhd down 50 sen to 14.90 ringgit with 12.240 million shares
traded.
</P>
<P>
The weekly main board ready turnover stood at 894.462 million

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Sino-Nigerian Trade Ties to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The last couple of years have
witnessed the two remote nations of China and Nigeria
developing their economic ties rapidly.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the volume of annual bilateral trade reached 320
million U.S. Dollars, up from 212 million U.S. Dollars in 1995
and merely 57 million U.S. Dollars in 1980.
</P>
<P>
And Nigeria is now China's second largest trade partner in
Africa, second only to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say China and Nigeria enjoy great potentials of trade
potentials. Nigeria has rich resources and a huge market, while
China has advanced technologies. Chinese products are welcomed by
Nigerian people for its good quality at acceptable prices.
</P>
<P>
China's reasonably-priced quality exports to Nigeria, which
used to be dominated by light industrial products and hardwares,
has in recent years turned more and more technology intensive.
</P>
<P>
And Nigeria is now one of the biggest African markets for
Chinese engineering contractors. By the end of 1996, Chinese
firms had signed 101 engineering contracts with Nigeria, totaling
758 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of Nigeria's 3,500-km railway lines by the
China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation at a cost of 526
million U.S. Dollars is so far the biggest project that Chinese
firms have ever won in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, China has been helping train Nigerian technicians
in vegetable and rice farming, fresh water culture, hydropower,
computer, metrology and many other fields.
</P>
<P>
China's direct investment in Nigeria has been increasing
rapidly since the first Chinese-funded enterprise went into
operation in 1981.
</P>
<P>
By August 1996, Chinese businesses had invested 7.29 million
U.S. Dollars in Nigeria in 10 joint ventures engaged in fishing,
plastics, steel, paper, timber processing and textile.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China, with a population of 1.2 billion, is also
encouraging Nigerian exporters to sell their products to China
in view of its own grand market.
</P>
<P>
Ways to expand bilateral trade ties is on top of the agenda
of the forthcoming talks between Nigeria's government leaders
and visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng who is scheduled to arrive
in Abuja on May 11 to pay an official visit.

<HEADLINE> Colombo Bourse Records Turnover of 1 Billion Rupee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The total turnover at the Colombo
Stock Exchange (CSE) during this week's trading reached 1 billion
rupee (16.89 million US dollars), a record for three years,
according to the CSE sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that this week's total turnover of 1 billion
rupee was nearly double that of last week's 586.4 million rupee
(9.91 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of shares traded this week was 26.6 million in 5,286
 trades, an increase from last week's 14.5 million in 4,514
trades.
</P>
<P>
However, the sources said that there were declines in the All-
Share and Sensitive Price Indices by 16 and 46 index points
respectively.
</P>
<P>
But, market analysts said there was no cause for concern as the
signals were very positive with the economy on course, corporate
earnings rising and foreign players becoming increasingly active.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover recorded at the CSE at the end of Friday's
trading increased to 48.1 million rupee (810,000 US dollars) from
Thursday's 44.28 million rupee (750,000 US dollars), the sources

week at 731.1 while the Sensitive Price Index stood at 1,136.5,
down 7.2 points.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that the main reason for the strong
improvement in the Colombo bourse was due to corporate earnings
this year being above average and beyond expectations of the
business community.

NEW DELHI, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A number of Congress leaders in
the past 24 hours called on Sonia Gandhi, widow of Indian former
prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, and urged her to lead the party and
help in strengthening the unity and effectiveness of the party.
</P>
<P>
Former union minister Arjun Singh said in a statement that Mrs.
Gandhi's decision had added a new dynamic dimension to the affairs
of the Congress.
</P>
<P>
"It is now up to all Congressmen to demonstrate how far we are
prepared to go to join her in her efforts to strengthen the
Congress Party so that it plays its historic role in the service
of the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sonia Gandhi was offered presidentship of the Congress Party in
1991 soon after her husband's assassination, but she declined the
offer on the plea that she wanted to stay away from active
politics.
</P>
<P>
She had since been consistently spurning offers for party
leadership.
</P>

Another senior leader of the Congress party A.K. Antony has
said that he did not think that Mrs. Gandhi was interested in any
post, she wanted to help the Congress.

<TEXT>
<P>
PUSAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- For the small island in the Pacific
Ocean, Guam may have no chance to take a medal in competitons, but
they have chances to get more out of it.
</P>
<P>
Chu Tze Chung, Chief-de-Mission of the Guam Sports Delegation for
the second East Asian Games, said that to partcipate in the games is
a
chance for them to exchanges sports with the countries and regions in
the area. "We cherish it, as our athletes have rare chances to
compete with the rest of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>

to
the organizing committee, about 1900 athletes from nine countries and
regions including China, South Korea, Japan and Mongolia will take
part in the 10-day games, competiting for 199 gold medals.
</P>
<P>
"For us, we have no chance to win a medal. Some of our athletes
may finish fourth to fifth to their best in competitions," Chu said.
</P>
<P>
Guam has sent 46 athletes competing in seven sports of basketball,
soccer, judo, boxing, swimming, bowling and taekwondo.
</P>

At the last East Asian Games in Shanghai in 1993, Guam only took
part in three sports.

"We have more athletes this time and our men's basketball team
might finish at fourth to sixth position in this games," Chu said. A
total of seven squads will take part in the men's basketball
tournament.
</P>

Guam has been stepping forward in sports. Eight years ago, the
Guam Olympic Committee was formed and it has become a member under
the
International Olympic Committee, which made it eligible to send a
delegation to the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"To take part in international games such as the Olympics and the
East Asian Games promote our sports standards," he said. "We are very
greetful to be an associate member of the East Asian Games Council."

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTREAL, May 9 (Xinhua) -- China is to hold the second Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Expo in its eastern coastal
city of Yantai next month, a Chinese minister announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Long Yongtu, head of the Chinese delegation to the APEC Trade
Ministers Meeting here, made the announcement today during
discussions on APEC-business relations.
</P>
<P>
Since its first exposition, APEC had been promoting its ties
with the business sector, said Long, chief negotiator and vice
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government held that the business sector could not
only participate in APEC activities, but also directly benefit
from them.
</P>
<P>
To provide business with good trade and investment
opportunities, China would host the second APEC Expo in Yantai
from June 6 to 10, Long said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government had made great efforts for the success
of this exposition. Almost all APEC member economies would send
business delegations to the exposition.

<P>
The two-day ministers' meeting is designed to further trade and
investment, and economic and technical cooperation among APEC
members in the runup to the APEC Leader's Meeting in November.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Introduce Green GDP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
preparing a new concept macro accounting system which includes the
cost of environmental damage in the calculation of the gross
domestic product (GDP), local newspaper Bisnis Indonesia reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The new concept, referred to as Green GDP, was expected to
replace the conventional concept introduced by the United Nations
at its 1968 convention, the report quoted official sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the conventional accounting system, the report said,
progress made by a country in its economic development was
calculated based on the output or amount of goods and services
produced during a period of time, excluding environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
Environmental damage includes pollution, depletion of natural
resources and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
Many economists previously questioned the economic growth of
7.8 percent enjoyed by Indonesia in 1996, since the calculation of
the macro economic figure did not include the cost of
environmental damage.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the new accounting system is expected to
lead to more realistic efforts in measuring Indonesia's
development progress, since it calculates not only the goods and
services produced by the national economy but also the cost of
social and environmental damage, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The Green GDP concept is currently implemented by a number of
European countries, including Finland and Denmark, which tax
companies for the environmental damage they cause.
</P>
<P>
Environment experts expressed their support for the idea,
calling for the immediate implementation of the new macro economic
accounting system.

The FAO director general, who is currently here on a three-day

<HEADLINE> Oil Exploration to Confirm China's Future Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to strengthen
exploration in undeveloped western basins as well as in areas near
existing eastern oil-fields to confirm that there are enough oil
reserves to fuel future economic growth, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
More investment is expected to be put into the in-depth
exploration and the government will grant preferential policies,
with more professional to be dispatched to exploration areas and
studies on geological conditions to be strengthened, said the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), which produces 90 percent
of the nation's total oil output, expects that an additional 55
percent of an estimated 70 billion tons of oil resources will be
verified in the future.
</P>
<P>
Oil potential remains huge, as only 25 percent of the nation's
resources have been confirmed, according to CNPC officials.
</P>
<P>
But pressures is mounting on the oil industry for larger
reserves and increased production, as the national economy has
grown at double-digit rates while the average increase of crude
oil in the past few years has remained below nine percent.
</P>
<P>
CNPC, which has 21 major oil-fields, will start several key
exploration projects soon. The company is expected to verify five
billion tons of petroleum equivalent during the Ninth Five-year
Plan (1996--2000).
</P>
<P>
About 600 million tons of oil reserves are expected to be
confirmed and ten million tons of oil is expected to be produced
by the end of the century in the Junggar Basin, one of the three
major oil-bearing basins in Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate the Junggar Basin has geological reserves of
6.9 billion tons in oil and 1.24 trillion cubic meters in natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 oil and gas fields have been developed in the
basin so far, with 16 being operational. The basin turned out 8.3
million tons of crude oil last year, ranking it first among the
three great oil-rich basins in Xinjiang.

<HEADLINE> Genscher: New World Order Without China Unimaginable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Building a cooperative new world
order without China, which has the fastest economic growth in the
world, is unimaginable, says former German Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an article entitled "West Must Show
Sincerity in Establishing Partnership With China", which was
published here today in the Daily Mirror.
</P>
<P>
He said the world is developing towards multipolarization,
which calls for responsible cooperation, on the basis of equality,
between big countries and regional organizations such as the
European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Whether such a new order could be built successfully hinges on
the participation of China, the former German minister said. The
wider the door to the World Trade Organization (WTO) opens to
China, a country with 1.2 billion people, the more effective
cooperation with it will be.
</P>
<P>
China has played an increasingly important part in the world's
political and economic affairs. So anybody who doesn't acknowledge
its equal position today in the new order will pay "a high price"
tomorrow, Genscher warned.
</P>
<P>
He urged the EU to play a major role in seeking cooperation
with China in political, economic, social, and environmental
matters on the eve of the new century.
</P>
<P>
He criticized certain westerners for isolating China and
preaching Western chauvinism. He stressed that the West should try
to help China join the cooperative new world order instead of
isolating or defaming it.

<P>
JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A protection of intellectual
property rights (IPR) would support the implementation of the
ASEAN free trade area (AFTA), Arpad Bogsch, director general of
the World Intellectual Property Rights Organization (WIPO) said.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of the round table subregional discussion
between WIPO and ASEAN here Friday, Bogsch said it will be a big
boost to the innovations and inventions carried out by inventors,
sources at the meeting said today.
</P>
<P>
Intellectual property rights has been thought of as the best
way to avoid counterfeits, piracy and other unfair practices that
obstruct trading and investment.
</P>
<P>
Bogsch said that complex procedures and weakness in mechanism
in the intellectual property rights have long been regarded as
non-tariff barriers in the international trade relations.
</P>
<P>
AFTA aims at a free trade mechanism among the ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) members by eliminating
non-tariff barriers through an integrated system that protects
intellectual property rights and accelerates trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN Secretary General Ajit Singh said at the meeting that the
ASEAN countries, which are developing their high-tech oriented
industries, need the system to ensure the implementation of AFTA
in 2003.

Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,

<HEADLINE> Analysis: Thai Currency Under New Assault </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai currency baht is again
under a wave of assault when rumors are spreading that the central
bank of Thailand may widen the baht's trading band.
</P>
<P>
On Friday speculators rushed to sell baht in favor of dollars,
resulting in the four-satang trading band being broken in the
morning session (one baht has 100 satang).
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, the trading band is allowed to move
two satang higher or lower than the official mid-rate, which is
fixed and announced by the Thai central bank on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
On the spot market, dollar/baht trading was at a range between
26.08 and 26.09 baht Friday morning, even though the mid-rate was
officially fixed at 25.99 baht.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank, the Bank of Thailand, came out
immediately to quash the rumor, claiming that it was totally
groundless and reaffirming that the government was fully committed
to maintaining the stability of the Thai baht under the present
regime.
</P>
<P>
The denial was followed by a reported intervention by the
central bank in Singapore foreign exchange markets in the morning,
in the hope to help ease the pressure on the baht and increase
supply.
</P>
<P>
The trading rate dropped to 26.01 baht per dollar in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The baht, supported by a rapidly developing Thai economy over
the past decade, had been stable until late last year, when the
Thai economy began showing slowdown.
</P>
<P>
The currency market has been volatile from time to time,
especially in February, when the persistently slackening economy
showed no signs of recovery.
</P>
<P>
The baht is pegged to a basket of currencies, which consists
mainly of the U.S. dollar and other currencies, such as the
Japanese yen and the German mark. Compared with a year ago, the
baht has lost more than 4 percent to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The assault on the baht followed announcements of economic
figures for the first quarter of this year which showed no sign of
economic recovery in Thailand, and falling Stock Exchange of
Thailand (SET) index during the week.
</P>
<P>
Share prices are currently at their lowest mark since January
17, 1991, when the index stood at 582.16 points. The SET closed
Friday at 605.43 points.
</P>
<P>
The sell-off of the baht is believed to have been prompted by
continued investor pessimism about Thailand's economy, and foreign
investors are far from certain that the economic slowdown had
bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
With the stock market down and no signs that exports have
improved, it is almost inevitable that there would be heavy
speculation and arbitrage against the baht, according to currency
traders.

JAKARTA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rice production is
predicted to increase with an extra supply of fertilizer and a
favorable climate this year.
</P>
<P>
The result of a Ministry of Agriculture meeting held here
Friday indicated that this year's climate will be normal and the
national rice output would be higher than initial prediction for
1997, official sources at the meeting said today.

This year will also see the addition of 1.4 million tons of
fertilizer, said the sources.
</P>

With a population of 200 million, Indonesia achieved
self-sufficiency in rice in 1984. However, the country is
currently under threat as rice fields are being eaten away by
industrial expansion and disturbed by unfriendly weather.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the country's rice output reached 50.58 million tons
of unhulled paddy, an increase of 831,074 tons compared with the

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Bill for Imported Oil Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's bill for imported oil
soared 24.3 percent in the first quarter of this year over the
same period last year to 42.28 billion baht (1.69 billion U.S.
dollars), official figures showed.
</P>
<P>
The increased bills reflected the 5.5 percent rise in import
volume for both crude and refined oil products, which averaged
787,860 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
According to figures from the Commerce Ministry and Petroleum
Authority of Thailand, bills for crude oil imports rose 65.1
percent over the same period last year to 38.33 billion baht (1.53
billion dollars). The country paid 3.94 billion baht (157 million
dollars) for imports of refined oil products, a drop of 63.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
In terms of volume, crude imports rose 35.5 percent to 723,370
barrels per day. Imports of refined oil products plunged 69.7
percent to 64,490 barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The shift of import balance between crude and refined products
was due to the increase in crude intake capacity resulting from
the presence of two new oil refineries in Rayong province, eastern
Thailand.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Scenic and tranquil Songhua Lake in
Jinlin Province, northeast China, is an ideal retreat for either
summer or winter vacationers from crowded cities.
</P>
<P>
The scenic area of the Songhua Lake, which stretches 100
kilometers, is composed of dense woods, mirror-like lakes,
fantastically shaped islands and cliffs.
</P>
<P>
As the day turns warmer, lake banks are covered with green
leaves and blooming plum blossoms, with white sails mirroring on
the lake. Fresh air and tranquility in the dense wood behind the
lake are what the visitors like to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
Going fishing in the clear blue lake or enjoying the coolness
of the mountain forests stretching around the lake are also among
the favorite tourist activities.
</P>
<P>
In winter, cold weather and fog-coat trees with frost along the
lake, creating a wonderful view of crystalline purity and giving
birth to the world-famous "Ice and Rime Festival".
</P>
<P>
December to February is the best season to enjoy the sight of
ice-rimed trees, with the five-km-long embarkment along the river
being the best scene.
</P>
<P>
The attractive place also has great potential for skating and
skiing.
</P>
<P>
With an extremely steep slope along a peak 934 meters above the
sea level and two tracks with lengths of three to ten km, the
Songhua Lake ski area is a popular spot for people to enjoy snow
and ice. A 1,776-meter-long cable lift sends skiers to the top of
the slope in only eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the area boasts many other tourist attractions such
as Longtanshan Deer Farm, Tortoise Island, Peony Peak, Five Tiger
Island and Shilong Cliff.

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest Venice Separatists, Release Demanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VENICE, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian police today stormed the bell
tower in St Mark's Square, in Venice, and arrested eight
separatists who had occupied it to demand independence for Venice.
</P>
<P>
The separatists broke into the famous landmark earlier today,
unfurled the flag of the old Republic of Venice. They issued a
statement describing themselves as a regular unit of the
Serenissima Repubblica di Venezia (Most Serene Republic of Venice).
</P>
<P>
After the arrests, a message was received by the ANSA news
agency, demanding the release of the eight separatists.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet threatened to use force if the eight were not set
free within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
"We will respond to the violence of the Italian occupiers in
such a way as to discourage any other attempt to violate our
rights," the message said.
</P>
<P>
The leaflet accused the Italian authorities of beating the
separatists and putting them in isolation jail cells.
</P>
<P>
The eight were arrested by police and paramilitary Carabinieri
special forces about five hours after they occupied the tower.
</P>
<P>
The group were also found to have been behind recent pirate
radio transmissions which jammed public TV broadcasts in the
northern Veneto region with separatist messages.
</P>
<P>
Around six o'clock this morning, a weak radio signal broadcast
from the top of the tower cut in on local public radio
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
A man with strong Venetian accent declared that the Republic of
Venice had occupied the bell tower of St Mark Square. He
shouted: "Long live St Mark! Long live the Republic of Venice!"
</P>
<P>
After preliminary investigation, it was ascertained all eight
arrested were Venetians and one had been investigated for
distributing separatist materials.
</P>
<P>
All reportedly refused to say who was the leader of the
"republic."
</P>
<P>
Police said the group had commandeered a ferry shortly after
midnight to take them down the Grand Canal to St Mark's Square.
</P>
<P>
Venice was an independent state for centuries. Its sovereignty
ended after French forces of Napoleon I entered the city on May
12, 1797.

<HEADLINE> Political Compromise Reached in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Albania's 10 main parties, including
the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party, today signed a
"six-point" political contract committing that the general
election will be held by the end of June.
</P>
<P>
The political contract was signed under the mediation of
European Envoy Franz Vranitzky, who announced the breakthrough at
a news conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The election will follow a system which combines the
first-pass-the-post with the proportional representation. A
decision on a new election law will be made by May 12.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the salvation committees, citizens' groups
set up after the rioting to restore order in southern Albania,
will be dissolved at least 46 days before the election.
</P>
<P>
Free movement of people and fair access to media will be
guaranteed for all parties during the campaign period.
</P>
<P>
All parties agreed that the former members of the Communist
Political Bureau, state security police collaborators and the
people convicted of crimes against humanity will be barred from
running.
</P>
<P>
Also a co-ordinator of international standing will be nominated
by the international community to make a final report on the
electoral process.
</P>
<P>
Vranitzky, envoy of Organization of Security and Cooperation in
Europe, has been on his fourth visit to Albania since widespread
rioting broke out in February over failed pyramid savings schemes.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the political contract has given the green
light for the election. But just as Vranitzky said at the news
conference, the contract is just a commitment and the key is to
make it a reality.

<HEADLINE> Ericsson Taps China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Swedish telecommunications giant
Ericsson clinched five contracts worth 137 million US dollars for
deals in China, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
Under the contracts signed earlier this month, the company will
provide mobile-telecommunications system expansion programs in
four northern provinces of the country.
</P>
<P>
The deals, struck between Ericsson and the provinces of
Liaoning, Hebei, Qinghai and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, are
scheduled to be completed by this year or next, the
English-language daily quoted an official with Ericsson 's China
Operations.
</P>
<P>
The company, which entered China in 1985, has been one of the
major foreign beneficiaries of China's exploding
mobile-communications market along with Motorola, Nokia, Alcatel
and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
So far, Ericsson's mobile-communications systems have covered
20 provinces in the country, thus making the market Ericsson's
second biggest worldwide only after the United States.
</P>
<P>
China's cellular phone subscribers, numbering 6.8 million by
the end of last year, have been projected to surpass 20 million by
the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the country plans to have four million new
subscribers, Wu Jichuan, minister of post and telecommunications
said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The China market has inestimable potential. The estimation of
20 million subscribers by the year 2000 sounds too conservative
from the point of view of many observers", said one Ericsson
official. "I'm confident we'll get more such contracts from the
country's expansion programs."

<HEADLINE> Italy Drafts Law to Allow Exiled King's Son to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government today approved a
draft law to allow the son of the last king to return after a
50-year exile.
</P>
<P>
If the bill is passed by both houses of the parliament,
Vittorio Emanuele, 59, will be allowed to return home for the
first time since he was forced into exile with his father, King
Umberto II, as a nine-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
Italians voted against the monarchy in 1946 in favor of a
republic, blaming them for links to more than 20 years of fascist
rule under dictator Benito Mussolini, who led Italy into World War
Two on the Nazi side.
</P>
<P>
The bill proposes to lift the post-war republic's decision to
ban the last king and the male heirs of his family from returning
to Italy.
</P>
<P>
Umberto II took his family to Portugal and then Switzerland,
where he died in 1983, leaving Vittorio Emanuele as his
heir. Vittorio Emanuele lives in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
He said he will not give up his former claim to royal
prerogatives but the new bill says members of the Savoy dynasty
would be barred from political activity and from voting in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Vittorio Emanuele triggered widespread outrage last week when
he refused to apologize for fascist anti-semitic laws passed in
1938 which threw Jews out of schools and jobs when his
grandfather, Vittorio Emanuele III, was head of state.
</P>
<P>
Political parties across the spectrum welcomed the bill, except
for the extreme-left Communist Refoundation Party, whose support
gives Prime Minister Roman Prodi a parliamentary majority, and the
small center-left Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
Refoundation said earlier this week it was opposed to the
return of Vittorio Emanuele in the light of his comments.
</P>
<P>
The bill, sponsored by Italian Premier Romano Prodi, was also
accused by the opposition parties of trying to buy popularity
ahead of run-off mayoral elections in key northern cities this
weekend.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 10 (Xinhua) -- More than 42,000 civilians in
Malaysia have signed up as armed forces reservists under the
Defense Ministry's reservists program, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figure represented more than half of the national target of
80,000 reservists by the year 2020, Defense Minister Syed Hamid
Albar was quoted as saying Friday in Johor Baru, about 370
kilometers southeast from here.
</P>
<P>
The minister was pleased with the response towards the
reservists program, especially from youths and was very confident
of achieving the 80,000 target based on the "positive response
from the public so far", the report said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the "very encouraging" recruitment campaign
for reservists showed that a major cross-section of the population
understood the role and functions of the armed forces which he
said "are capable of defending the country from any outside
threats".
</P>
<P>
"The success of our reservist recruitment drives also shows
that there is good understanding between the armed forces and the
public," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, with a population of about 20 million, has about
100,000 regular armed forces in addition to some 70,000 police
forces.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Buy Electricity from Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will sign a memorandum of
understanding in July to buy electricity from Myanmar for 10
years, according to Prime Minister's Office Minister Sompong
Amornvivat.
</P>
<P>
Sompong said he agreed with Myanmar Energy Minister U Khin
Maung Thein during his recent trip to Myanmar that the two
countries would work together in energy development.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will buy 1,500 megawatts of electricity per day from
Myanmar over the next 10 years, but under certain conditions.
</P>
<P>
Electricity sold by Myanmar must come from power plants which
have at least a 25 percent Thai holding and the construction of
substations and power lines used in the delivery of energy to
Thailand must not affect the environment in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Sompong said he also discussed a plan to buy natural gas from a
new gas field in Myanmar, south of Tavoy, where U.S.-based
Atlantic Richfield Co. is drilling.
</P>
<P>
Detailed negotiations will be held soon. If agreement is
reached, the gas field will become the third field from which gas
is sold to Thailand.

<P>
GENEVA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Dutch veteran Erik Breukink overcame
bad weather conditions to earn valuable time in a bonus sprint and
took the overall lead Friday in the Tour de Romandie.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Mario Cipollini won his second straight stage, beating
Czech Jan Svorada by centimeters at the finish-line.
</P>
<P>
The results left Thursday's overall leader Chris Boardmann in
second place, a second behind the 33-year-old Breukink, who
notched his last victory four years ago as Dutch road cycling
champion.
</P>
<P>
The rainy and windy weather prompted the cyclists to stage a
brief strike after just 17 kilometers. Race organizers were forced
to reroute the race. This cut about 10 kilometers from the
171-kilometer stage from Estavayer-Le-Lac to Monthey.
</P>
<P>
Italian mountain-bike king Marco Pantani and pre-race favorite
Luc Leblanc of France both withdrew.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Experts Suggest Bolder Reform Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Although the economic
"soft-landing" in 1996 created a favourable climate for the
macro-economy in the coming years, work is still needed to made
further breakthroughs in economic reform, today's China Daily
quoted Chinese economists as saying.
</P>
<P>
Many experts attending a seminar on China's economic trends
held recently held that the top problem faced by Chinese decision
makers is how to rejuvenate State enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The problems faced by these enterprises are still tough since
the number of unprofitable ones keep rising, with many products
stored in warehouses and with about 10 million workers having been
laid off, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Many of them held that duplicated industrial structures were
the main reason for the low efficiency, and proposed taking bolder
measures to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Another factor obstructing the sound development of the
national economy is the reform in financial sector lagging far
behind that in other sectors, the scholars noted.
</P>
<P>
State banks, as the main channel from which State enterprises
can get capital, have shouldered nearly all responsibilities and
risks of investment. As a result of more enterprises'
unprofitability, State banks find themselves bonded by many bad
loans.
</P>
<P>
Participants feel it is necessary to establish diversified
capital markets so that risk shouldered by State banks can be
lessened and idle capital can find more channels to invest.
</P>
<P>
Most experts believe that general principle for the future
macro-economy should be "advancement in a stable economic climate".
</P>
<P>
They suggested the investment scale should not be further
expanded. Moreover, they acknowledged that the key point lies in
how to readjust the duplicated industrial structures and improve
the quality of economic growth rather than simply turn to another
round of increasing investment.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Rules out Another War With India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan today ruled out any chance of another war between India
and Pakistan, but warned it will be horrible if it happens.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with BBC here today, Ayub Khan said, while
answering a question about the possibility of a war between India
and Pakistan, "I hope not, and at least we will not be the first
to do any thing like this".
</P>
<P>
He also said, "I hope the war will not come, it brings about
sufferings, it pushes the countries back."
</P>
<P>
"I personally think there will be no war because of the fact
that there has been such an escalation of weaponry on both sides
and the sophistication of those weapons and that both countries
have acquired technology which will be horrible if used", he added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Pakistan could reach an agreement with India on the
core issue of Kashmir in the forthcoming long- awaited meeting
between the two Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan in Male, he
said, "We should go step by step."
</P>
<P>
Ayub Khan left here today for Male, capital of Maldives, to
attend a ministerial meeting of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC). The SAARC summit is expected to open
in Male next Monday.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Income Key to Agriculture Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- It could be imperative for the
government to ensure gains in farmers' cash income this year in
order to fulfill its agricultural targets, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The "Economic Green Paper '97", an annual reported released on
Friday, predicts that cereal output may equal the record harvest of
last year if farmers can expect a further increase in their income
and build up their investment and if no major natural disasters
occur.
</P>
<P>
The paper was jointly compiled by the Institute of Rural
Development under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the
General Organizations of Rural Social-Economic Surveys under the
State Statistics Bureau (SSB). This is the fifth time the two
institutions have produced such an annual report.
</P>
<P>
The paper points out that it is normal for grain output to dip
slightly because the primary industry outperformed last year as
the weather was benign and the government substantially increased
procurement prices of grain.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that more severe natural disasters may
strike this year and the government is unlikely to significantly
increase grain-purchase prices again.
</P>
<P>
The output of cotton and oil-bearing crops will be about the
same as last year and that of fruits, meat and poultry may grow to
some extent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese farmers produced 490 million tons of
cereals, 23 million tons more than the previous record in 1995.
Rural per capita income is expected to grow by nine percentage
points in real terms in 1996, the fastest since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
The paper said farmers' expectations for high income increase
is the most important factor behind the hefty output growth.
</P>
<P>
The unexpectedly high cereal output, however, strained the
country's already fragile grain-marketing system and created
selling difficulties in some regions.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish sales have somewhat slowed farmers' income growth
during the first quarter and could prompt them to cut agricultural
investment if the trend is not reversed soon, according to Xian
Zude, deputy head of SSB's rural survey team.
</P>
<P>
Initial statistics indicate that farmers increased their grain
acreage by 2.2 percent last winter, a sign that summer grain
output may equal or exceed that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Summer grain makes up one-fifth of the year's total.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Urges U.S. to Lower Trade Barriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Brazil on Thursday urged the
United States to lower its trade barriers with the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Washington maintains too many trade barriers with the Southern
Common Market, said Francisco Dornelles, Brazil's industry,
commerce and tourism minister, during a meeting of ministers and
businessmen at the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. restricts the imports of 27 Brazilian products,
including orange juice, steel, footwear and textiles.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Mercosur partners -- Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay
-- have also complained about U.S.' trade barriers against their
goods.
</P>
<P>
Dornelles also reaffirmed at the meeting his government's
commitment to the goal set at the 1994 Miami summit -- the
creation of a pan-American free trade area by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Known as the Free Trade Area of the Americas, the world's
largest free trade zone would join 750 million people in 34
countries as diverse as Haiti and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from the 34 countries will meet next week in
Belo Horizonte, the capital of the Brazilian state of Minas
Gerais, to discuss the creation of the trade bloc.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Professionalize Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto
de Ocampo has directed the Securities and Exchange Commission to
come up with a list of important issues to be addressed to
professionalize the country's stock market.
</P>
<P>
According to today's local newspaper reports, de Ocampo also
ordered to look deeper into the practice of "rumor mongering" in
the stock exchange so as to have an early warning system devised
to "cure" the so-called insider trading.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo said he expected the Securities and Exchange
Commission to submit the list of possible measures for discussion
at a Cabinet meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Among the policies expected to be put in place are those that
would discourage insider trading and policies on the distribution
of initial public offering shares (IPO).
</P>
<P>
Insider trading is the practice of using privileged information
by market players, while an IPO is the process of selling and
listing the shares of a company in the stock market for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
De Ocampo's order came before media reports that the share
prices on Manila Stock Exchange sank for the third session Friday,
falling 10.71 points to close at 2,671.39.
</P>
<P>
The share prices had suffered serious declines in the past 30
days due to speculation that the Philippines would have a
Thailand-style financial crisis caused by the glut of real estate
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange index, a basket of 30 companies, nose-dived
128.87 points to close at 2,708.44 on April 29, the sharpest
plunge in more than two years.

BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- By April 22, approximately 2.167
million ha of China's winter wheat crop were suffering the ill
effects of drought, according to a recent issue of China Water
Resources News.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the State Anti-Flood and Drought

virtually no effective rainfall over most of northern China since
mid April and temperatures are slightly higher than usual.
</P>
<P>
In northern China this is the planting season for the autumn
harvest.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Yangtze River Water Resources Commission are
predicting that a severe flood is likely on the Yangtze River this
year, and that the upper reaches of the river, which are usually
immune to flooding, are more flood-prone in months ahead.
</P>
<P>
So local governments along the river are stepping up efforts to

<P>
WELLINGTON, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Don McKinnon
said New Zealand should shed its image as a solely European
country.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered in the South Island city of Denedin
Friday, the minister noted that for over 30 years, NZ has had a
place in the UN's Western European and Other group. But it is no
longer appropriate for NZ to be seen as part of Europe, the local
paper The Dominion reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Several variants are possible," he said. "But we are
determined to put behind us the image of being solely a European
country. We should look at the option of an association with the
Asian group at the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Such a move would be a transitional step toward a serious
reform of the UN group system.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon stressed the importance of NZ's relationships with
countries of the Asia-Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Background: ABCs of Basic Law of Hong Kong SAR (73-74) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 10 (Xinhua) -- Following are the ABCs of the Basic
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (73-74) in a
question-and-answer format:
</P>
<P>
Question: What does the Basic Law stipulate regarding ship
register and access to the ports?
</P>
<P>
Answer: Hong Kong is a free port and a well-known international
shipping center. To maintain and develop its position in this
regard, Article 125 of the Basic Law stipulates, "The Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region shall be authorized by the Central
People's Government to continue to maintain a shipping register
and issue related certificates under existing legislation, using
the name 'Hong Kong, China'."
</P>
<P>
Regarding access to the ports of Hong Kong, Article 126 of the
Basic Law stipulates, "With the exception of foreign warships,
access for which requires the special permission of the Central
People's Government, ships shall enjoy access to the ports of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with the
laws of the Region."
</P>
<P>
Question: Will foreign airlines registered in Hong Kong be
allowed to continue their operation after 1997?
</P>
<P>
Answer: According to the Basic Law, the government of the Hong
Kong SAR will provide conditions and adopt measures for
maintaining Hong Kong's status as a center of international and
regional aviation.
</P>
<P>
Article 135 of the Basic Law stipulates that airlines
incorporated and having their principal place of business in Hong
Kong and businesses related to civil aviation functioning there
prior to the establishment of the Hong Kong SAR may continue to
operate.
</P>
<P>
The right of ownership and investment of foreign airlines will
be protected in Hong Kong according to law. At the same time, the
central government, consulting the government of the Hong Kong
SAR, will make arrangements to provide flights between Hong Kong
and other parts of China for airlines incorporated and having
their principal place of business in Hong Kong and China's other
airlines.
</P>
<P>
With authorization from the central government, the government
of the Hong Kong SAR may conclude new air service agreements with
foreign countries.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
economic news briefs from Latin American countries over the past
few days:

powdered milk, said the Milk Producers Inter-Cooperative Board.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-nine thousand tons of the total sold (77 percent) went to

Argentine dairy industry. An official report said that total
powdered milk production was 183,487 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
PANAMA CITY -- Panamanian mining industry has already invested
50 million U.S. dollars this year, said Luis Villarreal, the new
president of the Panamanian Mining Chamber.
</P>
<P>
The mining sector invested more than 200 million dollars during
the last five years, increasing exports and strengthening the
international balance of payments.
</P>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA -- Colombia trade deficit with Venezuela
continues increasing despite the results of the economic
adjustment plan adopted since April of last year.

</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- The European Union grants Nicaragua 50 million

122 percent during the first four months of this year, compared to
the same period of 1996, reaching 35,877 units.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan Motor Vehicle Manufacturing Chamber attributed
the increase to the easy conditions for acquisition and payment of
vehicles with fixed rates of yearly interest. Also for fear of a
currency devaluation, people prefer to contract debts and buy a
durable good, instead of waiting for the rate of inflation to
change.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- National air traffic increased 25 percent during
the first quarter of this year compared to the same period of
1996.

</P>
<P>
The figures at the close of 1996 were 295 million dollars and
1.6 percent of the GDP, respectively. The Central Bank of Uruguay

to the reform of the state and of government investments.
</P>
<P>

the first quarter of this year, compared to the same period of
1996, as shown by Central Bank statistics.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 10 (Xinhua) -- A canal is being dug in one of
China's leading scenic spots to link a beautiful lake with deserts
for tourist purposes.
</P>
<P>
The 'Shahu' (Sand and Lake) Scenic Area, which is located 56
kilometers to the north of Yinchuan, the capital of the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Reion and which is one of China's 35 major scenic
spots, has the unique beauty of areas south of the Yangtze River
and the grandeur of the desert.
</P>
<P>
In order to make the 24-sq km area more attractive, the
autonomous regional government has decided to spend 3.5 million
yuan (421,680 US dollars) on a nine-km-long canal to connect the
lake with the surrounding desert area.
</P>
<P>
The canal will be filled with water diverted from the Yellow
River. It is expected to be completed in July, and will
accommodate pleasure-boats taking tourists to scenic spots.
</P>
<P>
Currently under construction is the first phase of the project
where an inner-ring canal will be dug. The planned second phase
calls for an outer-ring canal, local officials said.

ATHENS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting European Commission
President Jacques Santer today stressed the need for majority
decision-making within the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Addressing at an event in Athens to celebrate Europe Day today,
Santer said that unanimity was becoming increasingly difficult to
achieve as the EU enlarged.
</P>
<P>
"In order to avoid this difficulty, we should extend wherever
possible the use of the majority vote. If we don't, we are in
danger of getting involved in a circle of immobilization,
resulting in a lack of credibility and undermining of trust," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the question of flexibility should act as a
catalyst for greater integration within the EU and not an agent of
division.
</P>
<P>
It should only be used as a last resort when all other efforts,
with the participation of all 15 member states, failed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Santer also emphasized that equality between member states
should be fully respected while the commission should undergo
certain adjustments such as a reduction in the number of
commissioners and a review of its organization.
</P>
<P>
Europe Day commemorates the day in 1950 when Robert Schuman
made a proclamation paving the way for the foundation of the

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 9 (Xinhua) -- New York stocks rose modestly today
after see-sawing amid different interpretations of Alan
Greenspan's remarks on inflation and interest rate policy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained rose 32.91 points to
7,169.53, having recovered from a 42-point deficit after giving up
an early 60-point gain. The blue-chip barometer ended the week
with a gain of nearly 100 points, but below Tuesday's record high
of 7,225.32.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by an 8-to-5 margin, with the
volume totaling 455.62 million shares, down from 534.12 million in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list was up 4.50 at 824.76, and
the NYSE composite index was up 2.33 at 429.23.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index was up 4.18 at 1,335.01, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.83 at 573.78.
</P>
<P>
Stocks opened higher with bonds amid speculation that
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, had hinted the
central bank won't need to raise interest rates aggressively to
protect against inflation.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan, in a speech in New York late Thursday, was not
explicit about what Fed policy-makers would do when they next meet
on May 20. But many investors took his remarks to mean that at
most, the Fed would raise rates this month and then wait for some
time.
</P>
<P>
After the initial enthusiasm over Greenspan's remarks wore off,
bond prices fell, and the yielding on 30-year Treasury bonds rose
higher.
</P>
<P>
Today, it rose as high as 6.94 percent before retreating to
6.89 percent as bonds recovered in the afternoon.

brigade, as saying that "we have all the necessary forces at our
disposal" to prevent any possible armed conflicts between Bosnian
Muslims and Serbs.

Army is preparing a large-scale offensive against the Serb entity
in August this year.
</P>
<P>
The targeted places of the offensive will be "Brcko, Doboj and

<HEADLINE> European Shares Mixed, London Ends at 6th Peak Running </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 9 (Xinhua) -- Europe's major stock markets ended
mixed Friday, with London extending its recent strong gains and
surging to the six consecutive record closing high while Paris
finishing in the negative ground.
</P>
<P>
The recent record-breaking run on the London market continued
on the back of a momentous performance by financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
Aided also by strong gilts and oil stocks as well as Wall
Street's big opening gains, the FTSE 100 index soared more than
one percent or 50.5 points to a new record close of 4,630.9, the
six one in a row and a gain of 175.3 points over last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Takeover talk and a shortage of finance stocks sent prices up
sharply, accounting for most of the index's gains.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares ended a dull session slightly
higher in thin trade as most traders were still away from the
market since the Ascension Thursday's holiday break.
</P>
<P>
The market was underpinned by firm bunds, strong futures and
the Dow's overnight strong close, with the DAX-30 index ending up
10.43 points at 3,562.41, a rise of 102.04 points on last week.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse had a bad day, as dollar weakness and anxiety
ahead of the forthcoming general election weighed on market
sentiment and trading was light as many market players took a long
weekend break after Thursday's market holiday.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 index finished down 9.4 points at 2,633.91, 21.4
points down on the week.

<HEADLINE> Research Team Finds Location of Colossus in Rhodes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 9 (Xinhua) -- A research team said today that the
location of the colossus of Rhodes, one of the seven wonders of
the ancient world, was possibly at the entrance to Mandraki
harbor where the statues of two fawns stand today.
</P>
<P>
Professor Evangelos Lekkas, who is leading the research team,
announced the findings while attending the fourth international
symposium on the preservation of Mediterranean monuments which is
currently being held in the southeastern Greek island of Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
The team reportedly studied the effects of earthquakes and
other natural disasters on Rhodes in the classical and medieval
periods.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lekkas said that a major earthquake in 227 BC was
accompanied by "seismic breaches" which caused significant damage
to monuments on the island and resulted in the collapse of the
colossus, no remains of which have ever been found.
</P>
<P>
The colossus of Rhodes, a large bronze statue of the sun god,
Helios, is believed to have been built in whole or in part by
chares of Lindus (Rhodes) between 292 and 280 BC.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Rejects German Charge Against Ciller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 9 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Foreign Ministry today
categorically rejected a German court charge that Turkish Foreign
Minister Tansu Ciller was connected with drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said in a written statement that it was
regretful that the German court made such an "irresponsible" claim
that was said to base only on a testimony of a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
This kind of claim was "baseless" and against the basic
principle of the international law, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after a Frankfurt court reiterated early
this week a claim by Judge Rolf Schwalbe several months ago that
Ciller was linked with international drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The statement, quoted by the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency, noted that Turkey was considering whether to take legal
action agaisnt the German court.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey requested information and documents about this but
until now no proof has been presented," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"we hope that this sort of development will not reflect on
Turkish-German relations in a negative way," it added.
</P>
<P>
Ankara has asked for an official explanation from the German
judiciary. However, the court this week reaffirmed its views.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, which historically attaches great importance to its
relations with Germany, has experienced a bitter time in
Turkish-German ties due to some key issues, such as Ankara's bid
for full EU membership, Cyprus issue as well as the alleged
Turkey's human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Germany, the most important money donator in the EU, was
regarded by Turkey as the biggest stumbling block for its success
in fully entering the EU.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan gave German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel an embarrassing reception during his last
month visit to Turkey to discuss the EU membership issue.
</P>
<P>
The alleged drug-related claim against Ciller, who is also the
chairwoman of the junior coalition partner True Path Party, was
widely seen as another sign of worsening ties between the two
countries.

medium-sized firms and town-and-village enterprises.

of 40 enterprises in China, mainly in the Heilongjiang Province
as well as overseas.
