	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ The Streak is over.
	   After 16 years and 2,632 consecutive baseball games, Cal Ripken
took himself out of the Baltimore Orioles' starting lineup Sunday
night and did not play in the game _ ending the most amazing iron
man record in sports history.
	   ``I think the time is right,'' Ripken told manager Ray Miller.
	   The 38-year-old third baseman said he was not hurt. But with the
Orioles out of playoff contention and playing their final home game
of the season against the New York Yankees, Ripken decided to end
the string of games that began on May 30, 1982. He had started
every game during his streak.
	   ``I don't feel a sense of relief. I don't feel much different,''
Ripken said after the game. ``Now that I know what it feels like I
don't want to sit and watch a game anymore.''
	   He said he would return to the starting lineup Monday night at
Toronto.
	   The end of the streak came during a magical season that has
featured the historic home run chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy
Sosa, a perfect game by David Wells and the Yankees' pursuit of the
American League record for victories.
	   ``What Cal did is so unbelievable. That's one record I do think
that will be around for a generation,'' baseball commissioner Bud
Selig said. ``What he's done, he's done a great thing for
baseball.''
	   Albert Belle of the Chicago White Sox played his 327th straight
game Sunday, the next-longest string in the majors.
	   There had been recent talk that Ripken would volunteer to end
the streak, which broke Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 in 1995.
Before the game, he walked into Miller's office and asked to have
his name removed from the lineup. Rookie Ryan Minor started in his
place. The Yankees won 5-4,
	   ``The emphasis should be on the team,'' Ripken said. ``There
have been times during the streak when the emphasis was on the
streak. I was never comfortable with that.''
	   One out into the game, when it became evident that Ripken would
not be playing, all of the Yankees walked to the top step of the
dugout, stood and applauded.
	   Ripken emerged from the Orioles dugout, tipped his hat toward
the Yankees and stepped back down to the bench. With the sellout
crowd standing and cheering, Ripken came out again and bowed to his
fans.
	   There was an immediate rush to the souvenir stands at Camden
Yards, with fans lining up to buy programs to mark the historic
night.
	   As the game progressed, Ripken appeared relaxed as he laughed
with teammates on the bench. He then watched much of the game from
the Orioles bullpen, occasionally shaking hands with fans and
posing for pictures.
	   He emerged in the sixth inning to warm up left fielder B.J.
Surhoff and chatted with his best friend on the team, center
fielder Brady Anderson.
	   Ripken also shook hands with fans in the bleachers along the
outfield wall, much in the same fashion he did when he broke
Gehrig's record. This time, however, he wore a warmup jacket over
his uniform.
	   Ripken's statistics this year _ .273 with 14 home runs and 61
RBIs _ are among the lowest of his career, which began in 1981.
	   While it would seem no one will ever again play in 2,632
consecutive games, the man who broke Gehrig's seemingly unbreakable
record by more than 500 isn't so sure the record will be his for
eternity.
	   On Sept. 6, 1995, Ripken passed the record set by Gehrig, who
was forced from the game by a rare muscular disorder that later
became known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
	   Then a shortstop, Ripken became the sport's all-time iron man on
June 14, 1996, when he played in his 2,216th consecutive game _
surpassing the record previously held by Japan's Sachio Kinugasa.
	   ``A lot of people think this is a great, great accomplishment,''
Ripken said after breaking Kinugasa's mark. ``But I really believe
that somebody else will come along and play more games, because if
I can do it, somebody else definitely will. I don't consider myself
superhuman and I'm not an iron man physically or mentally.''
	   Baseball's humble hero, Ripken was credited by many with
singlehandedly saving baseball in the aftermath of the bitter 1994
players' strike that canceled the World Series and alienated fans.
	   The streak was something poetic at a time many thought baseball
had lost its romance.
	   Ripken did not establish his streak by playing timidly. He dived
and leaped and slid with the best of them, and there were plenty of
close calls that almost brought the streak to an end.
	   The closest came in the middle of the 1997 season, when back
spasms nearly forced Ripken to sit out a game in Anaheim. But he
played in pain and hit the game-winning home run.
	   While The Streak will ultimately be recognized as Ripken's most
notable feat, Ripken has also excelled on the field. He appeared in
his 16th straight All-Star game this summer and was named AL most
valuable player in 1991 and 1983, the last year the Orioles won the
World Series.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A crowd of demonstrators briefly
chased after Queen Elizabeth's motorcade, but only to get a peek
before resuming chants for political reform near a Malaysian
courthouse where the country's former deputy prime minister was
expected to be arraigned.
	   ``Obviously she saw them when she passed by,'' but made no
comment, said Geoff Crawford, the queen's press secretary.
	   Later, the crowd swelled to 2,000 people and police fired water
cannon and tear gas to disperse the protesters.
	   Queen Elizabeth has stepped into the midst of a roiling
political drama in Southeast Asia during a four-day state visit to
officiate at the closing of the 16th Commonwealth Games, the first
ever to be held in Asia.
	   Mahathir, who was expected on Monday to meet the queen and her
husband, Prince Phillip, triggered the political turmoil by firing
his former heir-apparent, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2.
	   The ex-finance minister and former deputy prime minister has
since been fighting for his freedom and political life. Anwar has
repeatedly denied leaked police accusations of everything from
sexual misconduct to treason.
	   He has responded by orchestrating a series of nationwide
political rallies and calling for Mahathir's resignation after 17
years in power.
	   A spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office in London said that
while the situation was being monitored very closely, no changes
had been made in the queen's schedule due to the political
disturbances.
	   Anwar was arrested late Sunday in a police raid on his home, and
was due to be charged in Sessions Court on Monday morning on a
charge of sodomy, which he has vehemently denied.
	   About 500 of his supporters, having waited more than two hours
for his appearance, were protesting there when they queen was
driven by, on her way to a formal welcoming ceremony in Parliament
Square.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who had intended to leave
Monday night for an important meeting of the United Nations General
Assembly, decided to stay with the queen until the end of her visit
on Wednesday.
	   Cook's decision was made after Anwar had addressed a crowd of
35,000 supporters in central Merdeka (Freedom) Square, leading them
in chants against Mahathir.
	   The demonstration had begun as the royal couple were worshiping
in St. Mary's Cathedral, next to the square. It was the first
public event of her trip to Malaysia, which she has not visited
since 1989.
	   But Anwar told reporters before his arrest that his protest
movement would not intentionally strive to complicate the queen's
visit.
	   ``I don't think Malaysians would want to embarrass the queen in
any way. This is a domestic matter.
	   ``I know Mr. Cook quite well,'' Anwar had said. ``And I know his
concern and commitment with humanitarian issues.''

Pakistani shooter disqualified for drug use
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A Pakistani shooter was
disqualified at the Commonwealth Games for using a drug that helps
to lower the heart rate, officials said Monday.
	   The shooter was found to have used beta-blockers, Michael
Fennell, chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation, told
reporters. Beta-blockers are banned because they can help shooters
by lessening shaking by their hands.
	   Fennell did not identify the shooter or give any other details.
Pakistani officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   The disqualification was the only doping incident reported at
the 16th Commonwealth Games, which were ending later Monday.
	   Fennel said the federation was not looking at the possibility of
introducing blood tests. Urine tests now are used to check for use
of banned drugs.
	   ``We had one incident with the Pakistani shooter. He was
disqualified from the games. Other than that it has been a dope
free-games,'' he said.

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Hurricane Georges lashed the
easternmost islands of the Caribbean, whipping up high seas as
families huddled in basements and businesses piled sandbags in
front of their entrances.
	   Hurricane warnings were in effect for the islands of the
northeast Caribbean, from Dominica westward to Puerto Rico.
	   U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Roy Schneider imposed a curfew Sunday
evening and activated the National Guard. ``We must take the
appropriate steps to protect life and property,'' he said.
	   Georges swelled to 150 mph (240 kph) winds at one point Sunday,
then later weakened from a category 4 to a category 3 hurricane
with 115 mph (185 kph) winds.
	   Still, forecasters warned it could gain strength again.
Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of southern Florida in
1992, was a category 4.
	   Residents of Guadeloupe and Dominica, fearing the hurricane
would peel their roofs off, moved beds into basements or headed to
hurricane shelters in schools. Church congregations on many islands
cut short Sunday services to convert their sanctuaries into
shelters.
	   At 0300 GMT Monday, Georges' center was 30 miles (48 kilometers)
east-southeast of Antigua. It had slowed slightly to 16 mph (25
kph) and was forecast to sweep west-northwest through the Lesser
Antilles, threatening Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands on Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center in
Miami.

U.N. chief to receive dlrs 200,000 Seoul Peace Prize
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan has
been selected as the recipient of the dlrs 200,000 Seoul Peace
Prize, South Korean organizers said Monday.
	   The biennial prize was set up in 1990 to commemorate the 1988
Seoul Olympics. Past recipients include International Olympic
Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch, former U.S. Secretary
of State George Shultz and the relief organization Doctors Without
Borders.
	   The prize committee said Annan was chosen ``in recognition of
his distinguished contribution to world peace through international
diplomatic and humanitarian endeavors.''
	   Among other things, Annan negotiated the repatriation of more
than 900 international staff and Western hostages following the
outbreak of the Gulf War in 1990 and helped focus attention on the
plight of 500,000 Asians stranded in Iraq and Kuwait as a result of
hostilities, it said.
	   Annan will be given the prize whenever it is convenient for him
to visit Seoul, the committee said.

China's railways to speed up trains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's railways will mark the country's Oct. 1
National Day holiday by raising speeds on many rail lines, reducing
traveling time and improving efficiency, the official China Daily
reported Monday.
	   The Ministry of Railways will increase the speeds of trains on
three main lines _ Beijing-Guangzhou, Beijing-Shanghai and
Beijing-Harbin _ to as fast as 160 kilometers per hour (100 miles
per hour), the report said.
	   The China Daily said train service would be expanded when a new
timetable is released Oct. 1, but that ticket prices would remain
the same.
	   To prevent accidents due to the higher speed of some lines, the
railways were working to fence off 1,453 kilometers (908 miles) of
track before the end of September, it said.
	   The report did not say what the current speeds of the lines
were, however.
	   China's railways have been struggling to improve their
profitability and compete with airlines and other transport
industries for both passengers and cargo.

Chinese officials sentenced to life in jail for peddling government
</HEADLINE>
posts

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two local government officials in eastern China
have been sentenced to life in prison for peddling government posts
to hundreds of people, the official newspaper China Daily reported
Monday.
	   Xing Dangying, county Communist Party chief in Pizhou, eastern
Jiangsu province, was convicted of taking bribes and illegal gifts
worth 482,000 yuan (dlrs 58,000) from dozens of people. At one
point, Xing dismissed 600 officials en masse and redistributed jobs
to the highest bidders, the report said.
	   Chen Guangli, another county party chief in Lianshui, Jiangsu,
was similarly found guilty of taking 570,000 (dlrs 69,000) in
bribes and gifts, it said.
	   The cases highlight the government's difficulties in wiping out
rampant corruption by officials in China.
	   In addition to life sentences for Xing and Chen, Huang Dengren,
county party chief in nearby Shuyuan, was sentenced to 15 years in
prison for taking bribes. One official appointed by Huang to the
post of county police chief was found to have tortured suspects,
embezzled money and taken bribes, the report added.
	   A fourth official, Li Shuchun of Xiangshui, Jiangsu, was
sentenced to 12 years in prison for similar offenses, the report
said.

streak at 2,632, sitting out Baltimore's loss to New York.

Police charge Anwar supporters, fire tear gas and water cannon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES grafs 1-10 with police charging crowd, Anwar's
whereabouts unknown, staffers fleeing tear gas-filled courthouse
 &UR; AP Photos available
 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse 2,000 supporters of the country's
ousted deputy prime minister in a second day of street clashes.
	   Pounding batons on their heavy shields, police charged into the
crowd, which was chanting ``reform, reform.'' There were some
injuries among the demonstrators, who had rallied outside a
downtown courthouse to see their ousted leader, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar, who was tossed out of the government earlier this month,
was expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and disturbing
the public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night could add a
volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic troubles.
	   The official Bernama news agency quoted national police chief
Abdul Rahim Noor as saying that Anwar could be held under the
Internal Security Act, a harsh measure providing for indefinite
imprisonment without trial for those deemed a threat to national
security.
	   Abdul refused to say where Anwar was being held Monday.
	   His detention has already threatened to overshadow a visit by
Queen Elizabeth II to Kuala Lumpur and her festive closing of the
16th Commonwealth Games. The queen's motorcade passed the throng of
noisy pro-reform demonstrators outside the courthouse.
	   ``We're here to support Anwar because he's innocent. He didn't
do all those crazy things,'' said Haji Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old
businessman and member of the UMNO ruling party. ``We want him as
our prime minister.''
	   More than 100 reporters thronged the Sessions Court, expecting
to see Anwar brought in to hear the charges against him. Anwar has
been leading the increasingly public opposition to the 17-year-rule
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   However, late Monday morning, prosecutors said Anwar would stay
in jail while police gather more evidence against him.
	   As tear gas poured into the courthouse, frightened lawyers and
court staff rushed outside, holding handkerchiefs and cloths over
their faces.
	   Police used tear gas and water cannon to break up a march on the
prime minister's residence Sunday night.
	   Though the 51-year-old Anwar was held incommunicado, his wife
Azizah Ismail, spoke to reporters.
	   She said her husband had been taken into custody by a SWAT team
that broke down the front door. She called it ``unwarranted''
especially since her lawyers had promised the attorney general that
Anwar would not resist arrest.
	   Anwar's wife expressed apprehension about any further protests
like the huge demonstration that preceded her husband's arrest
Sunday night, but she added: ``The struggle will go on. It's better
to die in dignity and honor.''
	   Hundreds of Anwar's allies shouted angrily, ``God is great!''
and ``Long live Anwar!'' shaking their fists as police led him away
from the house Sunday.
	   Most newspapers featured pictures of Anwar's arrest, while some
showed him clutching his wife as police closed in.
	   Police burst into Anwar's home almost at the same time riot
officers fired tear gas and water cannon at a crowd of several
thousand people who were marching toward Mahathir's official
residence.
	   Many of them had come from a crowd of about 35,000 who joined
Anwar in the National Mosque and the capital's central Merdeka
(Freedom) Square, chanting for Mahathir's resignation Sunday.
	   Malaysia had hoped the royal visit and the Games would give a
much-needed publicity boost to this economically faltering nation,
but the political showdown has seized much of the world's
attention.
	   Several police helicopters swooped low over the capital, as part
of a hefty security force.
	   Newspapers have been carrying banner-headlined stories
containing explicit details of Anwar's alleged sodomy offenses.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges, saying they were cooked
up by Mahathir, who fears Anwar's growing popularity and any
challenge to his rule.
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's handpicked successor, is now his
principal foe.

Earthquake shakes Indonesian provincial town, no major damage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A magnitude 5.6 earthquake beneath the
Indian Ocean shook an Indonesian coastal town Monday, seismologists
said.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage.
	   The Department of Meteorology and Geophysics said the quake's
epicenter was about 210 kilometers (130 miles) south of Jakarta,
meteorologist Waan Tarmin said.
	   Residents of Pelabuhan Ratu, on the southwest coast of the main
island of Java, said their house shook when the quake hit at 1.21
a.m (1821 GMT).
	   Earthquakes are common in Indonesia, which sits on the so-called
Pacific ``Ring of Fire,'' a series of volcanoes and fault lines
that stretches from North America across through Japan and
Southeast Asia to the South Pacific.

Virus outbreak threatens Australian chicken exports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tests confirming virulent poultry disease.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Biological test on Monday confirmed
that birds at two western Sydney chicken farms have a virulent
strain of Newcastle disease, which threatens poultry exports.
	   Chief Veterinary officer Dick Jane said the disease did not
present a public health risk to poultry consumers.
	   An outbreak of the disease at Glenorie and Blacktown farms
forced the state of New South Wales to impose restrictions on the
movement of poultry in the metropolitan area Sunday.
	   New South Wales Agriculture spokesman Bill Muldrew said that
100,000 chickens will be destroyed in an operation that will begin
Monday night.
	   Australia has been free of Newcastle disease in the virulent
form since the 1930s but any outbreak could seriously jeopardize
exports, an agriculture spokesman said.
	   A total of 1,200 chickens had died at the farms so far and
although the disease did not present a public health risk to
consumers of poultry, caged and show birds could be at risk, he
said.
	   Authorities had no idea how the disease got into the farm, but
it could be passed on by pigeons and wild birds or be spread
through the air.
	   A restricted area around the two affected properties prevents
the movement of birds, litter and manure out of the area. Movement
of birds within and through the restricted area will require a
permit.

Firebomb attack carried out on Australia's Jabiluka mine company

<TEXT>
	   DARWIN, Australia (AP) _ A firebomb attack caused more than
100,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 60,000) damage Monday to a
Darwin office of the company building the controversial Jabiluka
uranium mine.
	   Four gasoline-filled beer bottles were thrown at the Energy
Resources of Australia office between 1:45 and 2 a.m., a police
spokeswoman said.
	   One went through a window while the remaining three were found
outside the office, which houses ERA's environment monitoring
division.
	   The fire caused more than 100,000 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs
60,000) damage to the office's front room and computer equipment,
ERA's principal environmental engineer, Mark Daniell said.
	   Police have not yet said if they suspect a link between the
attack and recent demonstrations throughout Australia against ERA's
planned uranium mine in an area surrounded by Kakadu National Park.
The mine is opposed by the area's traditional owners and
environmentalists.
	   Anti-uranium protesters distanced themselves from the Darwin
attack.
	   ``We are a peaceful protest. This was not endorsed in any way by
the protesters. We strongly disapprove of these types of tactics,''
said Sarojani Krishnapillai, a spokeswoman for the protesters.
	   In another incident Monday, a man chained himself to the office
of a rural National Party member of Parliament and threatened to
blow himself up if the government did not change its policy on
uranium mining at Jabiluka.
	   The siege ended safely more than four hours later when police
overpowered the 50-year-old man.
	   The Jabiluka mine, which is expected to dig up almost 20 million
metric tons of uranium ore in 28 years, is supported by the current
conservative government of Prime Minister John Howard.
	   But it is opposed by Labor, which says it will stop the project
it it wins government and there are no legally enforceable
contracts in place.

Amid Russia's turmoil, `blind town' struggles to carry on

<TEXT>
	   RUSINOVO, Russia (AP) _ At first glance, this small town seems a
typical product of Soviet urban design, with just a few hints of
its unique nature _ guide rails along the sidewalks, rubber treads
that serve as a road map on a factory floor, Braille on office
doors.
	   Rusinovo is better known as the ``city of the blind,'' because
about 300 of the 1,000 residents are without sight.
	   In a country that traditionally has provided little help to
people with disabilities, Rusinovo for decades offered the rare
promise of meaningful work and a full life for the blind. But now
it's all falling apart.
	   The settlement, about 65 miles (105 kilometers) south of Moscow,
dates to 1948, when the National Association of the Blind built a
factory and apartment buildings to assist Russians who lost their
sight to wounds and illnesses during World War II.
	   ``It was a good intention _ to create normal conditions for the
blind, both for life, and for work,'' said Viktor Kulikov, factory
director and effectively the man in charge of the town's affairs.
	   Over the past half-century, hundreds of blind people have
migrated to Rusinovo. But like so many places in Russia, the town
has been in sharp decline since the Soviet Union collapsed at the
end of 1991, and the government in Moscow lacks the resources to
help.
	   ``We have been left to our own devices,'' said Dmitry Terekhov,
who has lived in Rusinovo for nearly 50 of his 71 years. ``Pensions
are unpaid for two, three months. They have basically abandoned
us.''
	   In Soviet times, the Rusinovo factory assembled parts for the
country's Rubin television sets, but the plant folded several years
ago.
	   The factory switched to making lids for mayonnaise jars. An
average worker can put together 1,500 lids in a day, earning all of
3 rubles, or about 50 U.S. cents. Even those wages often go unpaid
for months.
	   In a sign that reflects the desultory state of the Russian
economy, a note in the factory hallway proclaims: ``The barter shop
can provide goods to the factory staff toward their wages for any
month except the current one.''
	   ``But they only give us junk there _ canned stuff,'' said Nina
Merkulova. ``We would also like to buy chocolate for our
grandchildren, but we never have any money at all.''
	   To pass the time, blind men and women sit around wooden tables,
playing chess in the shade of poplar trees in a small courtyard,
	   The players gently move their hands over the board to feel the
pieces, make a move, and call it out for others: ``Bishop, to E4.''
	   The guide railings and a few signs in Braille _ something not
found elsewhere in Russia _ are about all the special conveniences
that remain in Rusinovo.
	   No one has a seeing-eye dog _ a luxury that's far too expensive.
Disability pensions barely cover utility bills.
	   Still, staying in Rusinovo has attractions for its blind
residents.
	   ``When we are all together, it's easier for us, even in these
hard times,'' said Terekhov.
	   If nothing else, Rusinovo is familiar. A man walks briskly by,
unseeing eyes staring straight ahead, apparently guided by an
ingrained sense of his surroundings.
	   ``The blind have lots of their private landmarks _ a barrier, a
pot hole, a ditch,'' said Nikolai Poputnikov.
	   Now 60, Poputnikov lost his sight at age 4 due to complications
from measles during the war.
	   ``I remember some bright colors _ like red, or white _ those
that kind of stick in your memory,'' he said.
	   He no longer remembers the color of grass, but he does not need
a cane to find his way about and says he can ever ``hear'' air
drifting around him as he moves.
	   Kulikov, the factory director, hopes to revive Rusinovo's past,
and is brimming with ideas. He has written to Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov offering to supply plastic brooms _ another of the
factory's products _ for sweeping Red Square.
	   Meanwhile, the lack of jobs has prompted some of the blind to
beg. They take suburban trains into Moscow and hang out on street
corners and in subway stations, or rummage through garbage heaps
for scraps of food.
	   ``Even if I want to work very much, I can't apply myself,'' said
Erna Strekalova _ a university graduate in literature and one of
the few people in Rusinovo who have been to college.
	   Ms. Strekalova used to work as a local radio host, until the
station closed in January for lack of funds. Now she spends most of
her time reading Braille translations of Russian literary magazines
and helping her 13-year-old son, Maxim, with school work.
	   ``You can sit, grow cobwebs, and sink in the dirt in your dusty
room,'' Strekalova said. ``Or you can try to live. It is difficult.
And often it hurts.''

Police charge Anwar supporters, fire tear gas and water cannon

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse 2,000 supporters of the country's
ousted deputy prime minister in the second day of street clashes.
An army unit was sent onto the streets of the capital to help quell
the demonstrations.
	   Pounding batons on their heavy shields, police charged into the
crowd, which was chanting ``reform, reform.''
	   There were some injuries among the demonstrators, who had
rallied outside a downtown courthouse to see their leader, Anwar
Ibrahim. Some were hauled away bleeding by police.
	   Anwar, who was tossed out of the government earlier this month,
was expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and disturbing
the public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night has added a
volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic troubles.
	   Police swooped in and blocked several access points to the
city's main plaza, Merdeka (Freedom) Square, with jeeps, trucks and
police cars, to keep protesters away.
	   The square is located adjacent to the courthouse, where police
helicopters flew overhead during the scuffles between police and
protesters.
	   More than 1,000 police were frantically working to contain the
angry demonstrators. They were backed by a specially trained unit
of two-dozen reserve army officers.
	   Hundreds of police patrolled the main road to keep people from
gathering in the square. Police chased small mobs of men down the
side streets to get them away from the courthouse.
	   The official Bernama news agency quoted national police chief
Abdul Rahim Noor as saying that Anwar could be held under the
Internal Security Act, a harsh measure providing for indefinite
imprisonment without trial for those deemed a threat to national
security.
	   Abdul refused to say where Anwar was being held Monday.
	   But an aide to Anwar's wife said the family had been told that
he was taken overnight to a maximum security detention camp.
	   His detention has already threatened to overshadow a visit by
Queen Elizabeth II to Kuala Lumpur and her festive closing of the
16th Commonwealth Games. The queen's motorcade passed the throng of
noisy pro-reform demonstrators outside the courthouse.
	   ``We're here to support Anwar because he's innocent. He didn't
do all those crazy things,'' said Haji Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old
businessman and member of the UMNO ruling party. ``We want him as
our prime minister.''
	   More than 100 reporters thronged the Sessions Court, expecting
to see Anwar brought in to hear the charges against him. Anwar has
been leading the increasingly public opposition to the 17-year-rule
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   However, late Monday morning, prosecutors said Anwar would stay
in jail while police gather more evidence against him.
	   As tear gas poured into the courthouse, frightened lawyers and
court staff rushed outside, holding handkerchiefs and cloths over
their faces.
	   Police burst into Anwar's home almost at the same time riot
officers fired tear gas and water cannon at a crowd of several
thousand who were marching toward Mahathir's official residence.
	   Many of them had come from a crowd of about 35,000 who joined
Anwar in the National Mosque and Merdeka Square, chanting for
Mahathir's resignation Sunday.
	   Though the 51-year-old Anwar was held incommunicado, his wife
Azizah Ismail, spoke to reporters.
	   She said her husband had been taken into custody by a SWAT team
that broke down the front door. She called it ``unwarranted''
especially since her lawyers had promised the attorney general that
Anwar would not resist arrest.
	   She expressed apprehension about any further protests like the
huge demonstration that preceded her husband's arrest Sunday night,
but she added: ``The struggle will go on. It's better to die in
dignity and honor.''
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's handpicked successor, is now his
principal foe.

Virus outbreak threatens Australian chicken exports

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Biological test on Monday confirmed
that birds at two western Sydney chicken farms have a virulent
strain of Newcastle disease, which threatens poultry exports.
	   Chief Veterinary officer Dick Jane said the disease did not
present a public health risk to poultry consumers.
	   An outbreak of the disease at Glenorie and Blacktown farms
forced the state of New South Wales to impose restrictions on the
movement of poultry in the metropolitan area Sunday.
	   New South Wales Agriculture department spokesman Bill Muldrew
said that 100,000 chickens will be destroyed in an operation that
will begin Monday night.
	   Australia has been free of Newcastle disease in the virulent
form since the 1930s but any outbreak could seriously jeopardize
exports, an agriculture spokesman said.
	   A total of 1,200 chickens had died at the farms so far and
although the disease did not present a public health risk to
consumers of poultry, caged and show birds could be at risk, he
said.
	   Authorities had no idea how the disease got into the farm, but
it could be passed on by pigeons and wild birds or be spread
through the air.
	   A restricted area around the two affected properties prevents
the movement of birds, litter and manure out of the area. Movement
of birds within and through the restricted area will require a
permit.

Parents of murdered girl sit through grisly evidence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ The parents of murdered Japanese woman
Michiko Okuyama chose to remain in court Monday to view horrific
police photographs of their daughter's damaged skull.
	   A 17-year old man, who cannot be legally named, has pleaded
innocent to the murder of the 22-year-old woman in Cairns in
September 1997.
	   The brutal slaying, which happened in September 1997 as
right-wing member of Parliament Pauline Hanson was campaigning
against Asian immigration, made some Asians fear for their safety
in Australia.
	   Dr. David Williams testified before Cairns Supreme Court that
Okuyama's head injuries were consistent with having been rammed
into a wall with severe force.
	   He believed the girl's head had come into contact with a broad
instrument or had been hit by a broad barrier, and there was no
evidence of a narrow instrument such as a hammer being used.
	   The forensic expert told the court severe force to the face
could have loosened the nasal bone, making it abnormally easy to
remove. Michiko also had five teeth missing.
	   Williams said he was unable to comment on whether there had been
sexual interference. The lower torso was intact when found in a
swamp near Cairns Trinity Bay High School.
	   He said he had found granular material in the girl's trachea
which could represent congealed blood, and found she probably
drowned in her own blood while unconscious.
	   Sgt. Sean Remedios of the Cairns Police Scientific Section
showed photos of blood-stained areas in the vault area of the
building near the Cairns Civic Center where the body of the girl
was allegedly stored before being later dumped.
	   Her parents, Toshie and Hideo Okuyama, watched the trial and
reportedly intend to establish a permanent memorial to their
daughter.
	   The accused's name has been withheld on legal grounds because
was aged 16 at the time of the offense.

	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Australian fullback Joe Roff was
cleared Monday to play in Tuesday's rugby union World Cup qualifier

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Australia's world champion netball
team struggled to overcome New Zealand 42-39 in the gold medal
playoff at the Commonwealth Games on Monday.
	   Captain Vicki Wilson rebounded after a poor start to lead
Australia home with strong shooting in the final quarter. Australia
remained unbeaten through the tournament, lifting its overall
record to 79 wins from its past 81 internationals.
	   Coach Jill McIntosh replaced Wilson with Jennifer Borlase at
halftime but it did nothing to help the favorite and Wilson was
back on court before three-quarter time.
	   Heading into the final quarter the score was 31-all and
Australia led by two points with four minutes remaining before
Wilson goaled to secure the win.
	   ``At this particular moment this means everything,'' Wilson
said. ``It was one of those games that went down to the wire and
you couldn't ask for a better finale, it was quite fitting for the
Commonwealth Games, it was not a walkover by any means.''
	   England won the bronze medal by beating South Africa 56-54.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A crowd of demonstrators briefly
chased after Queen Elizabeth's motorcade Monday, but only to get a
peek before resuming chants for political reform near a courthouse
where Malaysia's former deputy prime minister was expected to be
arraigned.
	   ``Obviously she saw them when she passed by,'' but made no
comment, said Geoff Crawford, the queen's press secretary.
	   Later, the crowd swelled to 2,000 people and police fired water
cannon and tear gas to disperse them.
	   Queen Elizabeth has stepped into the midst of a roiling
political drama in Southeast Asia during a four-day state visit to
officiate at the closing of the 16th Commonwealth Games, the first
ever to be held in Asia.
	   A regal 21-gun salute boomed over Parliament Square early Monday
as part of the official welcome to the British monarch. It drowned
out the whir of a police helicopter, hovering above the nearby
courthouse.
	   Attendants shaded the queen with gold-colored parasols as she
walked a red carpet, inspecting 124 officers of the Royal Malay
Regiment alongside Malaysia's King, Tuanku Ja'afar. A military
brass band played ``God Save the Queen'' and Malaysia's national
anthem.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who attended the ceremony and
met later with the queen and her husband, Prince Phillip, triggered
the political turmoil by firing his former heir-apparent, Anwar
Ibrahim, on Sept. 2.
	   The ex-finance minister and former deputy prime minister has
since been fighting for his freedom and political life. Anwar has
repeatedly denied leaked police accusations of everything from
sexual misconduct to treason.
	   He has responded by orchestrating a series of nationwide
political rallies and calling for Mahathir's resignation after 17
years in power.
	   A spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office in London said that
while the situation was being monitored very closely, no changes
had been made in the queen's schedule due to the political
disturbances.
	   Anwar was arrested late Sunday in a police raid on his home, and
was due to be charged in Sessions Court on Monday morning on a
charge of sodomy, which he has vehemently denied.
	   The queen's press secretary, traveling with her, said, ``If
there were (cause for concern), however, the queen would act on the
advice of her ministers'' and the Malaysian government.
	   About 500 of his supporters, having waited more than two hours
for his appearance, were protesting there when the queen was driven
by, on her way to the welcoming ceremony in Parliament Square.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who had intended to leave
Monday night for an important meeting of the United Nations General
Assembly, decided to stay with the queen until the end of her visit
on Wednesday.
	   Cook's decision was made after Anwar had addressed a crowd of
35,000 supporters in central Merdeka (Freedom) Square on Sunday,
leading them in chants against Mahathir.
	   The demonstration had begun as the royal couple were worshiping
in St. Mary's Cathedral, next to the square. It was the first
public event of her trip to Malaysia, which she has not visited
since 1989.

Indonesian opposition figure sees parallels between Mahathir,
</HEADLINE>
Suharto

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Drawing parallels with the downfall of
Indonesia's ex-President Suharto, a prominent Indonesian opposition
figure Monday predicted that Malaysia's Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad might also step down soon.
	   Amien Rais, a popular Muslim leader and opposition party leader,
said prosecuting sacked Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim could
backfire on Mahathir.
	   ``It's unpopular,'' he said in reaction to the arrest of Anwar
on Sunday.
	   Rais, who heads the National Mandate Party, Mahathir could find
himself in a similar position to that of Suharto, who ruled
neighboring Indonesia for 32 years but was forced to quit last May
after 1,200 died in a wave of student protests and riots.
	   ``There are some similarities between Mahathir and Suharto.
Mahathir has been in power for such a long time,'' Rais said.
	   Rais, a friend and admirer of Anwar, said the forces for reform
in Malaysia appear similar to those in Indonesia where students and
others protested in the streets against corruption and nepotism.
	   ``Anwar has support on the campuses and among the students.
There is snowballing support for Anwar while Mahathir has been
under pressure from the students,'' Rais said.
	   Rais predicted that Anwar would survive politically despite the
charges against him.
	   ``Mahathir is a leader for the past. The future of Malaysia
belongs to Anwar,'' he said.

Official: Government knew airport had problems before opening
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Officials knew of problems at Hong Kong's new
airport weeks before it began operations, but ruled out delaying
the July opening because it would have damaged the government's
reputation, Hong Kong's top civil servant said Monday.
	   Testifying before a panel of legislators as investigations into
the problems began Monday, Chief Secretary Anson Chan said the
government felt the airport had been was ready for operation.
	   Officials had ``looked at the necessary facilities and those
were ready, although not everything was ready,'' said Chan, who is
the most senior government official so far to have testified in the
probes.
	   ``If there were the slightest indication that things were not
practicable ... as a responsible government we would have
reconsidered the date,'' she said.
	   Chan admitted, however, that after the July date was set, it
would have been difficult to change ``because it was a matter of
reputation for us.''
	   Chan also chairs the airport steering committee, which oversees
the U.S. dlrs 20 billion airport project.
	   In July, the much-anticipated opening of Chek Lap Kok airport
broke down into a costly fiasco as computer breakdowns and system
problems crippled both passenger and cargo services.
	   An ensuing ban on air cargo transport that lasted for over a
month was estimated to have cost Hong Kong 0.35 percent of this
year's gross domestic product.
	   Critics widely suspect government officials may have pressured
the airport authority for an early July opening to coincide with a
visit by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who dedicated the airport.
	   Several senior airport officials already have testified in an
ongoing separate, independent probe ordered by Chief Executive Tung
Chee-hwa. The government ombudsman also is expected to launch a
separate probe.
	   Chek Lap Kok airport was built on reclaimed land off a remote
outlying island, replacing the 73-year-old Kai Tak airport.

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Hurricane Georges lashed the
easternmost islands of the Caribbean, whipping up high seas as
families huddled in basements and businesses piled sandbags in
front of their entrances.
	   Hurricane warnings were in effect for the islands of the
northeast Caribbean, from Dominica westward to Puerto Rico.
	   U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Roy Schneider imposed a curfew Sunday
evening and activated the National Guard. ``We must take the
appropriate steps to protect life and property,'' he said.
	   Georges swelled to 150 mph (240 kph) winds at one point Sunday,
then later weakened from a category 4 to a category 3 hurricane
with 115 mph (185 kph) winds.
	   Still, forecasters warned it could gain strength again.
Hurricane Andrew, which devastated parts of southern Florida in
1992, was a category 4.
	   Residents of Guadeloupe and Dominica, fearing the hurricane
would peel their roofs off, moved beds into basements or headed to
hurricane shelters in schools. Church congregations on many islands
cut short Sunday services to convert their sanctuaries into
shelters.
	   At 0300 GMT Monday, Georges' center was 30 miles (48 kilometers)
east-southeast of Antigua. It had slowed slightly to 16 mph (25
kph) and was forecast to sweep west-northwest through the Lesser
Antilles, threatening Puerto Rico and the British and U.S. Virgin
Islands on Monday, according to the National Hurricane Center in
Miami.

Rescued police colonel says Philippine ferry crew abandoned

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Crew members of a Philippine ferry
carrying 454 people that sank in a tropical storm abandoned the
passengers and failed to instruct them to leave the ship, a rescued
police colonel said Monday.
	   ``We were left to fend for ourselves,'' said police
superintendent Napoleon Sesante, one of 311 confirmed survivors
from the sinking of the Princess of the Orient Friday night. At
least 39 people were dead.
	   Sesante said the ship's officers and crew never told passengers
what was happening or what to do as huge waves and strong winds
buffeted the ferry, which tilted, causing the passengers to panic.
	   The ferry's skipper, Capt. Esrum Mahilum, apparently ordered his
crew to abandon the ship when it began to sink but did not relay
this to passengers, Sesante said.
	   ``They didn't say anything, there were no instructions to
passengers. They were irresponsible,'' Sesante said in an interview
over a Manila radio station.
	   Rescuers on ships and helicopters continued their search Monday
off the coast of Cavite province, south of Manila. On Sunday, 17
people were rescued from chilly storm-whipped waters.
	   Maritime officials said several other ships had also reported
difficulties Friday night in tropical storm Vicki, including some
injured passengers. But they said the Princess of the Orient, one
of the Philippines' largest inter-island ferries, should have been
capable of withstanding much worse weather.
	   Survivors said the ship began tilting to the left and sank in
less than an hour.
	   Sesante said he was told after his rescue by the captain of
another ship owned by the same company, Sulpicio Lines, that chains
securing cargo in the Princess of the Orient got detached, allowing
several heavy containers to slide to one side when the ship
encountered strong waves and winds.
	   As the ship began to sink, Sesante called an aide on land using
a cellular phone and asked him to contact people who could rescue
the passengers. The aide called a Manila radio station, which in
turn informed navy and coast guard officials.
	   On Sunday, chief accident investigator Arnie Santiago said the
ship was carrying 15 vehicles and 66 containers of truck parts and
other heavy materials which may not have been properly secured.
	   ``The way the ship tilted indicates that the cargo moved,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   He said the sinking was unusually rapid, and some of the ship's
water seals may have been damaged by a fire in 1997. After the fire
the 24-year-old ship was repaired at a Singapore dry dock.
	   Carlos Go, chief executive officer of Sulpicio Lines, insisted
the ship was seaworthy despite the fire.
	   Sulpicio Lines also owned the Dona Paz, a ferry which collided
with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people died in the sinking of
another ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
	   Anguished relatives have been waiting at a pier in Manila for
the return of rescue ships since Saturday.
	   The company said there were 352 passengers and 102 crew aboard
the ship. No foreigners were reported on board.

Hundreds of protesters gather at Indonesia's Parliament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of pro and anti-government
protesters gathered at Indonesia's Parliament on Monday amid
continuing discontent over soaring food prices and unemployment as
well as impatience with the pace of democratic reform.
	   Witnesses said about 700 workers marched through several streets
and assembled outside the gates of Parliament for a noisy but
peaceful demonstration against President B.J. Habibie.
	   They were met by lines of hundreds of police and troops, but
there were no reports of violence or arrests.
	   A group of about 100 others later rallied nearby in support of
Habibie and were unchallenged by the larger group.
	   Earlier, about 200 students staged a brief protest but later
dispersed.
	   Protests against Habibie have intensified in recent weeks as
Indonesia grapples with its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
There have also been sporadic outbreaks of rioting and looting.
	   Student protests and riots forced former President Suharto to
step down in May, ending 32 years in power.
	   Armed forces commander Gen. Wiranto predicted that civil unrest
might intensify once more as the country's highest legislative body
prepares to debate democratic reforms.
	   The 1,000-member People's Consultative Assembly is set to
convene on Nov. 10 to pass new political laws for parliamentary
elections in May next year.
	   Wiranto has also said that some protesters are being paid by
anti-government groups to demonstrate. He said his troops will take
stern measures to guarantee public order.

Forecaster: new storm in eastern Atlantic might threaten no land
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tropical Storm Ivan formed late Sunday in the
eastern Atlantic, and forecasters said it may spend its entire life
over open water, threatening no land at all.
	   Ivan, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season,
formed less than 600 miles west of the Cape Verde Islands, which
lie just off the northern coast of West Africa.
	   The minimal tropical storm had maximum sustained winds of 40
mph, barely surpassing the 39-mph threshold that makes a depression
a named storm. Tropical storms become hurricanes once top sustained
winds reach 74 mph.
	   ``It's a pretty ragged system. It's not very well organized,''
said Neal Dorst, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center
in Miami.
	   ``It's a danger only to shipping right now,'' Dorst said.
``Other than that, no one should worry too much about it
threatening them _ quite possibly ever.''
	   Ivan may never approach land because of an atmospheric weakness
to its north, Dorst said.
	   ``It's probably going to recurve out to sea, and not threaten
anyone,'' the meteorologist said.
	   At 11 p.m. EDT Sunday, Ivan was centered near 16.9 north
latitude, 34.2 west longitude, or about 580 miles west of Cape
Verde, the hurricane center reported.
	   The system was heading west-northwest near 14 mph, and was
expected to maintain that heading and speed for the next 24 hours.
	   The storm could strengthen Monday, possibly reaching top
sustained winds of 50 mph, Dorst said.

 &UR; By SONYA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Looking to assert himself on the world
stage while settling aside his personal difficulties, U.S.
President Bill Clinton is calling anew for a united international
front to combat terrorists and their new, high-tech ability to kill
and maim.
	   Clinton was going before the 53rd session of the U.N. General
Assembly Monday to press his case that the fight against terrorism
remains a top priority on the world's agenda. It is a subject he
has addressed previously _ before the same audience _ but this time
the president was arguing that advances in technology mean no
nation has the luxury of battling terrorism in its own way.
	   ``He wants to make it clear to the international community that
the fight against terrorism is not a clash of civilizations or
cultures,'' said Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger.
``The dividing line is between those who practice, support and
tolerate terror, and those who understand that terrorism is, plain
and simple, murder.''
	   The White House hoped the image of the president in an
international leadership role would counter that of a testy Clinton
as grand jury witness in video footage also playing Monday before
an American public both curious and reluctant to see it.
	   A White House official said that Clinton showed no outward
concern Sunday that the airing of his testimony in the Monica
Lewinsky investigation would divert public attention from his U.N.
speech.
	   ``He certainly did not indicate that to me,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The official said Clinton would note in his speech the deadly
terror bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and point
out that those attacks are part of a trend being seen around the
world, from Sri Lanka to Kashmir and Egypt.
	   The president also planned to cite a few basic responsibilities
of all nations: to refuse harbor to terrorists, to decline support
for terrorist activities and to confront the reality that
terrorists will seek to use weapons of mass destruction.
	   After his speech, Clinton was to meet with Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and attend a luncheon with other world
leaders at U.N. headquarters. He was closing the day with a speech
at New York University's law school on democracy and the global
economy.
	   On Tuesday, Clinton was to meet Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi in Tarrytown, New York.
	   Monday's speech was Clinton's ninth before the world body. He
previously had addressed five annual meetings and three special
sessions that dealt with drugs, the environment and the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations.
	   Clinton was beginning his day with a visit to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and Foreign Minister Didier Opertti of Uruguay,
the General Assembly president. Berger said that meeting would
focus on Iraq and Kosovo, as well as U.N. financial reforms.
	   Clinton follows Brazil's Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia
on the list of speakers on the first day of the General Assembly's
annual general debate. He is to be followed by South African
President Nelson Mandela, British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and Obuchi among others.
	   The president, along with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
arrived in New York on Sunday night in time for a meeting with
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi. In their hour-long session,
Clinton and Prodi discussed the economic situation in Italy,
Russia's economy and its new government, the crisis in Albania and
efforts to negotiate peace in Kosovo.
	   Clinton is among 26 heads of state, two crown princes, one vice
president and 152 other emissaries who will have the chance to
address the General Assembly this week.
	   Of particular note Monday on the sidelines of the debate will be
an eight-nation meeting on the tensions between Iran and the
Taliban militia that rules most of Afghanistan.
	   Later in the week, Africa tops the agenda of a major ministerial
conference on the tensions and problems on the continent.
	   A meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan,
whose antagonistic nations have been in a race to develop nuclear
weapons capability, is expected Wednesday.
	   And next week, the Palestinians will speak to the assembly for
the first time, thanks to a vote this summer to enhance their
observer mission's status. The vote gave the Palestinians many of
the same rights as member-states to participate in assembly
matters, except for the right to vote.
	   PLO leader Yasser Arafat plans to use his speech try to gain
support for plans to declare a Palestinian state in May 1999,
Palestinian officials have said.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ At least some corpses recently found
in and around the capital have been linked to common crimes and not
to anti-government demonstrations that were violently suppressed by
police, the government said Monday.
	   The assertion followed the discovery of 21 bodies _ many of
which showed signs of torture _ by United Nations human rights
investigators.
	   The United Nations special representative for human rights in
Cambodia, Thomas Hammarberg, last week expressed ``grave concern''
over arrests, disappearances and the discoveries of unidentified
bodies in the wake of the crackdown.
	   Only in one case, however, did his statement suggest there was
evidence uncovered so far linking the death to political turmoil.
	   The government responded over the weekend with a report from its
own recently-created ``Cambodian Human Rights Committee''
summarizing its investigations into six bodies discovered between
Sept. 1 and Sept. 18.
	   It said one murder appeared to be the result of an extramarital
affair, another was related to a theft of bananas and that the
other four were still under investigation.
	   It also accused U.N. investigators in one case of tampering with
a body, and allegedly taking away evidence that included the
victim's gold teeth.
	   Several of the bodies, the government's report noted, were found
with their hands bound behind their backs or shot at close range,
but no link was made to recent street demonstrations calling for
the ouster of Cambodian leader Hun Sen.
	   ``What we are saying is that we have to investigate
professionally and not to jump to any conclusions,'' Information
Ministry spokesman Khieu Kanharith said Monday.
	   The United Nations human rights center here is a thorn in the
side of the government because it frequently highlights official
excesses.
	   The center is tolerated because its presence is desired by
foreign aid donors, but the government frequently tries to
discredit its work.
	   Police violently put down the antigovernment protests earlier
this month, killing at least four people and severely beating
dozens of others.
	   The discovery of unidentified corpses in rivers, shallow graves
and irrigation ditches has prompted speculation that the death
tally could be higher.
	   U.N. rights officials contacted Monday, a national holiday, had
not seen the government report and declined to comment on its
contents.
	   Hun Sen's ruling political party won a slight majority in July
26 parliamentary elections, but not the two-thirds needed to form a
government on its own.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party and its opposition
ally the Sam Rainsy Party, which together won 58 of 122 seats in
Parliament _ accused Hun Sen of winning through fraud.
	   They said they would not recognize the election results until
their complaints were properly investigated.
	   The three party leaders were scheduled to hold talks Tuesday
under the auspices of King Norodom Sihanouk to seek an end to the
dispute so that a new government can be formed.

Riots and protests challenge Suharto's successor in Indonesia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Five months after deadly riots forced
President Suharto to end 32 years in power, corruption allegations
are swirling around the old autocrat and a new wave of unrest is
challenging his beleaguered successor.
	   Suharto's longtime ally, President B.J. Habibie, has ordered an
investigation into Suharto's wealth and, while critics are
skeptical, there's talk of a possible trial and even a prison
sentence.
	   Meanwhile, Habibie is struggling to deliver democratic reforms
and fix the deep economic crisis that has brought misery to tens of
millions of Indonesians.
	   ``Indonesians are hungry and politically frustrated,'' said
Daniel Sparingga of Airlangga University in the country's second
largest city, Surabaya, where 6,000 protesters demanded the
president resign. ``Many just don't respect Habibie.''
	   Soldiers are back on the nation's streets to quell looting and
rioting. Hundreds of houses and shops have been burned, many
belonging to the ethnic Chinese minority resented for their
business success and comparative wealth.
	   Curfews are being enforced, and one military commander was
reported to have ordered his men to shoot troublemakers on sight.
	   Anger seethes over Indonesia's dire economic straits and
government corruption. ``Arrest Suharto for corruption! Fire
Habibie!'' one group of students cried when they defied troops and
marched toward the presidential palace in Jakarta.
	   Other protesters ripped down the gates of the national
Parliament demanding lower food prices and retribution for
corruption and human rights violations under Suharto.
	   Habibie is trying to cool feelings by providing cheap rice to
the growing ranks of poor among Indonesia's 202 million people.
	   The military, which underpinned Suharto's iron grip on power,
has promised to reform itself. Ten soldiers accused of kidnapping
and torturing pro-democracy activists are to face courts-martial.
Their commander, Suharto's son-in-law, has been fired from the
army.
	   Habibie has known Suharto since boyhood and served loyally in
his Cabinet for 20 years. But faced with mounting pressure, he
ordered last week that the former leader be questioned on
allegations of corruption.
	   Suharto's opponents charge that he illegally amassed a fortune
overseas while his six children built huge business empires. Last
month, Forbes magazine estimated Suharto's worth at dlrs 4 billion.
Other estimates are much higher.
	   In a recent and rare television appearance, Suharto, 77, denied
he had ``a cent'' squirreled away in secret bank accounts and
challenged his critics to prove him wrong.
	   His denial was greeted with disbelief from local news media and
by many Indonesians, who have been struggling to make ends meet
since Asia's economic crisis began more than a year ago.
	   Justice Minister Muladi said Thursday that the investigation of
Suharto will be thorough and fair.
	   ``There is the possibility of Suharto being jailed if proof of
criminal acts and abuse of power is found,'' Muladi said.
	   Despite the tough talk, opponents doubt the investigation will
result in a trial. Some say the government, which is laced with
former Suharto allies, including Habibie, does not have the will to
build a strong case.
	   Pursuing Suharto could drag in dozens of senior officials still
in office, the critics say. Habibie himself has had to defend his
family's wealth and extensive business interests against
allegations of impropriety.
	   While Suharto remains at his Jakarta home under military
protection, Bambang Trihatmodjo, his billionaire second son, was
banned last week from leaving the country as police investigate the
collapse of a bank he partly owned.
	   Cabinet ministers who served and grew wealthy under Suharto,
including Habibie, said they would account publicly for their
assets.
	   ``Corruption in Indonesia, as we all know, is endemic,
deep-seated and widespread,'' said Dennis de Tray, the World Bank's
representative in Indonesia.
	   The future of the world's fourth most populous country looks
bleak. Inflation and unemployment are soaring. The food minister
says 17 million families are not getting enough to eat and voiced
fears of famine before the rice harvest in January.
	   The government says almost 80 million people, or 40 percent of
the population, now live below its official poverty line _ four
times the number before the economic crisis hit.
	   Thousands line up every morning to buy state-subsidized rice and
other basic goods like cooking oil. Many have been doing without
since the market price of rice tripled.
	   ``I can't afford to feed my family properly anymore. Prices have
gone up and there's not much work around,'' said a man on Lombok,
an island 600 miles (1,000 kilometers) east of Jakarta.

Police charge Anwar supporters, fire tear gas and water cannon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 4th graf with protesters moving toward the
National Mosque &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse 2,000 supporters of the country's
ousted deputy prime minister in the second day of street clashes.
An army unit was sent onto the streets of the capital to help quell
the demonstrations.
	   Pounding batons on their heavy shields, police charged into the
crowd, which was chanting ``reform, reform.''
	   There were some injuries among the demonstrators, who had
rallied outside a downtown courthouse to see their leader, Anwar
Ibrahim. Some were hauled away bleeding by police.
	   Several hundred protesters, hemmed in by police units, then
headed toward the National Mosque, just a few blocks down the
street. The mosque was the site of the 51-year-old Anwar's fiery
speech Sunday that culminated in protests and his arrest.
	   Anwar, who was tossed out of the government earlier this month,
was expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and disturbing
the public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night has added a
volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic troubles.
	   Police swooped in and blocked several access points to the
city's main plaza, Merdeka (Freedom) Square, with jeeps, trucks and
police cars, to keep protesters away.
	   The square is located adjacent to the courthouse, where police
helicopters flew overhead during the scuffles between police and
protesters.
	   More than 1,000 police were frantically working to contain the
angry demonstrators. They were backed by a specially trained unit
of two-dozen reserve army officers.
	   Hundreds of police patrolled the main road to keep people from
gathering in the square. Police chased small mobs of men down the
side streets to get them away from the courthouse.
	   The official Bernama news agency quoted national police chief
Abdul Rahim Noor as saying that Anwar could be held under the
Internal Security Act, a harsh measure providing for indefinite
imprisonment without trial for those deemed a threat to national
security.
	   Abdul refused to say where Anwar was being held Monday.
	   But an aide to Anwar's wife said the family had been told that
he was taken overnight to a maximum security detention camp.
	   His detention has already threatened to overshadow a visit by
Queen Elizabeth II to Kuala Lumpur and her festive closing of the
16th Commonwealth Games. The queen's motorcade passed the throng of
noisy pro-reform demonstrators outside the courthouse.
	   ``We're here to support Anwar because he's innocent. He didn't
do all those crazy things,'' said Haji Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old
businessman and member of the UMNO ruling party. ``We want him as
our prime minister.''
	   More than 100 reporters thronged the Sessions Court, expecting
to see Anwar brought in to hear the charges against him. Anwar has
been leading the increasingly public opposition to the 17-year-rule
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   However, late Monday morning, prosecutors said Anwar would stay
in jail while police gather more evidence against him.
	   As tear gas poured into the courthouse, frightened lawyers and
court staff rushed outside, holding handkerchiefs and cloths over
their faces.
	   Police burst into Anwar's home almost at the same time riot
officers fired tear gas and water cannon at a crowd of several
thousand who were marching toward Mahathir's official residence.
	   Many of them had come from a crowd of about 35,000 who joined
Anwar in the National Mosque and Merdeka Square, chanting for
Mahathir's resignation Sunday.
	   Though the 51-year-old Anwar was held incommunicado, his wife
Azizah Ismail, spoke to reporters.
	   She said her husband had been taken into custody by a SWAT team
that broke down the front door. She called it ``unwarranted''
especially since her lawyers had promised the attorney general that
Anwar would not resist arrest.
	   She expressed apprehension about any further protests like the
huge demonstration that preceded her husband's arrest Sunday night,
but she added: ``The struggle will go on. It's better to die in
dignity and honor.''
	   Anwar, once Mahathir's handpicked successor, is now his
principal foe.

Baiocchi wins playoff in rain-shortened tournament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERRY KINNEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASON, Ohio (AP) _ Hugh Baiocchi felt like he'd won the lottery.
	   He battled two days to get into contention in the Kroger Senior
Classic, then waited out a 3 1/2-hour rain delay Sunday to make a
15-foot birdie putt on the second hole of sudden death to win a
record-tying five-man playoff.
	   ``To win two in a row is very satisfying,'' said Baiocchi, who
also won the Comfort Classic at Indianapolis. ``Last week, I was
defending a lead all day. Today was virtually a lottery. I'm glad I
had the winning ticket.''
	   Sunday's final round was wiped out by a thunderstorm. When the
rain finally let up, it was getting so dark that the playoff likely
would have been held over if Baiocchi had not made his putt.
	   ``I don't know if we would have been able to go one more time if
it had been necessary to do so,'' Baiocchi said. ``It was getting
difficult to read the green.''
	   Play at The Golf Center at Kings Island, just north of
Cincinnati, was initially suspended because of lightning. The last
group of leaders had finished just two holes, so tournament
officials wiped out the entire day's play when a heavy rain settled
in an hour later.
	   That meant the five players tied for the second-round lead at
7-under-par 133 _ Baiocchi, Bob Charles, Larry Nelson, Bruce
Summerhays and Frank Conner _ would meet in a playoff, tying the
Senior PGA Tour record set at the 1996 Emerald Coast Classic.
	   ``I would have appealed to come back tomorrow if we wouldn't
have determined a winner with that putt,'' Charles said.
	   The victory was worth dlrs 165,000 to Baiocchi, 52. Although he
played 22 years on the PGA European Tour and also won 11 titles in
his native South Africa, his winnings the past two weeks have made
this the most profitable year of his career.
	   With dlrs 943,718 in prize money, he's moved into sixth place on
the Senior money list and has become only the fourth multiple
winner this year, along with leading money winners Hale Irwin, Gil
Morgan and Nelson.
	   Baiocchi considered himself lucky to get into the playoff. He
had played three holes _ par, bogey, birdie _ when play was
stopped.
	   ``I didn't start out playing terribly well, so maybe I was a
little lucky the way things transpired,'' Baiocchi said.
	   The first time the five players went to No. 16, a 191-yard par-3
over water, all five missed the green. But all got up and down and
trooped back to the 16th tee because the final two holes were
unplayable.
	   This time all five hit the green, with Baiocchi closest to the
pin.
	   One by one, the others missed their birdie putts. Baiocchi
rolled in his putt and pumped his fist in the air.
	   It was the second Senior PGA Tour event that had to be shortened
to 36 holes this year because of rain. The first round of last
month's Coldwell Banker Burnet Classic, outside Minneapolis, was
canceled.
	   The Kroger Senior Classic had been abbreviated once before. Jim
Dent won it as a 36-hole event in 1990.

No serious risk to bank system expected from Philippine Airlines'
</HEADLINE>
demise

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The scheduled collapse of debt-ridden
Philippine Airlines is not expected to pose a serious risk to the
country's banking system, analysts said Monday.
	   But the demise of Asia's oldest airline, scheduled for midnight
Wednesday, would clearly add to the bad-loan difficulties of local
banks and have far-reaching economic ramifications, they said.
	   In a surprise move, PAL sought Monday a further 60-day
moratorium on servicing dlrs 2.1 billion in debts to foreign and
local creditors.
	   Some banking analysts believe, however, the move is aimed at
keeping creditors at bay a while longer for an orderly liquidation
of the company rather than at preventing the airline from closing.
	   Several months of acrimonious labor disputes led to the
airline's board announcing last Thursday that the company would
close for good this week.
	   PAL has failed to service its debt since June, when it sought a
moratorium from the Securities and Exchange Commission pending the
submission of a rehabilitation plan that was due Monday.
	   Of the airline's total liabilities, domestic banks are owed dlrs
233 million in dollar-denominated loans, along with a further 1.2
billion pesos (dlrs 27 million) in peso loans. This represents a
relatively small 0.7 percent of total loans in the Philippine
banking system.
	   ``The collapse of PAL, although significant in its scope, would
not seem to pose any significant systemic risk to the banking
sector,'' said ABN Amro Asia Securities (Philippines) Inc. analyst
Nicholas Cashmore.
	   Bankers Association of the Philippines' President Deogracias
Vistan was quoted in Business World newspaper Monday as saying that
the airline's closure could cause the non-performing loan ratio of
Philippine banks to rise by an average of up to one percentage
point.
	   According the most recent data available, the non-performing
loan ratio of banks averaged 9.7 percent in June, down from 10.4
percent in May.
	   This is roughly double the level prevailing before the regional
financial crisis erupted in July 1997, and vividly shows the impact
that high interest rates have had on companies struggling to meet
loan repayments.
	   Still, compared with other countries mired in the crisis, the
Philippines has an enviably low ratio of bad banking loans.
Thailand's are presently running at 46 percent, South Korea's at 25
percent and Malaysia's at 18 percent.
	   But Erwin Balita, senior analyst for Securities 2000 Inc. said
the airline's closure would clearly pose a headache for banks
grappling with a steep rise in bad corporate loans since the
crisis.

South Korea's defense budget to decrease for first time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea said Monday it plans to
trim its defense budget by 0.4 percent next year, the first
contraction in the country's history.
	   The Defense Ministry said it would ask Parliament for 13.74
trillion won (dlrs 9.81 billion) for 1999, down from 13.8 trillion
won (dlrs 9.86 billion) this year.
	   Most cuts will come in administrative costs and will not
seriously affect South Korea's defense posture, the ministry said.
	   Preoccupied with military threats from rival North Korea, South
Korea has boosted its military spending by an average 11 percent
annually since 1990.
	   Defense spending represented 17 percent of this year's overall
budget of 80.76 trillion won (dlrs 57.69 billion). Next year's
budget is expected to be submitted to Parliament later this month.
	   South Korea is tightening its belt to overcome its worst
economic recession ever. It was forced to call in the International
Monetary Fund to bail out its battered economy in December.

Hurricane Georges pounds Caribbean islands

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Packing 115-mph (185-kph) winds,
Hurricane Georges barreled into the northeastern Caribbean Monday,
flooding towns, knocking out electricity and forcing hundreds to
evacuate their homes.
	   More than 1,600 people sought shelter in schools and public
buildings in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where Georges
was expected to strike later Monday. Both U.S. territories declared
states of emergency and activated National Guard troops to help
evacuations and patrol streets.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' warned Puerto
Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello, adding the storm could bring ``havoc and
difficulties for our people.''
	   At 2 a.m. EDT Monday (0600 GMT), Georges was centered about 15
miles (24 kilometers) west-southwest of Antigua and was moving
west-northwest at 16 mph (26 kph). Hurricane-force winds of at
least 74 mph (118 kph) extended 85 miles (140 kilometers) from the
eye.
	   Its strength diminished considerably from a monstrous 150 mph
(240 kph) on Sunday, but with gusts up to 138 mph (220 kph), the
U.S. National Hurricane Center warned the storm was ``extremely
dangerous'' and capable of extensive damage.
	   In the French island of Guadeloupe, raging seas flooded roads in
the northern towns of Anse-Bertrand and Campeche and forced
residents living near the beach to head for shelter inland. France
was sending a team of 170 civil defense workers to help recovery
efforts.
	   Swirling winds knocked out power in several Guadeloupe towns.
``An incredible sound'' from a darkened, angry sea is how Jean
Barfleur, mayor of Port-Louis, described the hurricane's roar.
	   Georges downed lampposts and darkened all of St. Kitts,
population 32,000, while in Antigua families huddled in basements
and shop owners erected sandbag barricades to stop flooding. In St.
John's, Antigua's capital, civil defense workers distributed
flashlights, mosquito coils, water and toilet paper to nervous
shelter residents.
	   Under hurricane warnings, residents in Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands furiously boarded windows and jammed markets to
stock up on ice, water and canned food.
	   ``Why take chances with something that we cannot change?'' said
St. Croix resident Marion Jones as she put up storm shutters on her
home.
	   U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Roy Schneider imposed a 8 p.m. curfew
and asked President Bill Clinton to declare a federal state of
emergency that would release federal aid.
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico to coordinate disaster response. FEMA also
organized a 62-member search and rescue team in Miami to fly to
Puerto Rico after the storm passes. Teams from Virginia and
Maryland went on alert for St. Croix and St. Thomas.
	   In Puerto Rico, Gov. Rossello announced a ban on liquor sales,
activated the island's National Guard and ordered officials to open
more than 330 shelters. Banks and schools closed Monday, major
airlines canceled flights to and from the U.S. mainland, and with
20-foot seas forecast, ferry service to the eastern islands of
Culebra and Vieques was suspended.
	   More than 1,000 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities, and officials planned
Monday to order residents to leave homes in flood-prone areas. Up
to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain was expected in Puerto Rico's
mountains, raising the threat of mudslides.
	   Further west, the Dominican Republic issued a hurricane watch,
meaning hurricane conditions could occur there by Tuesday.

Fire destroys village in Russia's Far East, two believed dead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A forest fire destroyed an entire logging village
on Russia's Sakhalin Island in the Far East, and two people were
believed killed, news reports said Monday.
	   The Gorky township burned down in just 90 minutes on Sunday
night, and only five of its 141 houses were not damaged, the
Interfax and the ITAR-Tass news agencies reported, citing local
officials.
	   Some 700 residents were left homeless and the regional
authorities asked for urgent help from the federal government. Some
refused to be evacuated, staying in a field near a river and hoping
to rescue some of their belongings.
	   Emergency workers said two residents were missing and believed
dead, though their bodies had not been found.
	   Firefighters were still trying to contain the blaze, which has
devoured 20,000 hectares (49,000 acres) of forest. The firemen were
worried the blaze could spread to a nearby settlement and a fishery
plant, officials said.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian President B.J. Habibie has
appointed an ex-finance minister with a reputation for honesty and
integrity as a new economic adviser, State Secretary Akbar Tanjung
said Monday.
	   Akbar said Mar'ie Muhammad will join a team of other advisors
who also served as finance ministers under former President
Suharto.
	   Mar'ie was finance minister from 1992 to 1997, the year when the
country slid into economic chaos.
	   Suharto failed to reappoint him in a revamped Cabinet in March.
By May, Suharto himself was forced to step down amid protests and
riots, largely triggered by the economic crisis.
	   Habibie replaced Suharto and has pledged sweeping economic
reform and an anti-corruption drive.
	   Since his departure from government, Mar'ie has headed an
independent economic and anti-corruption watchdog group.
	   Outsiders, including the World Bank, have identified rampant
corruption in Indonesia's government and bureaucracy as a major
obstacle to economic recovery for the world's fourth most populous
nation.

Chief: Games still relevant despite absence of big names
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The chief of Commonwealth Games on
Monday declared the competitions a thumping success despite the
absence of big names, saying Kuala Lumpur will be a ``hard act to
follow'' for Manchester 2002.
	   Defending the relevance of the tournament when the Commonwealth
itself is becoming old-fashioned, Michael Fennell said the games
should not be seen just as a 13-day event but as the creator of a
legacy for future generations of fans, sports officials and
athletes.
	   ``Yes, we were missing top stars who opted for other events ...
but others came and gave great performances,'' Fennell, the
chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation, told reporters on
the final day of competiton.
	   The games, especially the track and field events, lost much of
their glamor when many top athletes stayed away, preferring to
compete in more prestigious events. Others couldn't come because of
injuries.
	   Among the absentees were Donovan Bailey, the 100-meters world
record holder, and 110-meters world record holder Colin Jackson of
Wales said he was too tired to compete. He, however, ran at the
TOTO International Super Track and Field in Tokyo the day 110
meters was held in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Cricket, which made its debut here, suffered the most when
England didn't send its team, citing scheduling problems. India
divided its national team, sending half of the players to Kuala
Lumpur and the others to Canada for a one-day series with Pakistan.
India lost both tournaments.
	   But that was hard to discern from the largely empty seats at
different venues, especially during matches where Malaysia didn't
compete.
	   Trinidad sprint star Ato Boldon and Frankie Fredericks of
Namibia made a fleeting appearance for their events and flew off to
Tokyo for the TOTO meet.
	   Fennell said all major tournaments face the problem of clashing
events and the only way to solve it is for various organizers to
get together to make a timetable that would allow athletes to
compete in a maximum number of events.
	   He praised Malaysian authorities for successfully holding the
largest Commonwealth Games ever, saying it has made the
Commonwealth aware of its own potential.
	   ``From here Manchester 2002 will be a hard act to follow ... We
do not expect Manchester to be the same as Malaysia but it is going
to be great as well,'' he said.
	   The legacy of Kuala Lumpur will be the world class sports
facilities that the Malaysian government built for the games, the
on-the-job training and qualifications that Malaysian sports
officials earned and the boost to sports in the country.
	   ``Quite often we make the mistake of measuring the legacy in
terms of what happens next year but we must look at the future, for
generations yet to come,'' he said.
	   Still, Sukom 98, the company that organized the games, earned 5
million ringgit (U.S dlrs 1.3 million) from ticket sales, far more
than expected, Sukom chairman Hashim Mohamad Ali told reporters.
	   But that was hard to discern from the largely empty seats at
different venues, especially during matches where Malaysia didn't
compete. Fennell said that could be because corporations bought
tickets en masse for employees who didn't show up at the venues.
The other problem was lack of transportation between venues, the
games village and the media center.
	   Yet these were minor compared to the embarrassment for Malaysia
as the hundreds of reporters assembled here turned their attention
on the dramatic political events unfolding in the country.
	   On Sunday, police fired tear gas and water cannons to disperse
hundreds of demonstrators backing Malaysia's sacked deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim who faces charges of sodomy. His supporters
have threatened to use the games' closing ceremony Monday to
highlight what they say is repression of democracy by Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   But Malaysian security is prepared to deal with that, Hashim
said.
	   ``They don't worry us at all. Far from it. It is a local
problem. This is a democratic country,'' he told reporters.

Japanese stock prices hit new 12-year low, dollar higher

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing stock, mid-afternoon bond and currency
prices; ADDS 4th graf trader quote.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo stock prices hit a new 12-year low Monday as
investors dumped shares amid uncertainty over the fate of
legislation to revive the country's ailing banking system. The U.S.
dollar rose against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 385.82 points,
or 2.76 percent, to finish the day at 13,597.30 _ its lowest close
since February 1986. On Friday, the Nikkei had closed up 123.98
points, or 0.89 percent.
	   The index lost ground from the outset of trading in reaction to
the apparent unraveling of an agreement on a set of bank
stabilization bills as ruling party and opposition lawmakers
resumed wrangling over key provisions, traders said.
	   ``The possibility of a breakdown in the agreement is leading the
selling,'' said Kenji Karikomi, general manager of the equity
department at Daiwa Securities Co.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Liberal Democratic
Party struck a preliminary accord with the opposition for dealing
with the huge load of bad loans burdening Japan's banking industry.
The plan called for closing or nationalizing insolvent lenders and
buying up bad debt with public money.
	   But important issues remain unresolved.
	   A top ruling party lawmaker suggested Sunday that 13 trillion
yen (dlrs 97.5 billion) in previously approved funds could be used
to bail out banks, apparently backing away from a major concession
to the opposition. Naoto Kan, leader of the largest opposition
party, warned the entire pact could fall apart.
	   Another point of contention involves the troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan Ltd., one of the country's largest banks.
	   Obuchi, speaking to reporters en route to a meeting with U.S.
President Bill Clinton in New York, signaled Monday that LTCB would
not be allowed to founder, despite opposition demands the bank be
declared insolvent and nationalized.
	   ``If the Long-Term Credit Bank were to fail, it would cause a
major impact on the global economy,'' Obuchi said.
	   The broader Tokyo Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined 25.43 points, or 2.37
percent, to close at 1,047.79. The TOPIX had closed up 4.16 points,
or 0.39 percent, on Friday.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
bought 133.14 yen in late morning trading, up 1.04 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 132.60 yen on
Friday.
	   The U.S. currency moved higher against the yen amid a belief
that the ruling party will face difficulty revising the proposed
bills more to its liking following Friday's compromise deal,
traders said.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.735 percent from Friday's finish of 0.675 percent,
driving its price down to 115.05 yen from 115.51 yen.

Asian stocks plunge for a whole host of reasons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets were sharply lower
Monday, and analysts blamed everything from disputes over a new
bank reform agreement in Japan to political instability in Malaysia
to the Clinton sex scandal in America.
	   In Japan, the key stock index plunged to its lowest level in
more than 12 years in early trading after a recent agreement
between the governing Liberal Democratic Party and the opposition
on key bills for dealing with the huge load of bad loans burdening
the banking industry appeared to unravel.
	   By midday, Hong Kong's key index had plunged 3 percent, and
Singapore's had fallen 2.5 percent.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 321.13
points, or 2.30 percent, to 13,661.99, by midday. Earlier in the
day it dipped as low as 13,658.79 for the first time since early
1986. On Friday, the Nikkei had gained 0.89 percent.
	   The U.S. dollar rose against the Japanese yen. It bought 133.24
yen in morning trading, up 1.14 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and
also above its New York level of 132.60 yen Friday.
	   In Japan, lawmakers had resumed wrangling over key provisions of
the accord reached Friday by Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling
party and the opposition. The plan calls for closing or
nationalizing insolvent lenders and buying up bad debt with public
money. But the two sides remain split over issues such as how to
write off problem loans at banks, and whether to allow the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank Ltd. to founder.
	   Speaking to reporters en route to a meeting with U.S. President
Bill Clinton in New York, Obuchi signaled Monday that LTCB would
not be allowed to fall.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index plummeted on
investors' worries that the planned release Monday of Clinton's
videotaped grand jury testimony on his sexual relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky could fuel calls for his
impeachment, analysts said.
	   ``People are concerned about Clinton,'' said Stanley Ng,
research manager with Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd. in Hong
Kong, who predicted the tape's release could pull the Dow Jones
Industrial Average down by up to 150 points Monday.
	   In Indonesia, the JSX Composite Index was 3.9 percent lower at
midday. Investors feared recent student protests could lead to more
damaging social unrest, dealers said.
	   In Malaysia, the key Composite Index was down 1.9 percent at
midday, following the arrest of sacked finance minister Anwar
Ibrahim late Sunday after he led unprecedented anti-government
protests in downtown Kuala Lumpur. Anwar supporters protesting his
detention clashed with police there Monday morning.

	   The Clinton grand jury testimony, the Lewinsky testimony and the
rest of the 2,800 pages of Starr documents will be made public by
the House Judiciary Committee when the Clinton videotape is
released at approximately 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) Monday.
	   The Government Printing Office is printing the materials in
bound form.
	   Sometime after the printed transcripts are distributed _ how
much longer is not known _ we expect to get the materials
electronically.
	   Because of the volume, the full texts of the testimony and
documents will not move on regular news wires.
	   Instead, once they are in electronic form, we will provide the
full texts in ASCII and HTML formats at an ftp site. We have
arranged for an ftp server with additional capacity to handle the
expected demand. This means the files will not be at the same
address used to deliver the Starr report last week.
	   The address of the ftp server is texts.ap.org. The files will be
in a directory called testimony. To get the username and password,
you can call your local bureaus. There will also be a voice mail
message at 212-621-6234 with the details, or you can call the
international desk at 212-621-1644.
	   Again, this is not the server we used to deliver the OIC report.
Please do not connect to that server. The files will NOT be there.
	   Also, we set up this ftp site so that members can have access to
the full text of the testimony and other evidence. So please do not
make the address, username and password public. If the address
becomes public you may have trouble connecting to the ftp site.
	   We will advise you as soon as there is something available at
the site.
	   We will also post the full texts on the Web at
http://textsweb.ap.org/starrtext
	   Running excerpts will move on regular news wires. We cannot
estimate wordage until we see the documents. The excerpts will be
edited; much of the sexually graphic detail may be deleted and any
that remains will be carefully flagged.
	   The full transcripts on the ftp site will be unedited and will
move in the official form provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.
	   Edited video clips in RealVideo and QuickTime formats from the
videotape of President Bill Clinton's testimony will also be
available at the ftp site.
	   Additionally, we will post the text files and video excerpts on
The WIRE, the AP's public Web site that is displayed by newspaper
and broadcast sites around the world.
	   APTV, the AP's international video service that provides video
to 200 broadcasters in the United States and abroad, plans to carry
the video in full, unedited, as soon as it is made available.
	   Warnings about explicit language will be shown both on screen
and in APTV advisories before the tapes are played.

Thai Deputy Health Minister resigns in purchasing scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's deputy minister of public
health resigned Monday over a corruption scandal at public
hospitals.
	   The scandal has also claimed the minister of public health, who
resigned last week in a rare show of responsibility by a Thai
politician.
	   Deputy Minister of Public Health Thirawat Siriwanasan, a member
of the Social Action Party, announced his resignation at a press
conference on Monday.
	   The scandal involved price fixing of medical supplies. It came
to light last month when an association of rural doctors charged
that officials at the ministry were forcing hospitals to buy
medical supplies from preselected companies at several times the
market price.
	   Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai appointed a committee of outsiders
to investigate the charges. The committee announced on Friday that
two politicians and two high-ranking bureaucrats were involved but
refused to divulge their names before submitting them to the prime
minister.
	   Politicians in Thailand almost never resign in the face of
scandal. Few politicians have ever been sent to jail for corruption
despite the fact that corruption is believed to be widespread among
elected officials and the bureaucracy.
	   Chuan said last week that the scandal was hurting his coalition
government's image of integrity.

Thai coalition government negotiating to bring in new partner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Top members of Thailand's coalition
government are preparing to meet Monday night to debate whether to
invite the second-largest opposition party to join the ruling
partnership, local news reports said.
	   If they do, it would bolster the coalition's slim majority in
Parliament but also risk adding a party that has undermined past
coalition governments.
	   The coalition is led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's Democrat
Party and has only 207 of the 393 seats in Parliament. The
coalition's stability has come into question in recent days because
of scandals and court cases involving two of its smaller parties.
	   On Monday, Democrat Party Secretary General Sanan Kachornprasart
told ITV, an independent television station, that he had been
negotiating with his counterpart from the Chart Pattana (National
Development) Party, Suwat Lipatapallop, about joining the
coalition.
	   Sanan is Chuan's political point man and was largely responsible
for forging together the current coalition government from the
chaos that resulted when former Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh resigned last November.
	   Chart Pattana is the party of the late former Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan, who was challenging Chuan for the premiership
last November.
	   The party holds 52 seats in Parliament, and its inclusion would
significantly increase the ruling coalition's majority.
	   ``Bringing Chart Pattana in will strengthen the coalition in
terms of numbers,'' said Suchit Boonbongkarn, dean of Political
Science at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.
	   Suchit said he didn't think Chart Pattana would destabilize the
coalition despite widespread belief that it helped cause the demise
of Chavalit's government by undermining his policies in an attempt
to maneuver Chatichai into the top job.
	   ``I don't think they will do anything to rock the boat,'' Suchit
said. ``An election can come at any time, and that would hurt them
at the polls. I think they want to change their image.''
	   The Chuan government's term does not expire until 2000, but the
fragility of the ruling partnership has led many analysts to
believe an election may come sometime in 1999.
	   Chuan also risks losing some of his smaller coalition partners
by bringing in Chart Pattana. ITV reported that two of the smaller
parties were against inviting Chart Pattana.
	   If Chart Pattana joins, a major Cabinet reshuffle would have to
take place, as the party would be the second largest in the
coalition and therefore entitled to a large share of top-level
appointments.
	   ``Big reshuffle or small reshuffle, it won't be a problem,''
Sanan said on Monday.
	   In the results of a poll released on Monday, more Thais than not
opposed the overtures to Chart Pattana. In the poll of 1,285 people
around Thailand conducted by Assumption University, 41.2 percent of
respondents opposed inviting an opposition party to join, while
28.6 percent approved.

Telecom staff protest against wage cuts
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo HK101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A small group of union demonstrators marched to
the offices of Hongkong Telecommunications early Monday to protest
the across-the-board wage cuts announced last week.
	   About 10 representatives of several labor unions waved banners
saying ``Strongly opposed to wage cuts'' and ``Ten billion in
profits, 10-percent pay cut'' outside a commercial building housing
the company's executive offices.
	   Union leaders also handed over a petition signed by nearly 9,000
citizens against the 10-percent pay cut announced last Thursday.
	   The Telecom, Hong Kong's largest private employer hiring 13,800
people, told its staff to take the cut starting Nov. 1 or be
sacked.
	   Unionists and workers fear the Telecom's decision would lead to
more pay cuts by smaller companies as unemployment has soared to a
15-year high of 5 percent.
	   ``We hope the Telecom won't sacrifice the workers' benefits and
the company's reputation ... for its own short-term gains,'' said
lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan, secretary-general of the Confederation of
Trade Unions.
	   Another evening protest, expected to be joined by more
employees, had been scheduled after office hours outside of the
Telecom's headquarters.
	   Meanwhile, the company's labor unions were asking workers to
refuse to work overtime starting Monday to pressure the company to
back down. Union officials said they were unsure how many people
would support the move.
	   Officials of the Federation of Trade Unions, Hong Kong's
largest, were scheduled to meet Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa to
discuss the wage cuts.
	   Ella Tam, a spokeswoman for Tung, said the government would not
intervene into the matter.

Russian soldier kills two comrades, deserts his unit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Russian soldier shot dead two of his comrades
and fled his unit in the Ural Mountains, the latest in a series of
such shootings in the demoralized Russian military, officials said
Monday.
	   Sgt. Vitaly Pryakhin was on guard duty in a military garrison in
the town of Ozyorsk when he opened fire on other sentries on
Sunday, killing two of them on the spot and badly wounding a third,
the military said.
	   Pryakhin then fled with his assault rifle and ammunition. A
massive effort was launched to apprehend him, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Military officials wouldn't comment on the possible motives for
the shooting.
	   The Russian armed forces suffer from abysmal living conditions,
chronic shortages of funds and supplies, and vicious hazings
inflicted on young conscripts by older soldiers.
	   There have been numerous mass shootings in the past few years.
Earlier this month, a sailor on a nuclear submarine killed eight
comrades and barricaded himself inside the vessel while it was in
port. The sailor later killed himself, the military said.
	   About 50 soldiers were killed by their fellow servicemen last
year, and about 500 committed suicide, according to the military.

Fifty years after constitution, Gordon welcomes advances of
</HEADLINE>
Japanese women &QL; 
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The woman who helped write the section on women's
rights in Japan's constitution after World War II praised on Monday
the advances women have made here in the last half-century.
	   Beate Gordon, 74, who worked for the U.S. Occupation,
acknowledged that Japanese women still face a great deal of social
inequalities and that Japan's record on women's rights lags behind
that of the United States. But Japanese women have come a long way,
she said.
	   ``I am amazed by the difference,'' Gordon told reporters in
Tokyo during one of her frequent visits to Japan, where she is
respected as a proponent of women's rights. ``The energy of the
women impresses me more than the energy of the men.''
	   The role of Gordon and other Americans who helped write the
Japanese constitution is a remarkable chapter in Japanese history.
	   To this day, many Japanese are grateful for the efforts of the
group of Americans, many young and idealistic, who helped draft the
constitution to include ideas that were fairly alien to Japan's
rulers of that era, including women's rights and commitment to
peace.
	   At a top-secret meeting to discuss the constitution, Japanese
officials were outraged that a section on women's rights was
proposed as part of the constitution, Gordon recalled.
	   But what she had initially proposed to her U.S. Occupation
bosses had offered even more guarantees on women's rights,
including equal rights for illegitimate children and government
help for pregnant and nursing women, Gordon said.
	   Those proposals were turned down by her bosses prior to the
meeting.
	   The Japanese constitution states that people are ``equal under
the law'' and that there should be no discrimination ``because of
race, creed, sex, social status or family origin.'' It also says
that marriage must be based on mutual consent and that husband and
wife are equal.
	   Gordon grew up in Japan as the daughter of pianist Leo Sirota,
who had taught here since 1929. Her Japanese female friends had to
learn docile, feminine roles and abide by arranged marriages, she
recalled.
	   ``After all, I know the Japan where the women walked behind the
men,'' she said.

American Airlines, British Airways announce global alliance
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ American Airlines and British Airways on Monday
announced they were forming a global alliance with three other
carriers to compete with a rival group called the Star Alliance set
up by United Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa.
	   American and British Airways are still awaiting approval for
their own transatlantic partnership but say they have now agreed to
a global deal that will join them up with Canadian Airlines, the
Hong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific and Australia's Qantas.
	   The carriers called their venture ''oneworld.''
	   They say they will coordinate their flight schedules and
cooperate on their frequent flier programs to better serve
customers.
	   The companies were to announce details of the venture at a
morning news conference Monday held by their chief executives.
	   ''We started this alliance effort by recognizing it's all about
people,'' said Don Carty, the chief executive at American. ''We
want to enhance the travel experience for our customers, improve
the competitive position of our respective airlines and thus
provide opportunities for our employees, as well as create value
for our shareholders by building the world's premiere airline
network.''
	   Canadian Airlines chief executive Kevin Benson pledged that the
alliance would ensure ''that our customers are recognized across
all airlines as if they were their own.''
	   The five airlines say that their network will service 632 cities
in 138 countries. Last year they carried a total of 174 million
passengers.

World Bank fears corruption threatens Indonesian humanitarian aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS appointment of ex-finance minister, final grafs

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Corruption is threatening billions of
dollars worth of international humanitarian aid meant for
Indonesia's dramatically growing number of poor, a visiting World
Bank official has warned.
	   ``It is crucial to ensure that fund leakage in social safety net
programs is not tolerated,'' said visiting senior World Bank
official Katherine Marshall.
	   ``The government needs to treat this matter with the utmost
seriousness,'' newspapers Monday quoted her as saying.
	   Indonesia is enduring its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Indonesia estimates that about 40 percent of its 202 million
people have slipped below the poverty line. Many of them face dire
food shortages as the price of rice and other food soars.
	   The World Bank has helped put together about dlrs 14 billion in
international aid, including food and medicine, to alleviate the
suffering.
	   Marshall, who completed an anti-corruption fact-finding mission
to Indonesia over the weekend, said the bank wanted tough measures
to protect the aid from corrupt local officials.
	   After talking with government officials and non-government
organizations, she said the World Bank is ``persuaded that
corruption is an obstacle to helping those hurt most by the
economic crisis.''
	   The World Bank has offered to assist Indonesia fight graft after
the bank was stung by allegations in an internal bank memorandum
that between 20 and 30 percent of its aid loans to the sprawling
Southeast Asian nation has been siphoned off by local officials.
	   The bank's representative in Indonesia, Dennis de Tray, has
disputed the figure but admits that corruption has been a major
problem.
	   ``Now we need concrete action to demonstrate that the government
is delivering on its commitment to combat the cancer of
corruption,'' de Tray said in a statement.
	   ``Indonesia's fight against corruption is crucial to the
country's recovery from the crisis,'' he said.
	   But he also said the fight to end corruption would be a marathon
effort that could take generations.
	   The push to clean up how Indonesia is governed follows last
May's resignation of President Suharto, who gave up 32
authoritarian years in power after riots and protests.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, has ordered an
investigation into corruption during the Suharto era.
	   Officials are to meet with Suharto soon over allegations that he
illegally amassed a fortune and stashed millions of dollars away in
foreign bank accounts before he quit.
	   Suharto, whose children built huge business empires when he was
in office, has denied any wrongdoing.
	   Meanwhile, Habibie has appointed an ex-finance minister, with
reputation for honesty and integrity, as a new economic adviser,
State Secretary Akbar Tanjung said Monday.
	   Mar'ie was finance minister when the country slid into economic
chaos in 1997.
	   Since his departure from government, Mar'ie has headed an
independent economic and anti-corruption watchdog group.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian court has ordered a university
professor to return to her husband and bear children by him, police
officials said Monday.

agreed with her husband at the time of their marriage that they

to expect his wife to bear children.
	   Under Egyptian law, neither party can be named as the case was
heard in a personal affairs court.
	   The court found Sunday that the agreement to delaying having
children was invalid. The judge ruled that the basis of marriage

Police charge Anwar supporters, fire tear gas and water cannon

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse thousands of supporters of the
country's ousted deputy prime minister in the second day of street
clashes. An army unit was sent onto the streets of the capital to
help quell demonstrations.
	   Federal police said the fired politician, Anwar Ibrahim, was
being held under a law that allows indefinite imprisonment without
charges or trial for those deemed a threat to national security.
	   The decision means Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad may be
seeking to remove Anwar, his only rival, from the political scene
by the quickest means possible. Anwar has been leading the
increasingly public opposition to the 17-year rule of the
72-year-old prime minister.
	   Anwar, who was tossed out of the government earlier this month,
is expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and disturbing the
public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night has added a
volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic troubles.
	   Pounding batons on their heavy shields, police charged into a
crowd of 2,000 people, who were chanting for reform outside the
courthouse.
	   There were injuries among the demonstrators. Some were hauled
away bleeding by police.
	   ``We didn't do anything,'' said Marizal Jai, 23, a janitor.
``They attacked us with water and tear gas. They chase us in and
out of buildings.''
	   Several hundred protesters, hemmed in by police, then headed
toward the National Mosque, just a few blocks down the street. The
mosque was the site of the 51-year-old Anwar's fiery speech Sunday
that culminated in protests and his arrest.
	   Police swooped in and blocked several access points to the
city's main plaza, Merdeka (Freedom) Square, with jeeps, trucks and
police cars.
	   The square is located adjacent to the courthouse, where police
helicopters flew overhead as more than 1,000 officers were
frantically working to contain the angry demonstrators. They were
backed by a specially trained unit of two dozen soldiers. Police
chased small mobs of men down the side streets to get them away
from the courthouse.
	   National police chief Abdul Rahim Noor refused to say where
Anwar was being held Monday.
	   But an aide to Anwar's wife said the family had been told that
he was taken overnight to a maximum security detention camp.
	   His detention has already threatened to overshadow a visit by
Queen Elizabeth II to Kuala Lumpur and her festive closing of the
16th Commonwealth Games. The queen's motorcade passed the throng of
noisy pro-reform demonstrators outside the courthouse.
	   ``We're here to support Anwar because he's innocent. He didn't
do all those crazy things,'' said Haji Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old
businessman and member of the UMNO ruling party. ``We want him as
our prime minister.''
	   More than 100 reporters thronged the Sessions Court, expecting
to see Anwar brought in to hear the charges against him.
	   As tear gas poured into the courthouse, frightened lawyers and
court staff rushed outside, holding handkerchiefs and cloths over
their faces.
	   Police burst into Anwar's home almost at the same time riot
officers fired tear gas and water cannon at a crowd of several
thousand people who were marching toward Mahathir's official
residence on Sunday night. Many of them had come from a crowd of
about 35,000 who joined Anwar in the National Mosque and Merdeka
Square, chanting for Mahathir's resignation.
	   Hundreds of Anwar's allies shouted angrily, ``God is great!''
and ``Long live Anwar!'' shaking their fists as police led him away
from the house Sunday.
	   Though Anwar was held incommunicado, his wife Azizah Ismail,
spoke to reporters. She expressed apprehension about any further
protests like the huge demonstration that preceded her husband's
arrest but added: ``The struggle will go on. It's better to die in
dignity and honor.''
	   Newspapers have been carrying banner-headlined stories
containing explicit details of Anwar's alleged sodomy offenses.
	   Anwar has vehemently denied the charges, saying they were cooked
up by Mahathir, who fears Anwar's growing popularity and any
challenge to his rule.

Former Thai prime minister says ASEAN in danger of falling apart
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Former Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations is
in danger of falling apart because of the regional economic crisis
and weak leadership.
	   ``If the present generation of leaders cannot help sustain the
grouping's progress and unity, how will the new generation be able
to forge unity?'' Chavalit asked in an interview with The Nation
newspaper published on Monday.
	   ASEAN is a regional security and economic grouping that consists
of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Chavalit was prime minister for one year until November 1997,
when he resigned amid public discontent over his inability to
manage Thailand's plummeting economy.
	   Thailand was the epicenter of the regional economic crisis,
which has now spread to Russia and Latin America. During Chavalit's
term, the central bank depleted the nation's foreign reserves in a
failed defense of the country's currency, the baht.
	   Chavalit floated the baht in July 1997, touching off a wave of
competitive devaluations and necessitating a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout of the Thai economy by the International Monetary Fund.
	   The economic crisis coupled with expanding and diverse
membership has strained relations between several ASEAN countries.
	   Malaysia and Singapore have been harshly criticizing each other
over a variety of issues. Thailand and the Philippines have voiced
displeasure over Myanmar's military government's reluctance to
begin political reform.
	   Differences have also emerged over how to handle the economic
crisis and the pace of reforms and free trade between some of the
more developed nations and those lagging behind, such as Vietnam
and Laos.
	   The public disagreements go against the group's philosophy of
not openly criticizing member countries and operating by consensus.
	   Chavalit also said Thailand should attempt to mediate between
Singapore and Malaysia because ``we are neutral enough to do the
job.''
	   He also said that despite the economic crisis, plans to link the
region's trade with Yunnan province in China should be pushed
forward to create ``a huge market of almost three billion people.''

Malaysia wins gold as Kiwi collapses
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand's Craig Barrett
thought he had won a gold medal when he fell in a delirious heap
near the finish of the 50-kilometer walk at the Commonwealth Games
on Monday.
	   It was only later in hospital, recovering from dehydration and
heat stroke with three liters of fluid pumped into him through a
drip that Barrett discovered what had happened.
	   In an extraordinary end to the first event of the final day,
Barrett held a five minute lead with less than a kilometer to go
when he staggered and fell. He tried to get on his feet and began
to crawl along the bitumen. Barrett then rose and fell twice more
before team chief Les Mills came to his aid, ruling him out of
contention. He was four hours into the race and had just five
minutes left to the finish.
	   ``(My legs) just kind of fell off,'' Barrett told a New Zealand
television station after recovering later Monday. ``My head was
getting really hot, I was starting to see stars.
	   ``I was in the medical tent and I thought I'd won ... I was
going, `I know what it's like to touch perfection now'. I was just
in this space age world, it was quite freaky.''
	   Malaysia's Govindasamy Saravanan walked past Barrett as the New
Zealander floundered. He crossed the finish line in 4 hours, 10
minutes, 5 seconds to win Malaysia's first track and field gold of
the games, and eighth overall, and was carried away by wildly
cheering fans.
	   He was well clear of two Australians, Duane Cousins, who was 25
seconds slower, and Dominic McGrath, who finished 2 minutes and 45
seconds behind the winner.
	   ``I could see (the blood) running down my legs and into my
socks, '' said McGrath. ``But once the legs get tired you just
forget about it. When you're staring down a medal you'll go through
anything.''
	   ``It's just such a relief, just to stop,'' said Cousins. ``If I
could qualify for 100 meters, I'd rather do that _ but someone's
got to do the 50k so it might as well be me.''
	   Canada's Erika-Leigh Stirton became her country's leading
competitor at the games when she swept all four gold medal on offer
Monday in the rhythmic gymnastics competition to finish with five
golds.
	   After winning the individual all-around gold Sunday, Stirton was
in strong form, scoring 9.508 for rope, 9.624 for hoop, 9.583 for
clubs and 9.650 for ribbon.
	   She matched the feat of Australia's Kasumi Takahashi, who won
all five in 1994.
	   ``I'm very satisfied with what I have achieved today,'' Stirton
said. ``To be frank, I did not expect to do well here.''
	   Australia will miss its record gold medal haul of 87 from four
years ago but easily wrapped up top position from England and
Canada for the third edition in succession.
	   Australia's netball team took its gold tally to 78 ahead of the
final track program when it beat New Zealand 42-39 in the gold
medal game.
	   Captain Vicki Wilson rebounded after a poor start to lead
Australia home with strong shooting in the final quarter. Australia
remained unbeaten through the tournament, lifting its overall
record to 79 wins from its past 81 internationals.
	   Coach Jill McIntosh replaced Wilson with Jennifer Borlase at
halftime but it did nothing to help the favorite and Wilson was
back on court before three-quarter time.
	   Heading into the final quarter the score was 31-all and
Australia led by two points with four minutes remaining before
Wilson goaled to secure the win.
	   ``At this particular moment this means everything,'' Wilson
said. ``It was one of those games that went down to the wire and
you couldn't ask for a better finale, it was quite fitting for the
Commonwealth Games, it was not a walkover by any means.''
	   England won the bronze medal by beating South Africa 56-54.

Fischer warns Malaysia turmoil threat to APEC summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HORSHAM, Australia (AP) _ Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said
Monday he feared political turmoil in Malaysia could end in
violence and the cancellation of the APEC summit in Kuala Lumpur in
November.
	   ``I have absolute fear that things might deteriorate very
rapidly and that in turn will jeopardize the prospects of a
constructive working meeting of APEC,'' the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, Fischer told journalists.
	   ``APEC is in a fragile state due to the economic difficulties
faced by Asia. We certainly don't want to see the holding of the
APEC leader's summit and the build up meetings to APEC in any way
reduced by the turmoil on the Malaysian political scene,'' said
Fischer, who also serves as Australia's trade minister.
	   Fischer's comments followed the arrest of Malaysia's former
deputy prime minister and leading dissident, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Fischer said he would not comment on claims that Anwar had been
set up on charges of sexual misconduct.

Fifty years after constitution, Gordon welcomes advances of

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The woman who helped write the section on women's
rights in Japan's constitution after World War II praised on Monday
the advances women have made here in the last half-century.
	   Beate Gordon, 74, who worked for the U.S. Occupation,
acknowledged that Japanese women still face a great deal of social
inequalities and that Japan's record on women's rights lags behind
that of the United States. But Japanese women have come a long way,
she said.
	   ``I am amazed by the difference,'' Gordon told reporters in
Tokyo during one of her frequent visits to Japan, where she is
respected as a proponent of women's rights. ``The energy of the
women impresses me more than the energy of the men.''
	   The role of Gordon and other Americans who helped write the
Japanese constitution is a remarkable chapter in Japanese history.
	   To this day, many Japanese are grateful for the efforts of the
group of Americans, many young and idealistic, who helped draft the
constitution to include ideas that were fairly alien to Japan's
rulers of that era, including women's rights and commitment to
peace.
	   At a top-secret meeting to discuss the constitution, Japanese
officials were outraged that a section on women's rights was
proposed as part of the constitution, Gordon recalled.
	   But what she had initially proposed to her U.S. Occupation
bosses had offered even more guarantees on women's rights,
including equal rights for illegitimate children and government
help for pregnant and nursing women, Gordon said.
	   Those proposals were turned down by her bosses prior to the
meeting.
	   The Japanese constitution states that people are ``equal under
the law'' and that there should be no discrimination ``because of
race, creed, sex, social status or family origin.'' It also says
that marriage must be based on mutual consent and that husband and
wife are equal.
	   Gordon grew up in Japan as the daughter of pianist Leo Sirota,
who had taught here since 1929. Her Japanese female friends had to
learn docile, feminine roles and abide by arranged marriages, she
recalled.
	   ``After all, I know the Japan where the women walked behind the
men,'' she said.

	   The wife had argued that her research had not finished and so
the agreement not to conceive should not end, but the court ruled
Sunday that such an agreement has no legal standing.
	   The judge said the basis of marriage was stability and
childbearing and ordered the professor to return to her husband and
try to conceive.
	   While research could be put off for a year, childbearing could
not be postponed, the officials quoted the judge as saying.

Sightseeing tours to North Korea to be delayed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hyundai business group said Monday its
planned sightseeing tours to a North Korean mountain resort will be
delayed for at least a month.
	   Group chairman Chung Mong-hun said the project was not being
delayed for political reasons but because, ``Some working-level
issues have yet to be resolved.''
	   Hyundai had planned to start the tours on Friday.
	   ``I believe we will be able to start the tours in mid-October at
the earliest,'' said Chung Mong-hun said upon returning to South
Korea from a visit to the North.
	   Chung's father, Chung Ju-yung, founder of Hyundai, visited his
native North Korea in June with a gift of 500 cattle. He returned
with agreements on several joint venture projects.
	   One allows Hyundai to operate cruise ship tours to Diamond

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Crew members of a Philippine ferry
that sank in a tropical storm abandoned the passengers and failed
to instruct them to leave the ship, a rescued police official said
Monday.
	   ``We were left to fend for ourselves,'' said police
superintendent Napoleon Sesante, one of 311 confirmed survivors of
Friday night's ferry accident. At least 39 people died.
	   Sesante said the Princess of the Orient's officers and crew
never told passengers what was happening or what to do as huge
waves and strong winds buffeted the ferry.
	   The ferry's skipper, Capt. Esrum Mahilum, apparently ordered his
crew to abandon the ship, which was carrying 454 people, when it
began to sink but did not relay this to passengers, Sesante said.
	   ``They didn't say anything, there were no instructions to
passengers. They were irresponsible,'' Sesante said in an interview
over a Manila radio station.
	   Andrei Andresan, a lawyer for Sulpicio Lines, the ship's owner,
said reports by surviving crew members indicate the captain did
give orders to people to abandon the ship. But Andresan said crew
members may have left the ship when it became impossible to save
more passengers.
	   ``They're also humans who will jump into the sea when there is
no more time,'' he said.
	   Rescuers in ships and helicopters continued their search for
survivors Monday off the coast of Cavite province, south of Manila.
On Sunday, 17 people were rescued from chilly storm-whipped waters.
	   Maritime officials said several other ships also reported
difficulties Friday night in tropical storm Vicki, including
injuries to passengers. But they said the Princess of the Orient,
one of the Philippines' largest inter-island ferries, should have
been capable of withstanding much worse weather.
	   Survivors said the ship began tilting to the left and sank in
less than an hour.
	   Sesante said he was told after his rescue by the captain of
another ship owned by Sulpicio Lines that chains securing cargo in
the Princess of the Orient came loose, allowing several heavy
containers to slide to one side when the ship encountered strong
waves and winds.
	   As the ship began to sink, Sesante called an aide on land using
a cellular phone and asked him to contact people who could rescue
the passengers. The aide called a Manila radio station, which in
turn informed navy and coast guard officials.
	   On Sunday, chief accident investigator Arnie Santiago said the
ship was carrying 15 vehicles and 66 containers of truck parts and
other heavy materials that may not have been properly secured.
	   ``The way the ship tilted indicates that the cargo moved,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   He said the sinking was unusually rapid, suggesting that some of
the ship's water seals may have been damaged by an onboard fire in
1997. After the fire, the 24-year-old ship was repaired at a
Singapore dry dock.
	   Carlos Go, chief executive officer of Sulpicio Lines, insisted
the ship was seaworthy despite the fire.
	   Sulpicio Lines also owned the Dona Paz, a ferry which collided
with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people died in the sinking of
another ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
	   Anguished relatives have been waiting at a pier in Manila for
the return of rescue ships since Saturday.
	   The company said there were 352 passengers and 102 crew aboard
the ship. No foreigners were reported on board.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who built
Sweden's welfare state and then forced it to deteriorate, now have
a chance to make good on their promise to rebuild it.
	   The party came through Sunday's national elections with their
worst performance ever _ just 36.6 percent of the votes _ but with
conservative parties apparently unable to budge them from power.
	   The four non-socialist parties ended up with a total of 169
seats in the 349-seat Riksdag parliament: far more than the Social
Democrats' 131, but short of a majority.
	   The Social Democrats' strength lies in the seats won by two
other parties, the Left Party and the Greens. Together, the three
parties would have 190 seats.
	   But it's not a combination that makes the Social Democrats
comfortable. The Social Democrats say the other two parties'
policies are unrealistic, and the Left and the Greens adamantly
oppose Sweden's possible participation in the European Union's
single-currency system which the Social Democrats have supported in
theory if not in action.
	   ``This is not a good situation'' said Ingela Thalen, a top party
official, as voting results rolled in.
	   Financial markets agreed, with the Stockholm bourse general
index falling 2 percent and the krona weakening against the German
mark in early trading Monday.
	   ``It was the worst result one could imagine,'' analyst Thomas
Hagenfeldt of Orkla Securities was quoted as telling the news
agency TT.
	   When they regained power in 1994, the Social Democrats embarked
on an austerity program of cutting funding to Sweden's cherished
cradle-to-grave social services in order to extract the country
from an enormous debt.
	   The measures paid off in restoring balance to public finances,
including a predicted small budget surplus this year; in a
virtually undetectable inflation rate and in reducing unemployment,
although it is still high at 7.3 percent.
	   But the measures also left Swedes watching medical and other
services decline even as they continued to pay the world's highest
taxes.
	   The austerity clearly cost the Social Democrats votes. While
their support declined from the 45 percent the party got in 1994,
the ex-Communist Left Party nearly doubled its total with 12
percent of the vote on promises of restoring the welfare state
while reducing the workweek.
	   Others may have gravitated to the other end of the political
spectrum, to the Christian Democrats who nearly tripled their
support with a platform emphasizing improved medical and elderly
care.
	   The Social Democrats have promised they can rebuild the welfare
state, but say it will never be what it was in the 1960s, when the
rest of the world looked admiringly at a country with full
employment and medical care that cost only nominal fees.
	   How they will do that is unclear, given the new balance of power
in the parliament.
	   ``It's too early to say which party we may cooperate with'' in
the budget process, Finance Minister Erik Aasbrink said late
Sunday.
	   It won't be with the Moderates, the main conservative party.
Moderates leader Carl Bildt, a former prime minister, ruled out any
parliamentary cooperation with the party.
	   ``The Social Democrats are entering both a parliamentary and a
political crisis,'' Bildt said.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson put on a sanguine face in public,
proclaiming to a party fete that ``We rule on!'' But he also said
he was cancelling a planned trip to New York on Monday in order to
analyze the election results.
	   Bildt had focused his campaign on characterizing the Social
Democrats as trying to hold on to a vision made obsolete by the
globalizing economy. Sweden's taxes stifle job-creation and doom
the country to marginality, he said.
	   But even Sweden's most market-oriented major politician could
not buck the system in a big way: Bildt's proposal for cutting
taxes would have reduced them to 50 percent of gross domestic
product _ still one of the world's highest tax burdens.

Officials: Liberians shoot at U.S. Embassy in attempt to get at
</HEADLINE>
former warlord
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberian secret police opened fire on
the American Embassy in Monrovia, killing at least two people and
injuring two as they tried to catch a former warlord who had sought
refuge inside, peacekeeping officials said Monday.
	   Two of those known to have died were aides to former Liberian
warlord Roosevelt Johnson, a rival of President Charles Taylor,
according to Gen. Timothy Shelpidi, commander of the Nigerian-led
peacekeeping force that patrols Liberia.
	   ``Some of Johnson's men ran into the American Embassy and
Liberian security forces opened fire on them,'' he said.
	   The Saturday morning shooting followed unrest that started
Friday night when the government tried to arrest Johnson. The
fighting was over by late Saturday, but it left parts of the
seaside Liberian capital littered with corpses and wreckage.
	   At least 33 people were killed.
	   Johnson was hiding in the embassy, according to a State
Department official in Washington, who spoke Sunday on condition of
anonymity. Government forces told embassy personnel they ``will
honor the inviolability of the embassy,'' said the official, who
said he didn't know whether Johnson was still at the compound late
Sunday.
	   The State Department official confirmed government forces fired
on Johnson's group as they entered the embassy, killing two of his
aides and injuring two Americans. One American security officer was
evacuated for medical treatment to Freetown, Sierra Leone.
	   It was unclear if Americans had fired back during the shooting,
nor was it known how badly they had been injured.
	   The embassy suspended operations and authorized the departure of
non-emergency personnel and family members of embassy workers.
	   The State Department also issued a travel advisory Saturday,
warning Americans against going to Liberia.
	   Smears of blood could still be seen near the embassy's gate a
day after the shooting. Liberian police and soldiers from the West
African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, were outside the
embassy gates.
	   Embassy officials declined all comment and Liberian officials
could not immediately be reached.
	   Taylor has blamed the latest outburst of fighting on Johnson's
men and said the former warlord - his greatest rival when both had
militias during Liberia's civil war - was hiding in the embassy.
	   ``We will not react kindly to any attempt by the U.S. government
to evacuate those individuals from Liberia,'' Taylor said Saturday.
	   On Sunday, Information Minister Joe Mulbah said Johnson had been
training a force to subvert Taylor's government.
	   Volunteers on Sunday collected dead bodies from Monrovia's
streets, which were patrolled by hundreds of soldiers who stopped
cars at many checkpoints.
	   Dozens of people were wounded by stray bullets during the
fighting, which centered around Johnson's home. On Sunday, dozens
of soldiers patrolled the streets of that neighborhood, stopping
cars and chasing away pedestrians. Tanks occasionally rumbled past.
	   A half-dozen soldiers lounged in front of Johnson's ramshackle
concrete house, marked by the wreckage of a 4-door Mazda torn apart
by gunfire.
	   On Saturday, explosions from rocket and mortar rounds echoed
through the streets.
	   Taylor's attempt to arrest Johnson in 1996 triggered months of
fighting that left hundreds of people in Monrovia dead and the city
a burned-out, looted wreck. Johnson eventually fled to Ghana _
after taking shelter in the U.S. embassy and flying from the
country on an American helicopter.
	   He and Taylor eventually reached a tenuous peace.
	   Johnson returned from exile to become Liberia's rural
development minister after Taylor won last year's presidential
elections.
	   But tensions between the two have persisted and forces loyal to
both sides have clashed several times in recent months.
	   Liberia's civil war left 150,000 people dead and prompted
thousands more to flee their homes before it ended in 1996.

Revolution Square, a rerun of Bucharest's heyday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALISON MUTLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A string of pearls around her neck,
Princess Margaret steps out of royal-blue car with her Romanian
actor husband, just in time to hear American soprano Barbara
Hendricks sing.
	   At the steps of the newly restored 19th century Athenaeum
concert hall, the scene seems like a rerun of Bucharest's fabled
days of glory when Princess Margaret's grandmother, Queen Marie was
the most glamorous royal in the Balkans.
	   A war, two abdications and almost half a century of communism
separate Princess Margaret and Queen Marie. But after decades of
wanton neglect, this square _ Revolution Square _ has been reborn.
	   ``You know we aren't the last country in Europe,'' says Anisa
Tichia, a 60-year-old dentist in navy blue chiffon and a straw hat,
defensively. She's been to four concerts this season, a festival of
song presided over by Yehudi Menuhin.
	   History has swept through this particular plaza. Nazis,
communists, bullets and democracy builders have all left their mark
on the square, the cultural and historical heart of Bucharest.
	   In the darkest days of communism in the fall of 1989, as Gypsy
flower sellers abandoned ``Piatza Palatului'' (Palace Square) as it
was known then, it was as if the soul of Bucharest was gasping its
last breath.
	   Not long after, bullets ricocheted through the rambling square,
pock marking the then-seedy Athenee Palace Hotel, the city's main
library and a church, as Romanians struggled to throw off Nicolae
Ceausescu's tyrannical rule. Ceausescu fled the square with his
wife Elena in a wobbling helicopter. Days later the couple was
executed after a summary trial.
	   Nine years on, Revolution Square is ``is a symbol of elegance,
of the past reborn,'' says resident French financial consultant
Philippe Tronche. ``Here, you feel like a citizen of the world.''
	   Thousands of hours of hard toil, more than a lick of paint and
tons of costly creamy-yellow stone facade went into the rebuilding
of the library, the Athenaeum and the royal palace.
	   The Athenee Palace has reopened as a five-star hotel run by the
Hilton chain.
	   At dusk, if it weren't for the glare of headlights and the hum
of cars, you could stepping into one of the many books written from
the square.
	   Crowds dine outdoors at ``Cina's'' crooned by live music. Guards
on sentry duty, the royal palace looks as if it might be expecting
King Michael back any minute. Michael was forced to abdicate by
communists in 1947.
	   He was given a standing ovation recently when he attended one of
the concerts, but he didn't visit his old palace.

Police charge Anwar supporters, fire tear gas and water cannon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new grafs 12-16 with statement by Anwar's wife.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse thousands of supporters of the
country's ousted deputy prime minister in the second day of street
clashes. An army unit was sent onto the streets of the capital to
help quell demonstrations.
	   Federal police said the fired politician, Anwar Ibrahim, was
being held under a law that allows indefinite imprisonment without
charges or trial for those deemed a threat to national security.
	   One of his allies, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, head of the youth wing of
the ruling party, was detained under the same act, bringing to at
least seven the number of Anwar's supporters arrested on various
charges.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad may be seeking to remove Anwar,
his only rival, from the political scene by the quickest means
possible. Anwar has been leading the increasingly public opposition
to the 17-year rule of the 72-year-old prime minister.
	   Anwar's detention has already threatened to overshadow a visit
by Queen Elizabeth II to Kuala Lumpur and her festive closing of
the 16th Commonwealth Games. The queen's motorcade passed the
throng of noisy pro-reform demonstrators in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar, who was tossed out of the government earlier this month,
is expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and disturbing the
public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night has added a
volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic troubles.
	   But the use of the security act implies that there is not enough
substance in the charges to try Anwar and his allies in court, said
Chandra Muzaffar, political science professor at the University of
Malaya. ``It means that the government is not prepared to give him
a chance to defend himself in court,'' the professor said.
	   Pounding batons on their heavy shields, police charged into a
crowd of 2,000 people outside the courthouse where Anwar had been
expected to appear for arraignment Monday morning.
	   There were injuries among the demonstrators. Some were hauled
away bleeding by police.
	   ``We didn't do anything,'' said Marizal Jai, 23, a janitor.
``They attacked us with water and tear gas. They chased us in and
out of buildings.''
	   Several hundred protesters, hemmed in by police units, then
headed toward the National Mosque, just a few blocks down the
street. The mosque was the site of the 51-year-old Anwar's fiery
speech Sunday that culminated in protests and his arrest.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, issued an eloquent rallying call
late Monday to Malaysia's still-diffuse reform movement.
	   ``Unfortunately the police acted wildly. This is another truth
how the police have lost their sense of balance, of humanity, by
attacking the public,'' Azizah told reporters.
	   She said she regretted the police storming of the family home
Sunday night, an act that terrified her, Anwar and their children.
	   ``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by ordering the police to act like
gangsters he will frighten the people from supporting this
reformation movement, he is dreaming. I think he has cut himself
off from reality,'' Azizah said.
	   Looking shaken, she added: ``I feel very sad because Dr.
Mahathir is a great leader, but now he has become a political
desperado, who is willing to suppress his own people just to keep
power.''
	   Police swooped in and blocked several access points to the
city's main plaza, Merdeka (Freedom) Square, with jeeps, trucks and
police cars to keep protesters away.
	   More than 1,000 police were frantically working to contain the
angry demonstrators. They were backed by a specially trained unit
of two dozen reserve army officers. Police chased small mobs of men
down the city's side streets.
	   National police chief Abdul Rahim Noor refused to say where
Anwar was being held Monday.
	   But an aide to Anwar's wife said the family had been told that
he was taken overnight to a maximum security detention camp.
	   ``We're here to support Anwar because he's innocent. He didn't
do all those crazy things,'' said Haji Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old
businessman. ``We want him as our prime minister.''
	   More than 100 reporters thronged the Sessions Court, expecting
to see Anwar brought in to hear the charges against him.
	   As tear gas poured into the courthouse, frightened lawyers and
court staff rushed outside, holding handkerchiefs and cloths over
their faces.

Saudi beheaded for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man was executed Monday for
murdering a fellow tribesman, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Mohammed Abdul-Rahman al-Qahtani was beheaded in the southern
province of Asir, the ministry said in a statement.
	   He had been convicted of shooting to death Mohammed Masood
al-Qahtani after a dispute.
	   The statement did not say when or where the crime took place.
	   The execution raised to 21 the number of beheadings in the
kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.

Da Costa runs fastest marathon in history at Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ The conditions were perfect. So was the race.
	   Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa ran the fastest marathon in history
Sunday to break a 10-year-old record by 45 seconds as he clocked 2
hours, 6 minutes, 5 seconds at the Berlin Marathon.
	   The 28-year-old bettered the previous world best of 2:06:50 set
by Ethiopia's Belayneh Densimo at Rotterdam, Netherlands, in 1988.
	   ``I wanted to run under 2:08, but when I saw how good the
conditions were, I just went for it,'' da Costa said after running
on a cool, sunny and windless day.
	   Da Costa broke to the front at the halfway point, reached in
1:04:42. He then struck out by himself and his acceleration was so
quick that within less than a mile, he was 45 seconds in front.
	   He ran the second half in a sensational 1:01:23, and after
crossing the finish line, he did a cartwheel in celebration.
	   Thus the men's and women's marks were broken in the same year.
Kenya's Tegla Loroupe smashed the women's 13-year-old record with
2:20:47 at Rotterdam in April.
	   Following da Costa across the finish line Sunday were three
Kenyans. Josephat Kiprono was runner-up at 2:07:26, followed by
Samson Kandie at 2:09:11 and Reuben Chebutich at 2:10:39. Kiprono's
time was 1 1/2 minutes faster than his previous best, while the
21-year-old Kandie matched his marathon debut time at Prague, Czech
Republic, in May and Chebutich's time was two minutes faster than
his victory at Belgrade, Yugoslavia, in April.
	   Belgium's Marleen Renders was the women's winner at 2:25:22,
nearly three minutes ahead of runner-up and first-time marathoner
Susan Chepkemei of Kenya (2:28:19). Three-time Berlin winner Renata
Kokowska of Poland finished third at 2:31:54.
	   The race had about 28,000 starters _ 4,000 more than last year _
making it the third-largest marathon, behind London and New York.
It was watched by an estimated 1 million spectators.

North Korea accuses Seoul of plotting to kill donated cattle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea accused the South Korean
government on Monday of orchestrating a ``vicious plot'' to kill
the 500 cattle it received as a gift from a Seoul businessman in
June.
	   The cattle were force fed indigestible material before being
shipped across the border so they would later die slowly, the
North's official Korean Central News Agency reported.
	   The report said the scheme was cooked up by South Korea's
Unification Ministry and the government's intelligence arm, the
Agency for National Security Planning.
	   ``Their act proves once again that the `ANSP' and the `Ministry
of Unification' are herds of traitors and separatists,'' said the
English-language news service, which serves as an international
voice for the reclusive communist regime.
	   The news agency said 15 cattle already have died and eight more
are near death.
	   Autopsies found vinyl strips and lumps of hemp rope in the
stomachs of the dead animals, items ``which cannot be seen in''
North Korea, the agency said.
	   ``We cannot guess how many (cattle) may fall to the vicious
plot,'' it added.
	   The cattle were a gift from Chung Ju-yung, founder of Seoul's
powerful Hyundai business group, when he visited his native North
Korea three months ago.
	   Seoul government officials denied the North Korean accusations,
saying they were not involved in any way in the shipment of the
cattle.
	   ``It is nonsense. It is not even worth making a comment,'' an
official at the Agency for National Security Planning said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Hyundai officials declined comment, saying they have no
information about the North's claim.
	   The Koreas were separated into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945 and fought a three-year war in the early
1950s.

Russia's Central Bank prints money, offers credits to help banks

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion
new rubles (dlrs 66 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid
to get cash flowing through the frozen banking system, an official
said Monday.
	   Also, President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov met in the Kremlin with the aim of finalizing the new
cabinet and working out a plan to stabilize the jittery economy.
	   The government's biggest fear at present is that the country's
shaky commercial banks will collapse. The Central Bank launched an
emergency rescue plan on Friday to help ensure that payments would
start circulating again.
	   Russia's financial crisis had caused a backlog of bank payments
totaling over 30 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion), Andrei Kozlov,
the first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, told a news
conference Monday.
	   The Central Bank on Friday helped to settle 10 billion rubles
(dlrs 666 million), or one-third of the total owed between banks
and their clients, Kozlov said.
	   As part of the effort, the Central Bank printed 900 million
rubles (dlrs 60 million) and issued short-term credits to banks,
Kozlov said.
	   Critics have accused the government of responding slowly to the
economic crisis which hit last month. The rescue plan for the banks
represents the biggest emergency effort so far.
	   Primakov has been in office 10 days, but has yet to outline an
overall economic strategy or put his cabinet in place. Key jobs,
such as the finance minister's post, have not be filled.
	   ``We are going to finalize the personnel issue with (Primakov)
today,'' Yeltsin said at the start of his meeting with the premier.
	   ``The cabinet formation is still on the way, but we have already
been carrying out serious work,'' Primakov said.
	   The economy has been crumbling over the past month as the
currency was devalued, inflation soared, and the country defaulted
on its loans.
	   The virtual shutdown of the country's banks meant a moratorium
on payments of all kinds, from salaries to the purchase of goods
and services, and left depositors cut off from their savings.
	   Primakov named Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin, considered a
moderate reformer, to head Russia's delegation in talks with the
International Monetary Fund, Russian news agencies reported Monday.
	   An IMF mission arrived in Moscow on Friday for a week of talks
with Russian officials to follow up on Russia's lending program.
The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package in July, but
it did not ward off the crisis.
	   The Central Bank's rescue plan for the banks helped them clear
their debts to one another with a so-called debt swap system, which
allowed them to use reserves stored in the Central Bank to pay
their liabilities.
	   However, the debt swap is expected to involve the printing of
billions of new rubles in coming weeks and months, which almost
certainly will contribute to inflation. Consumer prices have
already begun to soar after being kept under control for more than
a year.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who built
Sweden's welfare state and then forced it to deteriorate, now have
a chance to make good on their promise to rebuild it.
	   The party came through Sunday's national elections with their
worst performance ever _ just 36.6 percent of the votes _ but with
conservative parties apparently unable to budge them from power.
	   The four non-socialist parties got 169 seats in the 349-seat
Riksdag parliament: far more than the Social Democrats' 131, but
short of a majority.
	   The Social Democrats' strength lies in the seats won by two
other parties, the Left Party and the Greens. Together, the three
parties would have 190 seats.
	   But it's not a combination that makes the Social Democrats
comfortable. The Social Democrats say the other two parties'
policies are unrealistic, and the Left and the Greens adamantly
oppose Sweden's possible participation in the European Union's
single-currency system which the Social Democrats have supported in
theory if not in action.
	   Financial markets reacted negatively, with the Stockholm bourse
general index falling 2 percent and the krona weakening against the
German mark in early trading Monday.
	   ``It was the worst result one could imagine,'' analyst Thomas
Hagenfeldt of Orkla Securities was quoted as telling the news
agency TT.
	   When they regained power in 1994, the Social Democrats embarked
on an austerity program of cutting funding to Sweden's cherished
cradle-to-grave social services in order to extract the country
from an enormous debt.
	   The measures paid off in restoring balance to public finances,
including a predicted small budget surplus this year; in a
virtually undetectable inflation rate and in reducing unemployment,
although it is still high at 7.3 percent.
	   But the measures also left Swedes watching medical and other
services decline even as they continued to pay among the world's
highest taxes.
	   The austerity clearly cost the Social Democrats votes. While
their support declined from the 45 percent the party got in 1994,
the ex-Communist Left Party nearly doubled its total with 12
percent of the vote on promises of restoring the welfare state
while reducing the workweek.
	   Others may have gravitated to the other end of the political
spectrum, to the Christian Democrats who nearly tripled their
support with a platform emphasizing improved medical and elderly
care.
	   The Social Democrats have promised they can rebuild the welfare
state, but say it will never be what it was in the 1960s, when the
rest of the world looked admiringly at a country with full
employment and medical care that cost only nominal fees.
	   How they will do that is unclear, given the new balance of power
in the parliament.
	   ``It's too early to say which party we may cooperate with'' in
the budget process, Finance Minister Erik Aasbrink said late
Sunday.
	   It won't be with the Moderates, the main conservative party.
Moderates leader Carl Bildt, a former prime minister, ruled out any
parliamentary cooperation with the party.
	   ``The Social Democrats are entering both a parliamentary and a
political crisis,'' Bildt said.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson put on a sanguine face in public,
proclaiming to a party fete that ``We rule on!'' But he also said
he was cancelling a planned trip to New York on Monday in order to
analyze the election results.
	   Bildt had focused his campaign on characterizing the Social
Democrats as trying to hold on to a vision made obsolete by the
globalizing economy. Sweden's taxes stifle job-creation and doom
the country to marginality, he said.
	   But even Sweden's most market-oriented major politician could
not buck the system in a big way: Bildt's proposal for cutting
taxes would have reduced them to 50 percent of gross domestic
product _ still one of the world's highest tax burdens.

	   MANILA, Philippines _ Philippine officials allowed the country's
second-largest airline to resume flights Monday, two days before
the scheduled closure of the largest carrier, Philippine Airlines.
	   The Civil Aeronautics Board said Air Philippines will be allowed
to fly two of its aircraft after complying with safety requirements
for those planes. Its whole fleet of 12 planes was grounded Friday
for safety violations.
	   Air Philippines president Augustus Paiso said six flights were
scheduled Monday using the two cleared MD-82 planes. The other
planes are expected to be cleared within a week, he said.
	   Philippine aviation officials suspended the operating permit of
the airline after discovering lapses in its safety and maintenance
procedures.
	   A smaller carrier, Grand International Airways, remained closed
after voluntarily canceling flights last week because of unpaid
insurance and fuel bills, employees said.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, announced last week it will shut
down at midnight Wednesday because its efforts to recover from
massive financial losses were no longer viable following its
unions' refusal to accept a management-proposed rescue plan.
	   The grounding of the carriers and PAL's scheduled closure pose a
devastating threat to the country, leaving many areas of the
sprawling archipelago of 7,000 islands without air service.
	   The only alternative inter-island transportation, ocean ferries,
suffered a major blow last Friday when a ship carrying 454 people
sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.
	    &UR; ___
	   MANILA, Philippines _ President Joseph Estrada urged Philippine
Airlines' management and labor unions Monday to return to the
negotiating table in a last-minute attempt to stop the closure of
Asia's oldest commercial airline.
	   ``I am practically begging on bended knees for management and
the workers to come to their senses and reach an agreement,''
Estrada said.
	   ``We are doing everything to save PAL, that's why I'm still
talking to labor and management,'' he said in a radio interview.
``They should not only think of themselves but also of the country
because PAL's closure will affect a lot of people.''
	   PAL announced last week that it plans to shut down at midnight
on Wednesday.
	   Estrada ruled out the possibility of the government taking over
the airline to stop its closure, saying his administration has no
money to run the cash-strapped airline.
	   PAL's largest union appealed Monday to PAL chairman and chief
stockholder Lucio Tan to stop his closure order. It offered in
return to renegotiate its collective bargaining agreement.
	   In a rescue plan, Tan has offered workers 20 percent of the
airline's stock and three seats on its board in exchange for a
10-year suspension of their collective bargaining agreements, but
union leaders have refused.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand _ Former Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has said the Association of Southeast Asian Nations is
in danger of falling apart because of the regional economic crisis
and weak leadership.
	   ``If the present generation of leaders cannot help sustain the
grouping's progress and unity, how will the new generation be able
to forge unity?'' Chavalit asked in an interview with The Nation
newspaper published on Monday.
	   ASEAN is a regional security and economic grouping that consists
of Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Chavalit was prime minister for one year until November 1997,
when he resigned amid public discontent over his inability to
manage Thailand's plummeting economy.
	   Thailand was the epicenter of the regional economic crisis,
which has now spread to Russia and Latin America. During Chavalit's
term, the central bank depleted the nation's foreign reserves in a
failed defense of the country's currency, the baht.
	   Chavalit floated the baht in July 1997, touching off a wave of
competitive devaluations and necessitating a dlrs 17.2 billion
bailout of the Thai economy by the International Monetary Fund.

	   SEOUL, South Korea _ Hyundai business group said Monday its
planned sightseeing tours of a North Korean mountain resort will be
delayed for at least a month.
	   ``I believe we will be able to start the tours in mid-October at
the earliest,'' Hyundai chairman Chung Mong-hun said upon arrival
from a visit to North Korea.
	   Hyundai had planned to start the tours on Friday.
	   Chung's father, Chung Ju-yung, founder of Hyundai, visited his
native North Korea in June with a gift of 500 cattle. He returned
with agreements on several joint venture projects.
	   One allows Hyundai to launch cruise ship tours to Diamond
Mountain, a scenic tourist site on the North's east coast. Hyundai
hopes to send up to 2,000 tourists a week on the tours.
	   ``Some working-level issues have yet to be resolved,'' the
Hyundai chairman said, adding that the project was not being
delayed because of political reasons.
	   The tours would mark the first major joint venture between the
two Koreas, divided into the communist North and the capitalist
South in 1945.
	    &UR; ___
	   HONG KONG _ A small group of union demonstrators marched to the
offices of Hongkong Telecommunications early Monday to protest the
across-the-board wage cuts announced last week.
	   About 10 representatives of several labor unions waved banners
saying ``Strongly opposed to wage cuts'' and ``Ten billion in
profits, 10-percent pay cut'' outside a commercial building housing
the company's executive offices.
	   Union leaders also handed over a petition signed by nearly 9,000
citizens against the 10-percent pay cut announced last Thursday.
	   The Telecom, Hong Kong's largest private employer hiring 13,800
people, told its staff to take the cut starting Nov. 1 or be
sacked.
	   Unionists and workers fear the Telecom's decision would lead to
more pay cuts by smaller companies as unemployment has soared to a
15-year high of 5 percent.
	   ``We hope the Telecom won't sacrifice the workers' benefits and
the company's reputation ... for its own short-term gains,'' said
lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan, secretary-general of the Confederation of
Trade Unions.
	   Another evening protest, expected to be joined by more
employees, had been scheduled after office hours outside of the
Telecom's headquarters.
	    &UR; ___
	   TOKYO _ Japan's trade surplus rose 24.7 percent last month from
a year ago as the nation's economic slowdown and a drop in crude
oil prices lessened imports, the government said Monday.
	   The trade surplus, a tally of goods exported minus imports
without adjustment for seasonal factors, rose to 896.7 billion yen
(dlrs 6.72 billion) from the same month last year, the Finance
Ministry said.
	   Japan's politically sensitive surplus with the United States
continued to climb, rising 28.4 percent to 431 billion yen (dlrs
3.23 billion). It was the 23nd straight month of increase.
	   The overall trade surplus has now risen for 17 months straight
compared to last year. Japan has come under increasing pressure to
revive its recession-plagued economy and help struggling Asian
nations by importing more from the region.
	   Japan's exports rose 2 percent to 4.0 trillion yen (dlrs 30
billion) in August and imports fell 3 percent to 3.1 trillion yen
(dlrs 23.3 billion), officials said.
	   Japan's exports to the United States rose 15.3 percent to 1.2
trillion yen (dlrs 9 billion); imports also rose, by 9.2 percent,
to 781.9 billion yen (dlrs 5.87 billion).
	   Exports to the United States were led by a 17 percent rise in
auto exports and a 175.3 percent jump in steel exports, they said.
A stronger dollar also helped push auto exports to the United
States higher, Tokyo said.
	    &UR; ___
	   HORSHAM, Australia _ Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister
Tim Fischer said Monday he feared political turmoil in Malaysia
could end in violence and the cancellation of the APEC summit in
Kuala Lumpur in November.
	   ``I have absolute fear that things might deteriorate very
rapidly and that in turn will jeopardize the prospects of a
constructive working meeting of APEC, the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, Fischer told journalists in the Victorian
country town of Horsham.
	   ``APEC is in a fragile state due to the economic difficulties
faced by Asia. We certainly don't want to see the holding of the
APEC leader's summit and the build up meetings to APEC in any way
reduced by the turmoil on the Malaysian political scene.
	   ``I certainly hope it will be a peaceful circumstance over the
next couple of months in Malaysia. I just don't want any threat to
the holding of that APEC summit,'' he said.
	   Fischer's comments followed the arrest of former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Fischer said he would not comment on claims that Anwar had been
set up on charges of sexual misconduct.

Ugandan army detains 15 people, retrieves guns in security sweep
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ Ugandan soldiers detained 15 people and
retrieved guns and ammunition in a house-to-house search in eastern
Kampala, a private radio reported Monday.
	   The weekend operation was apparently aimed at robbers and
possible terrorists after last month's bomb attacks on three buses,
which killed 30 people, Radio Simba said.
	   The Njuba Times daily said 15 people without identification
papers were detained at Mbuya military barracks.
	   Authorities also tightened security in Kampala and deployed
police at government offices, banks, embassies and high-rise
buildings. Abandoned vehicles were immediately towed away.
	   Five diplomatic missions in Kampala, including the U.S. Embassy
and the British High Commission, were closed for several days last
week following a series of threatening telephone calls.
	   In Uganda, police have arrested 18 people suspected of planning
attacks on American and other foreign diplomatic missions as well
as Ugandan government installations, a senior official said
Saturday.
	   On Aug. 7, terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania killed 258 people, including 12 Americans, and injured
more than 5,500.
	   The Ugandan government has been fighting the rebels of Allied
Democratic Front in western Uganda and Lord's Resistance Army in
the north.
	   President Yoweri Museveni also said Ugandan troops were in
neighboring Congo to prevent cross-border rebel attacks. However,
Congolese President Laurent Kabila accuses Uganda of helping to
sponsor the rebellion in the east of the country.

Malaysia wins two badminton titles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's Wong Choon Han came
from a game down to beat compatriot Yong Hock Kin and claim the
gold medal in the men's singles badminton competition at the
Commonwealth Games on Monday.
	   Wong, Malaysia's No.3 player who has been in strong form since
the Thomas Cup in May, won 10-15, 15-12, 15-6 in a tense match
lasting 76 minutes.
	   The victory was Wong's first against Yong in their three
meetings. He started aggressively in the first set, taking a 9-5
lead with several strong crosscourt smashes. The more experienced
Yong fought back to level at 10-10 and won the game in 27 minutes.
	   Wong, 21, outplayed Yong in the third with some deceptive shot
and good work at the net.
	   ``I was really exhausted as I had to match Yong stroke for
stroke,'' said Wong. ``I was lucky I played Yong on his bad day.''
	   In the men's doubles gold medal round, Malaysia's second pair of
Choong Tan Fook and Lee Wan Wah scored an upset 15-7, 15-4 win over
No.1-ranked compatriots Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock.
	   ``We just went to the court and did our best. We felt no
pressure at all,'' said Wan Wah.
	   Tan Fook said the winning duo was inspired by its critics. ``At
the beginning of the tournament, people said we can't beat England,
can't even beat Northern Ireland. But today, we proved that we can
do it,'' said Tan Fook.

 &UR; ANTIGUA: Georges begins whipping Caribbean islands &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Families huddled in basements and
businesses barricaded their entrances with sandbags as Hurricane
Georges began lashing the easternmost islands of the Caribbean
Sunday night
	   Winds were gusting to 50 mph (80 kph) in Antigua Sunday evening,
with forecasters predicting the arrival of the hurricane's full 125
mph (200 kph) fury by late Sunday night.
	   Georges' winds had weakened from 150 mph (240 kph) earlier
Sunday, but government officials warned it could still cause the
worst damage in decades. Residents on Guadeloupe and Dominica,
fearing the hurricane would peel roofs off homes, moved beds into
their basements or headed to hurricane shelters set up in schools.
	   Church congregations on many of the islands cut Sunday services
short in order to convert their sanctuaries into shelters.
	   ``We expect a full house tonight,'' said Priscilla Nicholas, a
volunteer at the Seventh Day Adventist church in Cedar Grove,
Antigua.
	   At 8 p.m. (2400 GMT), Georges' center was near 16.7 degrees
north, 60.6 degrees west, or about 85 miles (135 kilometers)
east-southeast of Antigua. Its progress had slowed slightly from
Saturday to 16 mph (26 kph) and was forecast to sweep
west-northwest through the Lesser Antilles.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Soccer team manager charged with murder of player
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ The manager of a community soccer team
has been arrested on charges of murdering one of his players,
police said Sunday.
	   Rohan Bell, 29, was charged with the fatal stabbing of Michael
Martin, 26, at a soccer field in the southern town of Port
Henderson on Saturday. Bell is the manager of the De La Vega City
Football Club, an amateur soccer team.
	   According to the Police Information Center, Martin asked Bell to
sign documents transferring him to another team.
	   A quarrel developed between them, both men drew knives, and
Martin was stabbed in the chest, police said.
	   He died while undergoing surgery at the Spanish Town Hospital.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Vacationing U.S. policeman drowns
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A U.S. police detective who was
vacationing in Jamaica was found drowned in the sea near his hotel,
police reported Sunday.
	   The Jamaica Police Information Center identified him as Leroy
Eswanie, 39, of Phoenix, Arizona. Eswanie was a detective with the
Phoenix police department, police said.
	   He and his girlfriend, who was not identified, arrived at the
Grand Lido Negril Hotel in Westmoreland, Jamaica on Friday. They
had drinks at the hotel bar, then went to their room, police said.
Eswanie left the room alone that evening, and his girlfriend
reported him missing several hours later.
	   Eswanie's body was discovered Saturday on a beach near the
hotel. His head was submerged in the water, and autopsy confirmed
he had drowned.
 &UR; JAMAICA: Chissano says Mozambique's rebuilding is ``mammoth'' task
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Four years after its first democratic
elections, the African nation of Mozambique is struggling to meet
``mammoth and overwhelming'' challenges of development, its
president said Sunday.
	   Speaking to a conference of the Jamaica's People's National
Party during a conference in Kingston, Mozambican leader Joaquim
Chissano said his country is still trying to rebuild its economy
after 20 years of experimentation with communism.
	   ``We are at the turning point,'' Chissano said. ``Once the
difficulties relating to this stage are overcome, the situation
will improve.''
	   Mozambique, a former Portugese colony, ended a 16-year civil war
in 1992 and held its first democratic national elections in 1994.
	   It is one of Africa's poorest countries despite natural gas
reserves, rich mineral deposits and ports that serve landlocked
Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and Swaziland.
	   Chissano, who leads the socialist Mozambique Liberation
Movement, is in Jamaica to meet with Prime Minister P.J. Patterson
and sign an economic development agreement.
 &UR; UNITED STATES: Chicago lauds Dominican baseball hero
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Sammy Sosa hugged his mother, kissed his wife and
then took off on a victory lap around Wrigley Field, waving his cap
as the theme from ``Superman'' blared over the loudspeakers.
	   What a way to end the best party Wrigley Field has seen in
decades.
	   ``It's been something special,'' Sosa said Sunday. ``Thank you
very much and God bless all of you.''
	   A week after Sosa hit home runs No. 61 and 62 to tie and pass
Roger Maris' single-season mark, the Chicago Cubs and major league
baseball threw a bash to celebrate his amazing season. He has 63
home runs, two behind St. Louis' Mark McGwire.
	   Sosa's mother, Lucrecya, and his siblings were flown in from the
Dominican Republic, and Maris' six children were on hand, too.
Commissioner Bud Selig came, and so did Juan Marichal, the Hall of
Fame pitcher who is Secretary of Sports in the Dominican Republic.
	   Even Michael Jordan showed up.
	   ``It's been one of the greatest individual seasons in the
history of major league baseball,'' Cubs general manager Ed Lynch
said.

Bank deal beginning to unravel on eve of U.S.-Japan summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHESTER DAWSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A last-minute compromise to resuscitate Japan's
troubled banking system appeared to be unraveling Monday, as ruling
and opposition party leaders publicly fought over just what was
agreed upon.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi struck the banking bill deal with
opposition parties late last week as he prepared to leave for his
first summit with U.S. President Clinton.
	   Obuchi is hoping to cite the compromise deal as evidence Japan
is making progress in cleaning up its bad loan mess when he confers
with Clinton Tuesday.
	   But whether he will be able to do that looked questionable
Monday, as sharp disputes emerged over exactly what had been agreed
to in several key areas of the proposed package.
	   Fears the deal might collapse sent Japanese stock prices
spiraling down to a new 12-year low on Monday.
	   At issue is the fate of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. and other lenders staggering under the weight of soured
loans, many of which were extended before Japan's economy entered a
prolonged slump nearly 10 years ago.
	   En route to the United States, Obuchi signaled Monday that LTCB
_ one of the country's biggest banks _ would not be allowed to
founder. That appeared to directly contradict opposition claims the
bank would be declared insolvent and nationalized.
	   ``If the Long-Term Credit Bank were to fail, it would cause a
major impact on the global economy,'' Obuchi told reporters.
	   Also Monday, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka expressed
support for using 13 trillion yen (dlrs 97.5 billion) in previously
approved funds to bail out distraught banks, indicating the ruling
party was backing away from a concession to scrap the funding plan.
	   In response to the ruling party's apparent backtracking,
opposition leader Naoto Kan, head of the Democratic Party of Japan,
has warned the entire pact was in danger of falling apart.
	   Another opposition leader, Democratic Socialist Party head
Takako Doi, said she doubted the compromise would successfully be
rendered into legislation without significant alterations.
	   ``Whether there was really an agreement between the ruling party
and the opposition is a question,'' Doi said Monday. ``A lot is
going to change while the agreement gets written into law.''
	   The uncertainty comes before details of the preliminary accord
are hammered out in a package of six bills. The ruling party needs
opposition support if the bills are to win passage in the upper
house of Parliament, where it does not have a majority.
	   A third contested issue involves the oversight powers of Japan's
Finance Ministry, which has been tainted by its inability to
resolve the banking industry's woes and the implication of its
officials in an influence-peddling scandals earlier this year.
	   The opposition has demanded that the ministry's regulatory
authority over the financial industry be wholly transferred to a
separate institution.
	   Nonaka, however, said Monday that the ministry is unlikely to
lose its policy planning and global finance monitoring functions.
	   With Japan's banks in clear need of action, the widening
political gap concerned many analysts.
	   ``It is distressing to see how much political time is being
taken up by bickering,'' said Brian Waterhouse, a banking analyst
in the Tokyo office of James Capel Pacific Ltd.

Widow of late Cambodian tyrant Pol Pot breaks from rebel group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ The widow and daughter of Pol Pot,
the late leader of Cambodia's notorious Khmer Rouge, have fled the
guerrilla group along with other defectors, Defense Minister Tea
Banh said Monday.
	   Pol Pot died on April 15 this year at the age of 73 while under
house arrest by his comrades at what was then the guerrillas' main
base in northern Cambodia. He had been toppled from his leadership
position last year.
	   His death, reportedly from heart failure, came as government
forces were slowly driving the guerrillas out of the base at Anlong
Veng, their last major stronghold.
	   Pol Pot's 40-year-old widow, Mea Son, was one of several
thousand refugees who encamped at the Thai border as fighting
flared around the base. She and her daughter Mea Sith, 14, made
their first public appearance there in front of journalists right
after her husband died. Her whereabouts since then had not been
known.
	   Pol Pot met Mea Son in 1985 when she was 27 and he was 60 and
married her two years later. Mea Son and her daughter described Pol
Pot after his death as a good husband and father.
	   He was better known to the world as the head of a brutal
communist regime whose extremist policies were responsible for the
deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians in the late 1970s.
	   Pol Pot's first marriage in 1956 to fellow revolutionary Khieu
Ponnary was childless. She is said to have suffered a breakdown in
the 1980s and never recovered. It is unclear what happened to her
afterwards.
	   Mea Son is by all accounts a simple peasant woman, unlike Khieu
Ponnary, who had been an active leader in the Khmer Rouge movement.
	   Tea Banh said Monday that Mea Son and her daughter had defected
to the government along with two guerrilla officials, Tep Khunnal
and Khan Soeun, who had remained with the rebel group even after
its near-total collapse earlier this year. Their Sept. 11
defections were announced by the government last Friday.
	   Tep Khunnal was one of the last so-called ``intellectuals'' to
remain with the group as its remnants hid in the jungle under the
command of veteran guerrilla fighter Ta Mok, who has a reputation
for brutality. Khan Soeun was a military commander.
	   Like the two men, Mea Son and her daughter are said to have
settled in Phnom Malai, a former guerrilla base on the Thai border
that is now home to many defectors.
	   Tea Banh said Mea Son and her daughter were staying with So
Hong, a nephew of Pol Pot who defected more than a year ago.
	   He said Mea Son left because she could not stay under Ta Mok's
pressure anymore and had no one to turn to.

Zeman in Vienna for working visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman arrived
Monday for a brief working visit and talks with his Austrian
counterpart, Viktor Klima.
	   It was the first foreign visit by the Czech prime minister since
he took office in August.
	   In addition to Klima, Zeman was also to confer with President
Thomas Klestil and the president of the national assembly, Heinz
Fischer.
	   The chief topics during the talks will be expansion of the
European Union, construction of the south Bohemian nuclear power
station Temelin and the issues of the Suedenten Germans, who were
expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War II.
	   The Czech Republic is among the six countries which are expected
to enter the EU in the next expansion stage. The negotiations on
membership will begin in November during the final weeks of
Austria's EU presidency.

Demaci withdraws from political life due to health reasons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Adem Demaci, the political
representative of the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army,
has withdrawn from political life due to health reasons, Demaci's
office said Monday.
	   Demaci, 68, has canceled all meetings with foreign diplomats,
politicians or reporters after doctors warned him of increased
nervous tension and worsening diabetes. The doctors recommended a
withdrawal from public activities and long rest, said the
statement.
	   It was not clear when Demaci, who became the KLA political
representative last month, would be able to resume his job. Demaci
had spent 28 years in prisons in former, Communist-run Yugoslavia.
	   Kosovo is a province of Serbia, a dominant republic of what is
left of Yugoslavia. The KLA are fighting for independence of the
region whose more than 90 percent of population are ethnic
Albanians.

 &UR; Malaysia beefs up security for Games ceremony amid political
tensions &QL; 
 &UR; By VIJAY JOSHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian authorities deployed
nearly 6,000 policemen for the Commonwealth Games on Monday while
Australia and Canada ordered their athletes to stay away from
downtown amid fears of violence by supporters of a prominent
political dissident.
	   ``I am taking a very conservative approach,'' Canada's chef de
mission Margie Schuett told The Associated Press.
	   The caution was not necessarily because of fears of trouble,
``but just to be on the safe side I am saying `stay home in the
village and party there. Don't go downtown,''' she said.
	   Police fired tear gas and water cannons Sunday at hundreds of
supporters of Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim after police
arrested him under a colonial law that allows indefinite detention
without trial.
	   Anwar was sacked Sept. 2 by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
is accused of sodomy. Anwar denies the charge and has accused
Mahathir of humiliating him in a bid to suppress his calls for
political reforms.
	   Trouble also broke out Monday outside the court complex in Kuala
Lumpur where Anwar was expected to be charged.
	   The situation is now under control, Yusof Said, the chief of
internal security, said, adding that 5,800 security personnel have
been deployed to ensure safety at the games, which are scheduled to
be closed by Queen Elizabeth II at a gala ceremony later Monday.
	   People should have no fear about attending the function as
``police are taking appropriate action to ensure public order,''
Said was quoted as saying by the national news agency, Bernama.
	   Schuett said any disturbance outside the games village or
outside the games venue ``certainly has a concern to us.'' But
Malaysian officials have assured that ``our athletes are in good
hands,'' she said.
	   ``I have 800 parents waiting at the other end and if somebody
tripped and broke their leg I would be in trouble, so I have got to
be very, very conservative,'' she said.
	   Similarly, Australia also decided to play it safe.
	   ``It may be an overreaction but we decided it was better to be
safe than sorry,'' Australian team spokesman Ian Hanson said.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A magistrate's court Monday
formally charged two men with murder in connection with the Aug. 7
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in which 11 people died.
	   Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Rashid Saleh Hemed were charged
with 11 counts of murder according to Section 196 of the Tanzanian
Penal Code.
	   It was not immediately possible to ascertain the nationalities
of those charged, but police said earlier that one was a Tanzanian
national from Zanzibar and the other was a foreigner.
	   All 11 killed were Africans, mainly Tanzanians.
	   In a nearly simultaneous bombing at the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Kenya, 247 people, including 12 Americans, were killed.
	   Two men have been indicted in a U.S. Federal Disctrict Court in
Manhattan for the murders of the 12 Americans, and several other
suspects are being sought.

Forecaster: new storm in eastern Atlantic might threaten no land

<TEXT>
	   MIAMI (AP) _ Tropical Storm Ivan is churning away in the eastern
Atlantic with 40-mph winds, but forecasters say it will probably
blow itself out over water and never pose a threat to land.
	   At 5 a.m. EDT, Ivan, the ninth named storm of the Atlantic
hurricane season, was centered near 17.4 north latitude and 35.3
west longitude, or about 660 miles west of Cape Verde, off the
northern coast of West Africa.
	   ``It's a pretty ragged system. It's not very well organized,''
said Neal Dorst, a meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center
in Miami.
	   ``It's a danger only to shipping right now,'' Dorst said.
``Other than that, no one should worry too much about it
threatening them _ quite possibly ever.''
	   Ivan may never approach land because of an atmospheric weakness
to its north, Dorst said.
	   ``It's probably going to recurve out to sea, and not threaten
anyone,'' he said.
	   The system was heading west-northwest near 14 mph, and was
expected to maintain that heading and speed for the next 24 hours.
	   The storm could strengthen Monday, possibly reaching top
sustained winds of 50 mph, Dorst said.

US group helps set up anti-bomb and land mine center
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ An American-funded center to train
Vietnamese how to handle unexploded bombs and land mines has been
opened in central Quang Tri province, a local government official
said Monday.
	   The two-story, dlrs 28,000 center was built by the Seattle-based
Peace Tree Foundation and will provide training courses on how to
identify and avoid unexploded ordinance left over from the Vietnam
War, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   The center is the first of its kind in Vietnam.
	   Quang Tri was the site of fierce fighting during the war.
	   There are reports of casualties from leftover explosives almost
every month in Quang Tri, the official said, adding he hoped the
center will help to reduce the number of victims, many of whom are
children.
	   The victims include farmers working in their fields and scrap
iron collectors who risk their lives attempting to scavenge the
bombs in order to earn a living.

Australia looks to break lengthy losing streak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Four years after a tour that was to have
repercussions for three of the world's top cricketers, Australia
returns to Pakistan hoping to break a 40-year series winless
streak.
	   The Australians arrive in Karachi on Wednesday and open a
seven-week tour with a four-day match on Friday before the first of
three tests at Rawalpindi beginning Oct. 1.
	   Ian Healy's missed stumping of Inzamam-ul-Haq off leg spinner
Shane Warne in the first test at the Karachi National Stadium in
1994 turned what would have been a 1-0 win into a 1-0 loss.
	   Warne, fellow spinner Tim May and batsman Mark Waugh later
alleged Pakistan captain and man-of-the-series Salim Malik tried to
bribe them into playing poorly.
	   After initial exoneration, the issue flared again earlier this
month when a Pakistani judge found Malik, leftarm quick Wasim Akram
and batsman Ijaz Ahmed responsible for match-fixing and recommended
they be banned. The saga won't be settled when the Australians
arrive in Karachi.
	   It will almost certainly be the last hurrah on the subcontinent
for captain Mark Taylor, deputy Steve Waugh and Healy _ who needs
three more dismissals to overtake Rod Marsh (355) as the alltime
leading test wicketkeeper.
	   Richie Benaud was the last Australian captain to win a series in
Pakistan, 2-0, in 1959-60.
	   They remain Australia's only victories on Pakistan soil in 17
tests and seven tours.
	   Taylor began his reign on the Pakistan tour in 1994 with a pair
of draws and a one-wicket loss, then strung together nine
consecutive test series wins before losing 2-1 in India earlier
this year.
	   Among the major selection gambles is the recall of lefthanded
batsman Justin Langer, who has averaged only 22 from eight tests
scattered across four series and four years.
	   Langer will bat at No. 3 after Greg Blewett was dropped for the
second time for failing to deal with spin.
	   Although the Australians will be without Warne, recovering from
shoulder surgery, they have been boosted by the return of paceman
Glenn McGrath who missed most of last season with a stomach
problem.
	   The return of McGrath gives Australia a potent attack, with
swing bowler Damien Fleming a proven performer on the subcontinent
and Michael Kasprowicz now settled in at test level.
	   Leg-spinner Stuart MacGill showed he was up to test level when
debuted in Adelaide last season, while off-spinners Gavin Robertson
and Colin Miller should both enjoy the conditions.
	   Langer said all three spinners had a great chance to make their
mark in Warne's absence and believes the recent turmoil in
Pakistani ranks will aid Australia's cause.
	   ``They've got some turmoil, but they are a very talented team,''
Langer said. ``That talent is always hard to play to against, but
if we concentrate on what we have to do it will be a good challenge
and hopefully their turmoils will play in our favor.''
	   Australia will also play three limited-overs matches in November
at the end of the tour.
	   The Australian touring side: Mark Taylor (captain), Glenn
McGrath, Michael Slater, Stuart MacGill, Steve Waugh, Mark Waugh,
Gavin Robertson, Ian Healy, Michael Kasprowicz, Ricky Ponting,
Colin Miller, Justin Langer, Damien Fleming, Darren Lehmann.

Hong Kong share prices slump
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices tumbled Monday, with the key index
slumping nearly 4 percent, following sharp falls in Tokyo and
uncertainties over a U.S. presidential scandal.
	   The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 275.73 points, or 3.7
percent, closing at 7,170.23. On Friday, the index had lost 130.61
points.
	   Turnover amounted to 3.21 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
411 million), down from Friday's 4.39 billion Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 562 million).
	   Brokers said shares fell in reaction to the slump on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange, where the key index hit a new 12-year low.
	   There are also uncertainties about the U.S. political scene and
economy, with concerns growing that President Bill Clinton could
face impeachment, said Tom Levethorpe, sales trading director at
Indosuez WI Carr Securities.
	   Investors were also worried about the labor problems in the
territory after Hongkong Telecommunications Ltd., Hong Kong's
largest private employer, moved to cut the wages because of the
economic downturn.
	   Among properties, Cheung Kong fell 1.60 Hong Kong dollars to
31.10, and Sun Hung Kai Properties fell 1.15 dollars to 22.90.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings fell 5.00 dollars to
132.00, and Hang Seng Bank fell 1.90 dollars to 43.90.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa fell 1.70 dollars to 35.30, and
Hong Kong Telecom fell 45 cents to 14.30.

Japanese stock prices fall to 12-year low, dollar rises in Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with late afternoon currency and bond prices;
ADDS new trader quote in 4th graf.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Worry a legislative compromise to resolve Japan's
banking crisis was in danger of falling apart, stocks prices
tumbled to the lowest level in 12 years on Monday and the U.S.
dollar gained ground against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average posted its lowest
close since February, 1986, sliding 385.82 points, or 2.76 percent,
to finish the day at 13,597.30. On Friday, it had closed up 123.98
points, or 0.89 percent.
	   The Nikkei sank from the outset of trading as investors sold off
shares amid concern an agreement between the ruling party and
opposition forces in Parliament on a set of bank stabilization
bills appeared to be unraveling, traders said.
	   ``There will be no stopping the fall in shares if the ruling and
opposition parties do not make the content of the bills clear,''
said Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of the stock division at Chuo
Securities Co.
	   On Friday, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's ruling party struck an
accord with the opposition in an attempt to deal with the huge load
of bad loans burdening the banking industry. It called for closing
or nationalizing insolvent lenders and buying up bad debt with
public money.
	   But lawmakers signaled Monday that they remain at odds over a
number of key issues, such as the use of a 13 trillion yen (dlrs
97.7 billion) pool of funds for bank bailouts, a proposed rescue of
the Long-Term Bank of Japan Ltd. and plans to curtail the
regulatory powers of the Finance Ministry.
	   Shares of LTCB recovered to 21 yen (dlrs 0.16) after dipping to
an all-time low of 18 yen (dlrs 0.14) during trading on Friday. All
other major bank shares also lost ground, including industry leader
Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., which closed 5.8 percent lower.
	   Led by bank shares, the broader Tokyo Price Index of all issues
listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange declined
25.43 points, or 2.37 percent, to close at 1,047.79. The TOPIX had
closed up 4.16 points, or 0.39 percent, on Friday.
	   An estimated 389 million shares changed hands on the first
section, down from 454 million on Friday. Declining shares exceeded
advancers 956 to 217, with 114 issues closing unchanged.
	   The market was buffeted by waves of selling from companies
shedding cross-shareholdings in one another as a way to burnish
their balance sheets before a disappointing fiscal half year ends
later this month, traders said.
	   On the Tokyo foreign exchange market, meanwhile, the dollar
bought 133.00 yen in late afternoon trading, up 0.90 yen from late
Friday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of 132.60 yen on
Friday.
	   The U.S. currency moved higher against the yen amid a belief
that the ruling party will face difficulty revising the proposed
bills more to its liking following Friday's compromise deal,
traders said.
	   But the dollar's gains were curtailed by lingering concern about
U.S. President Bill Clinton's political problems at home, they
said.
	   In Tokyo trading, the dollar rose as high as 133.60 and fell as
low as 132.71.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
bond rose to 0.740 percent from Friday's finish of 0.675 percent,
driving its price down to 115.01 yen from 115.51 yen.

Prodi's Communist allies vote on how to handle looming budget
</HEADLINE>
battle &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's hard-line Communists still have to decide
how hard a line to take in a looming battle with the government
over the 1999 budget.
	   The leaders of the Communist Refoundation Party, after weeks of
internal debate, scheduled a vote Monday evening on a document
which maps out the party's strategy.
	   Refoundation wants the government to focus on slashing Italy's
jobless rate, which is 12.5 percent on a national scale and nearly
twice that in the depressed south. But the party's leader, Fausto
Bertinotti, and its No. 2, President Armando Cossutta, are divided
over how to attain the goal.
	   Bertinotti has repeatedly threatened to withdraw support for
Premier Romano Prodi's center-left coalition if it doesn't do more
to brighten the employment picture. Cossuta is pushing for a
compromise.
	   Although Refoundation is not part of the government, Prodi
relies on its votes for a majority in the Chamber of Deputies and
Bertinotti's tactics have twice pushed the government to the brink
of collapse.
	   ''We are asking for change, not for explanations,'' Bertinotti
told reporters Monday. ''So far the government's proposals have not
gone in this direction.''
	   News reports suggested the outcome of the vote would indicate
which strategy prevailed within Refoundation. The reports said 58
members would be voting, with 46 pro-Bertinotti and 12
pro-Cossutta.
	   On Sunday, Prodi urged the Communists not to reject the budget
adjustment before they had examined it. He said the 13.5 trillion
lire (8.1 billion dlrs) document was ''strong and serious.''
	   The government plans to finalize the budget at a meeting of
coalition leaders Wednesday and then present it to Parliament
Friday. It must be approved by both houses by Dec. 31.

Amsterdam exchange down sharply
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch shares fell sharply Monday
at the opening and continued to plunge, pushing the AEX benchmark
index under the 1997 closing level of 913.67 points.
	   The downfall was blamed on everything ranging from sharp losses
in Tokyo and other key Asian markets to the political woes of U.S.
president Bill Clinton.
	   At 0912 GMT, the 27-share index was at 910.81 points, down 48.76
points or 5.1 percent.
	   Friday's profit-warning from oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell, which
is heavily weighted in the index, also pushed down prices.
	   Shell was down 3.90 guilders (dlrs 1.95), or 4.4 percent, to
84.60 guilders (dlrs 42.30).
	   Another big loser was the electronics company Philips, which was
down 7.10 guilders (dlrs 3.55), or 7.2 percent, to 91.90 guilders
(dlrs 45.95).

Canada's Erika-Leigh Stirton gets five golds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Erika-Leigh Stirton of Canada
emerged the queen of rhythmic gymnastics at the Commonwealth Games,
winning all four gold medals at stake Monday, raising her personal
haul to five from five.
	   Stirton danced and pranced her way to score high nines in all
her routines. She got 9.508 for rope, 9.624 for hoop, 9.583 for
clubs and 9.650 for ribbon. She had won the individual all-round
title on Sunday.
	   Malaysia won the gold in team events, the sixth medal category
in the tournament.
	   ``I'm very satisfied with what I have achieved today. Everything
went well,'' said Stirton. ``To be frank, I did not expect to do
well here,'' said the 18-year-old high-school student who had taken
to ballet at the age of four. She switched to rhythmic because she
was too tall and often suffered injuries.
	   Stirton, who has been on the national team since 1995, has
already qualified for the Sydney Olympics.
	   Her achievement in Kuala Lumpur equaled the feat of Australia's
Kasumi Takahashi who won the hoop, ball, clubs, ribbon and
individual all-around titles at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in
Victoria.
	   Monday's gold rush also made up for Canada's poor performance in
the artistic competitions that were dominated by Australia. Its
national champion, Leigh Marning (9.500), took the silver in the
rope Monday and the bronze went to Thye Chee Kiat of Malaysia.
	   Chee Kiat gave a dramatic performance in the hoop to take the
silver with 9.524 points while Marning won the bronze with 9.500.
	   In clubs, Shaneez Johnston of Australia was second with 9.458
while Canada's Emilie Livingston was third with 9.341.
	   Chee Kiat could have won at least the bronze in this routine had
she not lost concentration and made three drops to end up with
9.237.
	   Johnston was again second in ribbons with 9.491 points while
Malaysia's Carolyn Au-Yong, who looked exhausted, grabbed the
bronze with 9.391 points.

Akebono suffers second upset
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozunas (grand champions) Takanohana and
Wakanohana held a two-way tie for the lead at 8-1 as Hawaiian-born
yokozuna Akebono suffered his second upset Monday, ninth day of the
15-day Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Hawaiian-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani,
suffered his third defeat against six victories.
	   Wrestling at the Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in downtown Tokyo,
Takanohana, seeking his 20th tournament victory, held off No.4
maegashira (senior wrestler) Aogiyama's hand thrusts and forced him
out, leaving Aogiyama at 3-6.
	   Wakanohana, Takanohana's elder brother, clashed against komusubi
(junior champion second class) Musoyama in the initial charge and
quickly pulled him down, handing Musoyama his fifth defeat against
four victories.
	   In a major upset, sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai and
Akebono charged each other, with Akebono trying to push him out.
But Chiyotaikai twisted him down for his sixth victory against
three defeats.
	   Akebono, or Chad Rowan, is still the closest rival of Takanohana
and Wakanohana at 7-2.
	   No. 4 maegashira Wakanosato put his head on Musashimaru's chest
and drove him out for his fifth victory against four defeats.
	   Ozeki Takanonami grabbed No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan's belt,
lifted him up to the ring's edge and sent him out for his sixth
victory against three defeats. Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar

Officials hope tourists will be tempted by Taj by moonlight

	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Indian tourism officials say it's now not
only safe to offer visitors a romantic moonlit view of Taj Mahal,
but an economic necessity.
	   The marble monument that is one of the world's seven wonders has
been closed at night since 1984, when Sikh militants threatened to
blow it up.
	   Since then, most tourists have stopped staying the night in
Agra, the town in Uttar Pradesh state where the Taj is located,
state tourism director Ravindra Singh told The Associated Press
Monday.
	   Agra is just 190 kilometers (118 miles) from New Delhi, making a
day trip from the capital possible. Trainloads of tourists arrive
in the morning and depart in the evening.
	   Sikhs led a 10-year rebellion for a homeland in nearby Punjab
state that was declared crushed five years ago but which still
occasionally flares.
	   Uttar Pradesh Tourism Minister Kalraj Mishra said the national
Archeological Survey, which oversees the Taj, remained concerned
about security.
	   He said he had offered to post extra police officers, some in
plainclothes, around the Taj and set up metal detectors at its
entrances. The survey's director general was in Agra Monday to
review the proposal.
	   ``We expect to get his approval by the middle of this week and
throw open the gates of the Taj Mahal for moonlight viewing during
the next full moon on Oct. 5,'' Mishra said.
	   About 5 million people visit the Taj Mahal every year. Singh
said that if even a third of those stay one night, it will mean 1
billion rupees (about dlrs 23 million) more in revenue for Agra's
hotels, restaurants, shops and transportation companies.
	   The Taj Mahal was built by Mogul emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb
for his queen, Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th
child.

Saudi beheaded for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man was executed Monday for
murdering a fellow tribesman, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Mohammed Abdul-Rahman al-Qahtani was beheaded in the southern
province of Asir, the ministry said in a statement.
	   He had been convicted of shooting to death Mohammed Masood
al-Qahtani after a dispute.
	   The statement did not say when or where the crime took place.
	   The execution raised to 21 the number of beheadings in the
kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A magistrate's court Monday
formally charged two men with murder in connection with the Aug. 7
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in which 11 people died.
	   Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Rashid Saleh Hemed were charged
with 11 counts of murder according to Section 196 of the Tanzanian
Penal Code.
	   It was not immediately possible to ascertain the nationalities
of those charged, but police said earlier that one was a Tanzanian
national from Zanzibar and the other was a foreigner.
	   All 11 killed were Africans, mainly Tanzanians.
	   In a nearly simultaneous bombing at the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Kenya, 248 people, including 12 Americans, were killed.
	   On Monday the National Disaster Operation Center in Nairobi
confirmed the death of a woman injured in the blast, bringing the
death toll to 248.
	   Two men have been indicted in a U.S. Federal Disctrict Court in
Manhattan for the murders of the 12 Americans, and several other
suspects are being sought.

Workers sift through rubble of rocket attack that killed 50 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket slammed into an open field
early Monday as rescue workers sifted through several neighborhoods
of Kabul that were devastated by a rocket barrage a day earlier.
	   There were no casualties in Monday's rocket attack, while on
Sunday more than 50 people died when several rockets blasted
crowded neighborhoods of Karti Parwan and Khair Khana, said
hospital officials and Taliban authorities.
	   Hundreds more people were wounded by flying shrapnel and debris,
hospital workers said on condition that their names not be used.
	   Relatives of the dead wailed and beat their chests as rescue
workers recovered bodies, eyewitnesses said.
	   ``These are my friends . . . All I can do is cry and cry,'' said
Mohammed Amir.
	   While no one has taken responsibility for the rocket assault the
Taliban army is blaming its opponents, who are positioned north of
the beleaguered capital, well within rocket range.
	   The rocket assault on Sunday was the worst since the Taliban
army took control of the capital in September 1996 ousting
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood.
	   One of the rockets Sunday destroyed a two story building and
badly damaged seven other buildings including a theater.
	   ``There was a massive explosion as the rocket hit the
building,'' said Bashir Ahmed, the owner of the drug store whose
three sons were killed in the attack. Ahmed received minor
injuries.
	   Other victims were men selling fruit and sweets on the road
side.
	   While hospital officials and the Taliban are reporting as many
as 50 dead, the death toll could be higher because Afghans bury
their dead immediately and seldom take the body to a hospital.
	   Hospitals were operating at capacity to try to keep up with the
wounded. Stretchers were set up in the halls and doctors in blood
stained coats treated scores of wounded.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is led by Massood and Rabbani and has
been within rocket range of the capital for more than one year.
However, the recent rocket assault was their deadliest attack on
Kabul.
	   Generally the opposition has been targeting the combined
military and civilian hospital.
	   The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan and in recent
weeks has made significant territorial gains pushing the opposition
out of most of Bamiyan province in central Afghanistan.
	   It also has routed the opposition on several other fronts. Last
month it took control of the opposition stronghold of -e-Sharif in
northern Afghanistan.

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Hurricane Georges barreled into the
northeastern Caribbean with 110-mph (175-kph) winds Monday,
flooding roads, toppling trees and utility lines and forcing
thousands to evacuate their homes.
	   More than 1,600 people sought shelter in schools and public
buildings in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where Georges
was expected to strike later Monday. Both U.S. territories declared
states of emergency and activated National Guard troops to help
evacuations.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' warned Puerto
Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello, adding the storm could bring ``havoc and
difficulties for our people.''
	   At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT), Georges was centered about 45 miles
(70 kilometers) south of St. Martin and was moving west-northwest
at 17 mph (28 kph). Hurricane-force winds of at least 74 mph (118
kph) extended 85 miles (140 kilometers) from the eye.
	   Georges' strength diminished considerably from a monstrous 150
mph (240 kph) on Sunday, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center
warned the storm was ``extremely dangerous'' and capable of
extensive damage.
	   Its winds howling, Georges downed trees and utility lines,
ripped wooden and galvanized roofs from homes and pelted sheets of
rain into residences in Antigua and St. Kitts and Nevis. There were
no immediate reports of injuries.
	   ``The storm really messed us up real bad. We got a pounding, a
real pounding,'' said Norman Thomas, manager of ABS radio in
Antigua, where 5,700 people spent the night in shelters.
	   In St. Kitts and its sister island of Nevis, residents ventured
out briefly to survey storm damage and check on neighbors when
Georges' eye passed overhead before dawn. They scurried back inside
as the hurricane's rear wall returned with a vengeance.
	   ``It's pretty rough right now,'' said Everett Herbert of Voice
of Nevis radio.
	   In the French island of Guadeloupe, raging seas flooded roads in
the northern towns of Anse-Bertrand and Campeche and forced
residents living near the beach to head for shelter inland. France
was sending a team of 170 civil defense workers to help recovery
efforts.
	   Swirling winds knocked out power in several Guadeloupe towns.
``An incredible sound'' from a darkened, angry sea is how Jean
Barfleur, mayor of Port-Louis, described the hurricane's roar.
	   In Antigua families huddled in basements and shop owners erected
sandbag barricades to stop flooding. In St. John's, Antigua's
capital, civil defense workers distributed flashlights, mosquito
coils, water and toilet paper to nervous shelter residents.
	   A hurricane warning was issued Monday for the Dominican
Republic, while residents in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands furiously boarded windows and jammed markets to stock up on
ice, water and canned food.
	   ``Why take chances with something that we cannot change?'' said
St. Croix resident Marion Jones as she put up storm shutters on her
home.
	   U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Roy Schneider imposed a 8 p.m. curfew
and asked President Bill Clinton to declare a federal state of
emergency that would release federal aid.
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico to coordinate disaster response. FEMA also
organized a 62-member search and rescue team in Miami to fly to
Puerto Rico after the storm passes. Teams from Virginia and
Maryland went on alert for St. Croix and St. Thomas.
	   In Puerto Rico, Gov. Rossello announced a ban on liquor sales,
activated the island's National Guard and ordered officials to open
more than 330 shelters. Banks and schools closed Monday, major
airlines canceled flights to and from the U.S. mainland, and with
20-foot seas forecast, ferry service to the eastern islands of
Culebra and Vieques was suspended.
	   More than 1,000 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities. Up to 15 inches (38
centimeters) of rain was expected in Puerto Rico's mountains,
raising the threat of mudslides.

Inflation in August hits record low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's inflation rate hit a record low in
August, reflecting a decline in consumer spending, the government
said Monday.
	   The composite consumer price index rose by only 2.7 percent from
a year earlier, the lowest rate of inflation recorded since the
government began keeping statistics in Oct., 1981, a government
statement said.
	   It rose by 3.2 percent in July.
	   The decrease in food prices and lower housing rents contributed
to the smaller rate of increase, the statement said.
	   Rent has been substantially lower since the onset of the
region's financial crisis 14 months ago as the once-booming
property sector has slumped.
	   Property prices have halved since last summer's peak.

<TEXT>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) _ For the first time in 16 years, Cal Ripken
didn't know what to do with himself during a Baltimore Orioles
baseball game.
	   He squirmed in the dugout. He watched from the bullpen. He shook
hands with some fans and posed for pictures.
	   For the first time since May 30, 1982, what Ripken didn't do was
play.
	   After 2,632 consecutive games, Ripken sat out Sunday night's
game against the New York Yankees. It was the Orioles' final home
game of the season, and the sellout crowd of 48,013 will remember
it for one reason _ Ripken's absence.
	   ``I was going to take the last day of the season off in Boston,
but I thought about it a long time and decided if this is going to
end, let it end where it started _ in Baltimore,'' Ripken said.
	   Ripken's remarkable and inspiring streak ended not with a broken
nose or a bruise or any of the other injuries that could have
sidelined him over the years. It ended less than an hour before the
game, when Ripken walked into manager Ray Miller's office with a
simple, stunning message: ``I think the time is right.''
	   The streak eclipsed not only Lou Gehrig's long-standing record
of 2,130 consecutive games _ a record once considered unbreakable _
but transcended baseball. Ripken's insistence that he was doing
nothing more than showing up for work and doing his job made him a
hero for fans looking for something good in the game after the
debacle of the 1994-95 players strike.
	   Ripken made his decision several days ago following a
conversation with his wife, Kelly.
	   He shared the secret with his closest friend on the team, center
fielder Brady Anderson.
	   ``Yesterday was, retroactively, the important day because that's
the last day of the streak,'' Anderson said. ``People will remember
today, but yesterday is the one that counted. I kept my bat and a
couple of balls from that game.''
	   But his rest from active duty at third base won't be long.
	   ``I still consider myself an everyday player. I plan on coming
out every single day and proving that on a daily basis,'' Ripken
said, adding that he will start tonight in Toronto.
	   The end came during a magical season that has featured the
historic home run chase between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, and a
perfect game by David Wells as his Yankees pursued the American
League record for victories.
	   There had been recent talk that Ripken, 38, would volunteer to
end the streak. He was replaced by rookie Ryan Minor, who went
1-for-4 in a game the Yankees won 5-4.
	   ``The emphasis should be on the team,'' Ripken said. ``There
have been times during the streak when the emphasis was on the
streak. I was never comfortable with that. It was time to move the
focus back to the team.''
	   One out into the game, when it became evident that Ripken would
not be playing, all of the Yankees walked to the top step of the
dugout and applauded.
	   Ripken emerged from the Orioles dugout, tipped his hat toward
the Yankees and stepped back down to the bench. With the sellout
crowd standing and cheering, Ripken came out again and bowed to his
fans.
	   ``I thought we should pay tribute to what he's done for the
game,'' New York's Joe Girardi said. ``As his peers, we have the
utmost respect for what he does and what he's done.''
	   Ripken, who went 0-for-4 against the Yankees on Saturday and was
mired in an 0-for-12 skid, was batting .273 with 14 home runs and
61 RBIs.
	   His numbers are among the lowest of his career, which began in
1981. His streak began the next season, when he became the AL
Rookie of the Year.
	   It started when Ronald Reagan was in his first term as
president. It was overseen by eight managers _ including his
father, Cal Sr. _ and lasted longer than most baseball careers. It
was analyzed, criticized and scrutinized.
	   And now it's over.
	   ``I'm a realist. At some point it was going to end,'' he said.
``The situation just came up. I felt it was the right time and I
acted upon it.''

	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Michael Chapes feels he was deprived of a piece
of history, and he has no doubt Mark McGwire was robbed, too.
	   Chapes caught the ball that would have been home run No. 66 had
second-base umpire Bob Davidson not ruled fan interference.
	   The ball was quickly snatched from Chapes' mitt, and when the
31-year-old high school gym teacher protested to security
officials, he got no sympathy, a dlrs 518 fine for interfering with
a ball in play and a police escort out of County Stadium.
	   ``It was definitely a home run,'' Chapes said. ``This whole
thing makes me sick.''
	   McGwire knows the feeling.
	   ``After further review, it looked like it was a home run,''
McGwire said. ``The man who caught the ball, he never came across
the yellow line.''
	   McGwire hit No. 65 in the first inning to extend his record in
the St. Louis Cardinals' 11-6 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers.
But the day was tainted by the debatable call.
	   ``I hope Mark McGwire signs my citation,'' Chapes told The
Associated Press in a phone interview from his home in Waterford,
Wisconsin.
	   Cardinals manager Tony La Russa said the club is appealing to
the National League to make the unprecedented move of reversing the
umpire's call and awarding the homer after the fact.
	   ``The home run chase has drawn attention all over the world,''
La Russa said. ``Most importantly, the way the inning played out,
it didn't make any difference.''
	   After McGwire's two-out, disputed double off rookie Rod
Henderson, Brian Jordan singled him home and scored on Ron Gant's
home run. Had McGwire been stranded, ``we wouldn't even have asked
because of the integrity of the game,'' La Russa said.
	   ``They asked us to look at it, and that's all I can say right
now,'' NL spokeswoman Katy Feeney said at Wrigley Field, where she
attended ``Sammy Sosa Celebration'' day.
	   Feeney said a ruling was expected today.
	   The fan who ended with the ball was Johnny Luna, 18, of New
York, who has no plans of giving it up.
	   McGwire moved two homers ahead of Sosa with a two-run 423-foot
shot to left off Scott Karl that needed no judgment call. Charles
Dombrowski, 21, of Wisconsin Rapids came up with the ball and said
he would give it back to McGwire.
	   McGwire would love that. He said the homer was special because
his 10-year-old son, Matthew, told him in spring training that's
how many he wanted his father to hit this season.
	   ``What a prediction. My God!'' McGwire said.
	   And what an afternoon.
	   Before Roger Maris set his record of 61 homers in 1961,
commissioner Ford Frick declared any record would carry a
``distinctive mark'' if it did not beat Babe Ruth's mark of 60 in
154 games. McGwire surpassed Maris on Sept. 8 in is 145th game.
	   But now Mighty Mac has a footnote of his own. Fans will forever
wonder whether his total should have been one higher.

Estrada urges Philippine Airlines' management, labor to return to

negotiating table

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada urged
Philippine Airlines' management and labor unions Monday to return
to the negotiating table in a last-minute attempt to stop the
closure of Asia's oldest commercial airline.
	   ``I am practically begging on bended knees for management and
the workers to come to their senses and reach an agreement,''
Estrada said.
	   ``We are doing everything to save PAL, that's why I'm still
talking to labor and management,'' he said in a radio interview.
``They should not only think of themselves but also of the country
because PAL's closure will affect a lot of people.''
	   PAL announced last week that it plans to shut down at midnight
on Wednesday.
	   Estrada ruled out the possibility of the government taking over
the airline to stop its closure, saying his administration has no
money to run the cash-strapped airline.
	   PAL's largest union appealed Monday to PAL chairman and chief
stockholder Lucio Tan to stop his closure order. It offered in
return to renegotiate its collective bargaining agreement.
	   In a rescue plan, Tan has offered workers 20 percent of the
airline's stock and three seats on its board in exchange for a
10-year suspension of their collective bargaining agreements, but
union leaders have refused.
	   ``We cannot simply accept the total abrogation of our collective
bargaining agreement and thus surrender our rights as a union and
employees,'' said Jose Penas, secretary of the ground workers'
union.
	   Also Monday, the Department of Labor began a referendum among
union members on Tan's offer. The referendum is to be completed in
two days.
	   An overwhelming vote in favor of Tan's rescue plan could
persuade union leaders to reconsider their decision, presidential
spokesman Jerry Barican said.
	   The country has four smaller airlines, all of which have
recently failed safety audits.
	   PAL has been devastated by a series of strikes and by Asia's
currency crisis, which hit just as the airline was launching an
ambitious dlrs 4 billion expansion and refleeting plan.
	   It owes dlrs 2.1 billion to creditors, who reportedly are
insisting on guarantees of labor harmony before they approve a
restructuring plan.

Gunmen kills another Shiite Muslim as religious violence escalates
</HEADLINE>
in Pakistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAHORE, Pakistan (AP) _ Gunmen shot and killed a Shiite Muslim
political activist inside his house Monday in eastern Punjab
province in the latest spate of religious violence in Pakistan,
police said.
	   Two gunmen broke into the house of a key Shiite leader Syed Zaki
Shah, 35, Gujranwala city, some 50 kilometers (30 miles) from
Lahore _ the Punjab provincial capital. Shah was shot at point
blank range, police said.
	   Shah was a member of Tehrik-e-Jafria Pakistan, or the Movement
for Implementation of Shiite Rights.
	   Following the killing police arrested more than 12 workers of
the militant Sunni group Sipah-e-Sahaba, or Guardians of the
Friends of the Prophet. The organization is routinely blamed for
killings of rival Shiite Muslims.
	   On Sunday, gunmen killed four Shiite Muslims and wounded eight
others in an attack on worshippers in a Shiite Mosque in Kot Addu,
about 260 kilometers (160 miles) south of Lahore.
	   Sunni and Shiite Muslim extremist groups have been waging a
bloody feud that has intensified in recent years.
	   Sunni groups blame Iran for helping the Shiite extremists, while
Shiite groups accuse Saudi Arabia of funding Sunni militant
organizations. Both countries deny the allegations. Shiites are a
minority of about 15 percent in Sunni-dominated Pakistan.

Australia wins Games with 80 gold
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout; ADDS top three medal nations &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY HARPER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ New Zealand's Craig Barrett
thought he had won a gold medal when he fell in a delirious heap
near the finish of the 50-kilometer walk at the Commonwealth Games
on Monday.
	   In a dramatic start to the final day of the Games, Barrett only
discovered that he hadn't won later in hospital when he was pumped
with three liters of fluid to treat his severe heat stroke and
dehydration.
	   Australia finished the games with 80 gold medals, off its record
of 87 four years ago, while England was second on 36, Canada had 30
and Malaysia was fourth on 10. It was the first time the hosts had
finished in the top four at the games.
	   Barrett's meltdown helped Malaysia on its way Monday, gifting it
the first of three golds on the final day.
	   Barrett held a five-minute lead with less than a kilometer to go
when he staggered and fell. He tried to get on his feet and began
to crawl along the bitumen. Barrett then rose and fell twice more
before team chief Les Mills came to his aid, ruling him out of
contention. He was four hours into the race and had just five
minutes left to the finish.
	   ``(My legs) just kind of fell off,'' Barrett told a New Zealand
television station after recovering later Monday. ``My head was
getting really hot, I was starting to see stars.
	   ``I was in the medical tent and I thought I'd won ... I was
going, `I know what it's like to touch perfection now'. I was just
in this space-age world, it was quite freaky.''
	   Malaysia's Govindasamy Saravanan walked past Barrett as the New
Zealander floundered. He crossed the finish line in 4 hours, 10
minutes, 5 seconds to win Malaysia's first track and field gold of
the games, and eighth overall, and was carried away by wildly
cheering fans.
	   He was well clear of two Australians, Duane Cousins, who was 25
seconds slower, and Dominic McGrath, who finished 2 minutes and 45
seconds behind the winner.
	   ``I could see (the blood) running down my legs and into my
socks, '' said McGrath. ``But once the legs get tired you just
forget about it. When you're staring down a medal you'll go through
anything.''
	   ``It's just such a relief, just to stop,'' said Cousins. ``If I
could qualify for 100 meters, I'd rather do that _ but someone's
got to do the 50k so it might as well be me.''
	   Canada's Erika-Leigh Stirton became her country's leading
competitor at the games when she swept all four gold medal on offer
Monday in the rhythmic gymnastics competition to finish with five
golds.
	   After winning the individual all-around gold Sunday, Stirton was
in strong form, scoring 9.508 for rope, 9.624 for hoop, 9.583 for
clubs and 9.650 for ribbon.
	   She matched the feat of Australia's Kasumi Takahashi, who won
all five in 1994.
	   ``I'm very satisfied with what I have achieved today,'' Stirton
said. ``To be frank, I did not expect to do well here.''
	   Malaysia's Wong Choon Han came from a game down to beat
compatriot Yong Hock Kin and claim the gold medal in the men's
singles badminton competition.
	   Wong, Malaysia's No.3 player who has been in strong form since
the Thomas Cup in May, won 10-15, 15-12, 15-6 in a tense match
lasting 76 minutes.
	   In the men's doubles gold medal round, Malaysia's second pair of
Choong Tan Fook and Lee Wan Wah scored an upset 15-7, 15-4 win over
No.1-ranked compatriots Cheah Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock.
	   Australia's netball team took its gold tally to 78 ahead of the
final track program when it beat New Zealand 42-39 in the gold
medal game.
	   Captain Vicki Wilson rebounded after a poor start to lead
Australia home with strong shooting in the final quarter. Australia
remained unbeaten through the tournament, lifting its overall
record to 79 wins from its past 81 internationals.
	   Coach Jill McIntosh replaced Wilson with Jennifer Borlase at
halftime but it did nothing to help the favorite and Wilson was
back on court before three-quarter time.
	   Heading into the final quarter the score was 31-all and
Australia led by two points with four minutes remaining before
Wilson goaled to secure the win.
	   ``At this particular moment this means everything,'' Wilson
said. ``It was one of those games that went down to the wire and
you couldn't ask for a better finale, it was quite fitting for the
Commonwealth Games, it was not a walkover by any means.''
	   England won the bronze medal by beating South Africa 56-54.

Death toll rises in Nigerian religious clashes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ The death toll from a clash in northern
Nigeria between Muslim protesters and police has risen to 13, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Members of the Muslim Brothers sect in the northern Nigerian
town of Kaduna battled on Friday with police after authorities
tried to stop a street protest against the detention of the group's
leader, Sheikh Ibrahim El-Zak Zaki.
	   El-Zak Zaki was arrested two years ago and is accused of
sedition, the Lagos Guardian reported.
	   Gunshots rang out during the clash with police, while protesters
hurled rocks and debris, the newspaper reported.
	   The protests began after Friday prayers.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A magistrate's court Monday
formally charged a Tanzanian and an Egyptian with murder in
connection with the Aug. 7 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in which 11
people died.
	   Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh
Hemed were charged with 11 counts of murder according to Section
196 of the Tanzanian Penal Code.
	   Saleh is a native of Zanzibar, an island off Tanzania.
	   Resident Magistrate Amiri Maneto said no bail was allowed under
the charges, and the penalty upon conviction was death by hanging.
	   The two accused were remanded in custody until Oct. 5 when the
court will determine a trial date in the High Court
	   All 11 killed in the embassy bombing were Africans, mainly
Tanzanians.
	   Although no details were released in court, local press reports
say police found traces of chemicals that could have been used in
making the bomb in Saleh's home and more traces in his Suzuki car.
	   The reports also said Saleh received frequent visits from two
men of Arab origin who visited him just before the bombing.
	   No information was available on why Ahmed was charged.
	   He told the court he couldn't understand the charge since he was
not even in Dar es Salaam on the day of the bombing. He said he was
in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   Saleh did not make a statement.
	   Three FBI agents were present at the hearing.
	   In a nearly simultaneous bombing at the U.S. Embassy in
neighboring Kenya, 248 people, including 12 Americans, were killed.
	   On Monday the National Disaster Operation Center in Nairobi
confirmed the death of a woman injured in the blast, bringing the
death toll to 248.
	   Two men have been indicted in a U.S. Federal Disctrict Court in
Manhattan for the murders of the 12 Americans, and several other
suspects are being sought.

 &UR; American Airlines, British Airways forge new global alliance &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ American Airlines and British Airways unveiled a
global alliance with three other carriers Monday _ and said they
want more partners to compete with a group led by United Airlines
and Germany's Lufthansa.
	   Canadian Airlines and Australia's Qantas already had marketing
partnerships with American and British Airways _ and the Kong Kong
carrier Cathay Pacific Airways came aboard Monday in the new
alliance to be called ''oneworld.''
	   Executives told a news conference that they had invited the
Spanish flag carrier Iberia to join up, and that Finnair would be
another strong potential candidate. They also have their eyes set
on a bigger prize: Japan Airlines.
	   ``It's really up to the Japanese to make their decision on
that,'' said Don Carty, the chief executive at American.
	   Oneworld was launched even as American and British Airways
continue their fight to gain regulatory approval for a separate
deal that would give them U.S. antitrust immunity to set prices on
routes across the Atlantic.
	   The new alliance is ``not a substitute,'' said Bob Ayling, chief
executive at British Airways.
	   The alliance is a first for Cathay Pacific, which said its
associate carrier Dragonair, serving some destinations in China,
might also join after setting up a frequent flyer program and
making other necessary changes.
	   The Cathay Pacific chief executive, David Turnbull, said Cathay
Pacific had been approached by other airlines, including the Star
Alliance organized by United and Lufthansa. The other Star Alliance
partners include Air Canada, Scandinavian Airlines System, Thai
Airways and the Brazilian carrier Varig.
	   ``It's taken us a long time,'' Turnbull acknowledged. ``When you
get married, you want to make sure you make the right choice.
Getting unmarried can be difficult.''
	   The airlines say they will coordinate their flight schedules and
ticketing, while cooperating on their frequent flier programs to
better serve customers.
	   Alliances are becoming increasingly common in the international
aviation industry, where travel is booming, but leading airlines
realized long ago it wouldn't be feasible to get big enough to
cover the entire globe single-handedly.
	   The creation of oneworld gives the industry two big global
alliances, although there are many smaller ones such as the deal
between Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
	   Virgin Atlantic Airways, the carrier run by British billionaire
Richard Branson, was sharply critical. Virgin hired a truck with a
sign saying ``no way'' to the British Airways-American alliance
painted on the side, and had it parked illegally outside the news
conference.
	   Virgin spokesman Will Whitehorn said the company would gladly
pay the parking ticket and towing fee to get its point across.
	   Whitehorn said the five airline partners are more concerned
about protecting their markets than they are about serving
customers better. He characterized oneworld as ``one company, one
monopoly and millions of ripped-off customers.''
	   The chief executives of the five airlines were asked several
times about whether their deal will lead to lower fares _ and none
would promise cheaper prices.
	   But they will not become one company _ each will maintain its
separate brand name and no equity stakes will be exchanged.
	   ``I don't think I have ever made a decision in my life that was
based on what Richard Branson would think of it,'' Carty said.
	   The five airlines say that their network will service 632 cities
in 138 countries. Last year they carried a total of 174 million
passengers.

Thai coalition government decides not to take in another party
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS and UPDATES with government spokesman saying present
government lineup will stay intact

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's coalition government has
decided not to invite a major opposition party to join its lineup,
instead preferring to carry out a limited Cabinet reshuffle, the
government spokesman said Monday.
	   Akaphol Sorasuchart, the government spokesman, said that leaders
of the six-party coalition told Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai at a
lunch time meeting that priority should be given to cleaning up the
problems at the Ministry of Public Health.
	   A corruption scandal at the ministry has forced the resignations
of the minister and his deputy, both of whom come from the Social
Action Party.
	   Many in the government feel the ministry should not fall under
the control of that party, which holds 20 seats in parliament, and
so that would necessitate a Cabinet reshuffle.
	   The reapportionment of the 49 seats among the six parties has
not yet been worked out.
	   Chuan's political point man, Democrat Party Secretary General
Sanan Kachornprasart, told local television on Monday that he had
been negotiating with his counterpart from the opposition Chart
Pattana (National Development) Party about joining the coalition.
	   Chart Pattana's 52 parliamentary seats would beef up the
Democrat-led coalition government's slim majority in the
legislative body. The coalition holds 207 of the 393 seats in
Parliament.
	   While accepting Chart Pattana into the fold would give the
coalition a commanding grip on the legislature, it would also be a
risky move for several reasons.
	   With 52 seats, Chart Pattana would demand several Cabinet seats
according to the quota system Thai governments use, meaning a
large-scale reshuffle would have to take place that might alienate
some current coalition parties.
	   Chart Pattana is also viewed with suspicion by many in politics
and the public who believe it undermined the previous government of
former Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, helping that
administration's eventual demise.
	   In the results of a poll released on Monday, more Thais than not
opposed the overtures to Chart Pattana. In the poll of 1,285 people
around Thailand conducted by Assumption University, 41.2 percent of
respondents opposed inviting an opposition party to join, while
28.6 percent approved.
	   Polls also show, however, that faith in the Chuan government is
declining because of several scandals.
	   The problems at the Ministry of Public Health arose when a rural
doctors association said high-ranking ministry officials were
forcing hospitals to buy medical supplies from preselected
companies at several times the market price.
	   Some of the scandals have also emanated from Chuan's Democrat
Party. His communications minister has been accused of colluding to
award contracts to specific companies for a high-speed digital data
network, and Sanan, who is also interior minister, has been accused
of involvement in an illegal logging case.
	   None of the accusations have been proved or resulted in court
cases.

Several arrested over IRA dissidents' bombing of Omagh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested several people
Monday on suspicion of involvement in last month's car bombing of
Omagh, the deadliest terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's 30-year
conflict.
	   Police declined to say how many people had been arrested in
connection with the Aug. 15 blast, which killed 29 people and
wounded more than 330 in the religiously mixed town 70 miles (110
kms) west of Belfast.
	   The Irish Republican Army dissidents who planted the bomb called
a ``complete cessation'' of violence two weeks ago. That put them
in line with the mainstream IRA, which in July 1997 formally halted
its campaign to destabilize British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   In response to the Omagh atrocity, the British and Irish
governments passed emergency anti-terrorist legislation designed to
allow police and courts to imprison IRA dissidents more easily.
	   But so far the extra powers _ including resctrictions on the
right to silence and giving police claims greater weight as
evidence _ have not been used to press charges against any
suspects.

Philippine government allows grounded carrier to resume flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine officials allowed the
country's second-largest airline to resume flights Monday, two days
before the scheduled closure of the largest carrier, Philippine
Airlines.
	   The Civil Aeronautics Board said Air Philippines will be allowed
to fly two of its aircraft after complying with safety requirements
for those planes. Its whole fleet of 12 planes was grounded Friday
for safety violations.
	   Air Philippines president Augustus Paiso said six flights were
scheduled Monday using the two cleared MD-82 planes. The other
planes are expected to be cleared within a week, he said.
	   Philippine aviation officials suspended the operating permit of
the airline after discovering lapses in its safety and maintenance
procedures.
	   A smaller carrier, Grand International Airways, remained closed
after voluntarily canceling flights last week because of unpaid
insurance and fuel bills, employees said.
	   PAL, Asia's oldest airline, announced last week it will shut
down at midnight Wednesday because its efforts to recover from
massive financial losses were no longer viable following its
unions' refusal to accept a management-proposed rescue plan.
	   The grounding of the carriers and PAL's scheduled closure pose a
devastating threat to the country, leaving many areas of the
sprawling archipelago of 7,000 islands without air service.
	   The only alternative inter-island transportation, ocean ferries,
suffered a major blow last Friday when a ship carrying 454 people
sank in storm-whipped waters south of Manila.

Impasse in talks in turbulent mountain kingdom of Lesotho
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Opposition party negotiators on Monday
refused to meet with government officials for talks aimed at ending
the chaos which has gripped this tiny mountain kingdom.
	   An opposition spokeswoman, Mamello Morrison, told South African
Broadcasting Corp. radio that the parties were angry because the
government refused to show at a meeting Sunday.
	   South African mediators sat down separately with both sides over
the weekend.
	   Sporadic gunfire was heard in the capital Monday morning, but
the source was unknown, SABC reported. A faction of the army
rebelled 11 days ago, deposing the leadership, and the new
commanders have refrained from restoring order in the streets.
	   Government offices and Parliament have been paralyzed by weeks
of demonstrations and strikes by the parties' supporters, who claim
the Lesotho Congress Party's May election landslide victory was
fraudulent.
	   A report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting, but did not suggest the election be invalidated.
	   South African's security minister, Sydney Mufamadi, who met with
both sides over the weekend, cancelled a planned visit Monday,
Ambassador Japhet Ndlovu said in Lesotho, according to South
African Press Association. No explanation was given.
	   SAPA also said protesters again were gathered at the royal
palace Monday morning, and had barred employees from entering the
building of state-controlled Radio Lesotho, keeping it off the air.
	   Completely surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is a poor nation
of 2 million people.

 &UR; Officials want letter from Suharto permitting bank account search

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Officials investigating corruption
allegations against ex-President Suharto said Monday they want
written permission from him to search for any foreign bank accounts
allegedly held by him.
	   Attorney General Muhammad Andi Ghalib, who is heading the probe
into the ex-leader's wealth, said he would ask Suharto to sign a
letter of authorization permitting foreign banks to open up their
records.
	   ``With this letter of authorization I can go anywhere in the
world'' in search of accounts that might be held by Suharto, Ghalib
told reporters.
	   A team of investigators is expected to meet Suharto soon. Ghalib
did not say when the meeting would take place.
	   Suharto, 77, quit in May after a wave of riots and protests,
ending 32 years in power.
	   He is accused of illegally enriching himself during his
three-decade rule and of hiding millions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts while his family built huge business empires under his
patronage.
	   In a television appearance this month he flatly denied any
wrongdoing and said he did not have ``a cent'' stashed away
overseas.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, who is also a longtime
friend and former subordinate of Suharto, last week bowed to
mounting pressure from protesters and others and ordered that the
former leader be questioned.
	   Ghalib said his office had yet to find any hard evidence that
Suharto had placed money overseas.

Aggravated injury puts Prosinecki's career in question
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ An aggravated back injury may have cut
short Robert Prosinecki's soccer career, the midfield virtuoso said
Monday.
	   Prosinecki, who has been playing for mother club Croatia Zagreb
this season with chronic back problems, exacerbated his injury in
last week's opening match of the Champions League against Ajax
Amsterdam.
	   ``I wanted to play for the crowd and the club and am solely to
blame for my predicament,'' said 30 year-old Prosinecki, who took
to the pitch against medical counsel and has been confined to his
bed since the match.
	   Now virtually immobile, he is considering undergoing surgery for
a herniated disc.
	   ``I still haven't decided whether I'll go under the knife or
treat the injury by conservative methods,'' Prosinecki told the
daily Sportske Novosti, ruling out the chance of a hurried return
to the field.
	   ``They can patch me up in ten days and then I'll be back in bed.
That's not much of a life,'' Prosinecki said.
	   Prosinecki, perhaps Croatia's most famous soccer export, dazzled
crowds and sparked a soccer revival when he he returned home from
stints with powerhouse clubs Real Madrid and Barcelona two seasons
ago. But his career has often been plagued by injuries.

Arrested politician's wife carries on fight in Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics

 &UR; By BETH DUFF-BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The wife of arrested Malaysian
politician Anwar Ibrahim took up his pro-democracy cause Monday,
calling Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad a great leader ``who has
become a political desperado.''
	   Anwar is being held under a law that allows indefinite detention
without trial or charges. Foreseeing prison, Anwar said last week
his wife, Azizah Ismail, would head up Malaysia's pro-democracy
forces if he were sent behind bars.
	   The soft-spoken, 45-year-old ophthalmologist did just that,
after police in ski masks broke down the front door of the family
home, terrified the couple's children and hauled away her husband
Sunday evening.
	   ``I've always been soft-spoken. But once they take away my basic
human rights, I have to fight for survival,'' Azizah said.
	   While police turned water cannon and tear gas on thousands of
Anwar supporters in the streets outside a city courthouse Monday,
Azizah waited inside for him to be brought there for arraignment.
Police never brought him to court, but sent him instead to a
maximum security prison.
	   Though she spoke eloquently, the waiting and uncertainty had
taken their toll, leaving Azizah emotionally drained.
	   ``I thank the supporters who have gathered peacefully in front
of the courthouse,'' she said Monday afternoon. ``Unfortunately the
police acted wildly. The police have lost their sense of balance,
of humanity, by attacking the public.''
	   Relating the frightening arrest scene Sunday night, Azizah said:
``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by ordering the police to act like
gangsters he will frighten the people from supporting this
reformation movement, he is dreaming.''
	   ``I think he has cut himself off from reality,'' she said,
giving a milder characterization of the national leader than her
husband, who had said Mahathir was no longer quite sane.
	   In her opinion, the time has run out for the 72-year-old
Mahathir, who is now Asia's longest-serving ruler.
	   ``I feel very sad because Dr. Mahathir is a great leader,''
Azizah said. ``But now he has become a political desperado who is
willing to suppress his own people just to keep power.''
	   What Azizah does and says over the next few days may be key to
whether the reform movement continues.
	   ``If Anwar's wife wants to do it, it would be very difficult for
the government to arrest her or attack her,'' said Bruce Gale, a
commentator from Political and Economic Risk Consultancy in
Singapore. If Azizah's efforts were to succeed, it could bring
about a split in the ruling United Malays National Organization,
which Mahathir heads.
	   Azizah is used to taking some heat on behalf of her husband. Her
father, highly connected in the government, opposed her wedding in
1978 to the fiery leader of a growing Islamic youth protest
movement. He had already been imprisoned for 22 months under the
Internal Security Act, the same law under which police said he was
detained Monday.
	   Though she is a trained eye doctor, Azizah stopped working
several years ago to raise the couple's six children.
	   She often said she'd have to go back to work if something
happened to him, though politics may beckon now more than medicine.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ben Johnson's appeal of his lifetime ban will be
watched closely because the outcome could affect sanctions imposed
on athletes in the future, said an official with the Canadian
Centre for Ethics in Sports.
	   ``If the appeal ends up in favor of Ben Johnson and there is a
ruling to have him reinstated, it'll have a dramatic effect on
lifetime bans,'' said Casey Wade, director of drug-free sport for
the center. ``It's going to have a tremendous impact on the future
rules around sanctions and the consequences of a positive test
result.''
	   Johnson, 36, who tested positive for steroids at the Seoul
Olympics in 1988 and failed a drug test again in 1993, was to be in
the Ontario Court of Appeal in Toronto on Monday to fight a
lifetime ban that was imposed after the second positive result. The
ban was imposed by the International Amateur Athletics Federation
(IAAF) and Athletics Canada as a member of the IAAF because it was
a second infraction.
	   Through his lawyer, Gary Boyd, Johnson was to argue before the
three-judge panel that the lifetime ban goes too far and is an
unreasonable restraint of trade.
	   ``We let murderers out on parole after 10 years,'' Boyd said.
``A lifetime ban is pretty extreme.''
	   The appeal panel, likely to reserve judgment after the hearing
that is expected to last one day, could dismiss Johnson's appeal or
allow it, strike down his penalty and order him reinstated.
	   Two days after posting a world-record time in the Olympic 100
meters in 1988, Johnson was stripped of his gold medal after
testing positive for the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol.

Asian stocks plunge for a whole host of reasons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with closing figures

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets tumbled Monday, and analysts
blamed everything from disputes over a new bank reform agreement in
Japan to political instability in Malaysia to the Clinton sex
scandal in America.
	   In Japan, the key index plunged to its lowest level in more than
12 years amid uncertainty over the fate of legislation to revive
the country's ailing banking system.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 385.82 points,
or 2.76 percent, to finish the day at 13,597.30 _ its lowest close
since February 1986. On Friday, the Nikkei had closed up 123.98
points, or 0.89 percent.
	   The Nikkei fell from the outset of trading in reaction to the
apparent unraveling of an agreement on a set of bank stabilization
bills as ruling party and opposition lawmakers resumed wrangling
over key provisions, traders said.
	   The two sides remain split over issues such as how to write off
problem loans at banks, and whether to allow the troubled Long-Term
Credit Bank Ltd. to fail.
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 133.00 yen in late
afternoon trading, up 0.90 yen from late Friday in Tokyo and also
above its New York level of 132.60 yen on Friday.
	   Indonesian shares tumbled to their lowest level in seven years
amid bearishness in regional markets, concerns over the domestic
political situation and fears of further social unrest, dealers
said.
	   The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 5.5 percent,
or 14.837 points, to 256.834 points, a level not seen since Sept.
26, 1991.
	   In Hong Kong, the key index slumped nearly 4 percent following
sharp falls in Tokyo and uncertainties over a U.S. presidential
scandal.
	   The benchmark Hang Seng Index fell 275.73 points, or 3.7
percent, closing at 7,170.23. On Friday, the index had lost 130.61
points.
	   Brokers said shares fell in reaction to the slump on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange.
	   There are also uncertainties about the U.S. political scene and
economy, with concerns growing that President Bill Clinton could
face impeachment, said Tom Levethorpe, sales trading director at
Indosuez WI Carr Securities.
	   Malaysian shares tumbled 3.8 percent as violent clashes between
riot police and supporters of former deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim
continued. Anwar was arrested Sunday after leading unprecedented
anti-government protests in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   The Kuala Lumpur's key Composite Index fell 14.98 points to
close at 378.32.
	   Singapore shares also closed sharply in line with regional stock
markets. The Straits Times Index fell 3.3 percent, or 30.15 points,
to 882.59.
	   Elsewhere:
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 120.19 points, or 1.7 percent,
to 7,029.40.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed lower. The NZSE-40
Capital Index fell 15.48 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,719.19.
	   MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower as investors worried
about the expected adverse economic impact of the impending closure
of Philippine Airlines, the country's largest airline. The
Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks fell 10.35
points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,164.26.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed lower. The All Ordinaries
Index fell 18.0 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,521.9.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on heavy selling by local
institutional investors. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell
3.78, or 1.3 percent, to 297.45.
	   BANGKOK: Thai share prices closed mixed. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand Index edged up 0.03 points, or 0.01 percent, to 221.88.

Ukraine's National Bank against using reserves to support hryvna
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Central Bank has no plans to use
its hard currency reserves to support the shaky currency, the
bank's chairman said Monday.
	   Speaking at a government meeting, Viktor Yushchenko said
National Bank reserves now stand at about dlrs 1 billion following
the arrival of the first installments of loans from the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
	   The sharp fall in the National Bank reserves, from dlrs 2.34 at
the start of 1998, resulted from its earlier attempts to defend the
hryvna.
	   The currency remained relatively stable in the first half of
1998 despite the departure of some foreign investors.
	   The Russian economic crisis, however, has pushed the hryvna down
from 2.1 to the U.S. dollar in mid-August to 2.99 on Friday, and
the government has been forced to expand its currency fluctuation
band.
	   ``Today the emphasis in supporting the hryvna is not placed on
spending the reserves but on modifying the currency market, trade
policies and payment operations,'' Yushchenko said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   He cited measures taken by the National Bank to limit dollar
trading and said these steps were ``adequate in the present
financial situation.''
	   Over the weekend, Yushchenko insisted that there was no
immediate threat of the hryvna slipping beyond the new fluctuation
corridor of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar, and no grounds to speak of a
further devaluation.
	   Still, Ukrainian bankers widely expect the hryvna to remain
under pressure, and they believe the limits of the fluctuation band
will be reached within days.

Malaysia wins first track gold as Kiwi collapses; five Games record
</HEADLINE>
set on final day &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with later events, adds quotes, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Long-time leader Craig Barrett of
New Zealand collapsed with dehydration less than a kilometer from
the end of the 50-kilometer walk on the final day of the
Commonwealth Games Monday and thought he'd won.
	   Convinced he had made it to the line, he had no idea as he was
rushed to a first aid tent that he had handed Malaysia its first
Commonwealth Games athletics gold medal.
	   In an extraordinary ending to the race, Barrett, who had a
5-minute lead over his rivals almost four hours into the race,
began staggering along the road.
	   He stopped three times, tried to start again and eventually
reeled to the side of the road where he fell. He made three
attempts to restart, still in the lead, but fell again and this
time New Zealand officials called for an ambulance.
	   By coincidence, it was at that stage that Malaysia's Govindasamy
Saravanan walked past him and went on to win his country's first
title.
	   ``(My legs) just kind of fell off,'' Barrett told a New Zealand
television station after recovering. ``My head was getting really
hot, I was starting to see stars.
	   ``I was in the medical tent and I thought I'd won. ... I was
going, `I know what it's like to touch perfection now.' I was just
in this space age world, it was quite freaky.''
	   Barrett's agonizing failure came on the final day of the 16th
Games in Kuala Lumpur and, despite five Games records, nothing in
the National Stadium later could match it for drama.
	   Yet a number of big names and nations lost their titles.
	   European 100-meter champion Darren Campbell led England to a
4x100 meter relay victory over Canada and beat the Canadians' Games
record set four years ago.
	   Dwain Chambers, Marlon Devonish, 200-meter titlist Julian
Golding and Campbell made three good exchanges to stay ahead
throughout the race and the European titlist moved away to finish
.26 ahead of the Canadian defending titlists, who didn't have star
sprinters Donovan Bailey, the world record holder and Olympic
titlist, and Bruny Surin in the lineup.
	   Australia took the bronze in 38.69.
	   Jamaica's quartet of Michael McDonald, Roxbert Martin, Gregory
Haughton and Davian Clarke became the first relay squad to go under
three minutes at the Games with a time of 2:59.03 to take the title
away from England.
	   But the real heroes of the race were the Welsh team who won the
bronze after trailing by 20 meters after the first leg.
	   Paul Gray, a sprint hurdler, was well back when he handed over
to 400-meter specialist Jamie Baulch, who ate up the deficit and
tore past two runners before handing over to European 200-meter
silver medalist Doug Turner.
	   Turner ran just as good a leg, charging through the field from
sixth to hand over to 400-meter titlist Iwan Thomas in third.
	   Thomas was some 30 meters back on leader Clarke, who was already
well clear of England's Mark Richardson, and the Welshman, who also
won the European Championship and World Cup, couldn't make up the
gap. The English foursome also went under the previous Games mark
with 3:00.82 while the Welshmen clocked 3:01.86.
	   Kenya's Jackline Maranga held off a challenge from defending
titlist Kelly Holmes of England to win the 1,500 meters in a Games
record 4 minutes, 5.27 seconds. Holmes placed second ahead of
Zimbabwe's Julie Sakara.
	   Laban Rotich then made it seven track titles for Kenya when he
pulled away from two English athletes to win the men's 1,500.
Rotich, who was fourth at the Atlanta Olympics, clocked 3:39.50,
with John Mayock second, .96 behind, and Tony Whiteman third.
	   Kenyan athletes have also won the men's 800, 5,000, 10,000 and
3,000 meters hurdles and the women's 10,000.
	   Women's 200-meter champion Nova Peris-Kneebone collected her
second gold medal of the Games as the Australians won the 4x100
meter relay in 43.39 seconds ahead of Jamaica and England.
	   Peris-Kneebone handed a lead over to Sharon Cripps at the final
changeover and the Australian held off a late charge by Bridgette
Foster to take Australia's 12th track gold.
	   Tania Van-Heer, who also was on that 4x100 squad, then collected
her second gold of the day when she anchored the Australians to a
runaway victory over defending titlist England in the 4x400 relay.
Susan Andrews, Tamsyn Lewis and Lee Naylor set her up with a lead
for the final leg and she crossed the line in 3:27.28.
	   Jamaica's Gillian Russell raced home in the women's 100-meter
hurdles to win by a quarter-second. She clocked 12.70 while Sri
Lanka's Sriani Kulawansha crossed the line in 12.95 for her
country's second medal. Canada's Katie Anderson took the bronze.
	   England's Ashia Hansen, indoor world record holder for the
women's triple jump, was the only competitor to leap 14 meters as
she made 14.32 to take the first Commonwealth Games gold in the
event. Francoise Mbango won Cameroon's first athletics medal here
with a leap of 13.95, beating England's Connie Henry by one
centimeter.
	   World champion Marius Corbett beat European titlist, former
world record holder and defending champion Steve Backley to take
gold in the javelin.
	   The South African, whose form has been poor since his world
title triumph in Athens over a year ago, heaved a Games record
88.75 meters with his second throw to edge Backley, whose best was
87.38.
	   Another Englishman, Mick Hill, who has finished runner-up for
the past three Games, this time took the bronze.
	   South Africa also won the shot, Burger Lambrechts throwing 20.01
meters to take gold ahead of Michalis Louca, who gained a first
athletics medal here for Cyprus with a heave of 19.52. Shaun
Pickering of Wales placed third with 19.33.

Police clash with Anwar supporters, fire tear gas and water cannon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with new 9th graf with description of protesters
elsewhere in the city, arrests.
 &UR; AP Photos XKL101-117

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse thousands of supporters of the
country's ousted deputy prime minister, in the second day of street
clashes. An army unit was sent onto the streets of the capital, to
help quell demonstrations.
	   Federal police said the fired politician, Anwar Ibrahim, was
being held under a harsh law that allows indefinite imprisonment
without charges or trial, for those deemed a threat to national
security.
	   One of his allies, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, head of the youth wing of
the ruling party, was detained under the same act, bringing to at
least seven the number of Anwar's supporters arrested on various
charges.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad may be seeking to remove Anwar,
his only rival, from the political scene by the quickest means
possible. Anwar has been leading the increasingly public opposition
to the 17-year-rule of the 72-year-old prime minister.
	   Anwar's detention has already threatened to overshadow a visit
by Queen Elizabeth II to Kuala Lumpur and her festive closing of
the 16th Commonwealth Games. The queen's motorcade passed the
throng of noisy pro-reform demonstrators in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar, who was tossed out of the government earlier this month,
was expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and disturbing
the public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night has added a
volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic troubles.
	   But the use of the security act implies that there is not enough
substance in the charges to try Anwar and his allies in court, said
Chandra Muzaffar, political science professor at the University of
Malaya. ``It means that the government is not prepared to give him
a chance to defend himself in court,'' the professor said.
	   Pounding batons on their heavy shields, police charged into a
crowd of 2,000 people, chanting ``reform, reform'' outside the
courthouse where Anwar had been expected to appear for arraignment
Monday morning.
	   Several thousand more demonstrators took to the streets in other
parts of the capital, where they were chased by riot police.
Reporters saw police detaining at least a dozen protesters and
shoving them into vans, though authorities released no figures on
the numbers arrested.
	   There were some injuries among the demonstrators. Some were
hauled away bleeding by police.
	   ``We didn't do anything. We just shouted `reformasi,''' said
Marizal Jai, 23, a janitor. ``They attacked us with water and tear
gas. They chased us in and out of buildings.''
	   Several hundred protesters, hemmed in by police units, then
headed toward the National Mosque, just a few blocks down the
street. The mosque was the site of the 51-year-old Anwar's fiery
speech Sunday that culminated in protests and his arrest.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, issued an eloquent rallying call
late Monday to Malaysia's still-diffuse reform movement.
	   ``Unfortunately the police acted wildly. This is another truth
how the police have lost their sense of balance, of humanity, by
attacking the public,'' Azizah told reporters.
	   She said she regretted the police storming of the family home
Sunday night, an act that terrified her, Anwar and their children.
	   ``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by ordering the police to act like
gangsters he will frighten the people from supporting this
reformation movement, he is dreaming. I think he has cut himself
off from reality,'' Azizah said.
	   Looking shaken, she added: ``I feel very sad because Dr.
Mahathir is a great leader, but now he has become a political
desperado, who is willing to suppress his own people just to keep
power.''
	   Police swooped in and blocked several access points to the
city's main plaza, Merdeka (Freedom) Square, with jeeps, trucks and
police cars, to keep protesters away.
	   More than 1,000 police were frantically working to contain the
angry demonstrators. They were backed by a specially trained unit
of two-dozen reserve army officers. Police chased small mobs of men
down the city's side streets.
	   National police chief Abdul Rahim Noor refused to say where
Anwar was being held Monday.
	   But an aide to Anwar's wife said the family had been told that
he was taken overnight to a maximum security detention camp.
	   ``We're here to support Anwar because he's innocent. He didn't
do all those crazy things,'' said Haji Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old
businessman and member of the UMNO ruling party. ``We want him as
our prime minister.''
	   More than 100 reporters thronged the Sessions Court, expecting
to see Anwar brought in to hear the charges against him.
	   As tear gas poured into the courthouse, frightened lawyers and
court staff rushed outside, holding handkerchiefs and cloths over
their faces.

Iraqi court cancels result of lawyers association elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A court has canceled the results of the
March elections for the leadership of the Iraqi Lawyers
Association, a newspaper reported.
	   The Al-Musawir al-Arabi said the court had declared void the
elections of March 19 which were won by a well-known supporter of
the ruling Baath Party, Ez-Eldin al-Nia'mi.
	   It is thought to be the first time that a court has overturned
the results of an election since President Saddam Hussein came to
power in 1979.
	   The losing candidate, Khalid Faleh al-Sa'di, had filed a suit
accusing al-Nia'mi of ``forging many ballots,'' the newspaper
reported Sunday.
	   Al-Sa'di told the newspaper: ``I have expected this decision
because of my faith in the legal system.''
	   Candidates running in elections for the Lawyers Association,
which has about 20,000 registered members, would have to be
approved by the Baath Party.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Shaken by government clampdowns
and the arrest of their leader, some of Malaysia's pro-reform
campaigners were behind bars Monday, pondering their next move.
	   As pro-democracy protests and scuffles with police spread
through the capital, so did fears of darker days, following the
arrest of Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister,
and growing numbers of his supporters.
	   ``There is no plan. We don't know yet where to go,'' said the
young man who had organized volunteers outside Anwar's house to
spread the word of rallies and protests.
	   On Monday, he was afraid to be quoted by name, as report after
report came in of new arrests.
	   The biggest-ever outpouring of dissent during Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule, led by Anwar, seemed as if it
could be fizzling out under the force of water cannon, tear gas and
laws that allow summary arrest without charge.
	   ``We fear that at the throes of his political death, Mahathir
would resort to the use of the Internal Security Act to carry out
mass arrests or even to declare yet another emergency,'' said Syed
Husin, president of the Malaysian People's Party.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah, designated by him as the leader of the
reform movement in anticipation of his arrest, on Monday evening
canceled the nightly news conference that Anwar had used to spread
his message to the rest of the world and generate local support.
	   She was exhausted after a futile day of waiting at the
courthouse for Anwar to be brought in for arraignment, following a
sleepless night after police wearing ski masks broke down the door
of her home to take away her husband.
	   But she still sounded defiant.
	   ``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by ordering the police to act like
gangsters he will frighten the people from supporting this
reformation movement, he is dreaming,'' she said as she left the
court for home. ``He has become a political desperado who is
willing to suppress his own people just to keep power.''
	   What Azizah does and says over the next few days may be key to
whether the reform movement continues.
	   ``If Anwar's wife wants to do it, it would be very difficult for
the government to arrest her or attack her,'' said Bruce Gale, a
commentator from Political and Economic Risk Consultancy in
Singapore.
	   Even though its economy is sinking into a recession, Malaysia's
popular frustrations haven't mounted to the levels of Indonesia,
where people rioted spontaneously during protests that led to the
downfall of President Suharto in May.
	   ``No, it's going to take a hell of a lot more sacrifice for this
to go anywhere. You don't have empty stomachs here like in
Indonesia, where the empty stomachs caused the revolution,'' Rajesh
Patel, an attorney.
	   At Anwar's house, the riot police were gone and the shards of
broken windows had been cleared up after Sunday's storming. But
helicopters darting through the skies of Kuala Lumpur reminded city
residents of the 72-year-old Mahathir's grip on power.
	   ``He has descended to the use of the instruments of state power
to curb popular democracy,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of
political science at the University of Malaya.
	   Chandra, sitting in Anwar's house along with a clutch of other
supporters, said he feared for his own future. ``The next arrest
may be of yours truly,'' he said grimly.
	   Many people were arrested or detained Monday as police chased
Anwar's supporters down side roads around the courthouse.
	   The head of the ruling party's youth movement, Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi, was detained under the same law as Anwar. Other members of
Mahathir's party were being investigated and anyone who had let
Anwar use their house for a speech or visited him was suspect.
	   Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman, the president of the Muslim Youth
Movement of Malaysia, a group Anwar had started before joining
Mahathir's party, was arrested Monday, along with three other party
executives at the group's headquarters.
	   Police gave no reason.
	   On Sunday, the sight of 35,000 people, punching the air with
their fists, waving banners and shouting ``Reformasi'' at the
Freedom Square may have driven Mahathir to order a repeat of a 1987
crackdown, Chandra said.

Duchess of York lost staunch ally in her mother

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The death of her mother in a car crash has robbed
the Duchess of York of her staunchest ally through divorce, debt
and disgrace, a family friend said Monday.
	   Susan Barrantes was ``the one person who throughout all (the
duchess's) tribulations remained most concerned,'' Ingrid Seward
wrote in the Daily Express tabloid.
	   ``As Susie once told me: 'She is my daughter and that is good
enough reason for me to believe in her,''' recalled Seward, who
edits ``Majesty,'' a magazine about the royals.
	   Although Mrs. Barrantes left the duchess's father for another
man in the 1970s and moved to Argentina, she and her daughter
remained close and friends say the duchess relied on her mother for
support during her divorce from Prince Andrew, the second sone of
Queen Elizabeth II.
	   The duchess, popularly known as ``Fergie,'' arrived in the
Argentine capital Buenos Aires Monday to make preparations for the
funeral. Aides said she was devastated.
	   The duchess, 38, who was on vacation in Italy when she heard the
news Sunday, flew straight home to Britain, staying just long
enough to hand over her daughters, Princess Beatrice, 10, and
8-year-old Princess Eugenie, to their father before catching a
flight to Buenos Aires.
	   The duchess's sister, Jane Luedecke, who lives in Australia, was
flying separately to the Argentine capital.
	   Police said Mrs. Barrantes, 61, was killed instantly Saturday
night when the Rover she was driving collided with van on a rural
road near Tres Lomas, about 310 miles (550 kms) southwest of Buenos
Aires, near the ranch where she raised polo ponies.
	   Mrs. Barrantes's passenger, nephew by marriage Rafael Barrantes,
25, escaped with minor injuries. The driver of the other car, Jose
Maria Rodriguez, suffered a broken ankle, police said.
	   The duchess's mother settled in Argentina in 1975 with her
second husband, Argentine professional polo player Hector
Barrantes.
	   Mrs. Barrantes left Maj. Ronald Ferguson, the queen's former
polo manager, and their two daughters, then teen-agers, for
Barrantes. He died of cancer in 1990.
	   Mrs. Barrantes' death was another blow for the high-spending,
controversial Fergie, oft-accused of trading on her royal
connections to help repay huge debts.
	   While her royal in-laws kept their distance and the public
scoffed, her mother offered support through the very public breakup
of her marriage, salacious tabloid reports of her love affairs and
a series of ill-advised money-making ventures.
	   Seward said Mrs. Barrantes felt guilty about leaving her
daughters. ''I got the impression Susie spent the rest of her life
trying to make up for leaving the children who almost
hero-worshiped her,'' she wrote.
	   At the end, Seward said, the pair were ''more like two friends
than mother and daughter.''
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced. But the
duchess's aides said Mrs. Barrantes will be buried alongside her
second husband near Buenos Aires.

Healthy rise in all traffic and narrowing of net losses
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Eurotunnel traffic -- cars, trucks, freight -- all
registered healthy rises in the first half of the year, the Channel
Tunnel operator said Monday, announcing a narrowing of net losses
to 1.2 billion francs (dlrs 211 million) from 3.1 billion francs
(dlrs 544 million) a year ago.
	   The net loss report excludes a one-time gain from the company's
debt restructuring plan, finalized in April. It cut the principle
considerably and lowered interest rates on the rest in exchange for
issuing shares to the company's creditors.
	   That plan was retroactive to October 15, 1996, and resulted in a
one-time gain for Eurotunnel of 2.8 billion francs (dlrs 491
million). Including that gain, Eurotunnel posted a net profit of
1.5 billion francs (dlrs 263 million).
	   Eurotunnel's operating profit rose to 559 million francs (dlrs
98 million) from 120 million francs (dlrs 21 million) thanks to a
strong rise in tunnel revenues and in gross profit margins, a
Eurotunnel statement said.
	   ``The results of the first half are encouraging,'' Eurotunnel
Executive Chairman Patrick Ponsolle and co-Chairman Robert Malpas
said in the statement. ``These results and the rise in our
July-August traffic confirm the feeling that operating profit for
the full year 1998 will be at least in line with our goal, and
likely higher.''
	   In early 1997, Eurotunnel set out a new business plan which set
an operating profit goal for 1998 of 1.08 billion francs (dlrs 189
million).
	   Automobile traffic for the first half rose to more than 1.5
million vehicles, up from 833,450 vehicles in the same 1997 period.
	   In the chairmen's letter, Ponsolle and Malpas said that 1998
July and August traffic continued to show a strong rise from a year
ago.
	   ``They were months during which traffic on our shuttles was much
greater than the corresponding 1997 period,'' they wrote, saying
car traffic rose by 31 percent, bus traffic by 43 percent, and
truck traffic by 67 percent.
	   Virtually no trucks used the tunnel in the first half of 1997
because it was closed to trucks for nearly the entire period after
a fire in late 1996.
	   Traffic on the Eurostar train service, which is not owned by
Eurotunnel but also operates through the tunnel, rose to 3,058,819
passengers from 2,702,986 a year earlier -- a 13 percent increase.

North Korea accuses Seoul of plotting to kill donated cattle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATEs with Hyundai's comment in grafs 11-13

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea accused the South Korean
government Monday of a ``vicious plot'' to kill the 500 cattle it
received as a gift from a Seoul businessman in June.
	   The cattle, the North's official Korean Central News Agency
said, were force fed indigestible material before being shipped
across the border so they would later die slowly.
	   The report said the scheme was cooked up by South Korea's
Unification Ministry and the government's intelligence arm, the
Agency for National Security Planning.
	   The alleged act showed they would do anything ``to block the
inter-Korean non-governmental cooperation and create distrust
between the South Korean businessmen and us,'' it said.
	   The news agency said 15 cattle already have died and eight more
are near death.
	   Autopsies found vinyl strips and lumps of hemp rope in the
stomachs of the dead animals, items ``which cannot be seen in the
DPRK (North Korea),'' the agency said, adding:
	   ``We cannot guess how many (cattle) may fall to the vicious
plot.''
	   The cattle were a gift from Chung Ju-yung, founder of Seoul's
Hyundai business group, when he visited his native North Korea
three months ago.
	   Seoul government officials denied the North Korean accusations,
saying they were not involved in any way in the shipment of the
cattle.
	   ``It is nonsense. It is not even worth making a comment,'' an
official at the spy agency said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   Hyundai officials said they had raised the cattle in clean and
pleasant environment and properly fed the cattle.
	   ``As we put all our efforts to raise the cattle well, we cannot
help expressing regret (at the North Korean claim),'' Hyundai said
in a statement.
	   Hyundai said it was solely responsible for the shipment of the
cattle and no outsiders were involved.
	   The Koreas were separated into the communist North and the
capitalist South in 1945. They fought a three-year war in the early
1950s. Animosity and distrust run deep between the two sides.

Somali man indicted in deaths of Italian TV crew
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A Somali man was indicted Monday in the 1994
slayings of an Italian television correspondent and a camerman in
an ambush in the Somali capital of Mogadishu.
	   Hashi Hassan, who has been in an Italian jail since January, is
accused of being the driver of the Land Rover that blocked the
vehicle the Italians were traveling in when they were killed. The
victims were RAI state television journalist Ilaria Alpi and
cameraman Miran Hrovatin.
	   The motive of the attack was unclear, and Italian authorities
said they were seeking to identify others involved.
	   Hassan had come to Rome to testify against Italian troops
accused of torturing local militiamen during the UN peace mission.
He was arrested following accusations by the driver for the
Italians.
	   Italian news agencies said the trial date was set for Jan. 18.

	   The Clinton grand jury testimony, the Lewinsky testimony and the
rest of the 2,800 pages of Starr documents will be made public by
the House Judiciary Committee when the Clinton videotape is
released at approximately 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) Monday.
	   The Government Printing Office is printing the materials in
bound form.
	   Sometime after the printed transcripts are distributed _ how
much longer is not known _ we expect to get the materials
electronically.
	   Because of the volume, the full texts of the testimony and
documents will not move on regular news wires.
	   Instead, once they are in electronic form, we will provide the
full texts in ASCII and HTML formats at an ftp site. We have
arranged for an ftp server with additional capacity to handle the
expected demand. This means the files will not be at the same
address used to deliver the Starr report last week.
	   The address of the ftp server is texts.ap.org. The files will be
in a directory called testimony. To get the username and password,
you can call your local bureaus. There will also be a voice mail
message at 212-621-6234 with the details, or you can call the
international desk at 212-621-1644.
	   Again, this is not the server we used to deliver the OIC report.
Please do not connect to that server. The files will NOT be there.
	   Also, we set up this ftp site so that members can have access to
the full text of the testimony and other evidence. So please do not
make the address, username and password public. If the address
becomes public you may have trouble connecting to the ftp site.
	   We will advise you as soon as there is something available at
the site.
	   We will also post the full texts on the Web at
http://textsweb.ap.org/starrtext
	   Running excerpts will move on regular news wires. We cannot
estimate wordage until we see the documents. The excerpts will be
edited; much of the sexually graphic detail may be deleted and any
that remains will be carefully flagged.
	   The full transcripts on the ftp site will be unedited and will
move in the official form provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.
	   Edited video clips in RealVideo and QuickTime formats from the
videotape of President Bill Clinton's testimony will also be
available at the ftp site.
	   Additionally, we will post the text files and video excerpts on
The WIRE, the AP's public Web site that is displayed by newspaper
and broadcast sites around the world.
	   APTV, the AP's international video service that provides video
to 200 broadcasters in the United States and abroad, plans to carry
the video in full, unedited, as soon as it is made available.
	   Warnings about explicit language will be shown both on screen
and in APTV advisories before the tapes are played.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 1100 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian markets tumbled Monday, and analysts
blamed everything from disputes over a new bank reform agreement in
Japan to political instability in Malaysia to the Clinton sex
scandal in America. In Japan, the key index plunged to its lowest
level in more than 12 years amid uncertainty over the fate of
legislation to revive the country's ailing banking system.
Indonesian shares tumbled to their lowest level in seven years amid
bearishness in regional markets, concerns over the domestic
political situation and fears of further social unrest, dealers
said. In Hong Kong, the key index slumped nearly 4 percent
following sharp falls in Tokyo and uncertainties over a U.S.
presidential scandal. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A last-minute compromise to resuscitate Japan's
troubled banking system appeared to be unraveling Monday, as ruling
and opposition party leaders publicly fought over just what was
agreed upon. Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi struck the banking bill
deal with opposition parties late last week as he prepared to leave
for his first summit with U.S. President Clinton. Obuchi is hoping
to cite the compromise deal as evidence Japan is making progress in
cleaning up its bad loan mess when he confers with Clinton Tuesday.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion
new rubles (dlrs 66 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid
to get cash flowing through the frozen banking system, an official
said Monday. Also, President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov met in the Kremlin with the aim of finalizing the
new cabinet and working out a plan to stabilize the jittery
economy. The government's biggest fear at present is that the
country's shaky commercial banks will collapse. The Central Bank
launched an emergency rescue plan on Friday to help ensure that
payments would start circulating again. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Central Bank has no plans to use
its hard currency reserves to support the shaky currency, the
bank's chairman said Monday. Speaking at a government meeting,
Viktor Yushchenko said National Bank reserves now stand at about
dlrs 1 billion following the arrival of the first installments of
loans from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The
sharp fall in the National Bank reserves, from dlrs 2.34 at the
start of 1998, resulted from its earlier attempts to defend the
hryvna. (UKRAINE-ECONOMY)
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada urged
Philippine Airlines' management and labor unions Monday to return
to the negotiating table in a last-minute attempt to stop the
closure of Asia's oldest commercial airline. PAL announced last
week that it plans to shut down at midnight on Wednesday. Estrada
ruled out the possibility of the government taking over the airline
to stop its closure, saying his administration has no money to run
the cash-strapped airline. (PHILIPPINE AIRLINES)
	   LONDON (AP) _ American Airlines and British Airways unveiled a
global alliance with three other carriers Monday _ and said they
want more partners to compete with a group led by United Airlines
and Germany's Lufthansa. Canadian Airlines and Australia's Qantas
already had marketing partnerships with American and British
Airways _ and the Kong Kong carrier Cathay Pacific Airways came
aboard Monday in the new alliance to be called ``oneworld.''
Executives told a news conference that they had invited the Spanish
flag carrier Iberia to join up, and that Finnair would be another
strong potential candidate. They also have their eyes set on a
bigger prize: Japan Airlines. (BRITAIN-AIRLINES)

East Timor Bishop calls on Indonesia to be open about troop
</HEADLINE>
movements

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ East Timorese Bishop Carlos Belo has
called on the Indonesian military to be open about its troop
movements so as to build greater trust in the troubled territory, a
news report said Monday.
	   In recent weeks, pro-independence activists have accused the
military of secretly increasing troop numbers.
	   The accusations, denied by the military, follow the public
withdrawal of hundreds of combat soldiers from East Timor last
month.
	   The withdrawal was ordered as international negotiations
continue to search for a peaceful future for the former Portuguese
territory.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted Belo as saying that he had received
information that troops had been sent into the territory from
neighboring West Timor.
	   Indonesia's military invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it
the following year.
	   The world body does not recognize the claim but is sponsoring
talks between Indonesia and Portugal.
	   Indonesia has offered to grant a form of autonomy to East Timor
in return for international recognition of its sovereignty over the
half-island territory, 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) east of
Jakarta.
	   Since the invasion, East Timor has endured years of human rights
abuses and guerrilla warfare.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse thousands of supporters of the
country's ousted deputy prime minister, in the second day of street
clashes. An army unit was sent onto the streets of the capital, to
help quell demonstrations. Federal police said the fired
politician, Anwar Ibrahim, was being held under a harsh law that
allows indefinite imprisonment without charges or trial, for those
deemed a threat to national security. Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad may be seeking to remove Anwar, his only rival, from the
political scene by the quickest means possible. Anwar has been
leading the increasingly public opposition to the 17-year-rule of
the 72-year-old prime minister. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ A rocket slammed into an open field
early Monday as rescue workers sifted through several neighborhoods
of Kabul that were devastated by a rocket barrage a day earlier.
There were no casualties in Monday's rocket attack, while on Sunday
more than 50 people died when several rockets blasted crowded
neighborhoods of Karti Parwan and Khair Khana, said hospital
officials and Taliban authorities. Hundreds more people were
wounded by flying shrapnel and debris, hospital workers said on
condition that their names not be used. (AFGHANISTAN-ROCKET ATTACK)
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberian secret police opened fire on
the American Embassy in Monrovia, killing at least two people and
injuring two as they tried to catch a former warlord who had sought
refuge inside, peacekeeping officials said Monday. Two of those
known to have died were aides to former Liberian warlord Roosevelt
Johnson, a rival of President Charles Taylor, according to Gen.
Timothy Shelpidi, commander of the Nigerian-led peacekeeping force
that patrols Liberia. The Saturday morning shooting followed unrest
that started Friday night when the government tried to arrest
Johnson. The fighting left parts of the seaside Liberian capital
littered with corpses and wreckage. At least 33 people were killed.
(LIBERIA)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Looking to assert himself on the world
stage while settling aside his personal difficulties, U.S.
President Bill Clinton is calling anew for a united international
front to combat terrorists and their new, high-tech ability to kill
and maim. Clinton was going before the 53rd session of the U.N.
General Assembly Monday to press his case that the fight against
terrorism remains a top priority on the world's agenda. It is a
subject he has addressed previously _ before the same audience _
but this time the president was arguing that advances in technology
mean no nation has the luxury of battling terrorism in its own way.
(UN-GENERAL ASSEMBLY)
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ The Social Democrats, who built
Sweden's welfare state and then forced it to deteriorate, now have
a chance to make good on their promise to rebuild it. The party
came through Sunday's national elections with their worst
performance ever _ just 36.6 percent of the votes _ but with
conservative parties apparently unable to budge them from power.
The four non-socialist parties got 169 seats in the 349-seat
Riksdag parliament: far more than the Social Democrats' 131, but
short of a majority. (SWEDEN-ELECTIONS)

Three South Korean carmakers submit bids for Kia Motors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Three South Korean carmakers submitted
bids Monday to buy bankrupt Kia Motors Corp. and its commercial
vehicle arm, Asia Motors Corp.
	   It was the second time Kia, South Korea's second largest
automaker, had been put up for auction. The winner among Hyundai
Motor Co., Daewoo Motor Co. and Samsung Motors Inc. will be
announced Sept. 28.
	   The first auction earlier this month failed to find a buyer
after Kia's creditor banks rejected bids by U.S. automaker Ford and
the three Korean companies, which demanded a write-off of at least
part of Kia's dlrs 8.4 billion debt.
	   The creditors had offered to write off interest on that debt
over the next 10 years, an estimated dlrs 4.6 billion, but none of
the principal.
	   After failing to find a buyer in the first auction, creditors
said they would write off dlrs 2.1 billion of the principal along
with any interest on the remainder.
	   That still wasn't good enough for Ford, which did not take part
in the second round of bidding.
	   Kia and its creditors said the successful bidder must buy at
least 51 percent of the equity of Kia and Asia Motors. Ford already
owns 16.9 percent of Kia.
	   The move to sell Kia is part of the government's effort to
restructure its battered economy under a dlrs 58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund.
	   Kia's collapse last year helped erode investor confidence in
South Korea's industries, leading to a flight of capital.
	   Kia produced 780,000 cars in 1997. Asia Motors can turn out
250,000 vehicles, mostly trucks and buses. The two companies employ
more than 18,000 workers.

UN says it has speeded up the delivery of medicines to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has significantly
accelerated the delivery of medicines and medical supplies to Iraq,
U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Dennis Halliday said Monday.
	   The first batch of health care items ordered under the current
phase of the oil-for-food program arrived on Sept. 19, Halliday's
spokesman, Eric Falt, said.
	   The phase began in June, making for a three-month delay between
ordering and delivery. In the first phase, which began in December
1996, it was six months before the initial batch of health care
supplies arrived.
	   ``Given the complexity of the process, this shows a significant
speed-up in delivering items in the health sector,'' Halliday said.
	   Iraq has received dlrs 366 million worth of medicines and
medical supplies since the oil-for-food program began, Falt said.
	   The program allows Iraq to bypass the sweeping sanctions imposed
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell limited quantities of
oil. The proceeds are used to buy food and humanitarian supplies
for Iraq's citizens.
	   The shipment which arrived Saturday was part of an order for
medicines, vitamins and medical supplies from a Malaysian company.
	   Iraq has complained repeatedly that the slow process of
approving contracts by a U.N. committee in New York and delivering
the goods have caused death among citizens suffering severe
illnesses and malnutrition.
	   The United Nations has recently taken steps to streamline
procedures for the approval of contracts and delivery of shipments.

Russia's Central Bank prints money, offers credits to help banks

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion
rubles (dlrs 66 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid to
get cash flowing through the frozen banking system, an official
said Monday.
	   Also, President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov met in the Kremlin with the aim of finalizing the new
cabinet and working out a plan to stabilize the jittery economy.
	   The government's biggest fear at present is that the country's
shaky commercial banks will collapse. The Central Bank launched an
emergency rescue plan on Friday to help ensure that payments would
start circulating again.
	   Russia's financial crisis had caused a backlog of bank payments
totaling over 30 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion), Andrei Kozlov,
the first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, told a news
conference Monday.
	   The Central Bank on Friday helped to settle 10 billion rubles
(dlrs 666 million) of the payments, or one-third of the total owed
between banks and their clients, Kozlov said.
	   As part of the effort, the Central Bank printed 900 million
rubles (dlrs 60 million) and issued short-term credits to banks,
Kozlov said.
	   The moves should help the banks get back on their feet. But they
could also fuel inflation and lead to further declines in the the
Russian ruble, officially valued at 16 to the U.S. dollar, down
from six when the crisis began a month ago.
	   In another development, the Central Bank canceled electronic
currency trading on Monday, though the ruble continued trading at
street exchanges.
	   The Central Bank said it acted because it needed more time to
determine which banks should be allowed to participate on the
currency markets, and which should not.
	   ``We want to make sure that the banks will use the extra
(rubles) to settle their client payments and not to buy dollars,''
Kozlov said.
	   Critics have accused the government of responding slowly to the
economic crisis which hit last month. The rescue plan for the banks
represents the biggest emergency effort so far.
	   Primakov has been in office 10 days, but has yet to outline an
overall economic strategy or put his cabinet in place. Key jobs,
such as the finance minister's post, have not be filled.
	   ``We are going to finalize the personnel issue with (Primakov)
today,'' Yeltsin said at the start of his meeting with the premier.
	   ``The cabinet formation is still on the way, but we have already
been carrying out serious work,'' Primakov said.
	   Shortly after the meeting, Gennady Kulik, 63, a Soviet-era
agricultural official and a member of parliament's Agrarian
Faction, was named deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture.
	   Kulik, a defender of collective farms and a staunch opponent of
private land ownership, has been among those who have blocked
Yeltsin's plans to carry out land reform.
	   Primakov also named Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin, considered a
moderate reformer, to head Russia's delegation in talks with the
International Monetary Fund, Russian news agencies reported Monday.
	   An IMF mission arrived in Moscow on Friday for a week of talks
with Russian officials to follow up on Russia's lending program.
The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package in July, but
it did not ward off the crisis.
	   The Russian economy got more bad news Monday when the State
Statistics Committee announced that the Gross Domestic Product
shrank 2.1 percent in the first eight months of the year.
	   Also, the number of unemployed increased slightly last month to
reach 8.35 million people, or 11.5 percent of the workforce. The
rate is expected to rise even higher due to the worsening crisis.

Defense lawyers walk out of fraud trial of anti-apartheid hero
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Defense lawyers walked off the
case Monday in a wrangle over fees during the fraud trial of one of
the anti-apartheid movement's leading campaigners.
	   Allan Boesak, once a prominent African National Congress
official in the Cape Town area, looked on grim-faced as his lawyer
told the judge that the defendant had no money to pay his fees.
	   ``We have no choice but to withdraw as counsel in the matter,''
attorney Mike Maritz said ``This is regrettably unavoidable.''
	   Judge John Foxcroft postponed the case until Oct. 9.
	   Boesak has pleaded innocent to 32 charges of fraud and theft of
about a million rand, then worth about dlrs 300,000, from a charity
he ran from 1988 to 1994.
	   The case already has been delayed by a long-running dispute over
lawyers' fees.
	   After receiving an anonymous donation of 1 million rand (dlrs
160,000), Boesak hired a top legal team. However, that cash has now
run out and the state Legal Aid Board is not willing to pay the
full fees demanded by the lawyers.
	   Foxcroft said he hoped Boesak would be able to find new legal
representatives willing to work for lower wages. However, even if
new lawyers are found by next month they are likely to need at
least six months to be briefed on the enormous and complicated
trial.
	   Boesak hugged his wife, who wept in the courtroom, and told
reporters that there was a conspiracy against him in the legal
system organized by people hankering after the days of white rule.
	   ``This is a conspiracy of bad faith, revenge and political
vigilantism,'' he said ``Many of the remnants of the old regime are
still effectively running the system. Someone like myself, with my
record in the struggle, would be highly unlikely to find justice.''
	   Boesak said he plans to appeal to President Nelson Mandela,
currently on a trip to the United States, to help with funding his
defense.
	   ``I and my family trust that he will do the right thing so that
justice may be served,'' he said.
	   Boesak, a former minister who once headed the World Alliance of
Reformed Churches, is accused of embezzling money from the
Foundation for Peace and Justice.
	   Donations to the foundation came from singer Paul Simon, the
Coca-Cola Foundation, Scandinavian aid agencies and others.
	   Freddie Steenkamp, Boesak's bookkeeper at the foundation, was
sentenced in 1997 to six years in jail after pleading guilty to
embezzlement. Steenkamp said he was only following Boesak's
example.
	   Boesak gave up an appointment as ambassador to the United
Nations in Geneva when the scandal involving his charity emerged,
and took a lectureship in the United States for a year.

Nine arrested over IRA dissidents' bombing of Omagh

	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Police arrested nine people
Monday on suspicion of involvement in last month's car bombing of
Omagh, the deadliest terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's 30-year
conflict.
	   Northern Ireland police said they arrested six people in
connection with the Aug. 15 blast, which killed 29 people and
wounded more than 330 in the religiously mixed town 70 miles (110
kms) west of Belfast.
	   And in the neighboring Irish Republic, police arrested three men
on suspicion of helping steal the car used to ferry the
approximately 500 pounds (225 kgs) of homemade explosive into
Omagh.
	   The Irish Republican Army dissidents who planted the bomb called
a ``complete cessation'' of violence two weeks ago. That put them
in line with the mainstream IRA, which in July 1997 formally halted
its campaign to destabilize British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   In response to the Omagh atrocity, the British and Irish
governments passed emergency anti-terrorist legislation designed to
allow police and courts to imprison IRA dissidents more easily.
	   But so far the extra powers _ including resctrictions on the
right to silence and giving police claims greater weight as
evidence _ have not been used to press charges against any
suspects.
	   Under existing British anti-terrorist law the Northern Ireland
suspects can be held without charge for up to one week. Under the
strengthened Irish laws, the three suspects can be held without
charge for up to four days.
	   Police on both sides of the border have previously arrested a
number of people in connection with the Omagh bombing but they have
been released after questioning.

Cambodian leaders prepare for top-level negotiations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC;

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival political leaders prepared
Monday for a summit meeting led by King Norodom Sihanouk that is
meant to end Cambodia's post-election political deadlock and pave
the way for the formation of a new government.
	   Cambodian strongman Hun Sen arrived in this northwestern city
late Monday, a day ahead of his scheduled meeting with opposition
leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy.
	   The party leaders will try to ease tensions that erupted into
violence when police suppressed street protests against Hun Sen's
victory in the July parliamentary elections. The opposition claims
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party used fraud and intimidation to
win the polls.
	   Hun Sen's party won a slight majority in July 26 elections, but
not the two-thirds required to form a government on its own.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh of the royalist FUNCINPEC party and his
opposition ally Sam Rainsy, whose parties won 58 of the National
Assembly's 122 seats, had threatened to boycott the assembly,
effectively preventing the formation of a government. However, they
agreed last week to attend the assembly's opening session after
violent clashes between police and opposition demonstrators in the
capital threatened to get out of control.
	   The Tuesday meeting will mark the first face-to-face encounter
between Hun Sen and Ranariddh since Hun Sen ousted the prince as
his co-premier in a coup d'etat in July last year.
	   Among other matters, the talks are expected to finalize
arrangements for the opening of the National Assembly as scheduled
on Thursday.
	   King Sihanouk, who must personally convene the assembly, has
called for all elected members to gather in Siem Reap and, if there
are no hitches, be sworn in at the famous 12th century Angkor Wat
temple, which is just outside of town.
	   Khieu Kanharith, a spokesman for Hun Sen's party, suggested
Monday that Hun Sen would then push for a two-party coalition
government with Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC that would shut out Sam
Rainsy, a bitter foe of Hun Sen.
	   He said that whether FUNCINPEC could hold any of five important
ministerial positions was a matter still open to negotiation,
reversing a stand taken by Hun Sen soon after the elections.
	   Hun Sen's job as prime minister and the chairmanship of the
National Assembly, held by Chea Sim, secretary general of Hun Sen's
Party, were not negotiable, he said.
	   There is no public agenda for the summit talks with the king,
but they are expected to cover the two main technical complaints
the opposition has about the elections and a travel ban the
government has imposed on opposition members of the assembly.
	   The opposition saw its hundreds of election complaints rejected
out of hand by Hun Sen-appointed election bodies and now insists
only that two broad issues be seriously investigated.
	   The travel ban was instituted earlier this month after a grenade
attack on Hun Sen's house. He was not at home at the time of the
incident, which the opposition charged was staged to have a pretext
for cracking down on dissent. Hun Sen indicated that he believed
the opposition parties were implicated in the incident.
	   In the crackdown that followed the incident, police killed four
protesters and injured or arrested dozens of others.
	   Khieu Kanharith said Monday that the travel ban was still in
effect for opposition politicians, but he suggested it may be
lifted if FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party follow through with
their promise to attend the opening of parliament Sept. 24 in Siem
Reap.
	   The United Nations office in Cambodia on Sunday said it was
``seriously concerned'' about the government's travel ban against
the opposition, calling it unconstitutional.
	   Thailand released a statement the same day warning that efforts
to end Cambodia's political crisis could be derailed if the ban was
not lifted.

Global markets plunge on Wall Street fears

	   LONDON (AP) _ Stock prices plunged from Asia to Europe on
Monday, with traders nervously anticipating more global economic
turmoil and a fresh round of selling on Wall Street.
	   Blue chips on the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest
market, were off by about 2.2 percent in the late morning, sinking
further into the red for calendar 1998. Earlier, shares in Tokyo,
the top Asian market, plunged to their lowest level in more than 12
years.
	   ``The market's still going to be going through some major
pockets of volatility,'' said James Shoot, a salesman at the London
brokerage Schroders. ``The U.S. market is expected to be down a
reasonable amount today, and that's being penciled in at the
moment.''
	   Early U.S. stock futures trading indicated the Dow Jones
industrial average would fall sharply when the New York Stock
Exchange opened for business later Monday.
	   London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index had
plunged 115.5 points to 4,940.1 by late morning _ pushing the
so-called ``footsie'' down by 3.8 percent since the end of 1997.
	   Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index was off by about 3 percent in early
dealings, while in Paris, the CAC 40 index fell by 3.8 percent.
	   ``Some companies are still to announce disappointing earnings
forecasts, and this is the only thing investors are watching
closely, no matter how good the macro-economic perspectives are,''
said Jean-Charles Gand, a trader at Societe Generale in Paris. Gand
predicted the ``volatile, bearish'' conditions would persist.
	   Asian traders found lots of excuses for selling _ including
disputes over banking reform in Japan, Malaysian political troubles
and President Bill Clinton's problems in Washington.
	   Few found any reasons to buy.
	   Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 385.82
points, or 2.76 percent, to finish the day at 13,597.30 _ its
lowest close since February 1986.
	   The Nikkei fell from the outset of trading in reaction to the
apparent unraveling of an agreement on a set of bank stabilization
bills. With the Asian economic crisis spreading into other regions,
many experts have said Japan, the biggest Asian economy, must
reform its banking system to help lead a financial rebound.
	   In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index fell 3.7 percent to close at
7,170.23 points. Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 3.3 percent
to 882.59 points.
	   Jakarta shares dropped 5.5 percent to a seven-year low, while
Malaysian shares slid 3.8 percent against a backdrop of violent
political protests.

Police clash with Anwar supporters, fire tear gas and water cannon

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix writethru sequence

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse thousands of supporters of the
country's ousted deputy prime minister, in the second day of street
clashes. An army unit was sent onto the streets of the capital, to
help quell demonstrations.
	   Federal police said the fired politician, Anwar Ibrahim, was
being held under a harsh law that allows indefinite imprisonment
without charges or trial, for those deemed a threat to national
security.
	   One of his allies, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, head of the youth wing of
the ruling party, was detained under the same act, bringing to at
least seven the number of Anwar's supporters arrested on various
charges.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad may be seeking to remove Anwar,
his only rival, from the political scene by the quickest means
possible. Anwar has been leading the increasingly public opposition
to the 17-year-rule of the 72-year-old prime minister.
	   Anwar's detention has already threatened to overshadow a visit
by Queen Elizabeth II to Kuala Lumpur and her festive closing of
the 16th Commonwealth Games. The queen's motorcade passed the
throng of noisy pro-reform demonstrators in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Anwar, who was tossed out of the government earlier this month,
was expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and disturbing
the public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night has added a
volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic troubles.
	   But the use of the security act implies that there is not enough
substance in the charges to try Anwar and his allies in court, said
Chandra Muzaffar, political science professor at the University of
Malaya. ``It means that the government is not prepared to give him
a chance to defend himself in court,'' the professor said.
	   Pounding batons on their heavy shields, police charged into a
crowd of 2,000 people, chanting ``reform, reform'' outside the
courthouse where Anwar had been expected to appear for arraignment
Monday morning.
	   Several thousand more demonstrators took to the streets in other
parts of the capital, where they were chased by riot police.
Reporters saw police detaining at least a dozen protesters and
shoving them into vans, though authorities released no figures on
the numbers arrested.
	   There were some injuries among the demonstrators. Some were
hauled away bleeding by police.
	   ``We didn't do anything. We just shouted `reformasi,''' said
Marizal Jai, 23, a janitor. ``They attacked us with water and tear
gas. They chased us in and out of buildings.''
	   Several hundred protesters, hemmed in by police units, then
headed toward the National Mosque, just a few blocks down the
street. The mosque was the site of the 51-year-old Anwar's fiery
speech Sunday that culminated in protests and his arrest.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, issued an eloquent rallying call
late Monday to Malaysia's still-diffuse reform movement.
	   ``Unfortunately the police acted wildly. This is another truth
how the police have lost their sense of balance, of humanity, by
attacking the public,'' Azizah told reporters.
	   She said she regretted the police storming of the family home
Sunday night, an act that terrified her, Anwar and their children.
	   ``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by ordering the police to act like
gangsters he will frighten the people from supporting this
reformation movement, he is dreaming. I think he has cut himself
off from reality,'' Azizah said.
	   Looking shaken, she added: ``I feel very sad because Dr.
Mahathir is a great leader, but now he has become a political
desperado, who is willing to suppress his own people just to keep
power.''
	   Police swooped in and blocked several access points to the
city's main plaza, Merdeka (Freedom) Square, with jeeps, trucks and
police cars, to keep protesters away.
	   More than 1,000 police were frantically working to contain the
angry demonstrators. They were backed by a specially trained unit
of two-dozen reserve army officers. Police chased small mobs of men
down the city's side streets.
	   National police chief Abdul Rahim Noor refused to say where
Anwar was being held Monday.
	   But an aide to Anwar's wife said the family had been told that
he was taken overnight to a maximum security detention camp.
	   ``We're here to support Anwar because he's innocent. He didn't
do all those crazy things,'' said Haji Abdul Karim, a 35-year-old
businessman and member of the UMNO ruling party. ``We want him as
our prime minister.''
	   More than 100 reporters thronged the Sessions Court, expecting
to see Anwar brought in to hear the charges against him.
	   As tear gas poured into the courthouse, frightened lawyers and
court staff rushed outside, holding handkerchiefs and cloths over
their faces.

Demaci withdraws from political life, health reasons cited
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The political leader of ethnic
Albanian separatist fighting Serb security forces in Kosovo
resigned Monday in a apparent sign of disarray among the rebels.
	   Also on Monday, officials in both Serbia and Montenegro rejected
an ethnic Albanian proposal for the Serbian province to gain equal
status with those two republics in the joint Yugoslav federation.
	   Adem Demaci's office announced his withdrawal from political
life due to health reasons. It said the doctors had warned
68-year-old Demaci of increased nervous tension and worsening
diabetes.
	   But analysts in Pristina believe that Demaci made the decision
following a clash with the Kosovo Liberation Army headquarters over
the hard-liners refusal to accept anything short of full
independence for the majority Albanian province.
	   The move came following the KLA defeat by Serb forces in much of
the province. Demaci's pullout is expected to further marginalize
the rebels and strengthen the position of the U.S.-backed pacifist
Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The KLA and Demaci have challenged Rugova's position,
criticizing him for his pacifism and readiness to negotiate deals
for Kosovo which fall short of ethnic Albanian demands for
independence.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in present
Yugoslavia. It is over 90 percent ethnic Albanian but is ruled by
Serbia which abolished its broad autonomy in 1989.
	   A U.S. mediator Christopher Hill has been trying to negotiate a
deal for the province to avoid further fighting and a humanitarian
disaster for 250,000 displaced by Kosovo fighting.
	   Both Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics which constitute
Yugoslavia, rejected an ethnic Albanian proposal that Kosovo
becomes a third republic within the country.
	   Miodrag Vukovic, an adviser to the president of Montenegro, told
Dnevni Telegraf daily a territorial autonomy for Kosovo that would
change borders and position of Serbia in Yugoslavia is ``out of the
question.''
	   Montenegro, which is much smaller than Serbia, apparently fears
its position in the federation would be jeopardized if Kosovo
became a separate unit.
	   According to ethnic Albanian proposal, published Sunday in Koha
Ditore daily, Kosovo would be ``temporarily part of Yugoslavia, as
an independent entity equal to the other two republics in the
federation.''
	   Kosovo would have its own parliament, government, courts and
police, but would be part of a common market with the rest of
Yugoslavia. It indicated Kosovo's borders could remain in the hands
of the Yugoslav army and federal customs authorities.
	   But a vice president in the Serbian government, Vojislav Seselj,
said ``Kosovo must remain in Serbia.'' He added the region could
only be granted ``territorial autonomy'' within Serbia.
	   Last week, Koha Ditore carried a formula suggested by the United
States which would grant the province a high level of self-rule but
leaving it within Serbia and Yugoslavia. Rugova has backed the
plan, saying it was a good basis for the talks.
	   A U.S. diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said Sunday
that the Serb side could come up with their suggestions as early as
Monday, when U.S. envoy Hill is scheduled to visit the Yugoslav
capital, Belgrade.
	   Belgrade media have indicated that a Serb proposal would be
similar to the U.S. one.
	   Hill told Koha Ditore Monday that the key issue is to stop the
use of force in Kosovo. But he admitted ``I haven't had much
success.''
	   Serb forces and KLA clashed Monday in the central Drenica
region, reported ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center.

Heroes who stood out at the Commonwealth Games
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QL; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ With the big stars missing from
the Commonwealth Games, many wondered if the tournament was worth
the trouble. For these athletes who excelled for themselves and
their countries it was. For the fans who watched them it was too.
	   ___
	   TRACK: He won the 100-meter dash in 9.88 seconds. Then the show
started.
	   Sprinter Ato Boldon of Trinidad and Tobago preened and posed
before a stadium crowd of 37,000. He kneeled with his head bowed,
waggled his hips and raising his arms with palms open to the sky,
as if to say, ``Raise the roof.''
	   The brash 24-year-old, who boasts the aura of a rock star, was
perhaps the biggest celebrity at the Commonwealth Games, lending
the event some much-needed flair.
	   ___
	   SWIMMING: Susie O'Neill of Australia became the greatest swimmer
in Commonwealth Games history when she won her 10th gold medal.
	   The Olympic and world champion added to her stash of four
Commonwealth gold medals with another six at this year's games. She
also won two silvers.
	   O'Neill is 25 and will retire after the Sydney Olympics.
	   ___
	   Another Australian swimming star, Ian Thorpe, is only 15 years
old but he had little trouble picking up four golds.
	   Along with Michael Klim, Daniel Kowalski and Matt Dunn, the
teen-ager broke the world record in the 4x200-meter team with a
time of seven minutes, 11.86 seconds.
	   ``You can't believe he's 15. It's genetics gone bloody crazy,''
national swim coach Don Talbot gushed.
	   ___
	   DIVING: When his final marks flashed on the scoreboard, and gold
was his, Canada's Alexandre Despatie burst into tears.
	   Just 13 years old, the diving prodigy won the gold medal in the
men's platform event.
	   Despatie learned to swim when he was five in his parent's
backyard pool.
	   ``I was diving in my pool and asked my grandmother if she could
give me scores. She always gave some 10s. Always,'' he said. ``Then
I asked my dad if I could do it for real.''
	   ___
	   HOCKEY: Few did more than goalkeeper Roslan Jamaluddin to propel
the Malaysian men's field hockey team into the final.
	   The last round was a disappointment, with Australia trouncing
Malaysia 4-0. But on the way to the silver, the long-haired Roslan
denied team after team what seemed like certain goals.
	   In the semifinal round, favored India had eight penalty corners
but couldn't get the ball past Roslan.
	   ___
	   WEIGHTLIFTING: There are only 7,000 people on the Pacific island
of Nauru, and one of them is among the strongest men in the world.
	   Marcus Stephen won three gold medals, lifting 292.5 kilograms,
or nearly five times his body weight.
	   Stephen is a hero in his homeland, where a national holiday has
been named after him.
	   ___
	   THE WALK: Craig Barrett of New Zealand was out in front, less
than a kilometer from winning the 50-kilometer walk by a
comfortable margin. Then dehydration set in.
	   He staggered, wobbled, crouched down and picked up the pace. He
fell down, and kept on walking. Finally, he fell again and this
time he was taken to hospital in ambulance. Barrett recovered after
being hooked to a fluid drip.
	   `I was expecting people would perceive this a failure, rather
than a courageous effort so it's been very nice that people have
shown support,'' he said.
	   ___
	   BOXING: Judges ordered English boxer Audley Harrison to wear new
gloves for his bout and they were too tight.
	   A miffed Harrison vented his anger in the ring _ a powerful left
that floored his opponent, Michael Macaque of Mauritius just 65
seconds into the fight.
	   The super heavyweight title was Harrison's, but he wants more
out of his boxing career.
	   ``I am in it for fame and glory. I want to be a household
name,'' he said.
	   ___
	   GYMNASTICS: She began dancing ballet at age four. At age nine
she switched to rhythmic gymnastics because she was too tall for a
dancer and when she fell it hurt.
	   The years of pain finally became worth it Monday for Canadian
Erika-Leigh Stirton when she won her fifth gold medal on the floor
with her dances and prances with the rope, a hoop, the clubs and a
ribbon.
	   On Sunday, the 1.67 meter (5ft 5-1/2in) girl had won the
individual all-round title.
	   Her five golds equaled that of Australia's Kasumi Takahashi who
won the hoop, ball, clubs, ribbon and individual all-around titles
at the 1994 Commonwealth Games in Victoria.
	   ``To be frank, I did not expect to do well here,'' said the
18-year-old high-school student.
	   ___
	   CRICKET: Until the end Steve Waugh remained unbeaten. The
Australian captain piled up 215 runs from four innings and not once
could any bowler get him out.
	   His innings became more and more valuable as Australia advanced
in the round robin league. With a 100 against India, Waugh led
Australia's victory in the semifinal. In the final he made 90 to
rescue his side from 58 for 4 to 183 all out.
	   But the heroic effort went unrewarded as South Africa defeated
Australia by four wickets.
	   ___
	   RUGBY: Jonah Lomu, the world's most recognizable rugby player,
has endured a horrid couple of years. But the 1995 World Cup star's
long-term kidney illness and subsequent loss of form were forgotten
when he joined his teammates in a victory ``haka'' after the rugby
sevens final.
	   New Zealand's test side had just completed a worst ever losing
streak of five games before the games.
	   Lomu set up two tries and made a couple of crucial tackles as
the Kiwis beat world champion Fiji in the final. The man nicknamed
the whale was in tears after the game.
	   ``Words can't explain it. It's a once in a lifetime opportunity
that we got,'' Lomu said after collecting his medal before 20,000
cheering fans, most of them Malaysian.

Singapore, British navies to conduct joint exercise
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The navies of Singapore and Britain will engage
in a series of training activities from Sept. 21 to Sept. 24,
Singapore's Defense Ministry said Monday in a statement.
	   Supported by Singapore military jets, four Singapore ships and a
British frigate will conduct anti-air, anti-surface and
anti-submarine naval maneuvers in the South China Sea.
	   The training exercise is aimed at enhancing the cooperation
between the two navies, the ministry said. Singapore and Britain
are part of the Five Power Defense Arrangement, which also includes
Australia, New Zealand and Malaysia.
	   The exercise coincides with increased tensions in neighboring
Malaysia, where thousands protested following the arrest of the
ousted deputy premier, a popular opposition figure.
	   Citing border tensions with Singapore, Malaysia last month
canceled its participation in a regional FPDA exercise scheduled
for October.

Australian Stock Exchange to become one of world's few listed
</HEADLINE>
bourses &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ The Australian Stock Exchange Monday
said it will issue 100 million shares to its 606 members, making it
only the second publicly listed exchange in the world.
	   Current members will each receive 166,000 shares in a company
called Australian Stock Exchange Ltd. The shares will begin trading
on Oct. 14.
	   The Exchange has promoted going public as the best structure to
face globalization of financial markets, cross-border competition
for listings and the growing cost of technology.
	   Although no firm value has been put on the shares ahead of the
listing, stockbrokers estimate the parcels are worth between
Australian dollars 300,000 (U.S. dlrs 177,000) and Australian
dollars 500,000 (U.S. dlrs 295,000) _ implying the whole company
could be worth up to Australian dollars 300 million (U.S. dlrs 177
million).
	   According to media reports, the shares are valued around
Australian dollars 3 (U.S. dlrs 1.77) each, implying a value of
around Australian 500,000 (U.S. dlrs 295,000) for the share
parcels.
	   In its annual report, released Monday, the Exchange said its
operating surplus after tax rose to Australian dollars 16.7 million
(U.S. dlrs 9.8 million) in the year to June 30, from Australian
dollars 15.7 million (U.S. dlrs 9.2 million) a year earlier.
	   The only other publicly traded bourse is Sweden's stock exchange
in Stockholm.

American Norwood loses WBA featherweight title due to weight
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ American champion Freddy Norwood lost his World
Boxing Association featherweight crown Monday after being found too
heavy during the weigh-in before a title match against Koji
Matsumoto of Japan.
	   A 12-round title bout, however, will be held as scheduled at the
3,500-seat Yoyogi national gymnasium annex Tuesday night.
	   If Japanese challenger Matsumoto wins, he will become the new
champion. If Matsumoto loses, or draws, the title will become
vacant.
	   The 28-year-old Norwood weighed 57.9 kilograms (127 3/4 pounds)
in the first weigh-in at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT), 800 grams (28.22
ounces) over the limit of 57.1 kilograms (126 pounds) for the
featherweight category, said Kazuhiro Miyazaki, a spokesman of the
Japan Boxing Commission.
	   Norwood was requested to reduce his weight down to the limit
within two hours, but he failed to do so. That cost him the title,
Miyazaki said.
	   Matsumoto, WBA's No. 12 featherweight contender, weighed in at
the limit 57.1 kilograms in the first try.
	   Norwood won the title from Antonio Cermeno of Venezuela on April
3, 1998, and has defended it twice.

Leading liberal lawmaker hospitalized with heart attack
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal lawmaker,
has been hospitalized following a heart attack, but his life wasn't
in danger, officials said Monday.
	   Yavlinsky, 46, suffered a heart attack Friday and has remained
in a hospital since then, said his spokeswoman Yevgenia Dillendorf.
	   Doctors said he was in stable condition and may be discharged
within the next three days, she said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Dillendorf refused to say where Yavlinsky was staying or provide
additional details.
	   Yavlinsky finished fourth in the 1996 presidential elections and
said he would run again in 2000.
	   He currently heads the liberal Yabloko faction in the Russian
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.

Launch of U.S. satellite postponed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The space launch of an American communications
satellite aboard a Russian rocket has been delayed until at least
next year because of technical problems, a news agency reported
Monday.
	   The commercial launch of the Telesat Communications satellite
from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakstan, using a Russian Proton
rocket, was scheduled for this week, the ITAR-Tass news agency
said.
	   Lockheed Martin, the U.S. maker of Telesat, decided to postpone
the launch because of ``serious defects'' in the satellite,
ITAR-Tass said. The satellite was returned to the United States for
repairs on Friday.
	   The launch was to be carried out by International Launch
Services, a partnership between Lockheed Martin and the Russian
Khrunichev company.
	   A spokesman for Khrunichev said the Proton rocket ``was fully
prepared for launching,'' and would be used instead to send another
American communications satellite into orbit on Oct. 14.
	   Konstantin Lantratov said a new Proton booster rocket would be
built to carry the Telesat satellite into space, probably in
February.
	   Earlier this month, Russia's launch of 12 U.S. commercial
satellites failed shortly after takeoff from Baikonur, destroying
the cargo.
	   Russia's space agency rents the cosmodrome from the former
Soviet republic of Kazakstan and uses it for commercial rocket
launchings as well as for sending cosmonauts to the Mir space
station.

Top-seed Francisco Clavet wins dlrs 350,000 Romanian Open
</HEADLINE>
tournament

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Top-seeded Francisco Clavet of Spain
on Monday showed superior concentration and experience as he
defeated France's unseeded Arnaud Di Pasquale to win the dlrs
350,000 Romanian Open tennis tournament.
	   It took Clavet 125 minutes to finish off Di Pasquale 6-4, 2-6,
7-5 and to win dlrs 45,000 and 150 ATP points to move up seven
places and become the world's 24th ranked player.
	   In the first set, the pair played long rallies on a slow wet
clay court at Progresul Arena. In the end, left-handed Clavet
managed a break and took the first set 6-4.
	   In the second set, Di Pasquale replied with a powerful service
and strong backhands and won two games on Clavet's service to win
the second set 6-2.
	   But the Spaniard came back in the final set, leading 4-1, before
Di Pasquale broke his game and evened the score 4-4. Then the
Frenchman lost his concentration and made some unforced mistakes,
finally losing 7-5.
	   ``In every match during this tournament I was so close to lose
but I won. Today I was so close to win but I lost'', said Di
Pasquale after the match. He won 108 ATP points and a check of dlrs
26,000.
	   The finals were postponed Sunday due to heavy rain.
	   In the doubles finals also on Monday, Romanians Andrei Pavel and
Gabriel Trifu upset their countrymen George Cosac and Dinu Pescariu
7-6 (7-2), 4-6, 7-6 (7-4)er a 141-minute match.

Myanmar releases 101 Thai prisoners in goodwill gesture

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ It was a gift from one country's top
general to another, delivered by Hercules military transport plane.
	   Myanmar sent 101 Thai prison inmates home on Monday in a
goodwill gesture between neighboring nations with a long history of
mistrust and prickly relations.
	   The release of the jailed fishermen and loggers who had entered
Myanmar territory was granted by Gen. Khin Nyunt, Myanmar's
military intelligence chief, as a final token of appreciation to
Gen. Chetta Thanajaro, who will soon retire as Thai army commander
in chief.
	   Much of the world has condemned the military government of
Myanmar, also known as Burma, for rampant human rights abuses,
suppressing the country's democracy movement and allegedly failing
to stop drug trafficking.
	   But Gen. Chetta has strived to keep relations warm with his
counterparts across Thailand's western border.
	   Expected to enter politics after retiring later this year,
Chetta greeted 61 of the freed Thais as they arrived on the C-130
cargo plane at a military air base in Bangkok. He urged them to
become productive citizens.
	   Forty others held in a provincial prison were sent over land
back to northern Thailand.
	   The prisoners, dressed in white shirts and black trousers,
marched somberly off the plane, each carrying a Thai flag and large
framed portraits of Thailand's king and queen.
	   Then they kneeled in formation on the tarmac, raised their hands
over their heads and lowered their faces to the ground in respect
to the royal family and the general.
	   About 200 family members were on hand to greet the former
prisoners. Many broke down and cried, but not all were tears of
joy.
	   ``I have been waiting for five years. What am I going to do,''
screamed Boonom Senapak as she sobbed wildly and clutched her two
young children.
	   She had seen her husband's name on a roster of all Thai
prisoners, but mistook the list for those who were being granted
amnesty, said a Thai official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Noo-nguen Pangchong, 19, the only female prisoner, returned home
with mixed feelings. Her husband, a Myanmar national who was jailed
for trafficking illegal workers from Myanmar to Thailand, still has
one year left on his prison term.
	   ``I was allowed to see him briefly about a month ago. I'm not
sure if he knows I've been released,'' said Noo-nguen.
	   Wej Kongnuan, a 25-year old who had already served over six
years of his seven-year sentence for illegal entry, said conditions
at Insein Prison in Yangon were difficult.
	   The diet consisted mainly of beans, rice and vegetables twice a
day.
	   ``They gave us a piece of meat or one egg once a week,'' Wej
said.
	   The Thais were not kept, however, with hard core criminals or
political prisoners. The military government frequently sends
democracy activists and student protesters to Insein.
	   Former prisoners and human rights groups have reported the
political detainees are frequently tortured.
	   One Thai prisoner, who spoke only condition of anonymity, said
he did see student prisoners being brought to meet visiting
relatives, and that they were forced to wear bags over their heads.
	   About 12 journalists from Bangkok were allowed to accompany Thai
officials on the flight to Yangon to pick up the prisoners.
	   The reporters were not allowed to leave the airport, and
military intelligence officers followed them closely while they
were there.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Shaken by government clampdowns
and the arrests of their leader and fellow activists, pro-reform
campaigners in Malaysia pondered their next move.
	   As pro-democracy protests and scuffles with police spread
through the capital, so did fears of darker days, following the
arrest of Anwar Ibrahim and growing numbers of his supporters.
	   ``There is no plan. We don't know yet where to go,'' said the
young man who had organized volunteers outside Anwar's house to
spread the word of rallies and protests.
	   On Monday, he was afraid to be quoted by name, as report after
report came in of new arrests.
	   The biggest-ever outpouring of dissent during Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year-rule, lead by his
deputy-turned-opponent, seemed to be dissipating under the force of
water cannon, tear gas and laws that allow summary arrest without
charge.
	   ``We fear that at the throes of his political death, Mahathir
would resort to the use of the Internal Security Act to carry out
mass arrests or even to declare yet another emergency,'' said Syed
Husin, president of the opposition Malaysian People's Party.
	   Anwar's wife, designated by him as the leader of the reform
movement in anticipation of his arrest, on Monday evening canceled
the nightly news conference that he had used to spread his message
to the rest of the world and generate local support.
	   She was exhausted after a futile day of waiting at the
courthouse for Anwar to be brought in for arraignment, following a
sleepless night after police wearing ski masks broke down her door
to take away her husband.
	   ``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by ordering the police to act like
gangsters he will frighten the people from supporting this
reformation movement, he is dreaming,'' she said as she left the
court for home. ``He has become a political desperado who is
willing to suppress his own people just to keep power.''
	   What Azizah does and says over the next few days may be key to
whether the reform movement continues.
	   ``If Anwar's wife wants to do it, it would be very difficult for
the government to arrest her or attack her,'' said Bruce Gale, a
commentator from Political and Economic Risk Consultancy in
Singapore.
	   Despite its economy sinking into a recession, frustrations
haven't mounted to the levels in Indonesia, where people rioted
spontaneously during protests that led to the downfall of President
Suharto in May.
	   ``No, it's going to take a hell of a lot more sacrifice for this
to go anywhere. You don't have empty stomachs here like in
Indonesia, where the empty stomachs caused the revolution,'' Rajesh
Patel, an attorney.
	   At Anwar's house, the riot police were gone and the shards of
broken windows had been cleared up after Sunday's arrest. But
helicopters darting through the skies of Kuala Lumpur reminded city
residents of the 72-year-old Mahathir's grip on power.
	   ``He has descended to the use of the instruments of state power
to curb popular democracy,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, a professor of
political science at the University of Malaya.
	   Sitting in Anwar's house along with a clutch of other
supporters, Chandra said he feared for his own future. ``The next
arrest may be of yours truly,'' he said grimly.
	   There were plenty of arrests Monday, many on the streets as
police chased Anwar supporters down side roads around the
courthouse.
	   The head of the ruling party's youth movement, Ahmad Zahid
Hamidi, was detained under the same law as Anwar. Other members of
Mahathir's party were being investigated. Anyone who had let Anwar
use their house for a speech or visited him was suspect.
	   Ahmad Azam Abdul Rahman, president of the Muslim Youth Movement
of Malaysia, a group Anwar had started before joining Mahathir's
party, was arrested with three party executives at the group's
headquarters. Police gave no reason. Before Anwar's arrest, his
adopted brother, two former private secretaries and two friends
were arrested.
	   ``Without Anwar's organizing skills, without his charisma, the
Malays, particularly the Malay youth, have found themselves without
a leader,'' said Gale of Political Risk Consultancy. ``There might
be a few noisy protests, but the movement for reforms has lost
momentum.''

KLA reportedly detain nine ethnic Albanian politicians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Ethnic Albanian rebels fighting Serb
security forces have detained nine ethnic Albanian politicians,
most of whom are close to pacifist leader Ibrahim Rugova, a
newspaper reported Monday.
	   Ethnic Albanian newspaper Bujku said the nine were captured by
KLA forces Sunday afternoon after they traveled to the central
Drenica region to visit refugees there. The daily gave no
explanation for the move and there was no KLA confirmation or
denial.
	   All but one of the nine politicians are close to or members of
Rugova's Democratic League of Kosovo.
	   The KLA who are fighting Serbia for independence of Kosovo, have
been highly critical of Rugova's policies accusing him of betraying
Albanian national goals. Rugova has indicated he was ready to
accept a peace deal that falls short of independence from Serbia.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in present
Yugoslavia. It is over 90 percent ethnic Albanian but is ruled by
Serbia which abolished its broad autonomy in 1989.

Police official discuss cooperation against car smuggling and
</HEADLINE>
insurance fraud

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Police from 24 countries and two
international organizations convened in Bulgaria's capital Monday
to discuss joint action against a surge in car thefts, smuggling
and insurance fraud after the end of the Cold War.
	   ``The movement of stolen vehicles became a serious problem ...
after the changes in central and eastern Europe,'' said Interpol
General Secretary Raymond Kendall told participants in the meeting.
	   ``The integration of criminal structures in Europe proved to be
much easier than the integration of states,'' said Bulgaria's
Interior Minister Bogomil Bonev referring to international criminal
groups running international smuggling routes for cars stolen in
the West.
	   Interpol head office in Lyon, France, has registered more than 1
million car thefts so far, Kendall said.
	   ``Some 30-35 percent of those vehicles are subject of contraband
and illegal deals,'' said Kiril Radev, head of Bulgaria's police
unit dealing with organized crime.
	   Kendall said that in the past couple of years, car thefts have
decreased because producers sophisticated security equipment and
police forces in different countries improved their cooperation.
	   But he added that the effect was expected to be undone by a rise
in insurance frauds, where car-owners allow their vehicles to be
stolen and smuggled in order to be paid the insurance. Kendall
wouldn't quote any specific figures.
	   Western cars were smuggled to Bulgaria most often through the
Czech Republic, Croatia and Bosnia and were either locally sold or
smuggled further to Greece, Macedonia and Albania or to former
Soviet republics and the Middle East, Radev said.
	   He added that illegal workshops where car identity numbers and
papers are forged exist in all countries which lie on contraband
routes.
	   ``Organized criminal groups dispose with very good technical and
communication equipment,'' Radev said. ``They step up efforts too
penetrate different levels of public administration.''
	   Only in the first half of this year Bulgaria has arrested 128
suspects in breaking three international car-smuggling channels,
Radev said.
	   In the largest single seizure in August police impounded 20
luxury vehicles stolen in Canada and intended for local sale or
re-export after being shipped in containers via Greece.
	   Car thefts in Bulgaria itself have fallen to 8,443 last year
from 18,952 in 1994, reflecting new legislation against organized
crime that grew rampant after the fall of communism in 1989.
	   Bulgaria's government has refused to issue licenses to six
insurance companies suspected in unofficially employing racketeer
groups which blackmail car-owners buy their insurance.
	   Bonev said some of those companies were suspected of amassing
their initial capital by trafficking stolen cars from Italy to the
Middle East via Bulgaria. He wouldn't name the suspects.
	   In other steps against car theft Bulgaria has joined Interpol
database enabling it to check the origin of all imported vehicles.
The Balkan country has opened four x-ray laboratories to identify
forged engine and chassis numbers and introduced government
licensing of spare-part dealers.

Poor grain harvest means imports for Russia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will be forced to import grain from abroad
this year because of what's expected to be its worst harvest in 41
years, an agricultural official said Monday.
	   Oleg Temashov, a spokesman for the Agriculture Ministry, told
the ITAR-Tass news agency that Russia will harvest only 56 million
metric tons of grain, the lowest since the 54.9 million-ton harvest
of 1957.
	   He said because of a severe drought that hit 40 grain-growing
regions, Russia will have to make ``small purchases'' of grain from
abroad this year, about 2 million metric tons.
	   That, combined with a 20 million-ton surplus from last year's
bumper crop of 88.5 million tons, will be enough to meet the
country's food and fodder production needs, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Agriculture officials had been predicting a poor harvest this
year, but just last month said they had hoped to bring in at least
62 to 67 million tons.
	   A drought during the summer growing season, followed by a cold,
wet harvest season have been the main culprits, according to
ministry officials. In addition, they said Russia's economic crisis
aggravated the shortage of harvesting machines, fuel and
lubricants.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal lawmaker,
has been hospitalized following a heart attack, but his life wasn't
in danger, officials said Monday.
	   Yavlinsky, 46, suffered a heart attack Friday and has remained
in a hospital since then, said his spokeswoman Yevgenia Dillendorf.
	   Doctors said he was in stable condition and may be discharged
within the next three days, she said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   Russian media said Yavlinky had what appeared to be a mild heart
attack during a television questions-and-answers show late Friday,
but he continued answering viewers' questions until the program
ended some 20 minutes later. He then went directly to a hospital.
	   Dillendorf refused to say where Yavlinsky was staying or provide
additional details.
	   Yavlinsky finished fourth in the 1996 presidential elections and
said he would run again in 2000.
	   He currently heads the liberal Yabloko faction in the Russian
parliament's lower house, the State Duma.

Wing's Russian players despair over fate of their homeland
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ The Detroit Red Wings' Russian players despair
over conditions in their homeland and worry about families who
still live there.
	   ``I feel like there is no hope,'' said forward Igor Larionov
said. ``I am really concerned because it is my country and they are
good people.
	   The Russian economy has been crumbling over the past month as
the currency was devalued, inflation soared, and the country
defaulted on its loans.
	   Russia's Central Bank has printed almost dlrs 66 million in new
rubles and issued short-term credits to get cash flowing through
its frozen banking system. The government's biggest fear at present
is that Russia's shaky commercial banks will collapse.
	   The virtual shutdown of the country's banks meant a moratorium
on payments ranging from salaries to the purchase of goods and
services, and left depositors cut off from their savings.
	   ``Now I see graveyards where people cannot afford tombstones,''
Larionov told the Detroit Free Press for an article published
Monday. ``People are having a tough time knowing how to survive the
winter.
	   ``It's very, very disappointing because Russia is the richest
country in the world in natural resources _ oil, gas, nickel, coal,
forest. Everything we have, but we are crying for help. It is a
humiliation.''
	   Larionov has not lived in Russia for 10 years but visits every
summer. He has family in a town about 60 miles outside Moscow, and
spent 10 days there in August.
	   Fellow Red Wings forward Vyacheslav Kozlov said even food is in
short supply.
	   ``My family put in the garage lots of potatoes, salted cabbage,
pickles, tomatoes. So I think they will be OK for another couple of
months,'' he said.
	   ``The problem is there is nothing you can buy in the stores
right now. As soon as the ruble fell, everybody went to the stores
to buy lot of salt, lot of sugar,'' Kozlov said.
	   ``My mom, she had birthday Sept. 7 _ 50 years old, it's a big
deal _ and she can't buy the bread or the butter. She invite some
people to the house, but there is no bread.''
	   Vyacheslav Fetisov, who now is an assistant coach with the New
Jersey Devils, recently visited his father, Alexander, in Moscow.
	   ``I'm very sad about what's going on,'' said Fetisov, who fought
a legal battle to be released from the Central Red Army team so he
could play in the National Hockey League, where he began his career
in the 1989-90 season.
	   ``It's not the people's fault, but they are paying the price.
People expected something from democracy. I guess we were wrong.''

Cambodian leaders prepare for top-level negotiations

 &UR; Eds: AMs; RECASTS and UPDATES with Hun Sen's visit to
fortuneteller; trims &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen,
preparing for a summit meeting with rival political parties, was
assured by a fortune-telling monk Monday that he would prevail.
	   Hun Sen arrived in this northwestern city a day ahead of his
scheduled meeting with opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy. They will hold a meeting led by King Norodom
Sihanouk which is meant to end Cambodia's post-election political
deadlock and pave the way for the formation of a new government.
	   The party leaders will try to ease tensions that erupted into
violence when police suppressed street protests against Hun Sen's
victory in the July parliamentary elections. The opposition claims
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party used fraud and intimidation to
win the polls.
	   Late Monday afternoon, Hun Sen and senior members of his party
went to pray at a Buddhist temple located in the famous
12th-century Angkor Wat temple complex, where the Cambodian leader
had his fortune told by 70-year-old monk Ngonh Kruouch.
	   Reading from a scripture written in the holy language Pali, the
monk told Hun Sen that ``In search of fortune, you will succeed as
you wish'' in his upcoming activities. He also predicted personal
good fortune for Hun Sen and his family.
	   Hun Sen's party won a slight majority in July 26 elections, but
not the two-thirds required to form a government on its own.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh of the royalist FUNCINPEC party and his
opposition ally Sam Rainsy had threatened to boycott parliament,
effectively preventing the formation of a government. However, they
agreed last week to attend the parliament's opening session after
violent confrontations in the capital threatened to get out of
control.
	   The Tuesday meeting will mark the first face-to-face encounter
between Hun Sen and Ranariddh since Hun Sen ousted the prince as
his co-premier in a coup d'etat in July last year.
	   King Sihanouk, who must personally convene parliament, has
called for all elected members of parliament to gather in Siem Reap
Thursday and, if there are no hitches, be sworn in at Angkor Wat
temple, which is just outside of town.
	   Khieu Kanharith, a spokesman for Hun Sen's party, suggested
Monday that Hun Sen would then push for a two-party coalition
government with Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC that would shut out Sam
Rainsy _ a bitter foe of Hun Sen.
	   He said that whether FUNCINPEC could hold any of five important
ministerial positions was a matter still open to negotiation,
reversing a stand taken by Hun Sen soon after the elections.
	   Hun Sen's job as prime minister and the chairmanship of the
National Assembly, held by Chea Sim, secretary general of Hun Sen's
party, were not negotiable, he said.
	   There is no public agenda for the summit talks with the king,
but they are expected to cover the main technical complaints the
opposition has about the elections, and a travel ban the government
has imposed on opposition members of parliament.

Britain gives more aid to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain announced Monday that it will send another
2 million pounds (dlrs 3.36 million) in humanitarian aid to the
troubled Serbian province of Kosovo.
	   The cash injection brings to 4.5 million pounds (dlrs 7.6
million) the amount the government's Department for International
Development has contributed to the war-torn area since June.
	   ``With the harsh Balkan winter coming in a few weeks, the
already appalling conditions of those displaced by the fighting in
Kosovo are going to get very much worse,'' said International
Development Secretary Clare Short.
	   ``We are acting swiftly to provide basic accommodation and
emergency relief to the quarter of a million refugees in the
area.''
	   The money also will be used to educate local children and to
protect human rights, Short said.
	   At least 600 people have died and upward of 275,000 have fled
their homes since February, when Serbian police launched a
crackdown on Albanian guerillas from the Kosovo Liberation Army,
which seeks to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the dominant
Yugoslav republic.

Corruption complaints rise against civil servants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's top anti-graft agency said Monday
that it received 743 complaints in the first six months of the year
about possible corruption among civil servants, up 22 percent from
the same period in 1997.
	   But the Hong Kong Independent Commission against Corruption
cautioned that the rise in complaints doesn't necessarily signify a
sharp increase in corruption among government workers.
	   ``Not all corruption complaints contain sufficient evidence for
further action,'' it said.
	   The commission completed prosecution of 10 corruption cases in
the civil service in the first half of this year, compared with 40
prosecutions in all of 1997.
	   The commission, set up in 1974 to combat corruption then rampant
in Hong Kong, has sweeping powers of arrest and seizure.

American Norwood loses WBA featherweight title due to weight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to change slug

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ American champion Freddy Norwood lost his World
Boxing Association featherweight crown Monday after being found too
heavy during the weigh-in before a title match against Koji
Matsumoto of Japan.
	   A 12-round title bout, however, will be held as scheduled at the
3,500-seat Yoyogi national gymnasium annex Tuesday night.
	   If Japanese challenger Matsumoto wins, he will become the new
champion. If Matsumoto loses, or draws, the title will become
vacant.
	   The 28-year-old Norwood weighed 57.9 kilograms (127 3/4 pounds)
in the first weigh-in at 4 p.m. (0700 GMT), 800 grams (28.22
ounces) over the limit of 57.1 kilograms (126 pounds) for the
featherweight category, said Kazuhiro Miyazaki, a spokesman of the
Japan Boxing Commission.
	   Norwood was requested to reduce his weight down to the limit
within two hours, but he failed to do so. That cost him the title,
Miyazaki said.
	   Matsumoto, WBA's No. 12 featherweight contender, weighed in at
the limit 57.1 kilograms in the first try.
	   Norwood won the title from Antonio Cermeno of Venezuela on April
3, 1998, and has defended it twice.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's future is bright despite
its current economic woes, the visiting head of Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said Monday.
	   ``Indonesia is facing difficulties right now. But the economic
future of Indonesia is very promising as the country is richly
bestowed with natural resources and the government is
enthusiastically involved in political and economic reform,'' Kaoru
Yosano told reporters.
	   Yosano also said stability in Indonesia remains crucial to that
of the whole region.
	   He was speaking after meeting President B.J. Habibie and senior
economics minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita as well as Trade and
Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan.
	   Indonesia is currently enduring its worst economic crisis in 30
years.
	   Japan is among many foreign donor countries to contribute aid to
Indonesia, which is pursuing economic reform under an rescue plan
put together by the International Monetary Fund.
	   Despite the reforms, high food prices and mass unemployment have
fueled protests and sporadic rioting in recent weeks.

	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A press group decided Monday to move
forward with a proposal to establish an international code of
ethics for journalists and an international media council to deal
with press-related complaints.
	   At a briefing ending a three-day conference of journalists and
media experts from around the world, the organizer, the World
Association of Press Councils, said two working committees would
work on the possibility of writing up an ethics code and a body to
see that it is respected.
	   A third committee is charged with drafting a model for
independent press councils. Press councils, some 30 of which exist
in the world, are organizations that rule on complaints from and
against the press.
	   The committee working on the possible creation of this body will
advise on the ``feasibility of establishing, financing and
attracting wide media and especially public support for a voluntary
mechanism for the mediation and resolution of transnational
complaints,'' said David Flint, chairman of the world association,
who will also lead this working group. The committee will include
the president of the Turkish Press Council and a former executive
of the Egyptian Press Council.
	   ``Who wants this? And in whose interests is it? Certainly not
the press freedom organizations or the representatives of the
industry,'' Ronald Koven, European representative of the World
Press Freedom Committe, said after the announcement.
	   Koven, and other industry groups including the American Society
of Newspaper Editors, believe that such a mechanism could be used
by those opposed to press freedom to restrict journalists.
	   The writing up of an international code of ethics for
journalists also divided delegates at the conference. Claude Moisy,
president of UNESCO's Advisory Group on Press Freedom, said a code
for journalists would be wrong in principle, impossible to
formulate and impossible to enforce.
	   Established in New Delhi in 1992, the World Association of Press
Councils gathers 16 news councils in various countries to deal with
local complaints about the news media.
	   The working committees are scheduled to submit their conclusions
at a regional conference in Brisbane, Australia, in June.

Myanmar government arrests 29 more democrats: total now 882
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar's military government has
arrested 29 more members of Aung San Suu Kyi's political party,
bringing the total number of arrested activists to 882, the party
said Monday.
	   The mass arrests, which began in May and intensified in
September to prevent a planned meeting of the People's Assembly,
the country's elected parliament, constitute the largest clampdown
against the opposition since the early 1990s.
	   Among the arrested democrats are 196 members of parliament, 686
organizational workers for Suu Kyi's party and members of parties
representing the country's ethnic groups.
	   Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy, won 82
percent of the seats in parliament in a 1990 election. Despite
promising before the polls to hand over power to the winners, the
military has refused to let the People's Assembly meet.
	   Myanmar, also known as Burma, was a fractious parliamentary
democracy after gaining independence from Britain in 1948. In 1962,
Gen. Ne Win seized power in a coup d'etat. The country has been
ruled by the military in various forms ever since.
	   Suu Kyi is the daughter of the country's independence hero, Gen.
Aung San, who helped establish parliamentary democracy. She won the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 while under six years of house arrest for
attempting to reestablish democracy in her troubled homeland.
	   Suu Kyi and nine colleagues announced last week that they would
function as the country's parliament as long as the lawmakers were
under arrest.
	   The move is purely symbolic as the military is firmly in control
of all the levers of power in Myanmar.
	   The military has warned the NLD that any attempt to convene
parliament would be illegal and said a new constitution, being
drafted by a military-controlled convention, must first be in
place.
	   The NLD has countered that no such stipulation was made when the
election was held.
	   Also on Monday, a Buddhist monks group said that repression
against the clergy by the military government was escalating, with
at least 16 arrested for taking part in peaceful demonstrations.
	   ``As a consequence of the suppression, demonstrations by the
Buddhist monks across the country have been taking place,'' the All
Burma Young Monks Union in a statement faxed to The Associated
Press in Bangkok.
	   Several monks were gunned down along with thousands of people
protesting for democracy and against military rule in a failed
nationwide uprising in 1988.
	   The government has denied such actions have taken place, saying
it is impossible because they are devout Buddhists.

Press freedom group demands release of jailed Chinese reporter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ An international press freedom group appealed to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Monday to release a jailed
journalist, calling her imprisonment a blot on China's reputation.
	   The World Association of Newspapers urged Jiang in a letter to
release Gao Yu before Oct. 1, the 49th anniversary of the communist
victory and the end of Gao's fifth year in prison.
	   The letter urged Jiang to follow the examples of Nigeria and
Vietnam, both of which released imprisoned journalists earlier this
year.
	   ``The continued imprisonment of Gao Yu remains a clear blemish
on the international standing of China,'' the letter said.
	   A former deputy editor of a now-defunct economics weekly, Gao
was arrested Oct. 2, 1993. She was tried in secret and sentenced to
six years in prison for leaking state secrets, apparently for
writing about Communist Party politics for a Hong Kong magazine.
	   The government has never revealed the contents of the documents
she supposedly leaked. Gao maintained her innocence throughout the
trial and her unsuccessful appeal.
	   The Paris-based World Association of Newspapers honored Gao and
drew attention to her imprisonment by giving her its Golden Pen of
Freedom award in 1995. She also won UNESCO's annual press freedom
award last year, a move which embarrassed and angered Beijing.

U.N. says it has speeded up the delivery of medicines to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The United Nations has significantly
accelerated the delivery of medicines and medical supplies to Iraq,
U.N. officials said Monday.
	   The first batch of health care items ordered under the current
phase of the oil-for-food program arrived on Sept. 19, said Eric
Falt, a spokesman for Humanitarian Coordinator Dennis Halliday.
	   The phase began in June _ a three-month delay between ordering
and delivery. In the first phase, which began in December 1996, it
was six months before the initial batch of health care supplies
arrived.
	   ``Given the complexity of the process, this shows a significant
speed-up in delivering items in the health sector,'' Halliday said.
	   Iraq has received dlrs 366 million worth of medicines and
medical supplies since the oil-for-food program began, Falt said.
	   The program allows Iraq to bypass the sweeping sanctions imposed
after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait and sell limited quantities of
oil. The proceeds are used to buy food and humanitarian supplies
for Iraq's citizens.
	   The shipment which arrived Saturday was part of an order for
medicines, vitamins and medical supplies from a Malaysian company.
	   Iraq has complained repeatedly that the slow process of
approving contracts by a U.N. committee in New York and delivering
the goods have caused death among citizens suffering severe
illnesses and malnutrition.
	   The United Nations has recently taken steps to streamline
procedures for the approval of contracts and delivery of shipments.

Socialist Party pillories Starr, says investigation hurts America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's Socialist Party on Monday said that
Kenneth Starr is an ``unsavory figure'' obsessed with sex and that
the real victim of his investigation is not the American president
but America itself.
	   ``This is the Lewinsky soap opera now adapted for television,''
said Frederique Bredin, party national secretary, referring to the
videotape of President Clinton's grand jury testimony.
	   She made her comments during a weekly press briefing for the
party of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. She spoke hours before the
videotape was being released.
	   Bredin described Starr, the independent prosecutor, as an
``unsavory figure and sexually obsessed'' for his determination to
pursue the investigation of Clinton and his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
	   ``This is a great humiliation for Bill Clinton. But in reality,
when the conservatives want to weaken Mr. Clinton, they're missing
the mark because the victim is democracy. It is America and the
United States which are weakened and humiliated.''
	   Bredin's remarks were the most outspoken public comments yet on
the matter in France, whose press has provided roundly negative
views of the matter.
	   The privacy of public figures is honored in France by an
unspoken code of silence. Former President Mitterrand's
out-of-wedlock daughter became a public fact only with his
acquiescence.
	   Monday's left-leaning newspaper Liberation carried a cartoon
showing Clinton bound in ropes and strung upside down on a hook
with Starr holding a microphone to his mouth.
	   ``The leader of the free world speaks,'' said the Starr figure.
	   ``Hi there, I sinned,'' says Clinton.

Cambodian leaders prepare for top-level negotiations

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Chea Sim's party position to president in penultimate

	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian strongman Hun Sen,
preparing for a summit meeting with leaders of rival political
parties, was assured by a fortune-telling monk Monday that he would
prevail.
	   Hun Sen arrived in this northwestern city a day ahead of his
scheduled meeting with opposition leaders Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy. They will hold a meeting led by King Norodom
Sihanouk that is meant to end Cambodia's post-election political
deadlock and pave the way for the formation of a new government.
	   The party leaders will try to ease tensions that erupted into
violence when police suppressed street protests against Hun Sen's
victory in the July parliamentary elections. The opposition claims
Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party used fraud and intimidation to
win the polls.
	   Late Monday afternoon, Hun Sen and senior members of his party
went to pray at a Buddhist temple located in the famous
12th-century Angkor Wat temple complex, where the Cambodian leader
had his fortune told by 70-year-old monk Ngonh Kruoch.
	   Reading from a scripture written in the holy language Pali, the
monk told Hun Sen: ``In search of fortune, you will succeed as you
wish.'' He also predicted personal good fortune for Hun Sen and his
family.
	   Hun Sen's party won a slight majority in July 26 elections, but
not the two-thirds required to form a government on its own.
	   Prince Norodom Ranariddh of the royalist FUNCINPEC party and his
opposition ally Sam Rainsy had threatened to boycott the National
Assembly, Cambodia's parliament, effectively preventing the
formation of a government. However, they agreed last week to attend
the parliament's opening session after violent confrontations in
the capital threatened to get out of control.
	   The Tuesday meeting will mark the first face-to-face encounter
between Hun Sen and Ranariddh since Hun Sen ousted the prince as
his co-premier in a coup d'etat in July last year.
	   King Sihanouk, who must personally convene parliament, has
called for all elected members to gather in Siem Reap Thursday and,
if there are no hitches, be sworn in at Angkor Wat temple, which is
just outside of town.
	   Khieu Kanharith, a spokesman for Hun Sen's party, suggested
Monday that Hun Sen would then push for a two-party coalition
government with Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC that would shut out Sam
Rainsy _ a bitter foe of Hun Sen.
	   He said that whether FUNCINPEC could hold any of five important
ministerial positions was a matter still open to negotiation,
reversing a stand taken by Hun Sen soon after the elections.
	   Hun Sen's job as prime minister and the chairmanship of the
National Assembly, held by Chea Sim, president of Hun Sen's party,
were not negotiable, he said.
	   There is no public agenda for the summit talks with the king,
but they are expected to cover the two main technical complaints
the opposition has about the elections, and a travel ban the
government has imposed on opposition members of parliament.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Three dozen South African
police officers, including arms and demolition experts, entered
neighboring Mozambique Monday to seize weapons caches, officials
said.
	   It was the four such operation since 1995 aimed at stemming the
flow of arms into South Africa. The weapons -- including handguns,
machine guns, rocket launchers, grenades and mines -- are leftovers
of the Mozambican civil war.
	   ``The problem is a lot of these weapons are smuggled into South
Africa and are used for crimes here,'' said police spokesman Col.
Reg Crewe.
	   People who know where the caches are often sell items to arms
traders, he said. More than 300 tons of weapons were destroyed in
the past operations, he said.
	   The officers, working with Mozambican police, were expected to
stay in the country for up to three weeks.

	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ British Airways says it will
increase its London-Cape Town flights from five to six a week.
	   The announcement followed a decision by Britain's Civil Aviation
Authority to award British Airways, over Virgin Atlantic Airways,
the right to operate an additional flight to South Africa.
	   The airline said the extra flight would leave London on Thursday
evenings, and Cape Town on Friday evenings. The new flight was to
start sometime this winter.
	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ Soft drinks giant Coca-Cola has suspended
its operations in Zambia in a dispute with the government over a 25
percent tax on its imported raw materials.
	   The action by Coca-Cola subsidiary Zambia Bottlers could lead to
the permanent closure of its operations and the loss of up to
19,000 jobs in the bottling company and associated suppliers, said
Commerce Minister Enoch Kavindele.
	   He told reporters Sunday he urged the finance ministry to lower
its excise duty to 5 percent and negotiate with Coke to pay a tax
rebate.
	   Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi accused Coca-Cola of
``blackmail.''
	   Coca-Cola consumes one fourth of Zambia's sugar crop, worth 4.4
billion kwacha (dlrs 22 million).
	   It raised its price earlier this month from 500 kwacha (25
cents) a bottle to kwacha 900 (45 cents) to meet the government
tax.
	   --
	   WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) _ Namibian President Sam Nujoma has
lashed out at the European Union in an apparent reaction to a
warning that aid to African countries involved in the Congo would
be scrutinized.
	   Namibia, along with Angola and Zimbabwe, has sent troops to help
Congo President Laurent Kabila fight a rebellion. Rwanda and Uganda
are sympathetic to the rebels.
	   In an impromptu address at the opening of a youth center in
Windhoek on Sunday and widely reported on Monday, Nujoma said
European countries are instigating division in Africa.
	   ``These foolish Europeans. They formed a political union (the
EU) and again they want to get our raw materials without paying
us,'' Nujoma said. ``We cannot allow Africa to be ruled by
foreigners. Africa must be controlled by its African people,''
Nujoma added.
	   The EU's Commissioner for Africa, Joao de Deus Pinheiro, warned
on Friday that aid would be reviewed to ensure that it was not used
to finance the eight-week old war in Congo.
	   Nujoma also lashed out at white commercial farmers, warning that
his government had the power to seize land if such farmers were not
willing to share it with fellow Namibians.
	   At present, about half of Namibia's arable land is owned by
farmers, mostly of German or South African descent, with the
balance owned by the state.
	   Namibia's Constitution precludes seizure of private property
without due compensation.

<SLUG> Three NATO applicants foursquare for Kosovo autonomy </SLUG>


<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The defense ministers of the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland want to see autonomy returned to
Kosovo and called Monday for more international pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The ministers of the three former Warsaw Pact countries, which
are expected to become full-fledged NATO members next year, meet
regularly to coordinate their efforts at NATO and European Union
accession.
	   ``We should have become members long ago,'' said Poland's Janusz
Onyszkiewicz, adding the three plan to table the final documents
jointly in Washington, but did not add a timeframe.
	   Hungary has put off announcing a tender for the purchase of up
to 30 state-of-the-art fighter aircraft due to financial
constraints and the three agreed to set up a work team to
investigate the issue of joint moves on such purchases.
	   Surveying regional problems, the three ministers expressed grave
concern over the conflict in Kosovo.
	   ``Kosovo is a very sensitive issue and we agree there should be
a peaceful solution within the framework of autonomy,'' said Czech
defense minister Vladimir Vetchy.
	   He added that the three countries do not plan to participate in
military actions, if it came to that, but are prepared to extend
humanitarian assistance.
	   ``There's need for broader pressure on (Serbian President)
Milosevic's office to force them to negotiate for peace,'' said
Onyszkiewicz, adding ``we'll act in solidarity with our partners,
but the forms will have to be determined later.''
	   Hungary's Janos Szabo stressed the need for a negotiated
settlement, saying that ``military intervention can bring only
short-term results and maybe even lead to new conflicts.''
	   The next meeting of the three defense ministers will be in April
1999 in the Czech Republic.

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ It was a gift from one country's top
general to another, delivered by Hercules transport plane.
	   Myanmar sent 101 Thai prison inmates home on Monday in a
goodwill gesture between neighboring nations with a long history of
mistrust and prickly relations.
	   The release of the jailed fishermen and loggers who had entered
Myanmar territory illegally was granted by Gen. Khin Nyunt,
Myanmar's military intelligence chief, as a final token of
appreciation to Gen. Chetta Thanajaro, who will soon retire as Thai
army commander in chief.
	   Much of the world has condemned the military government of
Myanmar, also known as Burma, for rampant human rights abuses,
suppressing the country's democracy movement and allegedly failing
to stop drug trafficking.
	   But Gen. Chetta has strived to keep relations warm with his
counterparts across Thailand's western border.
	   Expected to enter politics after retiring later this year,
Chetta greeted 61 of the freed Thais as they arrived at a military
air base in Bangkok. He urged them to become productive citizens.
	   Forty others held in a provincial Myanmar prison were sent on a
later flight.
	   The prisoners, dressed in white shirts and black trousers,
marched somberly off the plane, each carrying a Thai flag and large
framed portraits of Thailand's king and queen.
	   Then they kneeled in formation on the tarmac, raised their hands
over their heads and lowered their faces to the ground in respect
to the royal family.
	   About 200 family members were on hand to greet the former
prisoners. Many broke down and cried, but not all were tears of
joy.
	   ``I have been waiting for five years. What am I going to do,''
screamed Boonom Senapak as she sobbed wildly and clutched her two
young children.
	   She had seen her husband's name on a roster of all Thai
prisoners but mistook the list for those who were being granted
amnesty, said a Thai official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Noo-nguen Pangchong, 19, the only female prisoner, returned home
with mixed feelings. Her husband, a Myanmar national who was jailed
for trafficking illegal workers from Myanmar to Thailand, still has
one year left on his prison term.
	   ``I was allowed to see him briefly about a month ago. I'm not
sure if he knows I've been released,'' said Noo-nguen.
	   Wej Kongnuan, a 25-year-old who had already served over six
years of his seven-year sentence for illegal entry, said conditions
at Insein Prison in Yangon were difficult.
	   The diet consisted mainly of beans, rice and vegetables twice a
day.
	   ``They gave us a piece of meat or one egg once a week,'' Wej
said.
	   The Thais were not kept, however, with hard core criminals or
political prisoners. The military government frequently sends
democracy activists and student protesters to Insein.
	   Former prisoners and human rights groups have reported the
political detainees are frequently tortured.
	   Wej said he did see student prisoners being brought to meet
visiting relatives and that they were forced to wear bags over
their heads.
	   About 12 journalists from Bangkok were allowed to accompany Thai
officials on the flight to Yangon to pick up the prisoners.
	   The reporters were not allowed to leave the airport, and
military intelligence officers followed them closely while they
were there.

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS ftp address for international subscribers in 6th graf
to 194.72.70.250 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   The Clinton grand jury testimony, the Lewinsky testimony and the
rest of the 2,800 pages of Starr documents will be made public by
the House Judiciary Committee when the Clinton videotape is
released at approximately 9 a.m. (1300 GMT) Monday.
	   The Government Printing Office is printing the materials in
bound form.
	   Sometime after the printed transcripts are distributed _ how
much longer is not known _ we expect to get the materials
electronically.
	   Because of the volume, the full texts of the testimony and
documents will not move on regular news wires.
	   Instead we will provide the full texts in ASCII and HTML formats
at an ftp site. We have arranged for an ftp server with additional
capacity to handle the expected demand. This means the files will
not be at the address used to deliver the Starr report last week.
	   The address of the ftp site is 194.72.70.250
	   To get the username and password, you can call your local
bureaus. You can call the international desk at 212-621-1644 if you
have any questions.
	   Again, this is not the server we used to deliver the Starr
report. Please do not connect to that server. The files will NOT be
there.
	   Also, we set up this ftp site so that subscribers can have
access to the full text of the testimony and other evidence. So
please do not make the address, username and password public. If
the address becomes public you may have trouble connecting to the
ftp site.
	   We will advise you as soon as there is something available at
the site.
	   We will also post the full texts on the Web at
http://textsweb.ap.org/starrtext
	   Running excerpts will move on regular news wires. We cannot
estimate wordage until we see the documents. The excerpts will be
edited; much of the sexually graphic detail may be deleted and any
that remains will be carefully flagged.
	   The full transcripts on the ftp site will be unedited and will
move in the official form provided by the House Judiciary
Committee.
	   Edited video clips in RealVideo and QuickTime formats from the
videotape of President Bill Clinton's testimony will also be
available at the ftp site.
	   Additionally, we will post the text files and video excerpts on
The WIRE, the AP's public Web site that is displayed by newspaper
and broadcast sites around the world.
	   APTV, the AP's international video service that provides video
to 200 broadcasters in the United States and abroad, plans to carry
the video in full, unedited, as soon as it is made available.
	   Warnings about explicit language will be shown both on screen
and in APTV advisories before the tapes are played.

	   Editors: The following stories have moved or will move on the
European circuits of The Associated Press by 1500 GMT, unless
otherwise noted.
	   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Congress laid before a weary nation Monday
the raw footage of President Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony
and 2,800 pages of evidence chronicling his relationship with
Monica Lewinsky in explicit detail. ``I regret that what began as
friendship came to include this conduct,'' Clinton testified.
	   With:
	   _ UN-GENERAL ASSEMBLY. Looking to assert himself on the world
stage while settling aside his personal difficulties, Clinton will
call anew for a united international front to combat terrorists and
their new, high-tech ability to kill and maim when he addresses the
53rd session of the U.N. General Assembly Monday.
	   _ WATCHING CLINTON. People around the world were watching the
broadcast of Clinton's grand jury testimony.
	   _ GERMANY-CLINTON-OUTRAGE. Germany's rail company ordered train
station TV sets switched off during broadcast of Clinton's
testimony. The professed reason is to shield children, but it's
really the adults who are offended. From Chancellor Helmut Kohl to
the man on the street, Germans are shocked by the U.S. scandal _
not because of the sex, but because of the shame it brings to a
world leader.
	   _ FRANCE-CLINTON REACTION. France's Socialist Party on Monday
said that Kenneth Starr is an ``unsavory figure'' obsessed with sex
and that the real victim of his investigation is not the American
president but America itself.
	   MOSCOW _ Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion new
rubles (dlrs 66 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid to
get cash flowing through the frozen banking system. President Boris
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov meet in the Kremlin
with the aim of finalizing the new cabinet and working out a plan
to stabilize the jittery economy. RUSSIA-ECONOMY.
	   With:
	   _ RUSSIA-YAVLINSKY. Grigory Yavlinsky, a prominent liberal
lawmaker, has been hospitalized following a heart attack, but his
life wasn't in danger, officials said Monday. Yavlinsky, 46,
suffered a heart attack Friday and has remained in a hospital since
then, said his spokeswoman.
	   _ RUSSIA-ARMY RAMPAGE. A Russian soldier shot dead two of his
comrades and fled his unit in the Ural Mountains, the latest in a
series of such shootings in the demoralized Russian military.
	   BONN _ With his lead in the polls nearly gone, Social Democrat
Gerhard Schroeder hastily resumes courting middle-of-the-road
voters he hopes will lift him to victory over Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in elections Sunday. GERMANY-POLITICS.
	   BERLIN _ The liberal Greens party say that Germany needs a new
national anthem to promote a common identity between east and west,
still undefined almost 10 years after reunification. GERMANY-ANTHEM
DEBATE.
	   STOCKHOLM _ The Social Democrats, who built Sweden's welfare
state and then forced it to deteriorate, now have a chance to make
good on their promise to rebuild it. The party came through
national elections with their worst performance ever _ just 36.6
percent of the votes _ but with conservative parties apparently
unable to budge them from power. SWEDEN-ELECTION.
	   With:
	   STOCKHOLM _ Amid a globalizing economy teaching that you can
never have too much, national elections showed Swedes holding to
their folk wisdom that ``just enough is best.''
SWEDEN-ELECTIONS-JUST ENOUGH.
	   PARIS _ Saying Russia's image has suffered abroad, presidential
hopeful Alexander Lebed makes a two-day visit to France seeking to
shore up his country's reputation and hopefully shake out some
funds for his Siberian region's own economy. FRANCE-LEBED.
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Officials in both Serbia and Montenegro,
which together form Yugoslavia, reject an ethnic Albanian proposal
that Kosovo remains in the federation but with an equal status as
the two republics. YUGOSLAVIA_KOSOVO
	   ROME _ Italy's hard-line Communists still have to decide how
hard a line to take in a looming battle with the government over
the 1999 budget. The leaders of the Communist Refoundation Party,
after weeks of internal debate, scheduled a vote Monday evening on
a document which maps out the party's strategy. ITALY-POLITICS.
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Riot police fired tear gas and water
cannons Monday to disperse thousands of supporters of the country's
ousted deputy prime minister, in the second day of street clashes.
Federal police said Anwar Ibrahim, was being held under a law that
allows indefinite imprisonment without charges or trial.
MALAYSIA-POLITICS.
	   KABUL _ A rocket slammed into an open field early Monday as
rescue workers sifted through several neighborhoods of Kabul that
were devastated by a rocket barrage a day earlier. More than 50
people died in Sunday's attacks. AFGHANISTAN-ROCKET ATTACK
	   MONROVIA, Liberia _ Liberian secret police opened fire on the
American Embassy in Monrovia, killing at least two people and
injuring two as they tried to catch former warlord Roosevelt
Johnson, who had sought refuge inside, peacekeeping officials said
Monday. LIBERIA.
	   BEIJING _ An international press freedom group appealed to
Chinese President Jiang Zemin on Monday to release a jailed
journalist, calling her imprisonment a blot on China's reputation.
CHINA-JAILED JOURNALIST.
	   TOKYO _ A last-minute compromise to resuscitate Japan's troubled
banking system appeared to be unraveling Monday, as ruling and
opposition party leaders publicly fought over just what was agreed
upon. JAPAN-BANK BILLS.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with another rocket hits Kabul killing at
least 10 people; opposition accuses Taliban of firing deadly
rockets into northern suburbs.

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ At least ten people were killed when
rockets blasted houses in a northern suburb of Kabul on Monday, the
second day of deadly assaults on the Afghan capital.
	   The rocket assault occurred as rescue workers were digging
through the rubble of another barrage that hit on Sunday, ravaging
several neighborhoods and killing more than 50 people and wounding
nearly 200 others.
	   Sirens of the International Red Cross ambulances screamed into
the Khair Khana neighborhood shortly after 3 p.m. local time
Monday. The powerful rocket demolished two houses and damaged seven
other homes.
	   At least 10 bodies were seen being taken away from the scene,
not far from the site of Sunday's rocket hits, which destroyed
entire streets.
	   No one took responsibility for any of the attacks, but the
Taliban is blaming its opponents, positioned north of the capital.
	   The Khair Khana suburb is on the northern edge of the city and
well within range of the opposition rockets.
	   Opposition leaders denied firing the rockets into the city and
accused the Taliban of hitting the northern suburb from their
positions east and southeast of the city.
	   Neighbors used their hands to dig through the rubble to reach
the wounded.
	   The Red Cross firmly condemned the rocket assaults.
	   Earlier Monday, a rocket landed in an open field while rescue
workers dug through the rubble of Sunday's rocket attack.
	   Relatives of the dead wailed and beat their chests as rescue
workers recovered bodies, eyewitnesses said.
	   ``These are my friends . . . All I can do is cry and cry,'' said
Mohammed Amir.
	   The rocket assault on Sunday was the worst since the Taliban
army took control of the capital in September 1996, ousting
President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his military chief Ahmed Shah
Massood.
	   One of the rockets Sunday destroyed a two story building and
badly damaged seven other buildings.
	   ``There was a massive explosion as the rocket hit the
building,'' said Bashir Ahmed, a drug store who lost three sons in
the attack. Ahmed received minor injuries.
	   Other victims were men selling fruit and sweets on the road
side.
	   While hospital officials and the Taliban are reporting as many
as 50 dead, the death toll could be higher because Afghans bury
their dead immediately.
	   Hospitals were operating at capacity to keep up with the
wounded. Stretchers were set up in the halls and doctors in blood
stained coats treated scores of wounded.
	   The anti-Taliban alliance is led by Massood and Rabbani and has
been within rocket range of the capital for more than a year.
	   The Taliban rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan and in recent
weeks have made significant territorial gains, pushing the
opposition out of most of Bamiyan province in central Afghanistan.
	   It also has routed the opposition on several other fronts. Last
month it took control of the opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan.

Dams body to look at world's major river basins
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ An independent body looking at
the pros and cons of major dam projects on Monday said it would
conduct reviews of at least 10 of the world's biggest river basins.
	   The World Commission on Dams was set up earlier this year by the
World Bank and the World Conservation Union to establish guidelines
to halt poorly conceived dam projects and support high quality
ventures.
	   Following a meeting at its headquarters in Cape Town, the
commission said it was in the process of finalizing a list of
rivers to study which would be announced shortly.
	   ``The commission resolved to conduct independent reviews in at
least 10 of the world's major river basins,'' the commission said
in a statement.
	   The reviews will not make recommendations on individual
projects, but seek to analyze the benefits and drawbacks of
existing dams.
	   Beyond saying that the Amazon in South America and the Zambezi
in Africa were almost certain to appear in the final list,
commission chairman Kader Asmal declined to say which other rivers
were likely to be studied.
	   The meeting had originally been planned to be held in India, but
the commission was forced to suddenly change the venue after
officials in the Indian state of Gujarat threatened to arrest its
members.
	   Gujarat is the site of a controversial dam project on the
Narmada river and the state government objected to the airing of
dam issues in India. One of the commissioners, Medha Patkar, is the
founder of an anti-Narmada dam protest group.
	   Asmal, South Africa's Minister of Forestry and Water Affairs,
declined to say if the Narmada river would be studied by the
commission.
	   Between 1950 and the 1980s, some 35,000 large dams have been
built around the world, and more are planned. While developing
countries focus on the economic benefits of their dams, opponents
of dam-building say big projects can destroy communities and wreak
environmental havoc.
	   The commission has 12 members, five of them outspoken critics of
dams. Among the dam proponents is Goran Lindahl, chief executive
officer of the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant ABB Asea Brown
Boveri.
	   The commission's next meeting will be held in Sri Lanka in
December.

Stocks fall on concern over Philippine Airlines' expected closure;
</HEADLINE>
peso weakens
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing lower, analyst comments

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine stocks were pushed lower
Monday by concerns over the impact of the scheduled closure of
Philippine Airlines, the country's largest carrier, traders said.
	   ``It's a big blow to the economy,'' said Helen Alvarez, research
director at All Asia Securities Corp.
	   The peso also weakened, pressured by concerns that PAL's demise
would trigger a wave of speculative dollar buying, traders said.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 10.35 points,
or 0.9 percent, to 1,164.26 after losing 94.63 points on Friday.
	   The broader All Shares Index was down 3.08 points to 390.01
after Friday's 19.89-point decline. Losers outnumbered gainers 56
to 18, while 38 issues were unchanged.
	   Among the largest losers were Philippine National Bank, the
biggest local creditor of Philippine Airlines, and Petron Corp., a
major supplier of aviation fuel to the airline.
	   Alavarez said PAL's expected closure sent jitters throughout the
banking sector since a number of local financial institutions have
exposure to the airline, although most of their loans are secured.
	   ``I can't see anything positive coming out of Philippine
Airlines' closure,'' Alavarez added.
	   The airline's closure will render jobless more than 5,000
employees and will adversely affect other industries such as
tourism.
	   Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000 Inc., said a slew of
recent bad news is likely to weigh down the market in coming days.
	   ``There's no interest in the market at the moment,'' he said.
	   In currency trading, the dollar averaged 44.150 pesos, up from
43.891 pesos on Friday. It closed at 44.290 pesos, its intraday
high.
	   Dealers said the market focused almost entirely on Philippine
Airlines.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the market is concerned that
if the airline is liquidated there may be heavy demand for dollars
as it repays creditors.
	   The bulk of its debt is dollar-denominated and much of it is
secured by aircraft and machinery.
	   Some market watchers believe the dollar could test, and breach,
the sensitive level of 44.50 pesos in coming days if speculative
pressure on the peso is sustained.
	   The central bank wasn't active in the market, although there is
some expectation it may raise overnight rates to stabilize the
peso.
	   The overnight borrowing rate, the central bank's main tool to
control domestic money supply, is 16 percent, and the overnight
lending rate 18 percent.

Some Portuguese doctors stage strikes over pay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Some of Portugal's doctors Monday began
100 days of wildcat strikes at state hospitals and clinics to press
claims for a pay rise.
	   The Independent Doctors' Union, which represents some 4,000 of
the country's 22,000 state-employed doctors, called the action a
``self-service strike'' because for the next three months the
doctors can choose when to walk off the job without giving any
warning.
	   At least 68 doctors stayed away from work Monday, health
officials said.
	   The union complains that its members earn less than nurses.
	   State-employed doctors earn between 215,000 escudos (dlrs 1,200)
per month and 465,000 escudos (dlrs 2,550) for a 35-hour week,
while nurses working the same hours can earn up to 450,000 escudos
(dlrs 2,470).
	   The Health Ministry negotiated a modest wage rise with the other
main medical union in July, but that deal was rejected by the
doctors' union.

	   NICE, France (AP) _ Two armed men wearing black masks made off
Monday with two valuable impressionist paintings from a museum in
Nice after taking the curator hostage.
	   The incident began about 7 a.m. Monday morning when the thieves
showed up at the home of Jean Fournis, the curator of the Fine Arts
Museum of Nice.

where they bound and gagged the caretaker as well as another
employee and shut all three men up in the museum library.
	   The museum alarm was turned off because the caretaker was on
duty.

Claude Monet called ``The Cliffs of Dieppe'' and another one by
Alfred Sisley dating from 1890 named ``The Alley of the Poplars.''
	   The sped off in the car belonging to the curator.
	   Both paintings belong to the French state. They are widely known
and would be difficult to sell, Fournis said.

Philippine kidnappers demand ransom for abducted Chinese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ The kidnappers of three Chinese
men have demanded ransom and are negotiating with local officials
in the southern Philippines, police said Monday.
	   Suspected Muslim rebels seized the three Hong Kong residents
Sept. 8 while the victims were fishing in Sitangkai in Tawi-Tawi
province, about 1,050 kilometers (650 miles) south of Manila.
	   Tawi-Tawi police chief Indo Ho said the kidnappers demanded 1.5
million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 193,500) during negotiations
with Governor Munib Estino of nearby Sulu province.
	   There were reports the three have been taken to Sulu, where
large areas are controlled by Muslim rebels and bandits, Ho said.
	   Police officials suspect the Chinese were kidnapped by former
rebels of the Moro National Liberation Front, once the country's
largest Muslim separatist guerrilla group, which signed a peace
accord with the Manila government in 1996.
	   A Filipino guide, Abdulkadil Munabirul, who was accompanying the
foreigners, was also abducted but later freed to relay the ransom
demand to two Manila-based companies that supposedly employed the
three Chinese.
	   A police investigation, however, showed the companies were
non-existent, and there were indications the Chinese men were
involved in the smuggling of corals from the southern Philippines
to Hong Kong and some European countries, Ho said.
	   Several foreigners, including an Italian missionary, have been
kidnapped in southern Mindanao Island this month by suspected
bandits or Muslim separatist rebels.
	   Italian priest Luciano Benedetti, 54, of Ravenna, Italy, and
several Taiwanese remain in captivity.
	   The kidnappings occurred amid a high-profile anti-crime drive by
President Joseph Estrada aimed at assuring foreigners that the
Philippines is a safe investment destination.

Court confirms prison for ex-minister convicted in anti-Basque
</HEADLINE>
'dirty war' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Supreme Court on Monday rejected a bid
by a former cabinet minister and another ex-official to be released
from prison while they appeal their convictions in a 'dirty war'
against Basque separatists.
	   The court also ruled that 10 other defendants, who pleaded
guilty and have sought pardons for a kidnapping that marked the
start of that covert campaign against the armed separatist group
ETA, must begin serving their jail terms on Tuesday.
	   Former Socialist Interior Minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo, 56,
and ex-secretary of state for security Rafael Vera, 53, began
serving 10-year sentences on Sept. 10 in a prison in Guadalajara,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Madrid.
	   They were convicted in July of organizing the 1983 kidnapping of
a Basque businessman who was mistaken for an ETA hitman and held
for 10 days.
	   Days before they went to prison, the defendants had filed
motions seeking to remain free on bail pending appeals to the
Constitutional Court. The Supreme Court said no, and reiterated
this stance on Monday in response to an appeal from the two
defendants.
	   The abduction was the first act attributed to the self-styled
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next four years in a campaign designed to crush
ETA. Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain.
	   Ten other defendants in the kidnapping case _ policemen,
politicians and security officials _ received sentences ranging
from two years and four months to 10 years in prison.
	   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that they must begin serving
these terms while the government considers their requests for
pardons.

Demaci withdraws from political life, health reasons cited
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The political leader of ethnic
Albanian separatists fighting Serb security forces in Kosovo
resigned Monday in a apparent sign of disarray among the rebels.
	   Also on Monday, officials in both Serbia and Montenegro rejected
an ethnic Albanian proposal for the Serbian province to gain equal
status with those two republics in the joint Yugoslav federation.
	   Adem Demaci's office announced his withdrawal from political
life due to health reasons _ doctors had warned the 68-year-old of
increased nervous tension and worsening diabetes _ but the move
comes after a clash with Kosovo Liberation Army headquarters over
hard-liners' refusal to accept anything short of full independence
for the majority Albanian province.
	   The move came following the KLA defeat by Serb forces in much of
the province. Demaci's pullout is expected to further marginalize
the rebels and strengthen the position of the U.S.-backed pacifist
Kosovo leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   The KLA and Demaci have challenged Rugova's position,
criticizing him for his pacifism and readiness to negotiate deals
for Kosovo which fall short of ethnic Albanian demands for
independence.
	   Kosovo is a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in present
Yugoslavia. It is over 90 percent ethnic Albanian but is ruled by
Serbia, which abolished its broad autonomy in 1989.
	   U.S. mediator Christopher Hill has been trying to negotiate a
deal for the province to avoid further fighting and a humanitarian
disaster for 250,000 displaced by Kosovo fighting.
	   Both Serbia and Montenegro, the two republics which constitute
Yugoslavia, rejected an ethnic Albanian proposal that Kosovo
becomes a third republic within the country.
	   Montenegro, which is much smaller than Serbia, apparently fears
its position in the federation would be jeopardized if Kosovo
became a separate unit.
	   According to the ethnic Albanian proposal, published Sunday in
the Koha Ditore daily, Kosovo would be ``temporarily part of
Yugoslavia, as an independent entity equal to the other two
republics in the federation.''
	   Kosovo would have its own parliament, government, courts and
police, but would be part of a common market with the rest of
Yugoslavia. It indicated Kosovo's borders could remain in the hands
of the Yugoslav army and federal customs authorities.
	   A vice president in the Serbian government, Vojislav Seselj,
said the region could only be granted ``territorial autonomy''
within the province of Serbia.
	   Last week, Koha Ditore carried a formula suggested by the United
States which would grant the province a high level of self-rule but
leaving it within Serbia and Yugoslavia. Rugova has backed the
plan, saying it was a good basis for the talks.
	   Belgrade media have indicated that a forthcoming Serb proposal
would be similar to the U.S. one.
	   Hill told Koha Ditore Monday that the key issue is to stop the
use of force in Kosovo. But he admitted ``I haven't had much
success.''
	   Serb forces and KLA clashed Monday in the central Drenica
region, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported.

Former Ukrainian government official and opposition activist
</HEADLINE>
charged &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukrainian authorities charged a former
government official and opposition activist with abusing his
position and embezzlement, the chief prosecutor's office said
Monday.
	   Mykola Syvulskiy, former deputy finance minister and deputy
Central Bank chief, is charged with illegally transferring more
than dlrs 5 million from the state gas company Ukrgazprom to a
private gas and energy trader, Unified Energy Systems (UES).
	   The charges, formally submitted Saturday, carry a prison term of
up to five years, the prosecutor general's office said in a
statement. Syvulskiy was detained last Thursday.
	   Leaders of Syvulskiy's centrist opposition Hromada movement have
protested the case, saying it was politically motivated.
	   Hromada leader Julia Timoshenko, who headed UES at the time of
the alleged money transfer, said Syvulskiy was ``thrown behind bars
under orders from the president and his closest entourage.''
	   Syvulskiy holds a senior post in the shadow cabinet formed last
year by Hromada and headed by Timoshenko, and has been active in
trying to organize a referendum on President Leonid Kuchma's
resignation.
	   The case was the latest twist in an investigation launched by
Ukrainian state prosecutors against Hromada leader and former
premier Pavlo Lazarenko and his closest aide Timoshenko.
	   Lazarenko's critics have accused him of abusing his authority
for personal gain when he was premier in 1996-97 and reaping huge
profits from gas imports to Ukraine by giving the UES preferential
status in the country's gas market during his term in office.
	   Tax authorities recently fined UES 1.4 billion hryvna (dlrs 500
million) for evading tax payments and illegally transferring abroad
money received from gas sales. UES has appealed, and the case was
sent to the Supreme Arbitration Court.
	   Prosecutor General Mykhailo Potebenko angrily dismissed any
suggestions of politics in the case. Speaking on Ukrainian
television Sunday, he pledged to complete the investigation, saying
that Lazarenko, Timoshenko and Suvylskiy ``will bear responsibility
for what they did'' if found guilty.
	   Potebenko charged Timoshenko and other Hromada lawmakers with
trying to pressure his office into releasing Suvylskiy.
	   Such actions are ``unacceptable, especially since she
(Timoshenko) used to head the UES,'' the prosecutor said, adding
that his office would not respond to ``any methods of blackmail and
slander.''

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Some of Portugal's doctors Monday began
100 days of wildcat strikes at state hospitals and clinics to press
claims for a pay rise.
	   The Independent Doctors' Union, which represents some 4,000 of
the country's 22,000 state-employed doctors, called the action a
``self-service strike'' because for the next three months the
doctors can choose when to walk off the job without giving any
warning.
	   At least 68 doctors stayed away from work Monday, health
officials said.
	   The union complains that its members earn less than nurses.
	   State-employed doctors earn between 215,000 escudos (dlrs 1,200)
per month and 465,000 escudos (dlrs 2,550) for a 35-hour week,
while nurses working the same hours can earn up to 450,000 escudos
(dlrs 2,470).
	   The Health Ministry negotiated a modest wage rise with the other
main medical union in July, but that deal was rejected by the
doctors' union.

Police clash with Anwar supporters, fire tear gas and water cannon

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Riot police fired tear gas and
water cannon Monday to disperse thousands of supporters of the
country's ousted deputy prime minister in the second day of street
clashes.
	   An army unit was sent onto the streets of the capital to help
quell the demonstrations.
	   A human rights group, Suaram, said 40 people had been arrested,
including six under a law that allows indefinite imprisonment
without charges or trial for those deemed a threat to national
security.
	   Federal police said the former deputy prime minister, Anwar
Ibrahim, was also being held under that law, which puts his future
in the hands of the home affairs minister.
	   In Malaysia, that is Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who
appeared to be seeking to remove Anwar, his only rival, from the
political scene by the quickest means possible. Anwar has been
leading a growing public opposition to the 17-year-rule of the
72-year-old prime minister.
	   Anwar's detention, and police action against his supporters, had
threatened to overshadow a visit by Queen Elizabeth II to close the
16th Commonwealth Games, which feature athletes from countries that
once belonged to the British Empire.
	   But Mahathir appeared in the center of the National Stadium,
receiving several minutes of applause, before greeting the queen,
who presided over the marching, dancing and singing. Earlier,
Mahathir declared Sept. 28 a national holiday ``as a tribute to the
nation and the people for the success of the games.''
	   A Malaysian government official, speaking on condition he not be
further identified, said the governing body of the ruling UMNO
political party had met Monday. They issued an appeal to all party
members to convince fellow Malaysians that the charges against
Anwar are justified, the official said.
	   Anwar, who was tossed out of the government earlier this month,
is expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and disturbing the
public order. His arrest at his home Sunday night has added a
volatile element to Malaysia's political and economic troubles.
	   But the use of the security act implies that there is not enough
substance in the charges to try Anwar and his allies in court, said
Chandra Muzaffar, a political science professor at the University
of Malaya. ``It means that the government is not prepared to give
him a chance to defend himself in court,'' the professor said.
	   Pounding batons on their heavy shields, police charged into a
crowd of 2,000 people outside the courthouse where Anwar had been
expected to appear for arraignment Monday.
	   Trucks sprayed strong jets of water mixed with chemicals that
stung the demonstrators' skin.
	   Several thousand more demonstrators took to the streets in other
parts of the capital, where they were chased by riot police.
Reporters saw police detaining at least a dozen protesters and
shoving them into vans, although authorities released no figures on
the numbers arrested.
	   There were injuries among the demonstrators. Some were hauled
away bleeding by police.
	   ``We didn't do anything,'' said Marizal Jai, 23, a janitor.
``They attacked us with water and tear gas. They chased us in and
out of buildings.''
	   Several hundred protesters, hemmed in by police units, headed
toward the National Mosque, the site of the 51-year-old Anwar's
fiery speech Sunday that culminated in protests and his arrest.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, issued a rallying call late Monday
to Malaysia's still-diffuse reform movement.
	   ``Unfortunately the police acted wildly. This is another truth
how the police have lost their sense of balance, of humanity, by
attacking the public,'' Azizah told reporters.
	   She said she regretted the police storming of the family home
Sunday night, an act that terrified her, Anwar and their children.
	   ``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by ordering the police to act like
gangsters he will frighten the people from supporting this
reformation movement, he is dreaming. I think he has cut himself
off from reality,'' Azizah said.
	   Looking shaken, she added: ``I feel very sad because Dr.
Mahathir is a great leader, but now he has become a political
desperado, who is willing to suppress his own people just to keep
power.''
	   Police swooped in and blocked several access points to the
city's main plaza, Merdeka (Freedom) Square, with jeeps, trucks and
police cars to keep protesters away.
	   More than 1,000 police worked frantically to contain the angry
demonstrators. They were backed by a specially trained unit of
two-dozen reserve army officers.
	   An aide to Anwar's wife said the family had been told that he
was taken to a maximum security detention camp.

Russia's Central Bank prints money, offers credits to help banks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with Central Bank saying its move not to affect ruble
rate, prices in new graf 6, a major commercial bank resuming
operation in two new final grafs. &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion
rubles (dlrs 66 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid to
get cash flowing through the frozen banking system, an official
said Monday.
	   Also, President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov met in the Kremlin with the aim of finalizing the new
cabinet and working out a plan to stabilize the jittery economy.
	   The government's biggest fear at present is that the country's
shaky commercial banks will collapse. The Central Bank launched an
emergency rescue plan on Friday to help ensure that payments would
start circulating again.
	   Russia's financial crisis had caused a backlog of bank payments
totaling over 30 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion), Andrei Kozlov,
the first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, told a news
conference Monday.
	   The Central Bank on Friday helped to settle 10 billion rubles
(dlrs 666 million) of the payments, or one-third of the total owed
between banks and their clients, Kozlov said.
	   As part of the effort, the Central Bank printed 900 million
rubles (dlrs 60 million) and issued short-term credits to banks,
Kozlov said. He stressed that the amount was too small to affect
the ruble's rate and inflation.
	   Many analysts feared that the move may set a dangerous precedent
of dealing with crisis by printing new money. If such policy is
continued, it could fuel inflation and lead to further declines in
the the Russian ruble, officially valued at 16 to the U.S. dollar,
down from six when the crisis began a month ago.
	   In another development, the Central Bank canceled electronic
currency trading on Monday, though the ruble continued trading at
street exchanges.
	   The Central Bank said it acted because it needed more time to
determine which banks should be allowed to participate on the
currency markets, and which should not.
	   ``We want to make sure that the banks will use the extra
(rubles) to settle their client payments and not to buy dollars,''
Kozlov said.
	   Critics have accused the government of responding slowly to the
economic crisis which hit last month. The rescue plan for the banks
represents the biggest emergency effort so far.
	   Primakov has been in office 10 days, but has yet to outline an
overall economic strategy or put his cabinet in place. Key jobs,
such as the finance minister's post, have not be filled.
	   ``We are going to finalize the personnel issue with (Primakov)
today,'' Yeltsin said at the start of his meeting with the premier.
	   ``The cabinet formation is still on the way, but we have already
been carrying out serious work,'' Primakov said.
	   Shortly after the meeting, Gennady Kulik, 63, a Soviet-era
agricultural official and a member of parliament's Agrarian
Faction, was named deputy prime minister in charge of agriculture.
	   Kulik, a defender of collective farms and a staunch opponent of
private land ownership, has been among those who have blocked
Yeltsin's plans to carry out land reform.
	   Primakov also named Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin, considered a
moderate reformer, to head Russia's delegation in talks with the
International Monetary Fund, Russian news agencies reported Monday.
	   An IMF mission arrived in Moscow on Friday for a week of talks
with Russian officials to follow up on Russia's lending program.
The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package in July, but
it did not ward off the crisis.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ The Russian economy got more bad news Monday when the State
Statistics Committee announced that the Gross Domestic Product
shrank 2.1 percent in the first eight months of the year.
	   Also, the number of unemployed increased slightly last month to
reach 8.35 million people, or 11.5 percent of the workforce. The
rate is expected to rise even higher due to the worsening crisis.
	   _ The Central Bank on Monday allowed Russia's second-largest
savings bank, SBS-Agro, to resume operations following a 10-day ban
on its activities.
	   Like several other leading Russian banks, SBS-Agro was hit hard
by the crisis and is about dlrs 2 billion in debt. It is allowing
its 5.7 million individual clients to reschedule their deposits for
terms ranging from one to five years.

First trial of Croats for wartime crimes against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The trial of nine Croats accused of
committing atrocities against rebel Serbs in the 1991 Serbo-Croat
war opened in the nation's capital Monday, the first such trial in
Croatia.
	   The nine are accused of a total of 10 crimes, including
abduction, extortion, attempted murder and murder, committed in the
Pakracka Poljana region in 1991. Hundreds of ethnic Serbs were
allegedly tortured and dozens of them eventually killed in the
area, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southeast of the capital, during
the war.
	   Three of the defendants, Munib Suljic, 39, Igor Mikola, 27, and
Miroslav Bajramovic, 41, appeared before the court Monday. The
other six defendants, who remain at large, will be tried in
absentia.
	   More than 20 witnesses are expected to testify in the case, the
first one in which Croats are being tried for alleged atrocities
committed against local Serbs.
	   Until last September, when the weekly Feral Tribune released the
testimony of key suspect Bajramovic, most Croats viewed themselves
as victims of the six-month war, in which about 10,000 Croats died
and a third of their country was occupied by Serbs for more than
three years.
	   Bajramovic admitted then that he tortured and killed 86 people
in Pakracka Poljana and Gospic, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southeast
and 180 kilometers (112 miles) south, respectively of Zagreb. He
claimed to have killed 72 victims with his own hands, nine of which
were women.
	   In his account, Bajramovic also implicated high-ranking army
officials, including the former interior minister and local
commander. Bajramovic was arrested immediately after his interview
was published, although neither he, nor the officials mentioned,
were charged with the acts described in the interview.
	   Bajramovic's account brought to light the painful discovery that
some Croats may have been brutal killers, too, and sparked a heated
debate. Some Croats _ mostly ex-soldiers _ completely denied the
atrocities _ while others pressed for a reevaluation of the 1991
war events.
	   A court statement issued shortly after Bajramovic's indictment
last September said he had retracted parts of his published
testimony in his official account.

Gadhafi tried to intervene for release of Iranians
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was shocked to
hear that Afghanistan's Taliban militia had killed some Iranian
diplomats after he had intervened to save their lives, Libya's JANA
news agency reported Sunday.
	   Gadhafi had personally intervened with Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar after Iran had announced the kidnapping of 10
diplomats and an Iranian reporter when the militia captured the
northern Afghan town of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8, the agency said.
	   ``We have been told from the mouth of Taliban's leader that they
know nothing about the diplomats and the search for them ended with
no result,'' Gadhafi told the agency.
	   On Sept. 10 the Taliban declared that their militiamen had
killed nine of the 11 Iranians. The reporter was among those
killed.
	   ``We are shocked and feel strong indignation for this
regrettable development,'' Gadhafi said.
	   He said he had hoped the Iranians would be released.
	   Gadhafi warned of a ``Zionist and imperialist conspiracy against
Islam ... aimed at igniting a regional war to destroy the Asian
Islamic nations.'' He did not elaborate.
	   This month Iran massed tens of thousands of troops on its border
with Afghanistan. Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to
the frontier region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   Tehran says Taliban is still holding at least 50 more Iranians,
most are truck drivers who were delivering food, medicine and other
humanitarian goods to needy Afghans. Taliban says they were
delivering weapons to its opponents.

Lebed says Russia's image abroad has suffered, seeks funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Presidential hopeful Alexander Lebed sought to
shore up his country's reputation and shake out some funds for his
Siberian region's economy at the start Monday of a visit to France.
	   Lebed said Russia's image abroad had suffered as a result of the
ongoing political crisis and that he had come to inform French
leaders, bankers and other officials of the situation.
	   The former general, who is now governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk
region in Siberia, met for 40 minutes, twice as long as planned,
with Laurent Fabius, the Socialist president of parliament.
	   ``Since Russia today makes an unfavorable impression, the
objective of the visit is to demonstrate that not everything is
bad,'' Lebed told reporters after meeting Fabius.
	   Lebed said he fully supported Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
whom Yeltsin appointed 10 days ago to lead the government and find
a solution to the current economic turmoil.
	   A poll aired Sunday night on Russia's prime weekly news program
Itogi showed Lebed would have strong chances to win the presidency
if elections were held now.
	   But Lebed, who finished third in the 1996 presidential vote, was
coy about his intentions in 2000 when the next election is
scheduled.
	   ``Life will show,'' whether or not he would run in the
elections, Lebed told journalists after meeting with Fabius.
	   His priority now was to make sure that workers in his region
were paid, that subsidies were paid to families in need.
	   ``Social tension is receding. The harvest is coming in,'' Lebed
said, speaking of the Krasnoyarsk region, an area four times the
size of France 3,400 kilometers (2,100 miles) east of Moscow.
	   Lebed's agenda during his two-day private visit includes
meetings with bankers, insurance officials, as well as lunch with
U.S. ambassador to France, Felix Rohatyn, a former Wall Street
investment banker who is known as the man who bailed out New York
city.
	   Lebed has connections across France's political and business
spectrum forged during a six-day visit to France in 1997.

Three NATO applicants foursquare for Kosovo autonomy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to RESTORE slugline &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) _ The defense ministers of the Czech
Republic, Hungary and Poland want to see autonomy returned to
Kosovo and called Monday for more international pressure on
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   The ministers of the three former Warsaw Pact countries, which
are expected to become full-fledged NATO members next year, meet
regularly to coordinate their efforts at NATO and European Union
accession.
	   ``We should have become members long ago,'' said Poland's Janusz
Onyszkiewicz, adding the three plan to table the final documents
jointly in Washington, but did not add a timeframe.
	   Hungary has put off announcing a tender for the purchase of up
to 30 state-of-the-art fighter aircraft due to financial
constraints and the three agreed to set up a work team to
investigate the issue of joint moves on such purchases.
	   Surveying regional problems, the three ministers expressed grave
concern over the conflict in Kosovo.
	   ``Kosovo is a very sensitive issue and we agree there should be
a peaceful solution within the framework of autonomy,'' said Czech
defense minister Vladimir Vetchy.
	   He added that the three countries do not plan to participate in
military actions, if it came to that, but are prepared to extend
humanitarian assistance.
	   ``There's need for broader pressure on (Serbian President)
Milosevic's office to force them to negotiate for peace,'' said
Onyszkiewicz, adding ``we'll act in solidarity with our partners,
but the forms will have to be determined later.''
	   Hungary's Janos Szabo stressed the need for a negotiated
settlement, saying that ``military intervention can bring only
short-term results and maybe even lead to new conflicts.''
	   The next meeting of the three defense ministers will be in April
1999 in the Czech Republic.

Monks oppose negotiations with Tamil rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NIRESH ELIATAMBY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Hundreds of saffron-robed Buddhist
monks marched through the Colombo streets Monday, demanding that
government forces defeat Tamil Tiger rebels militarily.
	   Waving placards and flags, they chanted anti-rebel slogans.
Prior to the march, nearly 500 monks and 1,000 civilians met at the
Young Men's Buddhist Association hall in the Sri Lankan capital and
pronounced themselves against any negotiations with the Liberation
Tigers of Tamil Eelam, who have been fighting for a separate
homeland for minority Tamils since 1983.
	   ``We must never give in to terrorism. The government and
opposition parties are spineless, and are afraid of the rebel
leader,'' said Iththepane Dhammalankara, a monk and spokesman for
the National Movement Against Terrorism.
	   The march by the monks caused massive traffic jams in some parts
of Colombo.
	   Sri Lanka's monks project themselves as the champion of majority
Sinhalese community, most of whom are Buddhists.
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million minority Tamils, who comprise 18
percent of the population, accuse the Sinhalese of widespread
discrimination in education and jobs.
	   The opposition has been putting pressure on the government to
resume peace negotiations with the LTTE. The ethnic conflict has
killed more than 54,000 people in the past 15 years.
	   President Chandrika Kumaratunga says she will not negotiate with
the Tamil rebels unless they surrendered their arms.
	   The government attempts at finding a negotiated settlement, most
recently in 1995, ended in failure with the guerrillas resuming
attacks on the military.

Despite cameos and conquests, games fail to pack them in
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Sprinter Ato Boldon made a cameo
appearance and left with one gold medal.
	   Susie O'Neill stayed the whole course and increased her
unmatched Commonwealth Games gold collection by six.
	   Another Australian swimmer, Ian Thorpe, missed one world record
by .01 second and helped his relay quartet set the only world mark
that fell here _ and he is only 15, a fact that raises Aussie hopes
for their home Olympics in 2000.
	   But there was less optimism about the Commonwealth Games
themselves, and about host Malaysia's proposed bid to stage the
2008 Olympics.
	   Home fans found bowlers, walkers and badminton and hockey
players to cheer. But they stayed away in droves from other sports
in the 10-day games, including track and field in the imposing,
100,000-seat National Stadium.
	   Attendance generally was sparse despite enthusiastic support for
the games by the Malaysian government and major promotions by
Malaysian newspapers, which published special sections.
	   On the eve of Boldon's race, the press advertised the first 100
meters under 10 seconds ever to be run in Malaysia. The Trinidad
sprinter obliged with a 9.88 _ not bad, but still short of the
world record of 9.84 that he thought might be broken in the humid,
windless conditions.
	   Frankie Fredericks of Namibia added a silver medal to his
collection from the 100- and 200-meter races of the last two
Olympics.
	   Then both flew off to a more lucrative track meet in Japan.
	   ``Yes, we were missing top stars who opted for other events ...
but others came and gave great performances,'' said Michael
Fennell, chairman of the Commonwealth Games Federation. He said the
16th running of the games had made the Commonwealth aware of its
own potential by drawing some 5,000 athletes from 70 nations.
	   With Malaysia now the proud owner of some world-class sports
facilities, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said Malaysia now would
pursue Olympic host rights in 2008.
	   ``I doubt whether we can succeed, but we will make a bid
anyway,'' he said, adding that one problem was Malaysia needed more
outstanding athletes.
	   Among sports added to the Commonwealth Games program at the
urging of the hosts was tenpin bowling. Malaysians won two of the
five gold medals, but were thoroughly upstaged by Australian Cara
Honeychurch, who went home with three _ plus scores far higher even
than the men's.
	   The Australians were among the teams that generally sent top
athletes as they worked toward Sydney 2000.
	   They ranged from O'Neill, who now owns 10 Commonwealth Games
gold medals in all, to gymnast Andrei Kravtsov, a former circus
acrobat who shook off a shoulder injury to win four gold medals.
	   But there were disappointments too. With cricket making its
debut in the game, the full-strength Australian team lost the gold
medal game to South Africa, despite the efforts of Steve Waugh. No
bowler managed to get him out in the entire tournament, while he
piled up 215 runs from four innings.
	   Another debut sport, rugby, attracted superstar Jonah Lomu, who
helped New Zealand beat world champion Fiji in the final of the
seven-a-side version of the game.
	   Also living up to their reputation were the Kenyan distance
runners. On the games' final day Monday, Laban Rotich won the 1,500
meters, completing a Kenyan sweep of all men's track races longer
than 400 meters.
	   One athlete distressingly failed to go the distance. New
Zealand's Craig Barrett thought he already had won the 50-kilometer
walk Sunday when dehydration stopped him. He wobbled, leaned
forward on his hands, fell to his knees, reeled to the roadside and
still tried to get up before team officials called an ambulance.
	   That opened the way for Malaysia's Govindasamy Saravanan, whose
gold, plus those from two final-day badminton events, put the host
nation into fourth place in the gold standings.
	   In its best Commonwealth Games finish ever, it amassed 10 gold
medals, behind Australia's 80, England's 36 and Canada's 30.

Queen Elizabeth II visits Malaysia during political storm

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with queen spokesman comment, graf 6, British foreign
secretary meeting with Mahathir, grafs 14-16

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A crowd of demonstrators briefly
chased after Queen Elizabeth's motorcade Monday, but only to get a
peek before resuming chants for political reform near a courthouse
where the former deputy prime minister was expected to be
arraigned.
	   ``Obviously she saw them when she passed by,'' but made no
comment, said Geoff Crawford, the queen's press secretary.
	   Later, the crowd swelled to 2,000 people, and police fired water
cannon and tear gas to disperse them.
	   Queen Elizabeth has stepped into the midst of a roiling
political drama in Southeast Asia during a four-day state visit to
officiate at the closing of the 16th Commonwealth Games, the first
ever to be held in Asia.
	   ``She has always closed the Commonwealth Games, as long as one
can remember,'' said Buckingham Palace spokesman Crawford, adding
that there was no plan yet to cut the queen's visit short.
	   A regal 21-gun salute boomed over Parliament Square early Monday
as part of the official welcome to the British monarch. It drowned
out the whir of a police helicopter, hovering above the nearby
courthouse.
	   Attendants shaded the queen with gold-colored parasols as she
walked a red carpet, inspecting 124 officers of the Royal Malay
Regiment alongside Malaysia's King, Tuanku Ja'afar. A military
brass band played ``God Save the Queen'' and Malaysia's national
anthem.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who attended the ceremony and
met later with the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, triggered
the political turmoil by firing his former heir-apparent, Anwar
Ibrahim, on Sept. 2.
	   The ex-finance minister and former deputy prime minister has
since been fighting for his freedom and political life. Anwar has
repeatedly denied leaked police accusations of everything from
sexual misconduct to treason.
	   He responded by orchestrating a series of nationwide political
rallies and calling for Mahathir's resignation after 17 years in
power. He was arrested Sunday night during a police raid on his
home.
	   A spokesman for Britain's Foreign Office in London said that
while the situation was being monitored very closely, no changes
had been made in the queen's schedule due to the political
disturbances.
	   The queen's press secretary, traveling with her, said that if
there were cause for concern ``the queen would act on the advice of
her ministers'' and the Malaysian government.
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook met with Mahathir on Monday
after postponing a trip to New York for a meeting of the U.N.
General Assembly. Cook had intended to leave Monday night but
decided on Sunday to remain with the queen until her visit ends
Wednesday.
	   ``They discussed the importance of ensuring that the state visit
is a success and that the state visit does not become caught up in
internal political controversy,'' said John Williams, press
secretary to Cook.
	   Mahathir and Cook also ``agreed that the (Anwar) case should be
dealt with through due legal process and independently in the
court,'' Williams said.
	   Anwar was due to be charged in Sessions Court on Monday morning
on a charge of sodomy, which he has vehemently denied. Later,
however, the head of the national police said Anwar would instead
be detained under the Internal Security Act, which allows
indefinite imprisonment without trial.
	   About 500 of his supporters, having waited more than two hours
for his appearance, were protesting there when the queen was driven
by, on her way to the welcoming ceremony in Parliament Square.
	   The demonstration had begun as the royal couple were worshiping
in St. Mary's Cathedral, next to the square. It was the first
public event of her trip to Malaysia, which she has not visited
since 1989.
	   But Anwar told reporters before his arrest that his protest
movement would not intentionally strive to complicate the queen's
visit.
	   ``I don't think Malaysians would want to embarrass the queen in
any way. This is a domestic matter.
	   ``I know Mr. Cook quite well,'' Anwar had said. ``And I know his
concern and commitment with humanitarian issues.''

IOC comes out against Super League plans

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
came out Monday against plans to create a European Super League
grouping the richest soccer clubs, arguing it would monopolize
income at the expense of smaller clubs.
	   An IOC delegation headed by President Juan-Antonio Samaranch
told European Union officials the lucrative television deals
planned under the super league would not profit soccer as a whole.
	   ``This is why a project like the Super League would be dangerous
since it would concern a select club of top teams and the money
they would generate would not trickle down to the provincial
clubs,'' said Jacques Rogge, the head of the European Olympic
Committees.
	   ``Our point is that the collective negotiations of television
rights is the only way to let money filter through from the top
level of sports to the grassroots,'' Rogge said.
	   The IOC called on the EU's executive Commission to use its clout
to make sure an equitable system of revenue distribution would
continue to exist.
	   The 15-nation EU showed the impact it can have on sports when it
forced the European soccer federation to apply the 1995 Bosman
ruling on free agency and scrap limits on EU foreigners.
	   The EU Commission is currently investigating whether the
collective bargaining of soccer federations for the television
rights of all their league clubs is compatible with EU antitrust
laws or whether clubs should be allowed to negotiate these rights
individually.
	   Again, granting such rights to individual clubs would jeopardize
the current system of solidarity between rich and poor clubs, Rogge
said.
	   ``If it becomes a jungle where every club can negotiate for
itself, then you won't have a redistribution effect anymore,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   The current Champions League system of the UEFA European soccer
federation still has such a solidarity principle, said UEFA
Secretary General Gerhard Aigner. Just over 68 percent of Champions
League revenue goes to the participating teams, with the rest going
to smaller clubs, national federations and special projects.
	   UEFA opposes the plans for a rival Super League.
	   On Monday, Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone said he was
interested in plans by Milan-based company Media Partners to form
the breakaway European Super League involving clubs like Manchester
United, Arsenal, Juventus, Inter and AC Milan, Barcelona, Real
Madrid and Bayern Munich.

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Crew members of a Philippine ferry
that sank in a tropical storm abandoned its passengers and failed
to instruct them to leave the ship, a rescued police official said
Monday.
	   ``We were left to fend for ourselves,'' said police
superintendent Napoleon Sesante, one of 361 confirmed survivors of
Friday night's ferry accident. At least 39 of the 454 people on
board died.
	   Sesante said the Princess of the Orient's officers and crew
never told passengers what was happening or what to do as huge
waves and strong winds buffeted the ferry, causing it to tilt.
	   He said the ferry's skipper, Capt. Esrum Mahilum, apparently
ordered his crew to abandon the ship when it began to sink but did
not relay this to the passengers. Mahilum is among those still
missing.
	   ``They didn't say anything, there were no instructions to
passengers. They were irresponsible,'' Sesante said in an interview
over a Manila radio station.
	   Andrei Andresan, a lawyer for Sulpicio Lines, the ship's owner,
said reports by surviving crew members indicate the captain did
give orders to people to abandon the ship. But Andresan said crew
members may have left the ship when it became impossible to save
more passengers.
	   ``They're also humans who will jump into the sea when there is
no more time,'' he said.
	   Several lawmakers said they would investigate the tragedy,
specifically survivors' complaints that the crew abandoned the
passengers. President Joseph Estrada said he has ordered a review
of the country's maritime safety regulations.
	   Rescuers in ships and helicopters continued their search for
survivors Monday off the coast of Cavite province, south of Manila.
On Sunday, 17 people were rescued from chilly storm-whipped waters.
	   The coast guard said it increased the number of survivors to
361, adding additional names gathered by Sulpicio Lines.
	   Survivors said the ship, one of the Philippines' largest
inter-island ferries, began tilting to the left and sank in less
than an hour.
	   Sesante said he was told after his rescue by the captain of
another ship owned by Sulpicio Lines that chains securing cargo in
the Princess of the Orient came loose, allowing several heavy
containers to slide to one side when the ship encountered strong
waves and winds.
	   As the ship began to sink, Sesante called an aide on land using
a cellular phone and asked him to contact people who could rescue
the passengers. The aide called a Manila radio station, which in
turn informed navy and coast guard officials.
	   On Sunday, chief accident investigator Arnie Santiago said the
ship, bound for central Cebu province, was carrying 15 vehicles and
66 containers of truck parts and other heavy materials which may
not have been properly secured.
	   ``The way the ship tilted indicates that the cargo moved,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   He said the sinking was unusually rapid, suggesting that some of
the ship's water seals may have been damaged by an on board fire in
1997. After the fire the 24-year-old ship was repaired at a
Singapore dry dock.
	   Carlos Go, chief executive officer of Sulpicio Lines, insisted
the ship was seaworthy despite the fire.
	   Sulpicio Lines also owned the Dona Paz, a ferry which collided
with a tanker in 1987, killing 4,341 in the world's worst peacetime
shipping disaster. A year later, 250 people died in the sinking of
another ship owned by the company, the Dona Marilyn.
	   Anguished relatives have been waiting at a pier in Manila for
the return of rescue ships since Saturday.
	   The company said there were 352 passengers and 102 crew aboard
the ship. No foreigners were reported on board.

Court confirms prison for ex-minister convicted in anti-Basque
</HEADLINE>
'dirty war' &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish Supreme Court on Monday
rejected a bid by a former cabinet minister and another ex-official
to be released from prison while they appeal their convictions in a
'dirty war' against Basque separatists.
	   The court also ruled that 10 other defendants, who pleaded
guilty and have sought pardons for a kidnapping that marked the
start of that covert campaign against the armed separatist group
ETA, must begin serving their jail terms on Tuesday.
	   Former Socialist Interior Minister Jose Luis Barrionuevo, 56,
and ex-secretary of state for security Rafael Vera, 53, began
serving 10-year sentences on Sept. 10 in a prison in Guadalajara,
about 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Madrid.
	   They were convicted in July of organizing the 1983 kidnapping of
a Basque businessman who was mistaken for an ETA hitman and held
for 10 days.
	   Days before they went to prison, the defendants had filed
motions seeking to remain free on bail pending appeals to the
Constitutional Court. The Supreme Court said no, and reiterated
this stance on Monday in response to an appeal from the two
defendants.
	   The abduction was the first act attributed to the self-styled
Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups, or GAL, which would go on to kill
27 people over the next four years in a campaign designed to crush
ETA. Many of the victims were mistaken targets.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year-old drive for an
independent state in the Basque country of northern Spain.
	   Ten other defendants in the kidnapping case _ policemen,
politicians and security officials _ received sentences ranging
from two years and four months to 10 years in prison.
	   The Supreme Court ruled Monday that they must begin serving
these terms while the government considers their requests for
pardons.

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Bowing three times before his corpse in a
traditional show of respect, Chinese leaders on Monday publicly
mourned the death of former president and veteran revolutionary
Yang Shangkun.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who succeeded Yang, and Premier
Zhu Rongji led a group of senior officials and Communist Party
elders in bowing before Yang's corpse, state television reported.
	   Accompanied by Yang's family members, the leaders then slowly
followed the military honor guard bearing Yang's body, covered with
the party's red flag with gold hammer and sickle, out of the No.
301 Hospital of the People's Liberation Army, state media said.
	   Yang's body was then taken for cremation at Babaoshan cemetery,
where many of China's revolutionary heroes are buried.
	   Yang died Sept. 14 in Beijing of an undisclosed illness at the
age of 91. A political commissar in the Red Army, Yang worked in
key party posts until he was purged by revolutionary leader Mao
Tse-tung in 1966.
	   Deng Xiaoping, architect of China's market-oriented economic
reforms, brought Yang back to the center of power in the late 1970s
and rewarded Yang's loyalty by making him state president from 1988
to 1992.

IOC comes out against Super League plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The International Olympic Committee
came out Monday against plans to create a European Super League
grouping the richest soccer clubs, arguing it would monopolize
income at the expense of smaller clubs.
	   An IOC delegation headed by President Juan-Antonio Samaranch
told European Union officials the lucrative television deals
planned under the super league would not profit soccer as a whole.
	   ``This is why a project like the Super League would be dangerous
since it would concern a select club of top teams and the money
they would generate would not trickle down to the provincial
clubs,'' said Jacques Rogge, the head of the European Olympic
Committees.
	   ``Our point is that the collective negotiations of television
rights is the only way to let money filter through from the top
level of sports to the grassroots,'' Rogge said.
	   The IOC called on the EU's Executive Commission to use its clout
to make sure an equitable system of revenue distribution continues
to exist.
	   The 15-nation EU showed the impact it can have on sports when it
forced the European soccer federation to apply the 1995 Bosman
ruling on free agency and scrap limits on EU foreigners.
	   The EU Commission is investigating whether the collective
bargaining of soccer federations for the television rights of all
their league clubs is compatible with EU antitrust laws or whether
clubs should be allowed to negotiate these rights individually.
	   Again, granting such rights to individual clubs would jeopardize
the current system of solidarity between rich and poor clubs, Rogge
said.
	   ``If it becomes a jungle where every club can negotiate for
itself, then you won't have a redistribution effect anymore,'' he
told The Associated Press.
	   The current Champions League system of the UEFA European soccer
federation still has such a solidarity principle, said UEFA
Secretary General Gerhard Aigner. Just over 68 percent of Champions
League revenue goes to the participating teams, with the rest going
to smaller clubs, national federations and special projects.
	   UEFA opposes the plans for a rival Super League.
	   On Monday, Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone said he was
interested in plans by Milan-based company Media Partners to form
the breakaway European Super League involving clubs like Manchester
United, Arsenal, Juventus, Inter and AC Milan, Barcelona, Real
Madrid and Bayern Munich.

Malaysian government accused of blocking unfavorable footage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Politics
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian officials blocked for
several hours satellite transmission of TV footage from the arrest
of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim and street protests
in Kuala Lumpur, news organizations said Monday.
	   The British Broadcasting Corp. and Independent Television News
both reported they were prevented from sending footage of the huge
crowds that shouted slogans against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
on Sunday and pictures of policemen firing tear gas at protesters.
	   The government-owned broadcasting house, which allows visiting
broadcasters to uplink to satellites, relented after diplomats
intervened.
	   ``We can confirm that this is happening and we are urgently
pursuing the matter with the Malaysian authorities,'' a British
Foreign Office spokesman said.
	   ``All restrictions have now been lifted and everybody is feeding
as normal,'' Paul Newman, a correspondent for BBC, said late
Monday.
	   ``The Malaysians were basically censoring stuff as it was
leaving by satellite,'' Newman added.
	   Queen Elizabeth II began a four-day state visit to Malaysia on
Sunday, the same day fired deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim led
some 35,000 demonstrators through the streets. Anwar was arrested
later the same day for threatening national security.
	   Many of the British television crews covering the royal visit
Sunday turned their cameras to the widespread protests. Dozens of
TV crews, stationed in Kuala Lumpur for the Commonwealth Games,
also rushed out to cover the political developments.
	   ``We have been censored on three occasions by the Ministry of
Information. In the last hour they have called to say there will be
no more interference,'' said Keith Catchpole of TV New Zealand.

Liberal party says Germany needs new national anthem
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS SCHMOLL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A liberal Greens party leader says Germany needs a
new national anthem to promote a common identity between east and
west, still undefined eight years after the former communist East
merged with the capitalist West.
	   East Germany's anthem was abolished along with the communist
state in 1990. United Germany adopted the ``Deutschlandlied,''
already being used by the western half.
	   Creating a new anthem would help cement a feeling of unity,
leading Greens lawmaker Werner Schulz said Sunday. Two-thirds of
East Germans said in a recent poll that they still do not feel
citizens of a united Germany, and some Greens politicians feel that
the use of the old anthem only exacerbates that feeling.
	   Schulz, a civil rights activist in the East during communism,
said the Greens would insist on a new anthem if they enter a
coalition with the center-left Social Democrats after national
elections Sept. 27.
	   The Social Democrats said Monday they are against the idea.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling Christian Democrats also oppose a
new anthem.
	   Schulz's proposal was triggered by a pre-election debate over a
musical composition marking the anniversary of German unification.
	   Reaction to the Unity Day piece, which blends excerpts from the
old East German anthem with the current national anthem, ironically
underscores how Germans from the two halves are still struggling
with feelings of disunity.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his allies condemn the ``musical
collage'' as tasteless and disrespectful to the memory of those who
suffered under communist repression. Leftists, who like the
composition, say the conservatives are stomping on the
sensitivities of 18 million former East Germans in their effort to
score political points.
	   The composition is to be played Oct. 3 during the national
celebration of Unity Day in the city of Hanover.

YMCA's honorary chairman in the Czech Republic dead at 72
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Lubor Drapal, who was instrumental
in the renewal of the Young Men's Christian Association in the
Czech Republic in 1990, died Monday, his wife said.
	   Iva Drapalova said that her husband, 72, died from a long
illness after he was rushed to hospital early Monday.
	   Drapal, who was limited only to inferior jobs and was jailed
several times under the former Communist rule, became instrumental
in the YMCA's renewal in the country after the 1989 collapse of the
totalitarian regime and became the association's honorary chairman
in early 1990s.
	   He also helped to revive the association in the Ukraine.
	   In Czechoslovakia, the YMCA was founded in 1921 but was
disbanded by the communists in 1950. It was renewed here in 1990.
	   Drapal is survived by wife and two sons.

Queen Elizabeth presides over festive closing of Commonwealth
</HEADLINE>
Games &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Ignoring their nation's political
turmoil for a night, more than 90,000 Malaysians cheered Britain's
Queen Elizabeth II in a floodlit stadium Monday during the closing
ceremony of the Commonwealth Games.
	   Malaysia laid on a sumptuous display at a time when its economy
is shrinking fast amid Asia's financial crisis. There were
fireworks, multi-colored, revolving spotlights, dancers in purple
robes and soldiers parading with fixed bayonets.
	   There were also fears that anti-government activists might try
to use the event as a high-profile stage for their cause. Helmeted
riot police with clubs and shields patrolled outside the stadium,
but there were no demonstrations.
	   Earlier in the day, police fired tear gas outside a Kuala Lumpur
courthouse to disperse several thousand supporters of Anwar
Ibrahim, the former deputy of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and
now his most persistent critic.
	   Anwar was arrested Sunday night at his home and faces charges of
sodomy, which is a crime in Malaysia. His allies say the government
trumped up the charges to silence him.
	   In a meeting Monday with Mahathir, Britain's foreign secretary,
Robin Cook, urged the Malaysian leader to ensure that the unrest
did not disrupt the visit of Queen Elizabeth.
	   Mahathir attended the closing ceremony of the games, which
included such standards as swimming and track and field and
additions including rugby, cricket, netball, tenpin bowling, field
hockey and squash.
	   He was cheered when he went to the center of the stadium before
greeting the queen.
	   The British monarch traditionally closes the Commonwealth Games,
which are held every four years. About 5,000 athletes from 70
countries, most of them former British territories, participated in
the two weeks of sporting contests this year.
	   She delivered her closing declaration after a spectacular burst
of fireworks over the stadium that drew shrieks of delight from the
crowd.
	   Earlier, the queen and her husband, Prince Philip, entered the
nearly full National Stadium, which was built especially for the
games, in a glistening black convertible.
	   Cameras flashed and row upon row of spectators roared their
delight as she raised her gloved hand in greeting. They showed no
interest in political activism, instead raising their arms in a
traditional crowd-pleasing stunt called the ``wave.''
	   ``You can see all these people are happy. They're not worrying
about politics,'' said Abdul Jalil, a 47-year-old supervisor at a
rubber plantation.
	   The city of Manchester, England, is host for the next games. In
a live television hookup from that city, thousands of people in a
square cheered and waved at the Malaysian spectators.
	   Led by flag-bearers, the athletes then paraded around the Kuala
Lumpur stadium. The good will faded briefly when the crowd booed
the contingent from Singapore, which is mired in political and
economic disputes with neighboring Malaysia.
	   Despite the pomp, many Malaysians are suffering economic
hardship and discontent is growing. Anwar's supporters want to tap
that sentiment to erode the authority of Mahathir, who has governed
for 17 years with a tight grip.
	   ``Some people are thinking now only about the Commonwealth
Games,'' said games volunteer Abdullah Hussin. ``Maybe after the
games, they'll concentrate on politics.''

Calibration train hits construction wagon on high-speed tracks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ A train used to calibrate a new stretch of
high-speed railway hit a construction wagon on the tracks doing 200
kilometers (125 mph) an hour, forcing officials to close the
Berlin-Hanover line for six hours early Monday.
	   High-speed service between Berlin and Hanover is scheduled to
open Sept. 27, the day Germans elect a new parliament. Chancellor
Helmut Kohl inaugurated the line last week.
	   Three construction workers jumped off the tracks as the
calibration train approached, avoiding injury in the early morning
collision about five kilometers (2 1/2 miles) east of Stendal in
eastern Germany.
	   German railway spokesman Reiner Latsch said the construction
company had a contract to work on the line, but had not cleared
with anyone before getting on the track.

Laos communist party wants 6-7 percent GDP increase
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The ruling Laotian communist party has
completed its annual congress and said it is determined that the
country's economy grow by 6 to 7 percent in 1999, government radio
reported Monday.
	   The central committee of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party,
agreed at the recently concluded 12-day meeting to push for the
increase in the gross domestic product in spite of several
difficulties, the report said.
	   It pointed to Southeast Asia's economic crisis and unfavorable
weather that has taken its toll on the agriculture sector for the
third year in a row. One of the most underdeveloped countries in
the world, Lao's economy is heavily based on agriculture.
	   The party also discussed how to ensure social and political
stability.
	   The meeting was held in the Laotian capital of Vientiane and
chaired by party chief Khamtay Siphandone, who is also the
president of the country.

Blair calls for new strategies at IMF, World Bank
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Recent global economic turmoil highlights a need
to reform the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday.
	   The two institutions were created in 1944 at a conference in
Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to help create a new economic order
in the aftermath of World War II _ and critics say they have failed
to keep pace with the dramatic changes in global economics.
	   The IMF lent dlrs 25 billion over the last year as the Asian
economic crisis unfolded _ and it now urgently needs more money,
Blair said in remarks prepared for a speech at the New York Stock
Exchange.
	   But the prime minister added this is a good time to overhaul the
entire global economic system _ making finance more open to lessen
lending risks.
	   ``The current crisis illustrates the weaknesses of the existing
international financial system,'' Blair said. ``It needs to be
modernized to meet the challenges of a new century.''
	   Blair cited several priorities for a new global financial
system:
	   _Greater openness and transparency by national governments,
which will encourage them to pursue sounder monetary and fiscal
policies.
	   _Improved financial supervision and regulation _ with greater
coordination among regulators in different countries as they
supervice international financial institutions. Blair said the IMF
and the World Bank should also focus on the ways various countries
are preparing their financial institutions for any potential
computer problems occurrding in the year 2000.
	   _Nations must have better ways to provide short-term capital to
troubled countries that are trying to shape up _ something that the
IMF is not equipped to do as it negotiates loans in exchange for
policy changes in affected countries.
	   _Massive capital flows across borders must be better assessed by
regulators and lenders alike, so loans can be more appropriately
priced in relation to their riskiness.
	   _More accountability by the big financial institutions
themselves, and ``more systematic external evaluation of IMF
policies.''
	   The global nature of the modern economy means that any new order
cannot be developed only by governments or a few rich
industrialized nations, Blair said. They will need input from
developing nations and outside experts he said.
	   Blair called for a new plan to be drawn up within one year, ``so
that we can have the reformed institutions in place before the new
millennium.''
	   ``This is not a matter for a few technical changes,'' Blair
said. ``We should not be afraid to think radically and
fundamentally. We need to commit ourselves today to build a new
Bretton Woods for the next millennium.''

Singapore markets worried by Malaysia crisis but little impact so
</HEADLINE>
far

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The political crisis in Malaysia could unnerve
some investors in neighboring Singapore, but the unrest was
unlikely to do much real damage to the city state's economy or its
markets, analysts said Monday.
	   The two countries are closely linked by social and economic
ties, and investors here have been keeping a close watch on
Malaysia after it was jolted by violent demonstrations and the
arrest on Sunday of reformist leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``Obviously, any uncertainty in the region affects the
investors' confidence,'' said Richard Johnson of ABN Amro Asia
Securities in Singapore.
	   Anwar was arrested after he led marchers calling for the
resignation of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Police
fired tear gas and a water cannon Monday in an attempt to disperse
a crowd of Anwar supporters in the capital, Kuala Lumpur.
	   Worries about the unrest drove the Singapore dollar lower
against the U.S. currency early Monday, dealers said. The U.S.
dollar bought 1.73 Singapore dollars, up from about 1.72 in late
Asian trading Friday.
	   But analysts said Malaysia's political upheaval was unlikely to
do any serious damage to the economy of Singapore, or to Malaysia
itself, because there was little chance the protests there would
escalate into the kind of rioting in Indonesia that brought down
President Suharto in May.
	   That view was reconfirmed by Singapore's senior statesman Lee
Kuan Yew, who predicted late Sunday that Malaysia will not erupt in
civil disorder.
	   Singapore investors were more worried about Malaysia's recent
decision to virtually close its economy to foreign investors, said
Chia Yew Boon, research director for Santander Investment
Securities in Singapore.
	   Malaysia hoped to halt dramatic market declines by imposing
controls on currency and stock trading by foreigners. But the new
rules, Chia said, ``can only result in a more painful, bigger fall
later on.''
	   The Stock Exchange of Singapore fell sharply Monday, but traders
attributed the decline mostly to domestic factors and worries about
big drops on larger Asian stock exchanges.
	   The benchmark Straits Times Index fell 30.15 points or 3.3
percent to close at 882.59 points Monday.

U.N. refugee agency welcomes ratification of land mine treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The ratification of a treaty aimed at eliminating
anti-personnel land mines will make the task of returning refugees
to former war zones easier and safer, the U.N. refugee agency said
Monday.
	   As well as preventing future laying of land mines, it will
encourage authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cambodia, Mozambique
and elsewhere to do more mine clearing, said U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees spokesman Kris Janowski.
	   The ratification would also help reduce refugees' reluctance to
return to their homes because they fear that mines are still buried
nearby, he said.
	   Nations that ratify the treaty pledge to destroy all stockpiles
of mines within four years and clear all mines from their territory
within 10 years.
	   UNHCR estimates that up to 700,000 mines are still planted in
areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina which were in the front line during the
war. ``The mine pollution is enormous,'' Janowski said.
	   In a press release, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako
Ogata welcomed the ratification of the treaty, entitled the
Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production
and Transfer of Anti Personnel Mines and their Destruction.
	   ``It's a gigantic step toward the safety of returning
refugees,'' Ogata said.
	   The treaty will take effect March 1, 1999. The United Nations
made the announcement last Wednesday after the West African nation
of Burkina Faso became the 40th country to ratify the pact.
	   The treaty required ratification by 40 nations and their
legislatures to go into effect in those countries.
	   The United States has refused to sign or ratify it, maintaining
that mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter North Korea
from invading South Korea. Russia and China are also holding out,
contending they need land mines for defensive purposes.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each
year, mostly innocent civilians.

EU tests marred by widespread reports of cheating, confusion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Tens of thousands of people seeking
jobs in the European Union's executive Commission may have to sit
exams again amid reports of cheating and poor organization during
last week's EU-wide tests.
	   The EU Commission said Monday it was looking into allegations by
candidates of widespread irregularities and poor organization
during the tests.
	   Last Monday, 31,000 people sat the competition in 38 centers
across the EU for jobs in the EU Commission that require a
university degree. Of that figure, only 475 people will be
selected, said Commission spokeswoman Ann D'Haen-Bertier, who
organized the event.
	   ``So far we have had about 15 complaints by candidates,'' she
said. But ``what we have discovered at this stage does not warrant
at all a cancellation'' of the tests, she added.
	   Candidates complained that despite a rule forbidding them to
leave the room during the tests, many people did in fact leave to
go to the bathroom where they made calls on their mobile phones.
	   ``People were given instructions not to get up during tests.
People did get up,'' D'Haen-Bertier acknowledged. But she said
sometimes ``you can't prevent people from going to the bathroom.''
	   There were also reports of results being leaked before the
tests, of confusing questions, and of bad organization, she said.
Most of the complaints concerned Rome, and Brussels, where 5,500
candidates took the tests.
	   In Milan, the tests were delayed for an hour after people showed
up at the wrong address because of a street name that existed both
in the city and in one of the suburbs.
	   The EU Commission said it will investigate the reports. ``We
will decide one way or the other what steps to take within the next
15 days,'' EU spokeswoman Martine Reicherts said.
	   She said if there were irregularities, the event would have to
be rescheduled.
	   The exams for the Commission's level-A jobs, which require a
university degree, were the first to be held in five years.
	   Some 15,000 people work at the Commission's headquarters.

Japan will grant Laos dlrs 1 million to help boost economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Japan has agreed to grant Laos
144,951,000 yen (dlrs 1.07 million) in aid to help boost the
country's ailing economy and improve living standards, Laos
government radio said Monday.
	   Much of the grant will go towards paying a massive debt for the
second phase of the Nam Ngum hydropower station, the radio
reported.
	   The communist country of about 4.6 million people is one of the
least developed in the world. The government is determined to make
Laos, which borders the Mekong River, the leading exporter of
hydroelectric power in the Southeast Asia region.
	   The agreement was signed last week by Phongsavath Boupha, deputy
minister of foreign affairs, and Hiroomi Sakai, Japan's ambassador
to Laos.
	   Japan is one of Laos' leading donors.

Moderate concedes defeat, vows to struggle for democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The moderate Bosnian Serb
president conceded defeat Monday by a hard-liner in this month's
election. She vowed to continue fighting for democracy in the
Serb-ruled part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``I'm addressing the public not as the president, but as a
member of my coalition,'' incumbent President Biljana Plavsic said
in acknowledging her loss to extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
	   Although the final tally of Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 vote won't be
known until later this week, election officials have indicated that
Poplasen defeated Plavsic, the American favorite.
	   Such an outcome would deal an unexpected blow to a key part of
the West's strategy in Bosnia: bringing Serbs, Muslims and Croats
back together after a 3 1/2 Bosnian war that ended in 1995 with a
U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   Since Plavsic, a former nationalist, turned moderate about a
year ago, the United States and other Western powers have invested
millions of dollars into the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, hoping
to make Serbs forget their wartime goal of dividing Bosnia and
joining Serbia.
	   In her first appearance since the elections, Plavsic said that
`Regardless of election results, my coalition `Harmony' will stick
to its policies ... based on respect of the Dayton peace agreement
and a legal state.''
	   A grim-faced Plavsic said she has no intention of leaving the
political scene and that her coalition's concept is a ``long-term
project, the only one that can bring progress to my countrymen.''
	   ``We were the ones who opened the door for Republika Srpska to
the rest of the world,'' Plavsic said. ``It would be absurd for
whoever wins these elections to attempt to close that door.''
	   Plavsic held a presser together with her two coalition partners.
	   Socialist Zivko Radisic _ the most likely candidate to win the
seat as Bosnian Serb member in the Bosnia's three-member presidency
_ said these incident-free elections were ``historic'' and could
present a chance for the future.
	   Reformist Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik _ who will likely
be replaced by a hard-liner once Poplasen takes power _ predicted
``difficult political struggle in the times ahead.''
	   A last-minute candidacy by a Muslim for the presidency of the
Bosnian Serb sub-state appeared to drew away tens of thousands of
refugee and Muslim votes from Plavsic _ thereby helping Poplasen.
	   ``I wouldn't blame them, it's normal for people who remain
homeless and poor to be bitter and dissatisfied,'' Plavsic said.
	   ``How could they have even voted for those who made them
refugees in the first place?'' Dodik asked.
	   ``Serbs seem to me obsessed with heir own demise,'' he
concluded.

Zambian President Chiluba shuffles Cabinet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ President Frederick Chiluba shuffled his
Cabinet Monday, firing a minister who favored giving a tax rebate
to the soft drinks giant Coca-Cola.
	   Enoch Kavindele, who on Sunday criticized a government tax on
materials imported by Coca-Cola after the drinks maker shut down
its operations in Zambia, was replaced as commerce minister by
former Information Minister David Mpamba.
	   Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa, whose police and
immigration officials handled a recent influx of refugees from
fighting in Angola and the Congo, was shifted to the labor
ministry.
	   Tourism Minister Katele Kalumba took over Machungwa's job and
Newstead Zimba went from the labor ministry to head the information
ministry, said Richard Sakala, Chiluba's spokesman.
	   Kavindele was the only minister fired in the shuffle, but Sakala
refused to link his removal to the Coca-Cola controversy.
	   On Sunday, Kavindele said suspension of production by Coca-Cola
subsidiary Zambia Bottlers in a dispute over a 25 percent duty on
imported raw materials for its soft drinks threatened at least
19,000 jobs at the bottlers and suppliers.
	   He called for a tax rebate for Coca-Cola and a reduction of
import duty to 5 percent.
	   Sakala said the government was in negotiations with Coca-Cola
over the duty that earlier this month doubled the price of Coke in
Zambia.
	   ``The issue is being addressed,'' Sakala told reporters.
	   Kavindele, a wealthy construction tycoon, defected to Chiluba's
ruling party from the main opposition group, the United National
Independence Party, in 1996.
	   He has repeatedly urged cabinet colleagues to speed up
market-led economic reforms and improve investment incentives.
	   Finance Minister Edith Nawakwi on Sunday accused Coca-Cola of
``blackmail'' by threatening to permanently shut down its
operations in Zambia.

More tourists visited Hong Kong in August
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Tourism in Hong Kong rose in August for a
second straight month despite Asia's economic crisis, with arrivals
up 4.9 percent from the same period a year earlier, officials
reported Monday.
	   The Hong Kong Tourist Association said 859,310 tourists visited
the territory in August, the highest monthly arrivals since May
1997.
	   Executive director Amy Chan said that while economic problems in
the region will continue to have a negative impact on travel, Hong
Kong is ``hopeful this modest recovery can be sustained.''
	   Arrivals from China climbed by 35 percent to 267,839, and
tourists from Taiwan rose by 2.6 percent to 166,500 from a year
earlier.
	   Japanese tourists, however, slipped 9.5 percent to 88,365,
though they remained the third-most-numerous visitors.
	   The number of visitors from other Asian countries were down
substantially, including South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and
Indonesia.
	   Overall, the association expects arrivals to be down 6 percent
this year, totaling fewer than 10 million.

International peacekeeping exercise held in western Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LVIV, Ukraine (AP) _ About 1,000 servicemen from 16 nations,
including 159 NATO troops, were completing peacekeeping exercises
Monday in western Ukraine, officials said.
	   The exercises, called Peace Shield '98, began last week at the
Yavorivsky training grounds and involved computer-simulated events
in an imaginary nation engulfed by an ethnic conflict.
	   Practical tasks were left to the Ukrainian-Polish battalion,
which trained outside the main framework of Peace Shield. Other
servicemen used computers and maps to design operations to maintain
stability and secure safe passage for humanitarian shipments and
refugees in the supposed conflict zone.
	   Britain, Russia and Uzbekistan sent observers to the exercise,
held under the auspices of NATO's Partnership for Peace program and
planned by the U.S. military.
	   The Peace Shield exercise was launched in 1996 and was the first
of its kind held on the territory of the former Soviet Union,
bringing together contingents from NATO countries and former Warsaw
Pact members.

NKorea: Security Council has no right to discuss satellite launch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ North Korea filed a formal protest Monday
with the U.N. Security Council, complaining about its discussion of
the reclusive country's recent satellite launch.
	   ``The satellite launch is not a matter to be discussed in the
Security Council, nor is there any precedent for such a
discussion,'' wrote North Korea's deputy ambassador, Kim Chang Guk.
	   ``The mere fact that those countries gathered in the Security
Council and slandered the satellite launch ... can be construed as
nothing but a peculiar phenomenon,'' his letter said.
	   The 15-member council urged North Korea on Sept. 15 to stop
launching any more ``objects'' without warning and urged
surrounding countries to refrain from retaliatory action.
	   North Korea launched what was initially believed to be a missile
on Aug. 31 over Japan's main island. The action alarmed nearby
countries, especially Japan, which filed a formal protest with the
council. The United States later confirmed that it was a satellite
that failed to reach orbit.
	   Both the council and Japan said they were alarmed by North
Korea's action because the satellite was launched through heavily
used commercial air space and part of it landed in busy sea lanes.
	   In its letter, North Korea said it ``has never been informed in
advance by any countries, including Japan, which launched
satellites in the past.''
	   North Korea said it will continue its ``full-fledged use of
outer space for peaceful purposes, no matter what other countries
may say about it.''

More bodies found in Kosovo village
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DOBRATIN, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Residents of this Kosovo village
found two more bodies Monday, bringing the total of corpses found
to eight since Serb security forces swarmed the area to attack
guerrillas to the south last week.
	   Two elderly men who buried the bodies of a 58-year-old man and
his 37-year-old cousin early Monday said one was riddled with
bullets while the other had his jaw ripped off and his chest cut
open.
	   Avni Mucolli, a Dobratin politician, said he may disinter the
bodies if ethnic Albanian forensic investigators from Pristina make
it past police checkpoints that were stopping most traffic to this
village Monday.
	   He said investigators also plan to inspect the bodies of six
other men residents found on the weekend when they returned to
their village after fleeing an advance by Serb security forces
almost a week ago.
	   The six bodies were burned beyond recognition in charred area
houses.
	   Area residents say all eight men were farmers who returned to
their village last Thursday to feed their cows. They accuse police
of executing them.

Officials offer rice in exchange for rats in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Officials in a southern Philippine
province are offering to exchange a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of rice
for every 10 rats that residents can kill in an effort to combat a
costly rodent infestation, a provincial official said Monday.
	   Agriculturist Rey Lagaste said the program was launched this
week after some 4,000 hectares (9,720 acres) of rice and corn land
in South Cotabato province were destroyed by rats between May and
August of this year.
	   The rats have destroyed 138 million pesos (dlrs 3.2 million)
worth of crops, he said.
	   Lagaste said residents will have to submit the rats' tails as
evidence to receive the rice.
	   In the town of Tantangan, where the infestation is heaviest, the
program is expected to net up to 31,000 rats, he said.
	   He said the arrival of the rainy season has made the use of
chemicals to kill the rats ineffective.
	   Rat infestations, a yearly problem plaguing Philippine
agricultural lands, have spread to several provinces in the
southern portion of Mindanao island, one of the country's poorest
regions.

 &UR; Stocks tumble worldwide, Dow down 175 &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES thruout with Dow sinking, volume,
percentage change heading into Monday's session, UPDATES European
trading. Changes byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICIA LAMIELL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks plunged worldwide Monday, sending the Dow
industrials tumbling as much as 175 points, as traders followed the
latest disclosures on President Bill Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky and worried about global economic turmoil.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 100 points last
week, was down as much as 175.37 points in the opening minutes
before recovering a little of its lost ground. It still was off
165.81, or by 2.1 percent, at 7,729.85 by midmorning. Broader
indicators also were falling sharply in trading that was active but
well below Friday's heavy volume.
	   The retreat sent the Dow sliding even further below where it
started the year, at 7,908.25. As it began Monday's session, the
average of 30 blue-chip stocks already was 15.4 percent below the
record 9,337.97 set July 17.
	   Markets are unsettled by economic crises in Asia and Russia that
are threatening to spread to Latin America and are damaging
corporate profits. In addition, there is political uncertainty as
Congress Monday released the videotaped testimony of President
Clinton to a grand jury as well as thousands of pages of evidence
on his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   U.S. Treasury bonds, a traditional haven for funds in times of
unrest, rallied. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, which fall as
prices rise, dropped below 5.1 percent for the first time since the
government began regular auctions of the securities in 1977.
	   Stocks were weak worldwide.
	   The selling spree sent Tokyo's main index falling 2.8 percent to
a new 12-year low, while Hong Kong shares dropped 3.7 percent and
Indonesia's market skidded 5.5 percent to a seven-year low.
Singapore's Straits Times Index fell 3.3 percent to 882.59 points.
Malaysian shares slid 3.8 percent against a backdrop of violent
political protests.
	   Blue chips on the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest
market, were off 3.1 percent in the afternoon. Shares were down 4.6
percent in Frankfurt, Germany, and 4.5 percent in Paris.
	   ``Some companies are still to announce disappointing earnings
forecasts, and this is the only thing investors are watching
closely, no matter how good the macro-economic perspectives are,''
said Jean-Charles Gand, a trader at Societe Generale in Paris. Gand
predicted the ``volatile, bearish'' conditions would persist.
	   Asian traders found lots of excuses for selling _ including
disputes over banking reform in Japan, Malaysian political troubles
and Clinton's problems in Washington.

 &UR; YMCA's honorary chairman in the Czech Republic dead at 72

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Lubor Drapal, who was instrumental
in the renewal of the Young Men's Christian Association in the
Czech Republic in 1990, died Monday at age 72 after a long illness,
his wife said.
	   Iva Drapalova, a longtime Prague correspondent of The Associated
Press, said her husband was rushed to a hospital early Monday and
died soon afterward.
	   Drapal, who was jailed several times by the Communists, became
instrumental in the YMCA's renewal in the country after the 1989
collapse of the totalitarian regime and became the association's
honorary chairman in early 1990s.
	   He also helped to revive the association in the Ukraine.
	   The Czechoslovakian YMCA was founded in 1921 but was disbanded
by the communists in 1950. It was renewed here in 1990.
	   Drapal is survived by wife and two sons.

Iraq dlrs 1 billion under target in oil-for-food program
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq will be able to sell just dlrs 3
billion worth of crude during the current, six-month phase of the
U.N. oil-for-food program, or about dlrs 1 billion below target, an
Iraqi oil official said Monday.
	   Saddam al-Hassan, director-general of the State Oil Marketing
Organization, told The Associated Press that this would give the
country just dlrs 2 billion for food and other necessities. The
balance will go to war reparations and the cost of the U.N. weapons
monitoring program.
	   Al-Hassan blamed low world oil prices and production problems
because of the disrepair of Iraq's oil facilities.
	   Eric Falt, spokesman for U.N. humanitarian programs in Iraq,
acknowledged the shortfall but said it would not affect the
distribution of food, medicine and other necessities.
	   Falt also said that dlrs 300 million earmarked for the purchase
of spare parts to repair Iraq's oil facilities would be preserved.
	   ``Clearly other sectors will be affected,'' he added. These
include funds for agriculture, education and electric power
projects.
	   The United Nations agreed to increase the oil-for-food program
to dlrs 5.2 billion from the previous dlrs 2 billion every six
months. The program, an exception from U.N. trade sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, allows Iraq to sell oil to
buy necessities for its 20 million people.
	   Iraq had said it couldn't meet the dlrs 5.2 billion total and
set a target of dlrs 4 billion for the current six month period.
	   Al-Hassan said Iraq's current production was about 2.4 million
barrels a day, with exports averaging about 1.85 million barrels a
day.
	   But he said the industry was ``at a very critical stage'' and
that without spare parts, ``sooner or later we will have to
reduce.''
	   The United Nations earlier this year agreed that Iraq could
spend dlrs 300 million during the current phase for spare parts for
its oil industry.
	   Al-Hassan said Iraq has signed more than 270 contracts with
foreign firms for the supply of spare parts, covering most of the
dlrs 300 million earmarked for this.
	   He said that 80 of the contracts have been sent to the United
Nations for approval but that just 24 have been okayed so far.
Nothing has yet been delivered, he added.

Germany's central bank will investigate report of mole
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's central bank on Monday said
it would investigate a report in the Sunday Times of London that
claimed a high-level Bundesbank mole had betrayed Germany's
economic secrets to Britain.
	   A bank spokesman said they were ``surprised'' by the report, but
could not comment on the specifics. A German government spokesman
declined any comment on the report.
	   The Sunday Times quoted a former British spy, Richard Tomlinson,
who claimed a senior officer in the Bundesbank was recruited in

Love for mother brings controversial author home
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Facing death threat from Islamic
extremists, controversial author Taslima Nasrin said Monday she
risked her life for love of her ailing mother.
	   ``I know I've taken great risks. But I want to be with my mother
in her last days,'' Nasrin told The Associated Press by telephone
in her first interview since returning to her homeland, where her
presence has sparked angry protests.
	   ``I fear for my life. I don't know what is going to happen to
me,'' she said from her secret hide-out.
	   Nasrin, 36 , lived in self-imposed exile in Europe for four
years. She returned with her 60-year-old mother, Eid-ul-Ara Begum,
who underwent treatment in New York for colon cancer.
	   Islamic extremists already have announced a cash reward of
200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who kills Nasrin. Her
homecoming has provoked the extremists to renew the death threat
that forced her to flee the country in 1994.
	   Some Muslims were angered after a newspaper quoted Nasrin as
saying that the Koran, the Islamic holy book, should be rewritten.
	   She has denied making the comments, but suggested changes in the
Shariah, Islamic laws to give more rights to women in Bangladesh's
conservative Islamic society.
	   Her novel Lajja, or ``Shame,'' criticized Muslims for attacking
the country's minority Hindus after Hindu zealots destroyed a
mosque in neighboring India in 1992.
	   Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's liberal government is under
pressure to reopen a 1994 criminal case that accused her of
blaspheming Islam.
	   ``Taslima Nasrin is a self-confessed infidel. It's government's
moral obligation to arrest her for trial,'' Matiur Rahman Nizami, a
spokesman for the country's largest conservative Islamic party,
Jamaat-e-Islami, said in a press statement Monday.
	   The party plans a street protest Tuesday in Dhaka, the
Bangladesh capital.
	   Hundreds of Muslims paraded through the Dhaka streets on Friday
calling for Nasrin to be hanged.
	   A tiny minority here wants a state run according to Islamic law.
Bangladesh is a predominately Muslim country with a secular
constitution that has been run by a series of liberal governments.
	   Government lawyers said the case against Nasrin is pending and
she is still a fugitive in the eyes of law. Liberal writers have
criticized the anti-Nasrin protests and asked the government to
protect Nasrin.
	   Nasrin first fled to Stockholm, Sweden, in 1994 after former
Prime Minister Khaleda Zia's government ordered her arrest. From
there, she traveled to many European and American cities to speak
to writers and women's rights activists.

Nine Serb hard-liners removed from candidates lists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The international
organization overseeing the elections in Bosnia removed nine
Bosnian Serb hard-liners from the list of candidates Monday, as
punishment for violating election rules, officials said.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, or
OSCE, stopped short of punishing Nikola Poplasen, the leader of the
Bosnian Serb Radical party. Poplasen, who ran against
Western-backed incumbent Biljana Plavsic, now appears to have a
clear path to the Bosnian Serb presidency.
	   Six candidates of the Bosnian Serb Radical party were removed
from the lists for the national assembly of the Serb-run half of
Bosnia. The other three were removed from the lists for the House
of Representatives of the Bosnian parliament.
	   The decision is likely to be welcomed by the Serb hard-liners,
who were threatening mass demonstrations and even violence if OSCE
should remove Poplasen from the candidates lists.
	   On the eve of the Sept. 12-13 ballot, a television station from
neighboring Yugoslavia broke the pre-election media blackout by
carrying out an interview with Poplasen only a few hours before
polling stations opened.
	   OSCE has also said that immediately after the elections, their
international and local staff were exposed to harassment and
intimidation by Serb hard-line supporters.
	   The violations triggered debates among local and international
officials about whether Poplasen himself should be punished and
removed from the candidates lists.
	   Many international officials argued that such a decision, even
if legally justified, could be understood as international
tampering with election results and would seriously undermine the
authority of Western agencies and officials working towards peace
in Bosnia.
	   A Poplasen victory would be a humiliating setback for U.S.-led
efforts to boost the popularity of moderates among Bosnian Serbs
and sideline the extremist supporters of indicted war crimes
suspect Radovan Karadzic, including Poplasen.
	   It could also call into question the entire U.S.-European
strategy, which has been to funnel millions of dollars in aid to
those who support a multi-ethnic, unified Bosnian state.
	   International official said that despite Poplasen's lead,
preliminary election results show moderates doing well in other
races.
	   The OSCE, which was to release preliminary results last Tuesday,
has said no results will be released until a final tally is
available later this week.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ More than 1,500 workers demonstrated Monday
evening outside the headquarters of Hongkong Telecommunications
Ltd. to protest across-the-board wage cuts announced last week by
the company, one of Hong Kong's largest private employers.
	   The protesters, including teachers, social workers and other
unionists, crowded into a narrow sidewalk.
	   They chanted and waved placards reading: ``Against pay cuts''
and ``Protect our rights.''
	   Simon Wong, 32, a phone operator, said the company's move was
unfair, but workers had no other choice but to stay with the
company because ``there're no jobs out there.''
	   Hongkong Telecom, which employs 13,800 people, told its staff
last Thursday to take the 10 percent pay cut starting Nov. 1 or be
sacked. Workers and unions fear other companies would follow
Telecom's lead to cut wages, with unemployment in the territory
standing at a 15-year high of 5 percent.
	   Fung Ping-kwong, treasurer of one of the company's three main
unions, said union leaders failed to convince Hongkong Telecom to
rescind the pay cuts.
	   They asked the company to retract the cuts and instead offer
incentives for workers to resign or retire early to reduce costs.
He quoted management representatives as saying they would consider
the suggestion.
	   Union leaders said they would meet Tuesday to discuss further
action but refused to disclose any details, only saying they would
avoid jeopardizing telecommunications services.
	   Earlier, company spokeswoman Anita Choi said Hongkong Telecom
would continue negotiations.
	   Meanwhile, representatives from the Federation of Trade Unions,
Hong Kong's largest, met with Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa behind
closed doors Monday evening to discuss the issue.
	   A government statement quoted Tung as saying officials were
concerned about the labor dispute.
	   ``We appeal to employees to remain calm and continue to discuss
with management'' about a resolution, he said.
	   Many companies have folded or are suffering losses as Hong Kong
slid into recession because of the region's 14-month-old Asian
financial turmoil. Second quarter gross domestic product shrank 5
percent, and the economy is expected to shrink by 4 percent this
year.
	   Hongkong Telecom has laid off 270 managers so far this year, and
company Chief Executive Linus Cheung had said he could not rule out
further layoffs unless workers accept the wage cuts.
	   Earlier Monday, a smaller group of workers rallied outside the
the company's executive offices and presented a petition signed by
nearly 9,000 people.
	   Union officials had asked workers to refuse to work overtime
Monday, but union leaders said they couldn't estimate how many had
joined the action.
	   ``We hope Telecom won't sacrifice the workers' benefits and the
company's reputation ... for its own short-term gains,'' said
lawmaker Lee Cheuk-yan, secretary-general of the Confederation of
Trade Unions.

Brawling lawmakers apologize to South Africa for public fistfight
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Two lawmakers who punched each
other in the face after a rowdy parliamentary session apologized on
Monday for their public brawl.
	   Grim-faced and humble, Johnny de Lange of the ruling African
National Congress and Manie Schoeman of the opposition National
Party, told a hushed parliamentary chamber they were sorry for
fighting.
	   ``I would like to apologize unconditionally to the people of
South Africa,'' de Lange said ``I am not proud of having been party
to what happened.''
	   The fight broke out last Thursday after an acrimonious afternoon
session had been adjourned. As arguing lawmakers clustered around
the parliamentary speaker's chair, television cameras showed
Schoeman hit de Lange in the face. De Lange then turned around and
floored Schoeman with a blow to the chin.
	   Four years after all-race elections ended apartheid, many South
African lawmakers are still adjusting to a multi-racial, democratic
parliament. Loud heckling and shouted insults are common on both
sides in debates where former commanders of the ANC's armed wing
sit opposite the army generals they once fought.
	   However, speaker Frene Ginwala read out a joint statement from
the ANC and the National Party that said the fight should not be
seen as indicating any ``deep-seated animosity'' between the
parties.
	   Ginwala warned that politicians in South Africa had a special
duty to conduct themselves in a civilized manner due to the
country's violent past and high crime rate.
	   ``What took place ... is a step towards breakdown of the social
compact in this country,'' she warned.
	   Schoeman was suspended for five days and de Lange for one day.

Moderate quake rattles eastern Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ A moderate earthquake shook eastern
Romania Monday, but there were no reports of damage or injury, a
spokeswoman for the Earth Physics Institute said.
	   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 3.8, occurred at
16:49 (1149 GMT) in the Vrancea region in the eastern Carpathian
mountains, some 175 kilometers (103 miles) northeast of the
capital.
	   It rumbled at a depth of 140 kilometers (87 miles) and was not
felt in the capital, said spokeswoman Doina Dumitru by telephone
from the Bucharest institute.
	   More than 30 minor earthquakes hit the Vrancea region every
year, most of them causing no damage. Romania's last serious quake
left over 1,000 people dead and destroyed hundreds of buildings in
March 1977.

Ukraine's National Bank against using reserves to support hryvna
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS government decision on oil, crackdown planned on debtors;
SUBS 3rd graf to CORRECT figure to 2.34 billion. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's Central Bank has no plans to use
its hard currency reserves to support the shaky currency, the
bank's chairman said Monday.
	   Speaking at a government meeting, Viktor Yushchenko said
National Bank reserves now stand at about dlrs 1 billion following
the arrival of the first installments of loans from the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
	   The sharp fall in the National Bank reserves, from dlrs 2.34
billion at the start of 1998, resulted from its earlier attempts to
defend the hryvna.
	   The currency remained relatively stable in the first half of
1998 despite the departure of some foreign investors.
	   The Russian economic crisis, however, has pushed the hryvna down
from 2.1 to the U.S. dollar in mid-August to 2.99 on Friday, and
the government has been forced to expand its currency fluctuation
band.
	   ``Today the emphasis in supporting the hryvna is not placed on
spending the reserves but on modifying the currency market, trade
policies and payment operations,'' Yushchenko said, according to
the Interfax news agency.
	   He cited measures taken by the National Bank to limit dollar
trading and said these steps were ``adequate in the present
financial situation.''
	   Over the weekend, Yushchenko insisted that there was no
immediate threat of the hryvna slipping beyond the new fluctuation
corridor of 2.5 to 3.5 to the dollar, and no grounds to speak of a
further devaluation.
	   Still, Ukrainian bankers widely expect the hryvna to remain
under pressure, and they believe the limits of the fluctuation band
will be reached within days.
	   In other economic developments Monday:
	   _ Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko said his cash-strapped
government will crack down on companies that are slow in paying
back state credits in spite of ``having money on their accounts.''
About dlrs 150 million in state credits are to be returned by the
end of 1998, he said.
	   _ The government decided to purchase Ukrainian-produced oil and
send it to domestic refineries directly, without commercial
intermediaries. Last year, Ukraine produced 2.9 million tons of
oil, covering about 10 percent of its annual needs, according to
Interfax.
	   Pustovoitenko said the new scheme would make it easier for the
government to pay for the oil and ensure proper supplies for the
the refineries, some of which have been affected by the recent
decline in Russian oil supplies.

	   PARIS (AP) _ France's Socialist Party on Monday said that
Kenneth Starr is an ``unsavory figure'' obsessed with sex and that
the real victim of his investigation is not the American president
but America itself.
	   ``This is the Lewinsky soap opera now adapted for television,''
said Frederique Bredin, party national secretary, referring to the
videotape of President Clinton's grand jury testimony.
	   She made her comments during a weekly press briefing for the
party of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin. She spoke hours before the
videotape was being released.
	   Jospin himself, referring to the airing of the tape around the
world, called for a sense of respect.
	   ``I believe that the sense of respect that is due to all people
should be maintained by all, on the other side of the Atlantic (the
United States) as here,'' he said during a ceremony at the Justice
Ministry.

Commonwealth secretary general to meet Nigerian leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku said
Monday he will meet Nigeria's new military ruler later this month
and hopes the west African nation can soon rejoin the club of
Britain and its former colonies.
	   Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has repeatedly signaled that he
intends to break from his predecessor's oppressive policies; he has
released some political prisoners and promised to hold democratic
elections next year.
	   Gen. Sani Abacha, died of a heart attack in June, ending five
years of brutal rule and defiance of world condemnation for
usurping democratic elections. But Nigeria remains suspended from
the Commonwealth for the 1995 execution of nine opposition
activists.
	   Anyaoku, who will meet Abubakar in London on Sept. 23, said the
Commonwealth ''has been impressed with the actions taken so far by
the new authorities in Nigeria to ensure a speedy and workable
transition to a credible democracy.''
	   ''We have offered our help to make sure the proper structures
are in place for a transition that will genuinely reflect the will
of the Nigerian people,'' said Anyaoku, who visited Nigeria in
June.
	   He said renewed contacts with Nigeria, which remains suspended
from the Commonwealth for the 1995 execution of nine opposition
activitists, were ''important steps in this process.''
	   ''I am confident that a credible transition in Nigeria will
reopen the way for its return to its rightful place in the
Commonwealth family and the wider international community,'' he
said.

U.N. refugee agency welcomes ratification of land mine treaty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The recent ratification of a treaty aimed at
eliminating anti-personnel land mines will make the task of
returning refugees to former war zones easier and safer, the U.N.
refugee agency said Monday.
	   As well as preventing future laying of land mines, last week's
ratification will encourage authorities in Bosnia-Herzegovina,
Cambodia, Mozambique and elsewhere to do more mine clearing, said
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Kris Janowski.
	   It will also help reduce refugees' reluctance to return to their
homes, he said.
	   Nations that ratify the treaty pledge to destroy all stockpiles
of mines within four years and clear all mines from their territory
within 10 years.
	   The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling,
Production and Transfer of Anti Personnel Mines and their
Destruction required ratification by 40 nations and their
legislatures to go into effect in those countries.
	   The United Nations announced ratification last Wednesday after
the West African nation of Burkina Faso became the 40th country to
ratify the pact.
	   The treaty will take effect March 1, 1999.
	   UNHCR estimates that up to 700,000 mines are still planted in
front-line areas of Bosnia-Herzegovina. ``The mine pollution is
enormous,'' Janowski said.
	   The United States has refused to sign or ratify the treaty,
maintaining that mines are needed on the Korean peninsula to deter
North Korea from invading South Korea. Russia and China are also
holding out, contending they need land mines for defensive
purposes.
	   Tens of millions of land mines are scattered in more than 60
countries, and they kill or injure an estimated 20,000 people each
year, mostly innocent civilians.

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was shocked to
hear that Afghanistan's Taliban militia had killed some Iranian
diplomats after he had intervened to save their lives, Libya's JANA
news agency reported Monday.
	   Gadhafi had personally intervened with Taliban leader Mullah
Mohammed Omar after Iran announced the kidnapping of 10 diplomats
and an Iranian reporter when the militia captured the northern
Afghan town of Mazar-e-Sharif on Aug. 8, the agency said.
	   ``We have been told from the mouth of Taliban's leader that they
know nothing about the diplomats and the search for them ended with
no result,'' Gadhafi told the agency.
	   On Sept. 10 the Taliban acknowledged its militiamen had killed
nine of the 11 Iranians. The reporter was among those killed. Two
of the diplomats made there way back to Iran.
	   ``We are shocked and feel strong indignation for this
regrettable development,'' Gadhafi said.
	   He said he had hoped the Iranians would be released.
	   Gadhafi warned of a ``Zionist and imperialist conspiracy against
Islam ... aimed at igniting a regional war to destroy the Asian
Islamic nations.'' He did not elaborate.
	   This month Iran massed tens of thousands of troops on its border
with Afghanistan. Taliban leaders say they have rushed troops to
the frontier region to repulse any Iranian attack.
	   Tehran says the Taliban still holds at least 50 more Iranians.
It says most are truck drivers who were delivering food, medicine
and other humanitarian goods to needy Afghans. The Taliban militia
says they were delivering weapons to its opponents.

Nile Basin water ministers to meet in Tanzania Wednesday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, TANZANIA (AP) _ Water ministers from countries of the
Nile basin will meet this week to endorse a move to treat all
equally, a Tanzanian official said Monday.
	   ``This is a major milestone in the Nile cooperation and an
important precondition for reaching consensus on a strategic action
programme for the Nile, acceptable to all countries,'' said Idris
Mutila of the Water Ministry.
	   Mutila said the Wednesday meeting would be attending by
representatives from Burundi, Rwanda, Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia,
Sudan and Egypt as well as from hosts Tanzania.
	   Two other nations in the group _ Congo and Eritrea _ will
apparently not be sending representatives.
	   The setting up of a new mechanism that would treat all 10 member
states equally was discussed Sunday by members of the new Nile
Technical Advisory Committee.
	   Mutila said representatives would also try to agree on policy
guidelines and the action necessary to achieve sustainable
development through equitable use of Nile waters.
	   A 1959 agreement divvied up the Nile between Egypt and Sudan,
giving populous Egypt rights to three times as much water as Sudan.
Sudan has often complained the agreement is unfair, although it has
never used its full allotment.
	   Egypt uses nearly 100 percent of its annual share _ 55.5 billion
cubic meters.
	   An estimated 85 percent of the river's total flow comes from the
Blue Nile, that rises at Lake Tana in Ethiopia. Until recently,
Ethiopia had not paid much attention to Nile issues, mainly because
of domestic conflict and problems.

Soccer players' association investigates effects of headers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The association representing soccer players in
England is doing research on whether heading the ball can cause
long-term brain damage.
	   The Professional Footballers Association said Monday its
findings would not be available for several years. Other studies
have shown brain damage and other brain diseases may occur from the
practice.
	   In announcing the research, PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor
said he believed the risks were minimal.
	   ``With scanning techniques these days we should have a clear
idea,'' Taylor said. ``By conducting these studies we are not
looking to be alarmist. The benefits of playing sport, and football
especially, are obviously considerably greater.
	   ``From what I understand so far, any potential risk is only
slight. We are certainly not going to ban heading and we certainly
don't want people not playing the game because of this.''

King calls for unity, tolerance on eve of resurrected holiday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN ZHELEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ On the eve of a holiday that had been
banned by communists, former king Simeon II urged Bulgarians to
drop political and ethnic differences and work together to
establish a stable democracy and market economy and fight
corruption and crime.
	   Bulgaria will celebrate the 90th anniversary of its independence
Tuesday. On Sept. 22, 1908, Simeon's grandfather, Prince Ferdinand,
declared his country independent from Turkey and adopted the title
czar.
	   His act defied a treaty between European powers and Turkey,
under which Bulgaria had remained a principality vassal to the
Ottoman Empire after a Russian-Turkish war in 1878 ended 500 years
of harsh Turkish rule.
	   Bulgaria's government recently restored Sept. 22 as a national
holiday. It had been banned after communists seized power in 1944.
They linked the holiday to the royal dynasty, which they fiercely
opposed.
	   In an address carried by the state news agency BTA, Simeon
called for ``uniting the efforts of all patriotic Bulgarians to
come out of the economic catastrophe to which the country was
led.'' He was referring to an unprecedented economic crisis that
ended former communists' rule in 1997 and paved the way for the
current reformist government.
	   Alluding to the 800,000 ethnic Turks that live in the country of
8.2 million, Simeon appealed for ``integration of all compatriots,
no matter what their ethnic origin, in the country's social life.''
	   He also urged, ``united efforts of all political parties in the
struggle against corruption and crime.''
	   Simeon, 60 enjoys popularity because of he is non-partisan, and
has a European touch.
	   He is a businessman who lives in Spain and has enjoyed
tumultuous welcomes while visiting his homeland twice in the past
couple of years.
	   Simeon acceded to the throne at the age of 6 and reigned under
regencies after his father Boris III died in 1943. He was exiled in
1946 when monarchy was abolished by a referendum that many believed
the communists had rigged.

Moderate concedes defeat, vows to struggle for democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with OSCE disqualifying Bosnian Serb candidates in
grafs 6-8, fixes typos.
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The moderate Bosnian Serb
president conceded defeat Monday by a hard-liner in this month's
election. She vowed to continue fighting for democracy in the
Serb-ruled part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``I'm addressing the public not as the president, but as a
member of my coalition,'' incumbent President Biljana Plavsic said
in acknowledging her loss to extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
	   Although the final tally of Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 vote won't be
known until later this week, election officials have indicated that
Poplasen defeated Plavsic, the American favorite.
	   Such an outcome would deal an unexpected blow to a key part of
the West's strategy in Bosnia: bringing Serbs, Muslims and Croats
back together after a 3{ Bosnian war that ended in 1995 with a
U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   Since Plavsic, a former nationalist, turned moderate about a
year ago, the United States and other Western powers have invested
millions of dollars into the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, hoping
to make Serbs forget their wartime goal of dividing Bosnia and
joining Serbia.
	   In Sarajevo Monday, the Organization for Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE pulled nine Bosnian
Serbs from the candidate lists as punishment for violating election
rules, but stopped short of removing Poplasen.
	   OSCE disqualified six candidates of the Bosnian Serb Radical
party from the lists for the national assembly of the Serb-run half
of Bosnia. The other three were removed from the lists for the
House of Representatives of the Bosnian parliament for violating
pre-election rules.
	   A television appearance by Poplasen in neighboring Yugoslavia on
the eve of the Sept. 12-13 elections triggered a debate whether the
presidential candidate should also be punished.
	   In her first appearance since the elections, Plavsic said that
``Regardless of election results, my coalition `Harmony' will stick
to its policies ... based on respect of the Dayton peace agreement
and a legal state.''
	   A grim-faced Plavsic said she has no intention of leaving the
political scene and that her coalition's concept is a ``long-term
project, the only one that can bring progress to my countrymen.''
	   ``We were the ones who opened the door for Republika Srpska to
the rest of the world,'' Plavsic said. ``It would be absurd for
whoever wins these elections to attempt to close that door.''
	   Plavsic held a presser together with her two coalition partners.
	   Socialist Zivko Radisic _ the most likely candidate to win the
seat as Bosnian Serb member in the Bosnia's three-member presidency
_ said these incident-free elections were ``historic'' and could
present a chance for the future.
	   Reformist Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik _ who will likely
be replaced by a hard-liner once Poplasen takes power _ predicted
``difficult political struggle in the times ahead.''
	   A last-minute candidacy by a Muslim for the presidency of the
Bosnian Serb sub-state appeared to drew away tens of thousands of
refugee and Muslim votes from Plavsic _ thereby helping Poplasen.
	   ``I wouldn't blame them, it's normal for people who remain
homeless and poor to be bitter and dissatisfied,'' Plavsic said.
	   ``How could they have even voted for those who made them
refugees in the first place?'' Dodik asked.
	   ``Serbs seem to me obsessed with their own demise,'' he
concluded.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ A Kuwaiti company said Monday it will be building
the Middle East's first plant for manufacturing catalysts, which
are key components for oil refining, at a cost of dlrs 41 million.
	   ``Construction will start in November and, hopefully, we will be
producing in the first half of the year 2000,'' Saad al-Din Akasha,
managing director of the Kuwait Catalyst Co., told The Associated
Press.
	   The plant will produce 5,000 tons of the chemical a year. He
said that would cover Kuwait's needs and about half the demand of
other Arab Gulf countries.
	   Akasha said the factory would put Kuwait in the ``forefront of
oil support industries.''
	   Catalysts are used for removing sulfur and undesirable metals
from oil products, thus improving quality and quantity of oil from
refineries.
	   Kuwait Catalyst Co. was established last year with a paid-up
capital of 7 million dinars (dlrs 22.87 million). It is owned by a
group of Kuwaiti investors and four Japanese companies.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Energy Minister Habibollah Bitaraf met
Monday with Oman's ambassador, Abdullah bin Salem al-Shanfari, to
discuss expanding bilateral cooperation in power and water
projects.
	   The official Islamic Republic News Agency said that Bitaraf felt
that cooperation in the field of energy was ``a suitable area for
expansion of mutual cooperation.''
	   He noted that the Iranian company Mabna won an international
tender to build a 40-megawatt power plant in Oman.
	   Al-Shanfari carried a message from Oman's energy minister
accepting an invitation to pay an official visit to Tehran next
February.

Kohl challenger's campaign faces late trouble
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Anthem Debate &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder has campaigned on the
promise he'll give Germany the best of both worlds _ more jobs and
also more social programs. But less than a week before elections,
his strategy has lost its shine.
	   Just as his strong lead in the polls over Chancellor Helmut Kohl
fell apart, the Social Democrat faced pressure from a would-be
Cabinet member to come clean on the tough economic choices the
nation faces.
	   Party officials ignored the split Monday, announcing they would
focus the final days of campaigning before the Sept. 27 election on
Kohl's broken promises not to raise taxes.
	   With little time left, Schroeder clearly hopes to squeak by
without changing a message that Kohl's Christian Democrats have
hammered for months as vague and lacking substance.
	   So far, he has avoided being pinned down between his
business-friendly reputation and his campaign rhetoric, which
sticks close to the party platform and its defense of social
welfare programs.
	   But Schroeder's own would-be economics minister Jost Stollmann,
a nonpartisan software entrepreneur, rocked the boat this weekend
by urging sharp cuts in welfare-state spending and taxes in
newspaper interviews.
	   After Schroeder publicly considered defeat for the first time,
the party rushed Monday to polish up the sure-winner's image that
buoyed him until recently and could be decisive in swaying
undecided voters.
	   The Social Democrats' party chief, Oskar Lafontaine, said he was
sure Kohl's recovery was only a temporary surge after a strong
showing by his Bavarian allies in a Sept. 13 state vote.
	   ``We firmly expect the Social Democrats to be the strongest
party in the new parliament,'' he told reporters.
	   Schroeder sounded different in an interview in the latest
edition of the weekly Der Spiegel, saying ``the world won't go
under'' if he loses.
	   Kohl, in power for 16 years, has tried to freshen up his
campaign for the final stretch with a law-and-order theme. He says
he will seek to widen the scope of a law that allows police to
eavesdrop on suspected criminals in private homes.
	   But it's mainly the momentum from the Bavarian election _ won by
his conservative allies last weekend _ that Kohl seems to be
counting on.
	   ``I am quite certain that this last week is decisive,'' Kohl
said Monday.

India, Pakistan criticized for nuclear testing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ India and Pakistan joined the ranks
Monday of traditional targets Iraq and North Korea for flaunting
nuclear weapons conventions, as the U.N. atomic agency opened its
annual conference.
	   This spring, India and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear
weapons tests that drew international condemnation.
	   ``Japan finds the nuclear tests totally unacceptable as they
pose a grave challenge to the international non-proliferation
regime and seriously undermines stability in South Asia,'' Yukata
Takeyama, chairman of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, told
delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference.
	   India claimed to have detonated five nuclear devices in May, and
Pakistan said it had detonated six devices in response. The tests
triggered fears that the two countries would use nuclear weapons in
their dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.
	   Several governments, including the United States, Japan and the
European Union, urged the two to refrain from nuclear weapons
testing and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
	   As in previous years, Iraq and North Korea also drew criticism
for their nuclear policies at the start of the U.N. nuclear
watchdog agency's weeklong meeting.
	   Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA, said his
agency's inspection and verification operations have given it
insight into Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programs, but ``a
degree of uncertainty remains as to the completeness of this
picture.''
	   In August, Iraq limited IAEA access to declared nuclear sites,
preventing the agency from inspecting new sites or investigating
the lingering questions about the country's program, ElBaradei
said.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told a press conference
``Iraq is still in substantial violation of numerous (U.N.)
Security Council resolutions.
	   ``The United States, for one, is keeping all options on the
table to ensure that Iraq complies,'' with the resolutions,
Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
added.
	   North Korea also was criticized by ElBaradei for failing to
cooperate with the IAEA. In particular, North Korea has not
preserved material the IAEA needs to verify the accuracy of
information the country has provided on its nuclear program.

<TEXT>
	   At one point, the president was asked about the truthfulness of
the deposition he gave in a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against
him by Paula Jones.
	   He explained: ``My goal in this deposition was to be truthful
but not particularly helpful. I did not wish to do the work of the
Jones lawyers. I deplored what they were doing. I deplored the
innocent people they were tormenting and traumatizing. I deplored
their illegal leaking. I deplored the fact that they knew, once
they knew our evidence, that this was a bogus lawsuit, and that
because of the funding they had from my political enemies, they
were pushing ahead. I deplored it. But I was determined to walk
through the minefield of this deposition without violating the law,
and I believe I did.''

 &UR; Lewinsky writes of ``intimate and emotional relationship''
	   Lewinsky's first official statement to law enforcement, her
handwritten profer given to FBI agents on Feb. 1, 1998,
acknowledges her relationship with Clinton. In the first numbered
paragraph, Lewinsky wrote in neat printing:
	   ``Ms. Lewinsky had an intimate and emotional relationship with
President Clinton beginning in 1995. At various times between 1995
and 1997, Ms. Lewinsky and the president had physically intimate
contact. This included oral sex, but excluded intercourse.''

 &UR; Lewinsky recalls end of relationship as D-Day _ ``Dump Day''
	   Lewinsky, in her Aug. 6, 1998, grand jury testimony, described
phone messages left on her answering machine by Clinton.
	   Asked if she remembered any particular messages from Clinton,
Lewinsky replied, ``I remember them all.''
	   ``They're pretty innocuous. Sometimes _ or one time, it was, you
know, 'Sorry I missed you.' One time, it was just 'Hello.' And then
one time he called really late at night when I was not at home and
it was whispered kind of loudly, you know, 'Come on. It's me.'
Something like that. It was always nice to hear his voice.''
	   Clinton told Lewinsky he was uncomfortable leaving her messages.
``I think he felt it was a little unsafe,'' she said.
	   Lewinsky said Clinton broke off the relationship on May 24,
1997.
	   Lewinsky had a name for the date: ``D-Day.'' Asked what that
stood for, she replied, ``Dump Day.''

Moderate concedes defeat, vows to struggle for democracy

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The moderate Bosnian Serb
president conceded defeat Monday to a hard-liner in this month's
election. She vowed to continue fighting for democracy in the
Serb-ruled part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``I'm addressing the public not as the president, but as a
member of my coalition,'' incumbent President Biljana Plavsic said
in acknowledging her loss to extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
	   Although the final tally of Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 vote won't be
known until later this week, election officials have indicated that
Poplasen defeated Plavsic, the United States' favorite.
	   Such an outcome would deal an unexpected blow to a key part of
the West's strategy in Bosnia: bringing Serbs, Muslims and Croats
back together after a 3 1/2 Bosnian war that ended in 1995 with a
U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   Since Plavsic, a former nationalist, turned moderate about a
year ago, the United States and other Western powers have invested
millions of dollars into the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, hoping
to make Serbs forget their wartime goal of dividing Bosnia and
joining Serbia.
	   In Sarajevo Monday, the Organization for Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE pulled nine Bosnian
Serbs from the candidate lists as punishment for violating election
rules, but stopped short of removing Poplasen.
	   In her first appearance since the elections, Plavsic said that
``Regardless of election results, my coalition `Harmony' will stick
to its policies ... based on respect of the Dayton peace agreement
and a legal state.''
	   A grim-faced Plavsic said she has no intention of leaving the
political scene and that her coalition's concept is a ``long-term
project, the only one that can bring progress to my countrymen.''
	   ``We were the ones who opened the door for Republika Srpska to
the rest of the world,'' Plavsic said. ``It would be absurd for
whoever wins these elections to attempt to close that door.''
	   Reformist Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik _ who will likely
be replaced by a hard-liner once Poplasen takes power _ predicted
``difficult political struggle in the times ahead.''
	   A last-minute candidacy by a Muslim for the presidency of the
Bosnian Serb sub-state appeared to have drawn away tens of
thousands of refugee and Muslim votes from Plavsic _ thereby
helping Poplasen.
	   ``I wouldn't blame them, it's normal for people who remain
homeless and poor to be bitter and dissatisfied,'' Plavsic said.
	   ``How could they have even voted for those who made them
refugees in the first place?'' Dodik asked.
	   ``Serbs seem to me obsessed with their own demise,'' he
concluded.

Sri Lankan president decries recruitment of children in civil war
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Sri Lanka's president on Monday denounced
the recruitment of children as fighters by Tamil rebels in her
country's civil war and called for the world community to come
together to fight terrorism.
	   In a speech before the 53rd session of the General Assembly,
Chandrika Kumaratunga told world leaders that the objective of the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Elam was to create a mono-ethnic society
in Sri Lanka.
	   She called it ``an objective totally unacceptable to the
overwhelming majority in the country and even to the very community
whose cause the LTTE claims to represent.''
	   Many of Sri Lanka's 3.3 million minority Tamils, who comprise 18
percent of the population, accuse the majority Sinhalese of
widespread discrimination in education and jobs. They are seeking
an independent homeland in the north and east and have fought a
15-year war that has killed more than 54,000 people.
	   ``A particularly cruel offense against the innocence of children
is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group in Sri Lanka to
serve as suicide killers in the name of a cause they are too young
to even comprehend,'' she said.
	   The adoption of the U.N. convention on the suppression of
terrorist bombings, the president said, was a considerable moral
victory for the international community. But she cautioned that
signing the treaty wasn't enough.
	   ``When we enact legislation, we must also be eternally vigilant
to ensure that terrorists do not find loopholes in our laws or use
procedural delays to circumvent the emerging international
consensus against terrorism,'' she said.
	   She decried what she said was the Tamil's use of front
organizations to raise money ``which end up in the LTTE war chest
to contribute towards murdering and brutalizing our people.''
	   The president has said she will not negotiate with the Tamil
rebels unless they surrendered their arms.
	   The government attempts at finding a negotiated settlement, most
recently in 1995, ended in failure with the guerrillas resuming
attacks on the military.

Hong Kong's foreign reserves stand at dlrs 92.1 billion
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's foreign exchange reserves fell 4.6
percent to U.S. dlrs 92.1 billion at the end of August from a month
earlier, following the government's intervention in the stock and
currency markets, the central bank announced Monday.
	   In releasing the figures, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the
territory's de facto central bank, did not say how of that was
spent to shore up the stock market and maintain the Hong Kong
dollar's fixed exchange rate of 7.80 to the U.S. dollar.
	   During the last two weeks in August, the Monetary Authority
bought blue-chip stocks and Hang Seng Index futures contracts in a
widely publicized attempt to chase speculators out of its markets.
	   Hong Kong has the third largest foreign reserves in the world,
behind Japan's dlrs 209.3 billion in August and China's dlrs 140.6
billion in July, the monetary authority said.

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The moderate Bosnian Serb
president conceded defeat Monday by a hard-liner in this month's
election. She vowed to continue fighting for democracy in the
Serb-ruled part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``I'm addressing the public not as the president, but as a

	   Although the final tally of Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 vote won't be
known until later this week, election officials have indicated that
Poplasen defeated Plavsic, the American favorite.
	   On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo advised Americans
against unnecessary travel to Serb-ruled parts of Bosnia because
``the emotional tone of the political rhetoric'' there is
increasing and ``may serve to heighten tensions in the area.''
	   A victory by Poplasen would deal an unexpected blow to a key
part of the West's strategy in Bosnia: bringing Serbs, Muslims and
Croats back together after a 3{ Bosnian war that ended in 1995 with
a U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.

	   In Sarajevo Monday, the Organization for Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE, disqualified nine
Bosnian Serb candidates for violating election rules, but stopped
short of including Poplasen.
	   OSCE disqualified six candidates of the Bosnian Serb Radical
party from the lists for the national assembly of the Serb-run half
of Bosnia. The other three were removed from the lists for the
House of Representatives of the Bosnian parliament for violating
pre-election rules.
	   A television appearance by Poplasen in neighboring Yugoslavia on
the eve of the Sept. 12-13 elections triggered a debate whether the
presidential candidate should also be punished.
	   In her first appearance since the elections, Plavsic said that
``Regardless of election results, my coalition `Harmony' will stick
to its policies ... based on respect of the Dayton peace agreement
and a legal state.''
	   A grim-faced Plavsic said she has no intention of leaving the
political scene and that her coalition's concept is a ``long-term

	   ``We were the ones who opened the door for Republika Srpska to
the rest of the world,'' Plavsic said. ``It would be absurd for
whoever wins these elections to attempt to close that door.''
	   Plavsic held a press conference together with her two coalition
partners.
	   Socialist Zivko Radisic _ the most likely candidate to win the
seat as Bosnian Serb member in the Bosnia's three-member presidency
_ said these incident-free elections were ``historic'' and could
present a chance for the future.
	   Reformist Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik _ who will likely
be replaced by a hard-liner once Poplasen takes power _ predicted
``difficult political struggle in the times ahead.''
	   A last-minute candidacy by a Muslim for the presidency of the

All must cooperate to fight financial, nuclear threat, Lampreia
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With the global financial crisis hitting
Brazil's stock and currency markets, the immediate cooperation of
all countries is needed to battle the problem, Brazil's foreign
minister said in the opening speech of the General Assembly on
Monday.
	   ``Experience teaches us that inaction can have a high cost,''
Luiz Felipe Lampreia told world leaders gathered for the assembly's
53rd annual debate. ``The world cannot depend only on the
willingness, capacity and interest of a select number of countries
to mobilize and lead international efforts in this or that
direction.''
	   In recent weeks, Brazil's stock and currency markets have been
battered by the Asian economic crisis that has seen investors
fleeing Asia, Russia and other developing markets.
	   Brazil has lost some dlrs 25 billion in reserves in recent
weeks, but the country still has about dlrs 50 billion in foreign
reserves _ making a successful speculative attack on the currency
unlikely for now.
	   Lampreia said part of the problem rests with industrialized
nations who fail to treat developing countries as equals.
	   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso made the same
criticism Sunday against the group of seven industrialized nations,
known as G-7, for failing to expand to include developing
countries.
	   Lampreia said, ``The events of the past few months have revealed
a serious lag between growing financial interdependence and the
modest effectiveness of existing international mechanisms for
dialogue and coordination.''
	   In his speech, Lampreia also emphasized the urgency of curbing
nuclear proliferation. Last week, Brazil ratified the international
treaty designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons.
	   ``There is no longer room or justification for postponing action
in the nuclear field or in the broader fight to eliminate all
weapons of mass destruction,'' he said. ``The cost of omission
could be truly catastrophic and the risks are evident to all.''
	   In May, rivals India and Pakistan detonated nuclear devices
heightening the possibility of nuclear conflict in South Asia.

Bank deal beginning to unravel on eve of U.S.-Japan summit

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Ruling and opposition politicians presented sharply
divergent interpretations Monday of their compromise to save
Japan's faltering financial system, raising fears the crucial
agreement is in danger of falling apart.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic party wrangled with opposition
groups most of last week to strike a deal on the key bank
legislation before Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi left Sunday for his
first summit with U.S. President Clinton.
	   Obuchi wanted to present a concrete plan to dispel criticism in
the United States that Japan is moving slowly in cleaning up its
bad loan mess.
	   Obuchi meets Clinton Tuesday. But by Monday in Tokyo fears that
the deal was unraveling had sent Japanese stock prices spiraling
down to a new 12-year low.
	   At issue is the fate of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan Ltd. and other lenders staggering under the weight of bad
loans, many of which were made before Japan entered a prolonged
slump eight years ago.
	   On his way to the United States, Obuchi signaled Monday that
LTCB _ one of the country's biggest banks _ would not be allowed to
fail, an apparent contradiction of opposition claims the bank would
be declared insolvent and run by the government.
	   ``If the Long-Term Credit Bank were to fail, it would cause a
major impact on the global economy,'' Obuchi told reporters.
	   Meanwhile, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiromu Nonaka expressed
support for using 13 trillion yen (dlrs 97.5 billion) in previously
approved funds to bail out troubled banks, indicating the ruling
party was backing away from a concession to scrap the funding plan.
	   Opposition leader Naoto Kan, head of the Democratic Party of
Japan, responded with a warning the entire pact was in danger of
falling apart.
	   Another opposition leader, Democratic Socialist Party head
Takako Doi, said she doubted the compromise would be made into law
without significant alterations.
	   ``Whether there was really an agreement between the ruling party
and the opposition is a question,'' Doi said Monday. ``A lot is
going to change while the agreement gets written into law.''
	   The uncertainty comes before details of the preliminary accord
are hammered out in a package of six bills. The ruling party needs
opposition support if the bills are to win passage in the upper
house of Parliament, where it does not have a majority.
	   A third contested issue involves the oversight powers of Japan's
Finance Ministry, which has been tainted by its inability to
resolve the banking industry's woes and the implication of its
officials in an influence-peddling scandals earlier this year.
	   The opposition has demanded that the ministry's regulatory
authority over the financial industry be wholly transferred to a
separate institution.
	   Nonaka, however, said Monday that the ministry is unlikely to
lose its policy planning and global finance monitoring functions.
	   While politicians appeared to again be reaching a loggerhead
over the bills, an international credit rating agency, Fitch IBCA,
cut its rating on Japan's foreign debt citing the slow policy
response to the financial problems.
	   And with Japan's banks in clear need of help, the political
struggles concerned many analysts.
	   ``It is distressing to see how much political time is being
taken up by bickering,'' said Brian Waterhouse, a banking analyst
in the Tokyo office of James Capel Pacific Ltd.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Domestic politics will keep the prime
ministers of rivals India and Pakistan from bringing along pledges
to sign the nuclear test ban treaty when they go to New York this
week.
	   But Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan and Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India
will at least hold talks Wednesday on the sidelines of the U.N.
General Assembly session each will address _ an important step in
this volatile, newly nuclear region.
	   ``The entire international community is actually saying that
India and Pakistan have to sit down and resolve their
differences,'' said Maleeha Lodhi, editor of the Pakistani
newspaper The News and her country's former ambassador to
Washington. ``The best you can expect is that it will reduce
tensions.''
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars _ two over the
disputed state of Kashmir _ in the 51 years since the independent
states were carved out of the British empire.
	   They continue to exchange angry words and occasionally heavy
fire over Kashmir _ a factor that has exacerbated international
concern over their tit-for-tat nuclear weapons tests in May.
	   Vajpayee and Sharif met for the first time following the tests
in July during a regional summit. Those talks ended with India and
Pakistan each accusing the other of intransigence, and their armies
unleashing the heaviest firing across Kashmir in recent memory.
	   But since then, their foreign secretaries have met and
reportedly made progress that could result in Vajpayee and Sharif
agreeing over lunch on Wednesday to set a date for resuming peace
talks.
	   ``The reality is that things are going to move slowly. But we're
talking,'' said Jasjit Singh, director of New Delhi's independent
Institute for Defense Studies and Analyses. He cautioned that
differences remain deep between India and Pakistan, particularly
over Kashmir.
	   Nations around the world responded angrily to the series of
nuclear tests begun by India, slapping economic sanctions on both
countries and calling on them to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, known as the CTBT.
	   The U.N. atomic energy agency opened its annual conference on
Monday with members sharply criticizing the two states in language
usually reserved for pariahs like Iraq and North Korea.
	   ``Japan finds the nuclear tests totally unacceptable as they
pose a grave challenge to the international non-proliferation
regime and seriously undermines stability in South Asia,'' Yukata
Takeyama, chairman of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, told
delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference.
	   The CTBT is believed at the center of ongoing talks on nuclear
policy the United States is holding separately with India and
Pakistan. As part of that process, Vajpayee envoy Jaswant Singh was
to meet with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott Tuesday
in Washington.
	   India and Pakistan say they have no plans for further nuclear
tests _ but signing the CTBT still presents problems.
	   Sharif's opposition walked out when he tried to rally support
for the treaty during a special session of parliament earlier this
month. Both Indians and Pakistanis are unwilling to be seen as
bowing down before the world's main power, the United States.
	   For years, Indian politicians have denounced the CTBT as doing
too little to encourage Britain, China, France, Russia and the
United States to destroy their nuclear arsenals while denying most
other countries the chance to improve their own security by
conducting nuclear tests.
	   In exchange for signing the CTBT, Vajpayee wants access to
nuclear energy technology India has been denied because the
material also has military uses. So far, the United States appears
to have offered no deals.

Last opposition fighters begin return to Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The last group of opposition fighters who fled to
Afghanistan during Tajikistan's civil war were to begin their way
home Monday, a news agency reported.
	   About 250 fighters and 50 refugees were set to return to
Tajikistan in accordance with a peace deal signed last year, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Escorts from the National Reconciliation Commission will
accompany the group to Tajikistan's border. Some of the ex-rebels
are said to be in poor health, and all will receive medical
examinations, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Military observers from the United Nations will oversee parts of
the operation.
	   The U.N.-brokered peace accord provides for opposition fighters
to be integrated into the government's armed forces and for
opposition leaders to hold a number of key government positions.
	   Despite the peace accord that ended the civil war, the hard-line
government and the mostly Islamic opposition clash periodically.
Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace deal and wage turf
battles with one another.

Suspect arrested as terrorist suspect undergoes questioning
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A suspect arrested last week in Germany
as an alleged terrorist involved in the bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania last month, underwent questioning in Munich on Monday, a
Bavarian state official said.
	   Christoph Hillenbrand, spokesman for the state interior
ministry, said that the suspect, identified as Mamdouh Mahmoud
Salim, told investigators he was in Germany on ``some minor private
business.''
	   The United States was seeking extradition of the suspect in
connection with the bombings, and a state justice ministry source
said the extradition proceedings were to begin Tuesday.
	   According to investigators, Salim had a visa issued by a German
embassy and the required invitation from a resident. He said that
person also was being checked out.
	   Salim was arrested Wednesday at a car dealership near Munich on
a tip from Interpol in Washington, officials said.
	   Hillenbrand said he could not confirm a report by the
Munich-based Focus magazine that said Salim was in Germany to work
out a financial network for internationally sought terrorist Osama
bin Ladin.
	   Bin Ladin is a millionaire Saudi dissident wanted by the United
States for alleged involvement in the bombings that killed 259
people, 12 of them Americans, and injured more than 5,000.
	   Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein told German
television Sunday the man had arrived in Munich from Sudan.

Romania and Kazakhstan to discuss Old Silk Road and Caspian oil
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Kazak President Nursultan Nazarbayev
is to discuss reviving the Old Silk Road and rich oil reserves from
the Caspian Sea when he meets his Romanian counterpart Monday.
	   Romania's President Emil Constantinescu is keen that a planned
pipeline transporting oil from Central Asia to Western Europe and
the Middle East would pass through Romania.
	   A two-day conference on ``Caspian Energy to Europe'' is to take
place in Bucharest, opening Sept. 27. Oil company executives from
the United States, Italy and former Soviet republics are expected
to attend the meeting to discuss the route of the pipeline.
	   Nazarbayev arrived in the Romanian capital late Sunday and is
scheduled to depart early Tuesday. The two countries are expected
to sign various agreements, including one avoiding double taxation,
the private news agency Mediafax reported.

India, Pakistan criticized for nuclear testing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The U.N. atomic energy agency opened its
annual conference on Monday with members sharply criticizing
Pakistan and India in language usually reserved for pariahs like
Iraq and North Korea.
	   This spring, India and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear
weapons tests that drew international condemnation.
	   ``Japan finds the nuclear tests totally unacceptable as they
pose a grave challenge to the international non-proliferation
regime and seriously undermines stability in South Asia,'' Yukata
Takeyama, chairman of Japan's Atomic Energy Commission, told
delegates at the International Atomic Energy Agency conference.
	   India claimed to have detonated five nuclear devices in May, and
Pakistan said it had detonated six devices in response. The tests
triggered fears that the two countries would use nuclear weapons in
their dispute over the Himalayan region of Kashmir.
	   Several governments, including the United States, Japan and the
European Union, urged the two to refrain from nuclear weapons
testing and to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
	   As in previous years, Iraq and North Korea also drew criticism
for their nuclear policies at the start of the U.N. nuclear
watchdog agency's weeklong meeting.
	   Mohamed ElBaradei, director general of the IAEA, said his
agency's inspection and verification operations have given it
insight into Iraq's clandestine nuclear weapons programs, but ``a
degree of uncertainty remains as to the completeness of this
picture.''
	   In August, Iraq limited IAEA access to declared nuclear sites,
preventing the agency from inspecting new sites or investigating
the lingering questions about the country's program, ElBaradei
said.
	   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told a press conference
``Iraq is still in substantial violation of numerous (U.N.)
Security Council resolutions.
	   ``The United States, for one, is keeping all options on the
table to ensure that Iraq complies,'' with the resolutions,
Richardson, the former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,
added.
	   North Korea also was criticized by ElBaradei for failing to
cooperate with the IAEA. In particular, North Korea has not
preserved material the IAEA needs to verify the accuracy of
information the country has provided on its nuclear program.

Rebels capture town in eastern Congo near strategic air base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila have captured the eastern town of Kamituga in South
Kivu region, rebel officials said Monday.
	   The town, which is about 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of
the Lake Kivu town of Bukavu on the way to Kindu, a strategic air
base, was captured Friday, rebel officials said.
	   They said they now also control the northeastern town of Isiro,
380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kisangani, Congo's third
largest city, which has been in rebel hands for several weeks.
	   Isiro, which sits on the northeastern crossroads of the route
west across northern Congo, was captured Thursday at the same time
rebels captured Matila, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Shabunda
also en route to Kindu.
	   It was not possible to confirm the claims independently.
	   Rebel information officer Etienne Ngongura said Monday that
South Kivu regional capital Bukavu and the rebel stronghold of Goma
at the northern end of Lake Kivu were calm despite government
claims that its forces were surrounding both towns.
	   ``Both towns are safe,'' Ngongura said in Goma. ``There are no
threats.''
	   One week ago, local Mai-Mai traditional fighters and Rwandan
Hutu rebels allied with government forces attacked Goma for six
hours before withdrawing.
	   Ngongura dismissed as ``psychological warfare'' unconfirmed
reports that forces loyal to Kabila had distributed leaflets in
Goma warning of another attack.
	   He said he had not seen any leaflets, but even if they had been
circulated, it was only meant to frighten residents and had no
military significance.
	   Truck drivers plying the route between Goma and Masisi and
Rutshuru to the north said the roads were safe, and there appeared
to be no buildup of military activity in the area.
	   The rebellion, led by disgruntled soldiers and Kabila's
political opponents, broke out Aug. 2. The rebels made rapid
advances from their eastern base and even managed to capture
several key bases in the far west of the country.
	   But they were driven back when Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
poured men and equipment in to save the capital, Kinshasa, from
rebel capture.
	   Kabila claims Uganda and Rwanda are the driving forces behind
the rebellion. Uganda admits it has troops in northeastern Congo to
defend its security interests, and Rwanda has reserved the right to
intervene to protect itself from Rwandan Hutu rebel attacks.
	   Both countries, which were instrumental in putting Kabila in
power 16 months ago, now say he has failed to get rid of Ugandan
and Rwandan rebels who are using eastern Congo as a base from which
to attack Uganda and Rwanda.

Kohl backs defense minister's call for sending troops to Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Chancellor Helmut Kohl, in jab at his
election rival, reiterated support Monday for the possibility of
sending German troops and other international forces to quell
violence in Kosovo.
	   The question of sending troops has become an issue in Sunday's
national election, with Kohl and his Christian Democrats casting
doubt on whether Kohl's challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, would
support NATO intervention in the Serb-controlled province of
Yugoslavia.
	   Schroeder's center-left Social Democrats, if victorious in the
vote, could form a coalition with the environmentalist Greens
party, which is against all weaponry and would most likely oppose
sending troops to Kosovo.
	   Social Democrat party leader Oskar Lafontaine has criticized
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe for making Kosovo an election issue.
	   Kohl's comments Monday were in direct support of Ruehe and his
push for NATO intervention in the province, where secessionist
ethnic Albanian rebels have been fighting Serb troops since March.

Stocks tumble worldwide, Dow down 113
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: NEW throughout to UPDATE Dow coming back further from low for
the day, analyst quotes, UPDATES European trading; trims to
tighten. &QL; 
 &UR; By PATRICIA LAMIELL &QC;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks plunged worldwide Monday, sending the Dow
industrials tumbling as much as 184 points, as traders followed the
latest disclosures on President Bill Clinton's relationship with
Monica Lewinsky and worried about global economic turmoil.
	   But with no immediate fresh surprises from the newly released
Clinton testimony, stocks began recovering from their lows of the
day by late morning.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 100 points last
week, was down as much as 184.61 points in the morning. It was off
113.03, or by 1.4 percent, at 7,782.63 at late morning. With some
traders absent because of the observance of the Jewish New Year,
trading that was running well below Friday's heavy volume.
	   Broader indicators also were falling, but not as sharply as in
the early going.
	   In Asia, markets were unsettled by disputes over banking reform
in Japan, Malaysian political troubles and Clinton's problems in
Washington.
	   The selling spree sent Tokyo's main index falling 2.8 percent to
a new 12-year low, while Hong Kong shares dropped 3.7 percent and
Indonesia's market skidded 5.5 percent to a seven-year low.
	   In Europe, blue chips on the London Stock Exchange, Europe's
biggest market, were off 1.8 percent late in the trading day, above
its lows for the session. Shares were down 3.6 percent in
Frankfurt, Germany, and 3.5 percent in Paris.
	   Wall Street's retreat sent the Dow sliding even further below
where it started the year, at 7,908.25. As it began Monday's
session, the average of 30 blue-chip stocks already was 15.4
percent below the record 9,337.97 set July 17.
	   World markets are unsettled by economic crises in Asia and
Russia that are threatening to spread to Latin America and are
damaging corporate profits. In addition, there is political
uncertainty as Congress released the videotaped testimony of
President Clinton to a grand jury as well as thousands of pages of
evidence on his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   U.S. Treasury bonds, a traditional haven for funds in times of
unrest, rallied. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, which fall as
prices rise, dropped below 5.1 percent for the first time since the
government began regular auctions of the securities in 1977.
	   Hildegard Zagorski, a stock analyst at Prudential Securities,
said while the president's testimony did not appear to disclose
anything new, it was piled onto already serious problems elsewhere.
	   ``We're still on the ropes here,'' Zagorski said.''You've got
problems in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, and you have concerns about
corporate profits here. It's not a pretty picture.''

Moderate concedes defeat, vows to struggle for democracy

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with US Embassy advising Americans to avoid travel to
Serb area &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The moderate Bosnian Serb
president conceded defeat Monday to a hard-liner in this month's
election. She vowed to continue fighting for democracy in the
Serb-ruled part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``I'm addressing the public not as the president, but as a
member of my coalition,'' incumbent President Biljana Plavsic said
in acknowledging her loss to extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
	   Although the final tally of Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 vote won't be
known until later this week, election officials have indicated that
Poplasen defeated Plavsic, the United States' favorite.
	   On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo advised Americans
against unnecessary travel to Serb-ruled parts of Bosnia because
``the emotional tone of the political rhetoric'' there is
increasing and ``may serve to heighten tensions in the area.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ With Russia's economy in a tailspin, Russian
presidential hopeful Alexander Lebed came on a money-raising visit
to France and met Monday with the man credited with bailing out a
near-bankrupt New York City.
	   The private lunch with U.S. Ambassador Felix Rohatyn was one of
several meeting with officials as Lebed tried to shore up his
country's financial standing and shake out some funds for his
Siberian region's economy. No details of the lunch were available.
	   At the start of his two-day private visit to France, Lebed said
Russia's image abroad had suffered as a result of the ongoing
political crisis and that he had come to inform French leaders,
bankers and other officials of the situation.
	   The former general, who is now governor of the vast Krasnoyarsk
region in Siberia, met with Laurent Fabius, the Socialist president
of parliament.
	   ``Since Russia today makes an unfavorable impression, the
objective of the visit is to demonstrate that not everything is
bad,'' Lebed told reporters after meeting Fabius.
	   Lebed said he fully supported Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
whom Yeltsin appointed 10 days ago to lead the government and find
a solution to the current economic turmoil.
	   A poll aired Sunday night on Russia's prime weekly news program
Itogi showed Lebed would have strong chances to win the presidency
if elections were held now.
	   But Lebed, who finished third in the 1996 presidential vote, was
coy about his intentions in 2000 when the next election is
scheduled.
	   ``Life will show,'' whether or not he would run in the
elections, Lebed told journalists after meeting with Fabius.
	   His priority now was to make sure that workers in his region
were paid, that subsidies were paid to families in need.
	   Lebed has connections across France's political and business
spectrum forged during a six-day visit to France in 1997.

Amsterdam exchange closes at lowest level since January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with index closing. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Prices on the Amsterdam Stock
Exchange plunged Monday with the index closing at its lowest level
since January. Trade was also temporarily suspended for the first
time in a year.
	   Prices fell sharply on worries over Asia, the political troubles
of U.S. President Bill Clinton and a profit-warning from the
electronics giant Philips.
	   The 27-share AEX Index closed at 902.62 points, down 56.95
points or 5.9 percent, but up from its lowest level of 885.18
points at 1319 GMT.
	   When the index fell to that level, trade was suspended for 15
minutes, and the so-called cool down period kicked in. The pause
occurs whenever the 27-share AEX Index drops or rises 5 percent
from the opening level.
	   The index, already under pressure, plunged to its nadir shortly
after Philips issued a profit warning, saying it expects 1998
income from normal operations to remain equal to 1997 levels.
	   Philips said its income this year will be squeezed mainly by
losses at its U.S. telecommunication joint venture with Lucent.
	   Philips lost heavily and closed at 82.00 guilders (dlrs 42.93),
dropping 17.00 guilders (dlrs 8.90), or 17 percent.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman met
Monday with his Austrian counterpart, Viktor Klima to discuss his
country's entrance into the European Union and bilateral issues.
	   It was the first foreign visit by the Czech prime minister since
he took office in August.
	   Klima expressed his support for the Zeman's country joining the
European Union. The Czech Republic is among the six countries which
are expected to enter the EU in the next expansion stage. The
negotiations on membership will begin in November during the final
weeks of Austria's, EU presidency.
	   In addition, Klima said the issue of the Suedenten Germans, who
were expelled from Czechoslovakia after World War II, should remain
on a bilateral issue and not be tied to the Czech Republic's
joining the EU.
	   The two premiers agreed to set up a joint historical commission
to examine issues of the past, including the Sudeten Germans and
compensation for Czech forced laborers who worked for Austrian
companies during WW II.
	   Klima welcomed the initiation of an international commision to
examine the efficiency of the Czech nuclear power plant at
Tremelin, near the Austrian border. The Austrian prime minister
stressed the need to work towards European-wide nuclear safety
standards.
	   Austria is the only country in the world to have built a nuclear
power plant, then mothballed it after voting in 1978 by referendum
against putting it on line or having nuclear power.
	   Zeman also met with Austrian President Thomas Klestil and the
president of the national assembly, Heinz Fischer.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ With the global financial crisis hitting
Brazil's stock and currency markets, the immediate cooperation of
all countries is needed to battle the problem, Brazil's foreign
minister said in the opening speech of the General Assembly on
Monday.
	   ``Experience teaches us that inaction can have a high cost,''
Luiz Felipe Lampreia told world leaders gathered for the assembly's
53rd annual debate. ``The world cannot depend only on the
willingness, capacity and interest of a select number of countries
to mobilize and lead international efforts in this or that
direction.''
	   In recent weeks, Brazil's stock and currency markets have been
battered by the Asian economic crisis that has seen investors
fleeing Asia, Russia and other developing markets.
	   Brazil has lost some dlrs 25 billion in reserves in recent
weeks, but the country still has about dlrs 50 billion in foreign
reserves _ making a successful speculative attack on the currency
unlikely for now.
	   Lampreia said part of the problem rests with industrialized
nations who fail to treat developing countries as equals.
	   Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso made the same
criticism Saturday against the group of seven industrialized
nations, known as G-7, for failing to expand to include developing
countries.
	    &UR; Lampreia said, ``The, 7th graf pvs.

King calls for unity, tolerance on eve of resurrected holiday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VESELIN ZHELEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ On the eve of independence day
celebrations, former king Simeon II urged Bulgarians to drop
political and ethnic differences and work together to establish a
stable democracy and market economy and fight corruption and crime.
	   Bulgaria will celebrate the 90th anniversary of its independence
Tuesday. On Sept. 22, 1908, Simeon's grandfather, Prince Ferdinand,
declared his country independent from Turkey and adopted the title
czar.
	   His act defied a treaty between European powers and Turkey,
under which Bulgaria had remained a vassal to the Ottoman Empire
after a Russian-Turkish war in 1878 ended 500 years of direct
Turkish rule.
	   Bulgaria's government recently restored Sept. 22 as a national
holiday. It had been banned after communists seized power in 1944.
They linked the holiday to the royal dynasty, which they fiercely
opposed.
	   In an address carried by the state news agency BTA, Simeon
called for ``uniting the efforts of all patriotic Bulgarians to
come out of the economic catastrophe to which the country was
led.'' He was referring to an unprecedented economic crisis that
ended the former communists' rule in 1997 and paved the way for the
current reformist government.
	   Alluding to the 800,000 ethnic Turks that live in the country of
8.2 million, Simeon appealed for ``integration of all compatriots,
no matter what their ethnic origin, in the country's social life.''
	   He also urged, ``united efforts of all political parties in the
struggle against corruption and crime.''
	   Simeon, 60 enjoys popularity because of he is non-partisan.
	   He is a businessman who lives in Spain and has enjoyed
tumultuous welcomes while visiting his homeland twice in the past
couple of years.
	   Simeon acceded to the throne at the age of 6 and reigned under
regencies after his father Boris III died in 1943. He was exiled in
1946 when monarchy was abolished by a referendum that many believed
the communists had rigged.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ A press group decided Monday to move
forward with a proposal to establish an international code of
ethics for journalists and an international media council to deal
with press-related complaints.
	   At a briefing ending a three-day conference of journalists and
media experts from around the world, the organizer, the World
Association of Press Councils, said two working committees would
work on the possibility of writing up an ethics code and a body to
see that it is respected.
	   A third committee is charged with drafting a model for
independent press councils. Press councils, some 30 of which exist
in the world, are organizations that rule on complaints from and
against the press.
	   The committee working on the possible creation of this body will
advise on the ``feasibility of establishing, financing and
attracting wide media and especially public support for a voluntary
mechanism for the mediation and resolution of transnational
complaints,'' said David Flint, chairman of the world association,
who will also lead this working group. The committee will include
the president of the Turkish Press Council and a former executive
of the Egyptian Press Council.
	   ``It would be better if there were outsiders,'' said Peter
Galliner, former director of the International Press Institute,
lamenting that the committee members were all linked to press
councils.
	   The previously little-known World Association of Press Councils
has gained widespread attention through its proposals, much of
which was in form of criticism.
	   ``Who wants this? And in whose interests is it? Certainly not
the press freedom organizations or the representatives of the
industry,'' Ronald Koven, European representative of the World
Press Freedom Committee, said after the announcement.

First trial of Croats for wartime crimes against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ The trial of nine Croats accused of
committing atrocities against rebel Serbs in the 1991 Serbo-Croat
war opened in the nation's capital Monday, the first such trial in
Croatia.
	   The nine are accused of a total of 10 crimes, including
abduction, extortion, attempted murder and murder, committed in the
Pakracka Poljana region in 1991. Hundreds of ethnic Serbs were
allegedly tortured and dozens of them eventually killed in the
area, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southeast of the capital, during
the war.
	   Three of the defendants, Munib Suljic, 39, Igor Mikola, 27, and
Miroslav Bajramovic, 41, appeared before the court Monday. The
other six defendants, who remain at large, will be tried in
absentia.
	   More than 20 witnesses are expected to testify in the case, the
first one in which Croats are being tried for alleged atrocities
committed against local Serbs.
	   Until last September, when the weekly Feral Tribune released the
testimony of key suspect Bajramovic, most Croats viewed themselves
as victims of the six-month war, in which about 10,000 Croats died
and a third of their country was occupied by Serbs for more than
three years.
	   Bajramovic admitted then that he tortured and killed 86 people
in Pakracka Poljana and Gospic, 110 kilometers (68 miles) southeast
and 180 kilometers (112 miles) south, respectively of Zagreb. He
claimed to have killed 72 victims with his own hands, nine of which
were women.
	   In his account, Bajramovic also implicated high-ranking army
officials, including the former interior minister and local
commander. Bajramovic was arrested immediately after his interview
was published, although neither he, nor the officials mentioned,
were charged with the acts described in the interview.
	   Bajramovic's account brought to light the painful discovery that
some Croats may have been brutal killers, too, and sparked a heated
debate.
	   Some Croats _ mostly ex-soldiers _ completely deny the
atrocities, while others are pressing for a reevaluation of the
1991 war.
	   A court statement issued shortly after Bajramovic's indictment
last September said he had retracted parts of the testimony in the
published account.

Ballet star Rudolf Nureyev posthumously rehabilitated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rudolf Nureyev, the Russian ballet star who
defected to the West during the height of the Cold War, has been
posthumously rehabilitated, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Nureyev, a star of Leningrad's Kirov ballet theater, was granted
political asylum in France in the summer of 1961, following his
defection. A year later, in the Soviet Union, he was convicted in
absentia of high treason and sentenced to seven years in jail.
	   Nureyev died of AIDS in 1993 at age 54.
	   Alexander Zvyaginstsev, a senior official in the Prosecutor
General's office, told the ITAR-Tass news agency that Nureyev had
been forgiven under the law ``on rehabilitation of victims of
political repressions.''
	   On June 16, 1961, Nureyev was in Paris at the end of his first
tour abroad with the Kirov Ballet Company. He was about to be
returned to Moscow with two Russian escorts when he approached
customs inspectors at Le Bourget airport, saying, ``I want to stay.
I want to stay.''
	   A quarter of a century later, he was allowed to return to
Russia, where he danced in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) and
conducted ballets in Kazan.
	   Zvyagintsev said a review of Nureyev's case showed there was no
evidence of high treason.

Ugandan president blames Western influence for spread of AIDS
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HENRY WASSWA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ President Yoweri Museveni on Monday
blamed the rapid spread of AIDS in Africa on the copying of
promiscuous Western ways, saying in the past Ugandans gouged out
the eyes of those who engaged in premarital sex.
	   ``This sexual laxity existing today is a colonial phenomenon. It
is not traditional,'' Museveni said at a conference on caring for
those infected with the deadly disease.
	   ``We have lost the traditional values, and yet we do not have a
sophisticated health network of the modern world,'' he said. In the
past, premarital sex was so taboo that one tribe would poke out the
eyes of a violator.
	   About 10 percent of Uganda's population of 20 million carries
the virus the causes AIDS, according to government statistics. Dr.
Elizabeth Madra, director of the government AIDS control program,
said up to 500,000 people have died of diseases related to AIDS
since it was first diagnosed in Uganda in 1983.
	   Uganda has one of the world's most aggressive programs to
contain the spread of AIDS and has achieved important successes.
The World Bank, in a report released last year, said, for example,
the percentage of women in Kampala infected with the AIDS virus has
fallen from 30 percent in 1991 to 16 percent today.
	   Museveni called on governments in Africa to be more willing to
tackle the disease that has infected 20.8 million people in
sub-Saharan Africa of a worldwide total of 30.6 million, according
to a report from UNAIDS released in 1997.
	   ``African governments must be open and accept the challenge in
order to be able to fight the epidemic. Uganda was among the first
countries to be open about AIDS and displayed a slowing down,'' he
said.
	   Although Museveni blamed Western influence for the spread of
AIDS, he did not explain why the disease has moved more quickly
through Africa than in the West.

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Hurricane Georges barreled into the
northeastern Caribbean with 110-mph (175-kph) winds Monday,
flooding roads, toppling trees and utility lines and forcing
thousands to evacuate their homes.
	   More than 10,000 people sought shelter in schools and public
buildings in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Georges
was expected to strike later Monday. Both U.S. territories declared
states of emergency and activated National Guard troops to help
evacuations.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' warned Puerto
Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello.
	   At 11 a.m. (1500 GMT), Georges was centered about 35 miles (56
kilometers) east of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands and was
moving west-northwest at 16 mph (28 kph). Hurricane-force winds of
at least 74 mph (118 kph) extended up to 85 miles (140 kilometers)
from the eye, mostly to the northeast.
	   Georges' strength diminished considerably from a monstrous 150
mph (240 kph) on Sunday, but the U.S. National Hurricane Center
warned the storm was ``extremely dangerous'' and capable of
extensive damage.
	   Its winds howling, Georges downed trees and utility lines,
ripped wooden and galvanized roofs from homes and pelted sheets of
rain into residences in Antigua and St. Kitts and Nevis. There were
no immediate reports of injuries.
	   In St. John's, Antigua's capital, armed soldiers patrolled the
streets Monday to deter looting. Government officials urged
residents to stay indoors until streets could be cleared of debris.
	   ``The storm really messed us up real bad. We got a pounding, a
real pounding,'' said Norman Thomas, manager of ABS radio in
Antigua, where 5,700 people spent the night in shelters.
	   Winds gusted above 90 mph (144 kph) in St. Martin, where
Hurricane Luis caused hundreds of millions of dollars' damage in
1995. In Frederiksted, St. Croix, storm-tossed ocean waves battered
the coast and the city pier.
	   Residents in St. Kitts and Nevis ventured out briefly to survey
storm damage and check on neighbors when Georges' eye passed
overhead before dawn. They scurried back inside as the hurricane's
rear wall returned with a vengeance.
	   In the French island of Guadeloupe, raging seas flooded roads in
the northern towns of Anse-Bertrand and Campeche and forced
residents living near the beach to head for shelter inland. France
was sending a team of 170 civil defense workers to help recovery
efforts.
	   Antiguan families huddled in basements and shop owners erected
sandbag barricades to stop flooding. Civil defense workers
distributed flashlights, mosquito coils, water and toilet paper to
nervous shelter residents.
	   A hurricane warning was issued Monday for the Dominican
Republic, and Hurricane watches went into effect for Haiti's north
coast, the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands.
	   Residents in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands furiously
boarded windows and jammed markets to stock up on ice, water and
canned food.
	   ``Why take chances with something that we cannot change?'' said
St. Croix resident Marion Jones as she put up storm shutters on her
home.
	   U.S. Virgin Islands Gov. Roy Schneider imposed a 8 p.m. curfew
and asked President Bill Clinton to declare a federal state of
emergency that would release federal aid.
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico to coordinate disaster response.
	   In Puerto Rico, Gov. Rossello announced a ban on liquor sales,
activated the island's National Guard and ordered officials to open
more than 330 shelters. Major airlines canceled flights to and from
the U.S. mainland.
	   More than 9,700 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities. Up to 15 inches (38
centimeters) of rain was expected in Puerto Rico's mountains,
raising the threat of mudslides.

Appeals court dismisses suit over pig cartoon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Cairo appeals court on Monday threw out a
case over a poster drawn by an Israeli woman that portrayed Prophet
Mohammed as a pig.
	   The dlrs 10 billion suit had been brought against Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by Mustafa Ashoub, an Egyptian lawyer
who frequently has filed cases in the name of protecting Islam.
	   The appeals court ruled the Ashoub has no standing to file the
case, police officials said. The court did not elaborate
immediately on its ruling, they said. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   A lower court rejected the case in September 1997 on grounds
that Ashoub had no standing. But it did not block an appeal.
	   Tatiana Suszkin was convicted in Israel in December 1997 of
committing a racist act by posting drawings showing the Muslim
prophet as a pig stepping on the Koran, Islam's holy book. Muslims
consider pigs as unclean.
	   Ashoub filed the suit against Netanyahu, arguing that the prime
minister was responsible for actions by Israel's citizens.
Netanyahu apologized for the incident.
	   Ashoub was joined in the appeal by Mohammed Sayed el-Tantawi,
the head of Al-Azhar, Cairo's center of Islamic learning.

Appeals court dismisses suit over pig cartoon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A Cairo appeals court on Monday threw out a
case over a poster drawn by an Israeli woman that portrayed Prophet
Mohammed as a pig.
	   The dlrs 10 billion suit had been brought against Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by Mustafa Ashoub, an Egyptian lawyer
who frequently has filed cases in the name of protecting Islam.
	   The appeals court ruled the Ashoub has no standing to file the
case, police officials said. The court did not elaborate
immediately on its ruling, they said. They spoke on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   A lower court rejected the case in September 1997 on grounds
that Ashoub had no standing. But it did not block an appeal.
	   Tatiana Suszkin was convicted in Israel in December 1997 of
committing a racist act by posting drawings showing the Muslim
prophet as a pig stepping on the Koran, Islam's holy book. Muslims
consider pigs as unclean.
	   Ashoub filed the suit against Netanyahu, arguing that the prime
minister was responsible for actions by Israel's citizens.
Netanyahu apologized for the incident.
	   Ashoub was joined in the appeal by Mohammed Sayed el-Tantawi,
the head of Al-Azhar, Cairo's center of Islamic learning.

WASHINGTON: Dump Day.''

 &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; A quiet Capitol, except for the news media &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Clinton's videotaped testimony was played to a quiet Capitol
building, just long lines of anxious reporters who waited for the
tape and nearly 3,200 pages report of evidence.
	   With the House not in session, few lawmakers were on hand.
	   Across the Capitol parking lot, where television reporters have
camped on the lawn for days, the only sound was the echoes of
Clinton's voice.
	   Multiple TV sets broadcast the live feed of the president's Aug.
17 testimony. Some reporters watched and jotted down notes, while
others perused the lengthy two-volume report.
	   At one point, a curious Capitol Hill police officer strolled
across the green for peek.
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lewinsky tells how she got a nickname
	   In her written proffer of what she would say as a cooperating
witness, Ms. Lewinsky referred to herself in the third-person,
either as Ms. Lewinsky or Ms. L. Others referred to her as ``The
Stalker,'' she said.
	   According to the proffer, White House aide Evelyn Lieberman told
her ``the president paid too much attention to me and vice versa.
Ms. Lieberman told the pres. (Ms. Lewsinsky's abbreviation) that
she didn't care who worked (at the White House) after the election,
but they needed to be careful until then.''
	   Ms. Lewinsky was soon transferred to a job at the Pentagon.
 &UR; ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Clinton gets testy
	   Clinton became testy with lawyers who were questioning him
several times during his videotaped testimony to the grand jury.
	   At one point, the president complained that he answered the
questions put to him by Ms. Jones' lawyers but couldn't be held
responsible for not answering questions that they didn't ask.
	   ``This is the third or fourth time that you seem to be
complaining that I did not do all their work for them,'' he
groused.
	   At another point, a sarcastic Clinton chided a lawyer who was
questioning him.
	   ``I say sir, just from the tone of your voice and the way you're
asking questions here, it's obvious this is the most important
thing in the world,'' Clinton said.
	   And at another point, he said his questioners could elicit
information about whether he told the truth ``without requiring me
to say and do things that I don't think are necessary and that I
think, frankly, go too far in trying to criminalize my private
life.''

EU finance chief upbeat on growth prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's finance
commissioner said Monday he expects the EU to be the strongest
growing region in the world next year, despite risks posed by the
Russian and Asian crises.
	   Speaking before the monetary subcommittee of the European
Parliament, Yves-Thibault de Silguy reiterated the EU commission's
most recent economic forecasts pegging EU-wide growth at 2.8
percent this year.
	   De Silguy added that growth should remain at a ``well
supported'' level in 1999, but he declined to indicate if the
commission would revise its 3 percent 1999 growth estimate when it
publishes updated forecasts next month.
	   De Silguy said the global financial turbulence underlines the
need to reform international financial institutions and to forge a
common policy voice for the 11 EU nations that adopt the euro as
their common currency on Jan. 1.
	   EU finance ministers are expected to make those issues a central
theme of their meeting Friday and Saturday in the Austrian capital
of Vienna.
	   Regarding the future role of the International Monetary Fund, De
Silguy said there is broad support for a French proposal to boost
the decision-making capacities of the IMF's Interim Committee, made
up of ministers or central bank governors from member nations.

	   PARIS (AP) _ It was a classic French reaction to a very
un-French scenario: Reluctantly turning on coverage of President
Clinton's grand jury testimony, barman Gilles Lutrot groaned:
``This is pathetic...''
	   ``What right do we have to know about Clinton's sex life? How
does this affect our lives, or the lives of Americans?'' he added
in his downtown bar, empty apart from an American couple stretching
to make out Clinton's words.
	   In France, privacy of public figures is honored by an unspoken
code of silence _ former President Mitterrand's out-of-wedlock
daughter became a public fact only with his acquiescence.
	   The mood in bars, streets and political offices in Paris on
Monday was one of disbelief.
	   ``This is the Lewinsky soap opera now adapted for television,''
said Frederique Bredin, Socialist Party national secretary during a
news briefing, saying the real victim was American democracy.
	   She described Kenneth Starr as an ``unsavory figure and obsessed
with sex'' for his determination to pursue the investigation of
Clinton and his relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
	   Alain Leroy, a middle-aged businessman, said he'd seen enough
after 10 minutes, and crossed the road to another bar _ Harry's New
York Bar _ where there was no television.
	   ``I hope Clinton bounces back from this humiliation and I think
he will,'' Leroy said. ``At least everybody now knows what's in the
file and can start to think of other things.''
	   French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin called for respect.
	   ``I believe that the sense of respect that is due to all people
should be maintained by all, on the other side of the Atlantic (the
United States) as here,'' he said during a ceremony at the Justice
Ministry.
	   Monday's left-leaning newspaper Liberation carried a cartoon
showing Clinton bound in ropes and strung upside down on a hook
with Starr holding a microphone to his mouth.
	   ``The leader of the free world speaks,'' said the Starr figure.
	   ``Hi there, I sinned,'' says Clinton.
	   Lutrot, the barman, said Clinton's behavior was actually a sign
of strength, echoing similar sentiment recently from Culture
Minister Jack Lang.
	   ``We like energetic leaders in France and maybe he should come
and stand for office here,'' Lutrot then said. ``If the president
of France wasn't having affairs, that would really worry us.''

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES throughout with regional officials not ruling out
military intervention, government acknowledging army out of its
control, color and details; no pickup.

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ A South African official on Monday did
not rule out military intervention by countries in the region to
prop up Lesotho's teetering government.
	   The Southern African Development Community would not allow a
coup to unseat the government of a member state, said South
Africa's Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi, speaking in
Pretoria, South Africa.
	   ``We must make sure that any such stupid thing does not happen.
The position of SADC is that coups do not happen, and there is a
certain'' rule for intervention, Mufamadi said in a South African
radio broadcast.
	   Lesotho's Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili acknowledged on
Monday that the government was not in control of the army and said
intervention by foreign troops could be a ``very last resort.''
	   ``That is the tragedy of the present situation in Lesotho, that
the government cannot carry out its mandate in full,'' Mosisili was
quoted as saying by the South African Press Association.
	   Government and opposition figures both denied there had been a
coup.
	   Sporadic gunfire was heard in the Lesotho capital Monday
morning, but the source was unknown, SABC radio reported. A faction
of the army rebelled 11 days ago, deposing the leadership, and the
new commanders have refrained from restoring order in the streets.
	   Government offices and Parliament have been paralyzed by weeks
of demonstrations and strikes by the parties' supporters, who claim
the Lesotho Congress Party's May election landslide victory was
fraudulent.
	   A SABC radio reporter said senior government officials have gone
into hiding, including Foreign Minister Tom Thabane. Opposition
militants hauled teachers and children out of schools, the reporter
said.
	   But Deputy Prime Minister Kelebone Maope told the South African
Press Association that the ruling party was still in power with
Mosisili at its helm.
	   Opposition party negotiators on Monday refused to meet with
government officials for talks aimed at ending the chaos which has
gripped this tiny mountain kingdom.
	   An opposition spokeswoman, Mamello Morrison, said the parties
were angry because the government refused to show at a meeting
Sunday.
	   South African mediators sat down separately with both sides over
the weekend.
	   A report by a commission of representatives from South Africa,
Botswana and Zimbabwe last week cited ``serious concerns'' about
the voting, but did not suggest the election be invalidated.
	   Completely surrounded by South Africa, Lesotho is a poor nation
of 2 million people.

Typhoon slams western Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A typhoon hit western Japan on Monday, smashing
windows and blowing away roof tiles, as a more powerful storm
threatened the southern island of Shikoku.
	   The eighth typhoon of the season, packing sustained winds of 83
kilometers (52 miles) per hour, hit land Monday afternoon in
Wakayama prefecture (state) some 453 kilometers (283 miles)
southwest of Tokyo.
	   Damage was reported as far away as Gunma prefecture, 100
kilometers (60 miles) north of the capital, where winds blew out
windows or sent roof tiles flying at about 50 homes, news reports
said.
	   Gusts also overturned a truck and an one-story building in
Gunma, slightly injuring a worker in the building, the reports
said.
	   The typhoon, which was not named, dissipated later Monday in the
Sea of Japan, the Meteorological Agency said.
	   Meanwhile, the more powerful Typhoon Vicki, with sustained
maximum winds of 126 kilometers per hour (78 miles per hour), was
heading for the Pacific coast island of Shikoku, the agency said.
	   Vicki was about 340 kilometers (210 miles) south-southwest of
Kagoshima prefecture in southern Japan as of 9 p.m. local time
(1200 GMT).
	   Kagoshima is 985 kilometers (616 miles) southwest of Tokyo on
the island of Kyushu.
	   The agency predicted the typhoon would hit the coast of Shikoku
Tuesday afternoon.
	   Definitions of typhoons vary from country to country. In Japan,
any storm with sustained maximum wind speeds of 65 kilometers (41
miles) per hour is classified as a typhoon. In the United States,
sustained winds must reach 118 kilometers (74 miles) per hour to be
considered a typhoon.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin met with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Monday to finalize Cabinet selections and
formulate a strategy to reactivate the country's moribund economy.
	   Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion rubles (dlrs
66 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid to prevent the
collapse of the country's commercial banks.
	   The financial crisis has caused a backlog of bank payments
totaling over 30 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion), Andrei Kozlov,
the first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, told a news
conference.
	   The bank launched an emergency rescue plan on Friday to help
settle 10 billion rubles (dlrs 666 million) of the payments, or
one-third of the total owed between banks and their clients, Kozlov
said.
	   As part of the effort, the Central Bank printed 900 million
rubles (dlrs 60 million) and issued short-term credits to banks,
Kozlov said. He stressed that the amount was too small to affect
the ruble's rate and inflation.
	   But many analysts feared that the move may set a dangerous
precedent, and if such a policy is continued, it could fuel
inflation and lead to further declines in the Russian ruble,
officially valued at 16 to the U.S. dollar, down from slightly over
six when the crisis began a month ago.
	   Critics have accused the government of responding slowly to the
economic crisis, which hit last month. The rescue plan for the
banks represents the biggest emergency effort so far.
	   Primakov has been in office 10 days, but has yet to outline an
overall economic strategy or put his cabinet in place. Key jobs,
such as the finance minister's post, have not been filled.
	   ``We are going to finalize the personnel issue with (Primakov)
today,'' Yeltsin said at the start of his meeting with the premier.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ Russia's Finance Ministry will meet Thursday with
representatives of major Western banks who believe the government
has given preferential treatment to Russian bond-holding banks.
Acting Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told a news conference
they will seek a mutually acceptable plan for restructuring the
government's ruble-denominated debt and all investors will be
treated as equals. ``The treatment should be absolutely equal,'' he
said.
	   _ The ruble closed unchanged at 16.3 to the U.S. dollar after
the Central Bank canceled electronic currency trading on the
interbank exchange. The bank said it needed more time to determine
which banks should be allowed to participate on the currency
markets.
	   _ Russian stocks lost ground in sparse activity. The Russian
Trading System Index fell 4.6 percent to close at 47.81, down from
50.12 points Friday. It was the first time the index closed below
50 points.
	   _ Primakov named Gennady Kulik, 63, a Soviet-era agricultural
official and a member of parliament's Agrarian Faction, as deputy
prime minister in charge of agriculture. Kulik, a defender of
collective farms and a staunch opponent of private land ownership,
has been among those who have blocked Yeltsin's plans to carry out
land reform.
	   _ Primakov also named Vice Premier Alexander Shokhin, considered
a moderate reformer, to head Russia's delegation in talks with the
International Monetary Fund. An IMF mission is in Moscow for talks
with Russian officials to follow up on Russia's lending program.
The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package in July, but
it did not ward off the crisis.
	   _ The State Statistics Committee announced that unemployment
increased slightly last month to reach 8.35 million people, or 11.5
percent of the workforce. The rate is expected to rise even higher
due to the worsening crisis.

Sweden's high-tax government likely to continue

 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout with quotes &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ After a national election that left no
one with a firm grip on power, party leaders on Monday talked about
strategy, but not with each other.
	   The Social Democrats, who have governed Sweden for most of the
past seven decades and built its welfare state, came through
Sunday's national elections with their worst performance ever _
just 36.6 percent of the votes.
	   But conservative parties weren't able to rack up a majority of
seats in the 349-seat Riksdag parliament.
	   That left the balance of power in the hands of the Left and
Greens parties, both of whom are unlikely to decamp to the right
but who are unsavory to the Social Democrats.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson put on a bold public face as the
results came in on Sunday, proclaiming ``We rule on!'' But he
cancelled a planned Monday trip to New York to analyze the election
results.
	   ``It's quite a challenge for the party and Sweden to enter the
next century in this way,'' political scientist Olof Ruin of
Stockholm University commented Monday.
	   Left leader Gudrun Schyman met with other members of her party
on Monday, but had no contact with Persson.
	   Persson has said he won't go into coalition with the Left, whose
policies he regards as out of touch with reality and which opposes
Sweden's membership in the European Union.
	   The Social Democrats may hope to avoid being tainted by the Left
by courting support from some of the non-socialist parties, but
such support seems unlikely.
	   Carl Bildt, leader of the Moderates, the largest opposition
party, on Sunday ruled out cooperation with the Social Democrats
and Christian Democrats leader Alf Svensson followed suit Monday.
	   Persson is ``arrogant and dictatorial ... expecting the other
parties will stand there like yes-men,'' Svensson was quoted as
saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   When they regained power in 1994, the Social Democrats embarked
on an austerity program of cutting funding to Sweden's cherished
cradle-to-grave social services in order to extract the country
from an enormous debt.
	   The measures paid off in restoring balance to public finances,
including a predicted small budget surplus this year; in a
virtually undetectable inflation rate and in reducing unemployment,
although it is still high at 7.3 percent.
	   But the measures also left Swedes watching medical and other
services decline even as they continued to pay the world's highest
taxes.
	   The austerity clearly cost the Social Democrats votes. While
their support declined from the 45 percent the party got in 1994,
the ex-Communist Left Party nearly doubled its total with 12
percent of the vote on promises of restoring the welfare state
while reducing the workweek.
	   The Christian Democrats meanwhile nearly tripled their support
with a platform emphasizing improved medical and elderly care.
	   The Social Democrats have promised they can rebuild the welfare
state, but say it will never be what it was in the 1960s, when the
rest of the world looked admiringly at a country with full
employment and medical care that cost only nominal fees.
	   How they will do that is unclear, given the new balance of power
in the parliament. The first real test is likely to be the budget
bill, which has to be presented within three weeks.

Hamed set to fight McCullough in Madison Square Garden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Undefeated Naseem Hamed will fight Ireland's Wayne
McCullough on Oct. 31 for Hamed's WBO featherweight title, HBO said
Monday.
	   The fight between Hamed (30-0, 28 KOs) and McCullough (22-1, 14
KOs) is likely to take place in Madison Square Garden, although the
site is to be confirmed on Wednesday.
	   It will be Hamed's 11th defense of his title and his first since
fighting against Wilfredo Vazquez in April. Britain's Hamed made
his American debut at the Garden last December when he beat Kevin
Kelley in five rounds.
	   McCullough, the former WBC bantamweight champion, has won 22 of
his 23 contests.

	   Greg Foster, the three-time world champion in the 110-meter
hurdles, said he had been told of the death by Joyner-Kersee, who
had heard of it from her brother Al.
	   The sheriff's office in Orange County said a Florence Griffith

it was the former track star.
	   Griffith Joyner had suffered a heart seizure two years ago on a

	   Griffith Joyner still holds world records in the 100- and
200-meter dashes. She set the 100 meter mark of 10.49 seconds at
the quarterfinals of the 1988 Olympic trials at Indianapolis, and
since then, no one has even broken 10.60. At the Seoul Games, she
won the gold medal in a wind-aided 10.54.
	   She then smashed the world 200 record in the Olympic final,
clocking 21.34. No one else has broken 21.70.
	   She also won a gold medal in the 400 relay and just missed a

relay, which Griffith Joyner anchored.

EU finance chief upbeat on growth prospects
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's finance
commissioner said Monday he expects the EU to be the strongest
growing region in the world next year, despite risks posed by the
Russian and Asian crises.
	   Speaking before the monetary subcommittee of the European
Parliament, Yves-Thibault de Silguy reiterated the EU commission's
most recent economic forecasts pegging EU-wide growth at 2.8
percent this year.
	   De Silguy added that growth should remain at a ``well
supported'' level in 1999, but he declined to indicate if the
commission would revise its 3 percent 1999 growth estimate when it
publishes updated forecasts next month.
	   De Silguy said the global financial turbulence underlines the
need to reform international financial institutions and to forge a
common policy voice for the 11 EU nations that adopt the euro as
their common currency on Jan. 1.
	   EU finance ministers are expected to make those issues a central
theme of their meeting Friday and Saturday in the Austrian capital
of Vienna.
	   Regarding the future role of the International Monetary Fund, De
Silguy said there is broad support for a French proposal to boost
the decision-making capacities of the IMF's Interim Committee, made
up of ministers or central bank governors from member nations.

speech &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Clinton speech, edits to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; With US-Japan &QL; 
 &UR; By SONYA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Looking to assert himself on the world
stage, President Bill Clinton called Monday anew for a united
international front to combat terrorists and their new, high-tech
ability to kill and maim. ``This is a threat to all humankind,'' he
said.
	   Clinton went before the 53rd session of the U.N. General
Assembly Monday to press his case that the fight against terrorism
remains a top priority on the world's agenda. It is a subject he
has addressed previously _ before the same audience _ but this time
the president was arguing that technological advances now allow no
nation the luxury of battling terrorism in its own way.
	   ``The new technologies of terror ... raise chilling prospects of
vulnerability to chemica, biological and other kinds of attacks,
bringing each of us into the category of possible victim,'' Clinton
said. ``This is a threat to all human kind.''
	   The White House hoped the image of the president in an
international leadership role would counter that of a testy Clinton
as grand jury witness in video footage also playing before an
American public both curious and reluctant to see it.
	   A White House official said Clinton showed no outward concern
Sunday that the airing of his testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation would divert public attention from his U.N. speech.
	   ``He certainly did not indicate that to me,'' said the official,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   But during his speech Clinton seemed exhausted. His eyes were
puffy, he appeared ill-rested and his voice lacked energy.
	   Clinton noted that the United States itself is acutely aware of
terrorism, from the recent bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania to the bombings of a Pan Am jet in 1988, the World Trade
Center and a federal building in Oklahoma City in 1996. Those
actions, he said, reflect a trend being seen around the world, from
Sri Lanka to Kashmir and Egypt.
	   ``Let me urge all of us to think in new terms of terrorism,''
Clinton said. ``Terror is not a way to tomorrow. It is only a
throwback to yesterday. Together we can meet it and overcome its
threats, its injuries and its fears with confidence.''
	   He sought to diffuse a perceived clash between Western and
Islamic cultures that foments terrorism, vowing that the United
States ``will remain on a course of friendship and respect for the
Muslim world.''
	   ``Some may have the world believe that almighty God himself, the
merciful, grants a license to kill. But that is not our
understanding of Islam,'' Clinton said. ``There is no inherent
clash between Islam and America. Americans respect and honor
Islam.''
	   The president said all nations have an obligation to refuse
harbor to terrorists, to decline support for terrorist activities
and to confront the reality that terrorists will seek to use
weapons of mass destruction. He urged that they sign a global
anti-terror convention, promote stronger laws domestically against
terrorism and raise international standards for airport security.
	   Clinton also spoke of terrorism's psychological toll, ``hard to
measure but slow to heal. ... Each time an innocent man, or woman,
or child is killed, it makes the future more hazardous for the rest
of us.''
	   After his speech, Clinton was meeting with Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and attend a luncheon with other world
leaders at U.N. headquarters.
	   Monday's speech was Clinton's ninth before the world body. He
previously had addressed five annual meetings and three special
sessions that dealt with drugs, the environment and the 50th
anniversary of the United Nations.
	   Clinton was beginning his day with a visit to U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan and Foreign Minister Didier Opertti of Uruguay,
the General Assembly president. Berger said that meeting would
focus on Iraq and Kosovo, as well as U.N. financial reforms.
	   The president, along with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton,
arrived in New York on Sunday night in time for a meeting with
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi. In their hour-long session,
Clinton and Prodi discussed the economic situation in Italy,
Russia's economy and its new government, the crisis in Albania and
efforts to negotiate peace in Kosovo.
	   Clinton is among 26 heads of state, two crown princes, one vice
president and 152 other emissaries who will have the chance to
address the General Assembly this week.
	   A meeting between the prime ministers of India and Pakistan,
whose antagonistic nations have been in a race to develop nuclear
weapons capability, is expected Wednesday.

Germans find the Clinton tapes dirty ... politics
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNE THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Germany's rail company ordered train stations to
switch the channels on their TVs Monday afternoon away from the
broadcast of U.S. President Bill Clinton's testimony about his
sexual affair with Monica Lewinsky.
	   Deutsche Bahn, in a statement, said it wanted to protect
children from hearing the sordid details of Clinton's relationship
with the former White House intern.
	   In fact, adults _ the thousands of passengers who kill time
waiting for trains by watching the only public large-screen TVs in
the country _ may be more upset by the broadcast.
	   They think it's dirty ... politics. And the railway's order
reflects the national mood.
	   From Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the man in the street, most
Germans are outraged by what they see the United States' dragging
its own leader through the mud.
	   ``I find the whole business extremely upsetting,'' Kohl told
reporters Monday. ``I can only repeat, in my blunt way of saying
it, that it makes me throw up.''
	   In Frankfurt, Germany's banking capital, train station TVs
showed a nature program about owls instead of the national ntv
network's live broadcast of Clinton's testimony. The cable news
network Phoenix also showed the tape live.
	   ``It is nonsense ... (President Clinton) is also a person,''
said Ms. Scholz, a Deutsche Bahn employee who did not want to give
her first name.
	   Politics are high in the German psyche right now as the nation
gears up for an election Sept. 27. Sex, or character questions
pertaining to sex and marriage, are notably absent from the
campaign discussion _ though Kohl challenger Gerhard Schroeder has
been married four times.
	   Germans find all this personal stuff just too personal to be
part of politics.
	   ``What (Clinton) wants to keep private shouldn't become public
to the whole world. Most important, his political work didn't
suffer because of his affair,'' said Gerd Bandorf, as quoted in the
Koblenzer Stadtanzeiger newspaper. The front-page headline asks:
``Why are you making your president ridiculous before the world?''
	   Over and over German newspaper editorials have been making this
very point.
	   Their main message: World events from Russian economic crisis to
the Middle East peace process need Clinton's attention and can only
suffer if he is weakened and distracted by scandal.
	   ``The attention to the Clinton affair is bad for America and the
trusting of the political institution,'' the conservative
Frankfurter Allgemeine said in an editorial. ``It is bad for the
world, because they can not trust the courageous American
leadership.''

	   Not only did ``FloJo'' dazzle fans with her stunning speed, she
caught their attention with her colorful bodysuits and her 6-inch
(15-centimeter) decorated fingernails.
	   She also displayed a muscular physique, which prompted talk of
steroid use. Griffith Joyner insisted she never used performance
enhancers and she never failed a drug test.
	   At the 1988 trials, where she ran the three fastest 100-meter
times ever by a woman and set the American record in the 200, she
also set standards in track fashion.
	   One eye-catching outfit was a purple bodysuit with a turquoise
bikini brief over it, but with nothing on her left leg, a design
she referred to as a ``one-legger.''
	   At the Olympics, she painted three of her fingernails red, white
and blue, and she painted a fourth gold to signify her goal.
	   At the 1987 World Championships in Rome, she caused a sensation
by running the first two rounds in a skintight suit similar to a
speedskater's togs.

Milutinovic hired as new MetroStars coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Bora Milutinovic, the only
man to guide four different teams into the second round of the
World Cup, became the New York-New Jersey MetroStars' fifth coach
in less than three years on Monday, MLS deputy commissioner Sunil
Gulati confirmed.
	   The Serbian-born Milutinovic, who also was one of four
candidates to replace Steve Sampson as coach of the U.S. national
team, was to arrive in New York Monday evening and take over the
squad Tuesday.
	   Milutinovic replaces Alfonso Mondelo, who took over the side
following the departure of Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira.
Parreira left in December after one season with the MetroStars to
coach Saudi Arabia in the 1998 World Cup.
	   Despite clinching a playoff berth last month, the MetroStars
have lost their last six matches, fallen from second to third in
the Eastern Conference and dropped to 14-17 with one game remaining
before the post-season.
	   Milutinovic has a reputation as a soccer mercenary and gaining
immediate success. He led Mexico to the quarterfinals at the 1986
World Cup, its highest finish.
	   He took over Costa Rica shortly before the 1990 World Cup and
stunned many by getting it into the second round. He was introduced
by then U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg in 1991 as
a ``miracle worker'' and proceeded to qualify the United States for
the second round in 1994.
	   He left his post as the U.S. national team in 1995, saying he
was fired for not taking a larger role in player development.
	   Milutinovic appeared again on the world scene in France this
summer, guiding Nigeria into the second round before it was
eliminated by Denmark.
	   The 44-year-old Milutinovic continues the carousel of
high-profile coaches who have stood on the MetroStars' sideline.
Former New York Cosmos coach Eddie Firmani lasted less than two
months of the first season in 1996 before he was replaced by former
Portuguese national team coach Carlos Queiroz.
	   After Queiroz left to take a more lucrative offer with a
Japanese club following the 1996 season, Parreira was hired, but he
departed following the 1997 season for the Saudi job.
	   The hiring of Mondelo, who had coached the second-division Long
Island Rough Riders, was seen by many as an end to the MetroStars'
fascination with big-name coaches.
	   Milutinovic had been one of four names bandied about to replace
Sampson, along with Washington D.C. United coach Bruce Arena,
Queiroz and Parreira. Sampson's replacement is expected to be
announced before the end of October.

	   ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) _ Hurricane Georges barreled into the
northeastern Caribbean with 110-mph (175-kph) winds Monday,
flooding roads, toppling trees and utility lines and forcing
thousands to evacuate their homes.
	   More than 10,000 people sought shelter in schools and public
buildings in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Georges
was expected to strike later Monday. Both U.S. territories declared
states of emergency and activated National Guard troops to help
evacuations.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' warned Puerto
Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello.
	   At 11 a.m. (1500 GMT), Georges was centered about 20 miles (30
kilometers) east-northeast of St. Croix in the U.S. Virgin Islands
and was moving west-northwest at 16 mph (28 kph). Hurricane-force
winds of at least 74 mph (118 kph) extended up to 85 miles (140
kilometers) from the eye, mostly to the northeast.

Sweden's high-tax government likely to continue
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Leads throughout with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM HEINTZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ After a national election that left no
one with a firm grip on power, party leaders on Monday talked about
strategy, but not with each other.
	   The Social Democrats, who have governed Sweden for most of the
past seven decades and built its welfare state, came through
Sunday's national elections with their worst performance ever _
just 36.6 percent of the votes.
	   But conservative parties weren't able to rack up a majority of
seats in the 349-seat Riksdag parliament.
	   That left the balance of power in the hands of the Left and
Greens parties, both of whom are unlikely to decamp to the right
but who are unsavory to the Social Democrats.
	   Prime Minister Goeran Persson put on a bold public face as the
results came in on Sunday, proclaiming ``We rule on!'' But he
cancelled a planned Monday trip to New York to analyze the election
results.
	   ``It's quite a challenge for the party and Sweden to enter the
next century in this way,'' political scientist Olof Ruin of
Stockholm University commented Monday.
	   Left leader Gudrun Schyman met with other members of her party
on Monday, but had no contact with Persson.
	   Persson has said he won't go into coalition with the Left, whose
policies he regards as out of touch with reality and which opposes
Sweden's membership in the European Union.
	   The Social Democrats may hope to avoid being tainted by the Left
by courting support from some of the non-socialist parties, but
such support seems unlikely.
	   Carl Bildt, leader of the Moderates, the largest opposition
party, on Sunday ruled out cooperation with the Social Democrats
and Christian Democrats leader Alf Svensson followed suit Monday.
	   Persson is ``arrogant and dictatorial ... expecting the other
parties will stand there like yes-men,'' Svensson was quoted as
saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
	   When they regained power in 1994, the Social Democrats embarked
on an austerity program of cutting funding to Sweden's cherished
cradle-to-grave social services in order to extract the country
from an enormous debt.
	   The measures paid off in restoring balance to public finances,
including a predicted small budget surplus this year; in a
virtually undetectable inflation rate and in reducing unemployment,
although it is still high at 7.3 percent.
	   But the measures also left Swedes watching medical and other
services decline even as they continued to pay the world's highest
taxes.
	   The austerity clearly cost the Social Democrats votes. While
their support declined from the 45 percent the party got in 1994,
the ex-Communist Left Party nearly doubled its total with 12
percent of the vote on promises of restoring the welfare state
while reducing the workweek.
	   The Christian Democrats meanwhile nearly tripled their support
with a platform emphasizing improved medical and elderly care.
	   The Social Democrats have promised they can rebuild the welfare
state, but say it will never be what it was in the 1960s, when the
rest of the world looked admiringly at a country with full
employment and medical care that cost only nominal fees.
	   How they will do that is unclear, given the new balance of power
in the parliament. The first real test is likely to be the budget
bill, which has to be presented within three weeks.

British lawyer stands trial in Lisbon over alleged share scam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The trial opened Monday of a British
lawyer charged with fraud, forgery and criminal association in
connection with an alleged international share scam.
	   David Lowry, 54, a distinguished law expert before he became an
investment broker, denied the charges.
	   Lowry was the manager of Paramount Portugal when he was arrested
at the company offices in Lisbon in April last year.
	   The Public Prosecutor alleges the company defrauded clients of
some dlrs 13.5 million.
	   The scam allegedly involved persuading investors around the
world, contacted by phone by Paramount Portugal, to buy shares in
tiny U.S. companies that proved worthless or of little value. Some
share certificates were falsified, according to prosecutors.
	   The Portuguese securities commission received a complaint from
an Irish investor and informed the police who launched an
investigation, raiding the Paramount Portugal offices where some 70
people worked.
	   Lowry was refused bail five times. The trial was expected to
last several months.
	   The British embassy in Lisbon sent three letters to the Justice
Ministry expressing concern about conditions in Caxias jail, in the
capital's suburbs, where Lowry has been held in a cell with 14
others.
	   Investigators also are probing allegations that the suspected
Lisbon operation was part of an international fraud network.
	   Switzerland's federal banking commission last year closed the
Fribourg-based Paramount Securities and Trust Company, which held a
controlling stake in Paramount Portugal.

Stocks tumble worldwide, Dow down as much as 184

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES Dow, UPDATES with close of European markets and
temporary trading halt in Amsterdam. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks plunged worldwide Monday, sending the Dow
industrials tumbling as much as 184 points, as traders followed the
latest disclosures on President Clinton's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky and worried about global economic turmoil.
	   But with no immediate fresh surprises from the newly released
Clinton testimony, stocks began recovering from their lows of the
day.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 100 points last
week, was down as much as 184.61 points in the morning. It was off
94.20, or by 1.2 percent, at 7,801.42 by early this afternoon. With
some traders absent because of the observance of the Jewish New
Year, trading that was running well below Friday's heavy volume.
	   The selling spree sent Tokyo's main index falling 2.8 percent to
a new 12-year low, while Hong Kong shares dropped 3.7 percent and
Indonesia's market skidded 5.5 percent to a seven-year low.
	   Blue chips on the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest
market, closed down 1.3 percent, above the lows for the session.
Shares fell 3.6 percent in Frankfurt, Germany, and 3.5 percent in
Paris. In the Netherlands, trading was temporarily halted after a 5
percent plunge in the major index in Amsterdam, which closed with a
loss of 5.9 percent.
	   Markets are unsettled by economic crises in Asia and Russia that
are threatening to spread to Latin America and are damaging
corporate profits. In addition, there is political uncertainty as
Congress released the videotaped testimony of President Clinton to
a grand jury as well as thousands of pages of evidence on his
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
	   U.S. Treasury bonds, a traditional haven for funds in times of
unrest, rallied. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds, which fall as
prices rise, dropped below 5.1 percent for the first time since the
government began regular auctions of the securities in 1977.
	   Hildegard Zagorski, a stock analyst at Prudential Securities,
said while the president's testimony did not appear to disclose
anything new, it was piled onto already serious problems elsewhere.
	   ``We're still on the ropes here,'' Zagorski said.''You've got
problems in Europe, Japan, Hong Kong, and you have concerns about
corporate profits here. It's not a pretty picture.''

Despite threats, holiday off to quiet start
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC;  &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel celebrated a quiet New Year Monday
despite fears of holiday attacks, with people flocking to
synagogues, barbecuing with families, and vacationing at holiday
resorts.
	   Palestinians, meanwhile, complained bitterly of the sealing off
of the Gaza Strip and West Bank, which was imposed Sept. 12 and
expected to continue at least until Wednesday.
	   The head of Palestinian general intelligence, Amin al-Hindi,
said there was no justification to the Israeli security reports
that the radical Islamic group Hamas was planning attacks.
	   ``In our monitoring of (Hamas), we do not believe that they are
preparing attacks from our areas,'' al-Hindi said. ``Even the
Israeli security doesn't have real information that Hamas will
carry out any attacks.''
	   The Israeli army had imposed a closure on the Palestinian
territories a day after its soldiers shot and killed Adel and Imad
Awadallah, two Hamas fugitives wanted for their part in attacks on
Israel.
	   The sealing and a security alert came in reaction to threats by
Hamas to wage retaliatory attacks on Israel like those it has
carried out since 1994 that have killed dozens of Israelis.
	   The tense situation was not eased by the departure from the
region on Sunday of U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross, who had once
again failed to get Israel and the Palestinians to agree on the
terms for a long-overdue Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the
West Bank.
	   The sides failed to reach accord on a U.S. plan to end the
18-month log-jam in the negotiations, which outlines a withdrawal
and a Palestinian crackdown on anti-Israeli militants.
	   Despite the security alert, the streets of Israeli cities were
quiet Monday, with virtually all business and government offices
shut down, and public transportation halted.
	   The blowing of rams horns to usher in the year 5759 by the
Jewish calendar could be heard at synagogues in neighborhoods
throughout the country. The smell of grilled meat wafted over
backyards and picnic areas as many barbecued to mark the holiday.
	   Hundreds of religious Jews gathered to pray at the Western Wall
in the old city, Judaism's holiest site.
	   The two-day Rosh Hashana holiday ends at sundown Tuesday.

Milosevic denies humanitarian catastrophe in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ In a meeting with a top U.S. envoy
Monday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic denied humanitarian
plight in Serbia's embattled Kosovo province.
	   ``The term `humanitarian catastrophe' which we have been hearing
during the last weeks is not based on reality,'' said a statement
from Milosevic's office after he met U.S. envoy for Kosovo
Christopher Hill.
	   ``It represents a reason for continuous (international) pressure
on the republic of Serbia and Yugoslavia,'' the statement said.
	   Despite reports by international aid organizations that nearly
300,000 ethnic Albanians have fled their homes during a violent
Serb crackdown against Kosovo Albanian separatists and now face
hunger and diseases, Serbian officials have been saying that all of
them are now under shelter and taken care of.
	   Milosevic's statement said that ``the temporary displaced people
have in great numbers returned to their homes ... therefore the
pressures against our country are unfounded.''
	   NATO has readied plans for possible military intervention in
Kosovo _ where ethnic Albanians represent 90 percent of about two
million people _ to end Serbia's offensive.
	   In the statement, Milosevic reiterated his call for a negotiated
solution for Kosovo which he stripped of autonomy in 1987. He
indirectly accused Kosovo Albanian leaders of stalling the
negotiations.
	   Hill has been shuttling between Kosovo and Belgrade in trying to
end the fighting and find a negotiated solution for the crisis.

AP completes acquisition of Worldwide Television News
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Associated Press announced Monday it has
completed the acquisition of Worldwide Television News from ABC
News and will combine it and the existing APTV service into a new
global video news agency, Associated Press Television News.
	   APTN will provide fast and reliable coverage of the day's top
stories to nearly 350 television news customers around the globe,
making it the world's leading video news agency. APTN will have
dedicated newsgathering resources in 83 news bureaus operating in
67 countries, which will be supplemented and supported by news
gathering in 154 other AP bureaus and news supply agreements with
more than 350 television news organizations.
	   The newly named service combines and integrates APTV, AP's
4-year-old global video news service, with WTN, a leading supplier
of international video news since 1963. The acquisition was
announced in June; no purchase price was announced.
	   APTN will also provide a rich selection of specialized
television news services, including feature and archive services,
daily entertainment news, customized coverage from the Middle East
and an extensive video archive of more than 100 years of news
footage, representing nearly every major historical event of the
20th century.
	   In addition, APTN will have the largest broadcast special
services operation in the world, providing camera crews, editing
and satellite delivery to customers in the field. APTN is also a
major supplier of sports news through its partnership with SNTV,
Sports News Television.
	   ``APTN will offer up-to-the minute video news from around the
world and will support it with the kind of responsive customer
service the AP is known for,'' said Louis D. Boccardi, AP's
president and chief executive officer. ``This is a giant step
forward for the AP, its member owners and its clients. In addition
to reinforcing our place in video, it assures a timely and reliable
supply of video for all our member Internet services.''
	   The AP, a news cooperative celebrating its 150th anniversary
this year, is the world's oldest and largest news service, serving
more than 15,000 news organizations worldwide.
	   ``Broadcasters around the world will benefit from the most
comprehensive range of news services available anywhere. We will
have bureaus wherever the news happens. Customers will be able to
get all they need from a single supplier,'' said Derek Taylor,
managing director of APTN. ``Three qualities will mark us out: We
are focused on the needs of our customers, our sole business is
news, and APTN is the one agency customers can rely on _ to cover
the news with integrity and to deal fairly with our clients.''
Taylor, a veteran broadcast news correspondent, bureau chief and
marketing director, joined the AP in June.

Empathy, sympathy for Clinton
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Clinton-Lewinsky &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Watching Bill Clinton in the videotaped deposition
on TV in a west London pub Monday, Tony Charlesworth said he
already knew more than he wanted to know about the U.S. president's
sex life.
	   ``I don't need to be seeing this,'' said Charlesworth, a
31-year-old London businessman. ``They should only show it to
people who need to see it. They're just humiliating him.''
	   From Johannesburg to Jordan, many people who watched Clinton's
televised grilling by special counsel lawyers seemed to share a
similar opinion. Some viewers said they felt sorry for Clinton.
Many agreed the tape never should have been made public.
	   In London, Sky TV showed the entire deposition as it was
broadcast in the United States. Charlesworth, watching with
colleagues in the Sir Christopher Hatton pub, said he thought
Clinton did as well as he could with the probing, embarrassing
questions.
	   ``He seems like an ordinary man trying to keep his wife and kid
from hearing the facts,'' Charlesworth said.
	   In Italy, Clinton's testimony was broadcast on two channels _
one private, one public _ with Italian voiceover.
	   ``Everything they're doing is ridiculous,'' said Andrea Amedeo,
19, a student in Rome. ``He's the leader of America and the world.
... Leave him in peace to worry about the real problems.''
	   In Hong Kong, where passers-by watched on a screen at a shopping
mall, Lisa Wong said she ``supposed most people would lie to keep
such an affair secret.''
	   In Lebanon, the private Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. appeared to
be the only station in the Middle East carrying the simultaneous
broadcast.
	   In Jordan, many were glued to television sets in coffee houses
and at homes watching the testimony on Cable News Network.
	   ``I disapprove of broadcasting the tape because I think it is
purely an attack on the democrats and it will not serve any good
for the United States of America,'' said publisher Usama Sha'shaa.
	   In Greece, the tape was broadcast with simultaneous Greek
translation.
	   Giorgos Dedemadis, a 42-year-old mathematics teacher, contrasted
the grilling of Clinton about Lewinsky to the affair between the
late Premier Andreas Papandreou and a much younger woman, whom he
married in 1989.
	   ``They say the United States is a mature democracy and a serious
country and you have a spectacle like this,'' Dedemadis said. ``At
least in Greece we were sophisticated enough to separate a leader's
private and public lives. It's clear Clinton's political opponents
are just out to get him. It's sad.''
	   Swiss German Television showed the video on its second channel
for over an hour (until 1450gmt), with a voice-over by a
German-language interpreter.
	   The right-of-center watchdog Swiss Television and Radio
Association said, ``We cannot see what possible information the
Swiss public could get out of this broadcast beyond pure
voyeurism.''
	   In downtown Amsterdam, 45-year-old barkeep Ruud Knapp watched
from his post at the Cafe Kalkhover.
	   ``It's a soap, it's just about private sexual relationships,
it's crazy,'' he said. ``It's very sad for the man. It's
embarrassing. He's not strong anymore.''

With Iran-Afghan tensions high, Khatami meets Sharif at UN
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - With Afghanistan's Taliban militia and
Iran facing a military stand-off, Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami met Monday with the prime minister of Pakistan, whose
country is the Taliban's main backer.
	   Khatami met with Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistani prime minister, for
nearly a half hour on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly
meeting, Pakistani diplomats said.
	   They refused to say what the two leaders discussed, but their
talks are believed to have focused on Afghanistan.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have risen since the
militants overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan on Aug. 8 and killed several Iranian diplomats posted
there.
	   Iran has since deployed about 200,000 troops on its border with
Afghanistan, amid growing demands for vengeance by mobs of Iranian
demonstrators.
	   The Taliban has returned the bodies of seven of the Iranians to
Tehran, and has released a total of 10 Iranian captives.
	   Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, in comments published
Sunday, said he did not foresee a war with Iran.
	   Khatami told a group of Iranian-Americans Sunday that his
country did not want a war with Afghanistan, but reserved the right
defend itself.
	   In eastern Afghanistan Sunday, an estimated 10,000 people
chanting anti-Iranian slogans rallied in the town of Khost to
protest Tehran's massive troop buildup, Kabul radio reported.
	   The demonstrators reportedly demanded that Iran pull back its
forces, and vowed to defend their country if Iran attacks.
	   Meanwhile, five Iranians released by the Taliban returned to
Tehran on Sunday, and several said they were tortured in captivity,
the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
	   Iran says the Taliban militia is holding at least 50 more
Iranians. Tehran claims most were drivers delivering food, medicine
and other humanitarian goods to needy Afghans.
	   The Taliban, which controls 90 percent of Afghanistan, has said
the Iranians were carrying weapons to its opponents in the north of
the country.

 &UR; Aziz to meet Annan on weapons inspection standoff &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report Aziz, Annan to hold talks; CHANGES
dateline, overline. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, will meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
next week to review proposals to defuse the crisis over U.N.
weapons inspections, Aziz said in an interview published here
Monday.
	   Aziz said the meeting would be Sept. 28 in New York, the paper
said.
	   Aziz told the daily he will review with Annan ``ideas and
proposals he (Annan) presented to the Security Council regarding
the comprehensive review of what has been achieved by Baghdad in
disarmament areas.''
	   It quoted Aziz as saying that Iraq also will launch a
``large-scale'' campaign to muster support among Arab countries for
its stand on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   He said Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, who is
currently in New York, will tour several Arab states early next
month.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 that it was suspending cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions
are lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay, and ban air travel
to and from the country.
	   The U.N. Security Council retaliated on Sept. 9 by announcing it
would suspend periodic review of the sanctions. But it agreed to
conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of the sanctions if Iraq allows
the inspectors to return to work.
	   Annan, who eased a previous crisis over inspections last
February, is considering asking the Security Council to re-evaluate
all resolutions regarding Iraq's disarmament.
	   Iraq has said it is happy with this suggestion. But it also has
refused to back down on its Aug. 5 announcement.
	   Earlier, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Dennis
Halliday, said that the United Nations has sped up the delivery of
medicines and medical supplies bought by Iraq.
	   The latest supplies arrived in Iraq on Saturday, three months
after being ordered, according to Halliday's spokesman, Eric Falt.
In earlier phases of the program, the process had taken six months.
	   ``Given the complexity of the process, this shows a significant
speed-up in delivering items in the health sector,'' Halliday said.
	   Iraq has received dlrs 366 million worth of medicines and
medical supplies since the oil-for-food program began in December
1996, Falt said. The program is an exception to the sanctions,
allowing Iraq to sell specified quantities of oil to buy needed
food and medicine.
	   Iraq has complained repeatedly that severely ill and
malnourished citizens have died waiting for the slow
contract-approval and delivery processes at the United Nations in
New York. Recently, the United Nations began to streamline the
procedures.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ An appeals court Monday dismissed sprinter Ben
Johnson's bid to lift his lifetime ban so he could compete again.
	   The ban was imposed after a track meet in 1993, when Johnson
tested positive a second time for using a banned steroid.
	   He had been suspended for two years after testing positive for
steroids at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, when he was stripped of his
gold medal and a 100-meter world record of 9.79.

 &UR; Aziz to meet Annan on weapons inspection standoff &QL;

<TEXT>
	   ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Tariq Aziz, will meet U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
next week to review proposals to defuse the crisis over U.N.
weapons inspections, Aziz said in an interview published here
Monday.
	   Aziz said the meeting would be Sept. 28 in New York, the paper
reported.
	   Aziz told the daily he will review with Annan ``ideas and
proposals he (Annan) presented to the Security Council regarding
the comprehensive review of what has been achieved by Baghdad in
disarmament areas.''
	   It quoted Aziz as saying that Iraq also will launch a
``large-scale'' campaign to muster support among Arab countries for
its stand on U.N. weapons inspections.
	   He said Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, who is
currently in New York, will tour several Arab states early next
month.
	   Iraq announced Aug. 5 that it was suspending cooperation with
U.N. weapons inspectors, who must certify that Iraq has eliminated
its weapons of mass destruction before punishing trade sanctions
are lifted.
	   The sanctions, imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait,
limit the sale of oil, Iraq's economic mainstay, and ban air travel
to and from the country.
	   The U.N. Security Council retaliated on Sept. 9 by announcing it
would suspend periodic review of the sanctions _ efffectively
killing Iraq's chances of getting the sanctions lifted.
	   But it agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of the
sanctions if Iraq allows the inspectors to return to work.
	   Annan, who eased a previous crisis over inspections last
February, is considering asking the Security Council to re-evaluate
all resolutions regarding Iraq's disarmament.
	   Iraq has said it is happy with this suggestion, but it also has
refused to back down on its Aug. 5 announcement.
	   Earlier, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Dennis
Halliday, said that the United Nations has sped up the delivery of
medicines and medical supplies bought by Iraq.
	   The latest supplies arrived in Iraq on Saturday, three months
after being ordered, according to Halliday's spokesman, Eric Falt.
In earlier phases of the program, the process had taken six months.
	   ``Given the complexity of the process, this shows a significant
speed-up in delivering items in the health sector,'' Halliday said.
	   Iraq has received dlrs 366 million worth of medicines and
medical supplies since the oil-for-food program began in December
1996, Falt said. The program is an exception to the sanctions,
allowing Iraq to sell specified quantities of oil to buy needed
food and medicine.
	   Iraq has complained repeatedly that severely ill and
malnourished citizens have died waiting for the slow
contract-approval and delivery processes at the United Nations in
New York. Recently, the United Nations began to streamline the
procedures.

FloJo dies of heart seizure

<TEXT>
	   MISSION VIEJO, California (AP) _ Florence Griffith Joyner, the
triple gold medalist at the 1988 Olympics who captivated the world
with her meteoric speed and flamboyant style, died Monday of an
apparent heart seizure. She was 38.
	   Griffith Joyner was the wife of 1984 Olympic triple-jump gold
medalist Al Joyner and the sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
the six-time Olympic medalist and world heptathlon record-holder.
	   Greg Foster, the three-time world champion in the 110-meter
hurdles, said he had been told of the death by Joyner-Kersee, who
had heard of it from her brother Al.
	   The sheriff's office in Orange County said a Florence Griffith
Joyner, 38, had died in Mission Viejo, but could not confirm that
it was the former track star.
	   Griffith Joyner had suffered a heart seizure two years ago on a
flight to St. Louis.
	   ``We lost one of the great track and field athletes in
history,'' Foster said. ``She's going to be missed. It's definitely
a shock, a great loss.''
	   Griffith Joyner still holds world records in the 100- and
200-meter dashes. She set the 100 mark of 10.49 seconds at the
quarterfinals of the 1988 Olympic trials at Indianapolis, and since
then, no one has even broken 10.60. At the Seoul Games, she won the
gold medal in a wind-aided 10.54.
	   She then smashed the world 200 record in the Olympic final,
clocking 21.34. No one else has broken 21.70.
	   She also won a gold medal in the 400 relay and just missed a
fourth gold medal when the U.S. team finished second in the 1,600
relay, which Griffith Joyner anchored.
	   Not only did ``FloJo'' dazzle fans with her stunning speed, she
caught their attention with her colorful bodysuits and her 6-inch
(15-centimeter) decorated fingernails.
	   She also displayed a muscular physique, which prompted talk of
steroid use. Griffith Joyner insisted she never used performance
enhancers and she never failed a drug test.
	   At the 1988 trials, where she ran the three fastest 100-meter
times ever by a woman and set the American record in the 200, she
also set standards in track fashion.
	   One eye-catching outfit was a purple bodysuit with a turquoise
bikini brief over it, but with nothing on her left leg, a design
she referred to as a ``one-legger.''
	   At the Olympics, she painted three of her fingernails red, white
and blue, and she painted a fourth gold to signify her goal.
	   At the 1987 World Championships in Rome, she caused a sensation
by running the first two rounds in a skintight suit similar to a
speedskater's togs.
	   But her health was a concern.
	   In 1996, she suffered a seizure on an airplane flight from
California to St. Louis. She was hospitalized for one day, and the
family requested that no other details be released.
	   At the time, Griffith Joyner, accompanied by her husband and
daughter, Mary, was en route to the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Relays for
high school athletes.
	   ``The Olympic family is saddened and stunned by her passing,''
U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said today. ``She was a
role model for girls and young women in sports and her legacy will
be one that included kindness and an interest in children. She will
be missed.''
	   Griffith Joyner was voted The Associated Press Female Athlete of
the Year for 1988 and also won the Sullivan Award as the nation's
top amateur athlete.
	   After retiring from track in the wake of the Seoul Games, she
served for a time as co-chair of the President's Council on
Physical Fitness.
	   She began designing and modeling clothes and working with
children, both through sports programs and a series of books.
	   Griffith Joyner was born Dec. 21, 1959, in south Los Angeles,
one of 11 children whose father was an electrical technician and
mother was a teacher.
	   She graduated from Jordan High School in Los Angeles in 1978,
attended Cal State Los Angeles for two years, then graduated from
UCLA in 1983 with a degree in psychology.
	   She married Al Joyner on Oct. 10, 1987.
	   For many years, she was coached by Bob Kersee, husband of Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, but Al acted as her coach after the 1988 trials.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

 &UR; American Airlines, British Airways forge new global alliance &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The airline business will get a second super
alliance of carriers _ after American Airlines and British Airways
teamed up Monday with three partners, saying they will be able to
fly virtually anywhere in the world.
	   The alliance also includes Canadian Airlines, Australia's Qantas
and Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways _ and they hope to expand
soon with partners from continental Europe and Japan.
	   The airlines say their venture, called ``oneworld,'' will be a
tough competitor to the Star Alliance put together by United
Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa _ but one rival warns that
passengers may end up paying too much as competition dries up on
some routes.
	   Billionaire Richard Branson, who runs Virgin Atlantic Airways,
said the oneworld group will stifle competition on flights between
Britain and Australia or London and Hong Kong.
	   Virgin said it controls 16 percent of the traffic between London
and Hong Kong while British Airways and Cathay Pacific have the
other 84 percent.
	   ``For `oneworld,' read one company, one monopoly and millions of
passengers taken for a ride,'' Branson said in a statement.
	   Canadian Airlines and Australia's Qantas already had marketing
partnerships with American and British Airways _ and Cathay Pacific
came aboard Monday.
	   Executives told a news conference that they had invited the
Spanish flag carrier Iberia to join up. Finnair president Antti
Potila said later his company was negotiating to get into the
group.
	   The executives also have their eyes set on a bigger prize: Japan
Airlines.
	   ``It's really up to the Japanese to make their decision on
that,'' said Don Carty, the chief executive at American. Asked
about getting a Latin American partner, Carty said this, too, was a
possibility although he said American already has an extensive
route network in the region.
	   Oneworld was launched even as American and British Airways
continue their fight to gain regulatory approval for a separate
deal that would give them U.S. antitrust immunity to set prices on
routes across the Atlantic.
	   The new alliance is ``not a substitute,'' said Bob Ayling, chief
executive at British Airways.
	   The alliance is a first for Cathay Pacific, which said its
associate carrier Dragonair, serving some destinations in China,
might also join after setting up a frequent flyer program and
making other necessary changes.
	   The Cathay Pacific chief executive, David Turnbull, said Cathay
Pacific had been approached by other airlines, including the Star
Alliance organized by United and Lufthansa in May 1997. The other
Star Alliance partners include Air Canada, Scandinavian Airlines
System, Thai Airways and the Brazilian carrier Varig.
	   ``It's taken us a long time,'' Turnbull acknowledged. ``When you
get married, you want to make sure you make the right choice.
Getting unmarried can be difficult.''
	   The airlines say they will coordinate their flight schedules and
ticketing, while cooperating on their frequent flier programs to
better serve customers beginning early next year.
	   Alliances are becoming increasingly common in the international
aviation industry, where travel is booming, but leading airlines
realized long ago it wouldn't be feasible to get big enough to
cover the entire globe single-handedly.
	   The creation of oneworld gives the industry two big global
alliances, although there are many smaller ones such as the deal
between Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.
	   Despite protests from Branson, the airlines have no intention of
becoming one company _ each will maintain its separate brand name
and no equity stakes will be exchanged.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin met with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Monday to finalize Cabinet selections and
formulate a strategy to reactivate the country's moribund economy.
	   Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion rubles (dlrs
66 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid to prevent the
collapse of the country's commercial banks.
	   The financial crisis has caused a backlog of bank payments
totaling over 30 billion rubles (dlrs 2 billion), Andrei Kozlov,
first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, told a news conference.
	   The bank launched an emergency rescue plan on Friday to help
settle 10 billion rubles (dlrs 666 million) of the payments, or
one-third of the total owed between banks and their clients, Kozlov
said.
	   As part of the effort, the Central Bank printed 900 million
rubles (dlrs 60 million) and issued short-term credits to banks,
Kozlov said. He stressed that the amount was too small to affect
the ruble's rate and inflation.
	   But many analysts feared the move may set a dangerous precedent,
and if such a policy is continued, it could fuel inflation and lead
to further declines in the the ruble, officially valued at 16 to
the U.S. dollar, down from six when the crisis began a month ago.
	   Critics have accused the government of responding slowly to the
economic crisis, which hit last month. The rescue plan for the
banks represents the biggest emergency effort so far.
	   Primakov has been in office 10 days, but has yet to outline an
overall economic strategy or put his cabinet in place. Key jobs,
such as the finance minister's post, have not been filled.
	   ``We are going to finalize the personnel issue with (Primakov)
today,'' Yeltsin said at the start of his meeting with the premier,
but no new Cabinet appointees had been announced by Monday night.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin, after meeting with
Yeltsin, said the government's plan would be unveiled on Wednesday.
He did not reveal any details of the program.
	   He also said that decisions on how much money the government
should print should be made jointly by the Finance Ministry and the
Central Bank.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ Russia's Finance Ministry will meet Thursday with
representatives of major Western banks who believe the government
has given preferential treatment to Russian bond-holding banks.
Acting Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told a news conference
they will seek a mutually acceptable plan for restructuring the
government's ruble-denominated debt and all investors will be
treated as equals. ``The treatment should be absolutely equal,'' he
said.
	   _ The ruble closed unchanged at 16.3 to the U.S. dollar after
the Central Bank canceled electronic currency trading on the
interbank exchange. The bank said it needed more time to determine
which banks should be allowed to participate on the currency
markets.
	   _ Russian stocks lost ground in sparse activity. The Russian
Trading System Index fell 4.6 percent to close at 47.81, down from
50.12 points Friday. It was the first time the index closed below
50 points.
	   _ Primakov named Gennady Kulik, 63, a Soviet-era agricultural
official and a member of parliament's Agrarian Faction, as deputy
prime minister for agriculture. Kulik, a defender of collective
farms and a staunch opponent of private land ownership, has been
among those who have blocked Yeltsin's plans to carry out land
reform.
	   _ Primakov also named Shokhin, considered a moderate reformer,
to head Russia's delegation to the International Monetary Fund. An
IMF mission is in Moscow for talks to follow up on Russia's loan
program. The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package in
July, but it did not ward off the crisis.
	   _ The State Statistics Committee announced that unemployment
increased slightly last month to 8.35 million people, or 11.5
percent of the workforce. The rate is expected to rise even higher
due to the worsening crisis.

	   Special feeding centers have been established in Kinshasa to
help tens of thousands of people affected by food and clean water
shortages triggered by Congo's civil war.
	   Although the war shifted away from the capital in recent weeks,
an army of rebels had effectively cut the city off for almost a
month.
	   Food supplies had dwindled and market prices in many cases had
spiraled up beyond the reach of most people.
	   ``Commercial food deliveries to Kinshasa have just resumed, but
essential food items like flour and rice are still in short
supply,'' said Stefano Porretti, the WFP representative in
Kinshasa.
	   Among the most affected by the food shortages are young
children, the U.N. food agency reported.
	   The latest emergency shipments of food relief will help provide
three meals a day for up to 10,000 children over the course of one
week.
	   There are longer term plans to feed up to 120,000 people in
Kinshasa over the next three months, the agency said.

	   A three-judge panel of Ontario's appeals court rejected
Johnson's bid for reinstatement, ruling that a lower court was
correct last summer when it upheld the lifetime ban imposed by the
International Amateur Athletics Federation.
	   Johnson's agent and manager, Morris Chrobotek, has said Johnson
would try to take his case to Canada's Supreme Court if he lost the
appeal in Ontario.
	   Johnson, 36, trains almost full-time in hopes of becoming
eligible to race again. He says the ban is unfair because it
prevents him from working.
	   ``I'm a human being, allowed to make a living. This is my job,''
he said last week.
	   In 1993, Johnson tested positive for an abnormal level of
testosterone after a random test at a track meet in Montreal. At
the time, he was on a comeback from a two-year suspension after his
positive test at the 1988 Olympics.
	   His return to sprinting had started at the 1991 Hamilton Indoor
Games, where he finished second in the 50 meters in 5.77 seconds.
	   It reached its peak when he raced in a semifinal of the 100
meters at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, finishing last.

Albanian prime minister calls for cabinet changes, once situation
</HEADLINE>
calms

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian prime minister said Monday
he would support changes in his Cabinet to help secure stability in
Europe's poorest country but only after the current political
unrest has ceased.
	   After meeting with his Cabinet, Prime Minister Fatos Nano told
state-run Albanian television ministers had discussed a package of
measures that would take Albania to a point of stability that would
prevent ever falling back to ``abnormality.''
	   Violence exploded in Albania last week, after the assassination
of popular opposition leader Azem Hajdari on Sept. 19. Hajdari's
death sparked demonstrations by followers of former President Sali
Berisha, who accused Nano of the killing and demanded he resign.
	   The protests turned violent last Monday, when armed crowds
calling for Nano's resignation stormed government buildings and
took control of the state radio and television.
	   Albania's parliament lifted Berisha's immunity last week, paving
the way for his arrest on charges of trying to overthrow the
government. But international mediators have urged the government
not to arrest Berisha to allow tempers to cool.
	   On Saturday officials from the multinational Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe visited Albania in an attempt to
open dialogue between the two sides. The officials criticized
Berisha for inciting the violence, but also said Nano's government
had been slow in fighting corruption.
	   ``We have not denied the need for changes,'' Nano said Monday.
``But we'll do one thing at a time. Now we're still cracking down
on the attempt of a coup d'etat.'' He said the changes would take
place over three months, but gave no further details.
	   Also Monday, the World Bank offered support for the government,
saying it would continue its ``intensive cooperation with the
authorities to improve public administration, fight corruption and
implement other high priority reforms.''
	   Yet despite international community efforts to defuse the
political climate, the capital remained tense Monday.
	   Berisha, who is determined the government should resign, called
together right-wing parties to ``institutionalize the front against
dictatorship.''
	   A group of government prosecutors charged with investigating
last week's violent events, said in a statement that one of the
members' house had been targeted with hand grenades early Monday.
The prosecutors accused Berisha of orchestrating the attack.

<TEXT>
	   ... QUESTION: Going down to 6(d) _ ``Has it ever been reported
to you that he met with Monica Lewinsky and talked about this
case?''
	   This is your answer, or a portion of it.
	   ``I knew that he met with her. I think we suggested that he meet
with her. Anyway, he met with her. I thought that he talked to her
about something else.''
	   Why didn't you tell the court when you were under oath, and
sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,
that she had been talking with Vernon Jordan about the case, about
the affidavit from the lawyer, the subpoena?
	   CLINTON: Well, that's not the question I was asked. I was not
asked any question about _ I was asked ``Has it ever been reported
to you that he met with Monica Lewinsky and talked about this
case?'' ...
	   QUESTION: Are you saying, sir, that you forgot when you were
asked this question that Vernon Jordan had come on Dec. 19, just 3
1/2 weeks before, and said that he'd met that day, the day that
Monica got the subpoena?
	   CLINTON: It's quite _ this is sort of a jumbled answer. It's
quite possible that I had gotten mixed up between whether she had
met with him or talked to him on the telephone in those 3 1/2
weeks.
	   Again, I say, sir _ just from the tone of your voice and the way
you're asking questions here _ it's obvious that this is the most
important thing in the world and that everybody was focused on all
the details at the time. But that's not the way it was. ...
	   QUESTION: But Vernon Jordan met with you, sir, and he reported
that he had met with Monica Lewinsky. And the discussion was about
the lawsuit, and you didn't inform under oath the court of that in
your deposition.
	   CLINTON: I gave the best answer I could based on the best memory
I had at the time they asked me the question. That's the only
answer I can give you, sir.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ An appeals court on Monday dismissed sprinter Ben
Johnson's bid to lift his lifetime ban so he could compete again.
	   The ban was imposed after a track meet in 1993, when Johnson
tested positive a second time for using a banned steroid.
	   He had been suspended for two years after testing positive for
steroids at the Seoul Olympics in 1988, when he was stripped of his
gold medal and a 100-meter world record of 9.79.

World leaders urge action on Asian financial crisis, terrorism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be led &QL;

 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders opened the first day of the
General Assembly's annual debate Monday by urging an international
effort to rein in the Asian financial crisis before it brings down
more economies and calling for a comprehensive attack on terrorism.
	   Brazil's foreign minister launched the 53rd session by warning
that a few countries working alone cannot bail out nations
suffering from the effects of the crisis.
	   ``Experience teaches us that inaction can have a high cost,''
Luiz Felipe Lampreia said.
	   ``The world cannot depend only on the willingness, capacity and
interest of a select number of countries to mobilize and lead
international efforts in this or that direction.''
	   In recent weeks, Brazil's stock and currency markets have been
battered by the Asian economic crisis that has seen investors
fleeing Asia, Russia and other developing markets. The collapse of
the Indonesian currency last year sparked the crisis.
	   Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, in prepared
comments, urged the creation of a ``lender of last resort,'' to
meet the needs of the volatile markets because existing financial
institutions couldn't handle all the problems.
	   ``The maladies that spring from economic globalization require
remedies which are global in scope, remedies which must take
account of the ailments of all states, and not be based solely on
the prescriptions advanced by those who may seem to be secure,''
she said.
	   President Bill Clinton pledged the United States would do more
to minimize the turmoil. But he focused his address on the fight
against terrorism _ evidenced Monday in the unprecedented security
that greeted world leaders and which will remain in place for the
next two weeks.
	   ``Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation with a powerful
military and a worldwide presence active in promoting peace and
security, we are often a target,'' Clinton said, referring to the
Aug. 7 dual bombings on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.
	   ``No one in this room, nor the people you represent, are
immune,'' Clinton said.
	   Kumaratunga decried what she said was the terrorism that has
wracked Sri Lanka for 15 years and killed an estimated 54,000
people.
	   ``A particularly cruel offense against the innocence of children
is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group in Sri Lanka to
serve as suicide killers in the name of a cause they are too young
to even comprehend,'' she said.

Federal prosecutor reports arrest of Turkish terrorist suspect
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ The Chief Federal Prosecutor's office
on Monday said a Turkish terrorist suspect has been arrested as an
alleged member of a banned terrorist organization.
	   The man, identified only as Ertugrul Y., 39, was arrested in
Hamburg on Friday based on an arrest warrant issued on April 3,
1997, a prosecutor's statement said.
	   It said the suspect belonged to the Yagan wing of the outlawed
Turkish extremist organization group, Devrimci Sol, and was
responsible for obtaining weapons and forged passports for the
group.
	   The Interior Ministry banned Yagan and its rival splinter group,
Karatas, on Aug. 13, saying they finance their activities largely
by blackmailing Turkish residents and businesses in Germany.
	   Both groups split off from Devrimci Sol in 1992 and have long
used violence and murder to gain dominance in Germany, home to some
2 million Turks, the ministry said.
	   Both have a combined membership of about 1,300 and have adopted
Devrimci Sol's goal of overthrowing the Turkish government to
replace it with a Marxist regime, according to the ministry.
	   The latest arrest follows the arrests of several Karatas members
in June for blackmail, murder and attempted murder.
	   Prosecutors at the time said the leader of the Karatas wing
ordered members to attack and sometimes kill Yagan wing members
wing and Turks unwilling to contribute money. They also blame the
group for arson attacks against Turkish businesses in Germany.
	   Germany banned Devrimci Sol in 1983.

Iraqi lawyer to joint Lockerbie defense team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An Iraqi lawyer has been selected to join
the defense team of two Libyans suspected of the 1988 bombing of a
Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, a Baghdad weekly
reported Monday.
	   Nabed al-Shabab, or the Pulse of Youth, said the lawyer,
Izziddin Abdullah, would travel soon to Libya.
	   He was nominated for the job by Iraq's Bar Association and
National Assembly, or parliament, the paper said.
	   Libya has invited lawyers from a number of countries to
participate in the defense of Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah, who were indicted in the United States and Scotland
in the case.
	   Lawyers from Egypt already have said they will participate in
the suspects' defense, and Libyan officials said attorneys also
will come from Malta, the United States and Europe.
	   The crash killed 270 people and prompted the United Nations to
impose sanctions on Libya to force the surrender of the suspects.
The sanctions ban air travel to and from Libya, freeze assets
abroad and bar the sale of some oil equipment.
	   Britain and the United States initially insisted that the
suspects be tried in their countries. But last month, they said
they would accept a trial in the Netherlands.
	   Libya, which had repeatedly insisted that the trial be in a
``neutral'' country, accepted the offer in principle. But it has
sought negotiations on the rights and security of the suspects in
the Netherlands.

More progress needed for human rights to fulfill declaration,
</HEADLINE>
Mandela says &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Extraordinary developments have unfolded
since the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted 50
years ago, but millions of people have yet to reap its benefits,
South African President Nelson Mandela said Monday.
	   ``The very right to be human is denied every day to hundreds of
millions of people,'' held hostage by conflict, nuclear terror and
brutal regimes, he told world leaders at the General Assembly's
annual session.
	   ``Many are still unable to participate in the determination of
the destiny of their family and to protect themselves from
tyranny,'' said Mandela, whose own country freed itself from the
oppression of apartheid only four years ago.
	   In his speech, expected to be his last at the United Nations,
Mandela pointed out that these problems exist not only in Africa,
where regional conflicts in Sudan, Congo and Angola threaten to
spill over national frontiers. They also afflict Europe and Asia,
where ethnic rivalries have gripped the Balkans, Afghanistan and
Sri Lanka, he said.
	   The same lack of human rights can also be seen from an economic
perspective in the ``divide between the rich and the poor,''
Mandela said as he took note of the Asian financial crisis which
also has taken its toll on South Africa.
	   Since the beginning of the year, the rand has dropped 20
percent, and South Africa's unemployment is currently 40 percent.
The country's growth has dwindled to 0.3 percent, down from 1.7
percent in 1997 and 3.2 percent in 1996.
	   In his speech, Mandela also scolded countries that have nuclear
weapons programs.
	   ``We must ask the question, which might sound naive to those who
have elaborated sophisticated arguments to justify their refusal to
eliminate these terrible and terrifying weapons of mass destruction
_ why do they need them anyway?'' he said
	   ``In reality, no rational answer can be advanced to explain in a
satisfactory manner what in the end is the consequence of Cold War
inertia and an attachment to the use of the threat of brute force,
to assert the primacy of some states over others,'' he said.

Jimenez wins his fourth stage victory, Olano stays top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGUNAS DE NEILA, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Jose Maria Jimenez of
the Banesto team won the 16th stage of the Tour of Spain on Monday,
his fourth victory in the 22-leg cycling marathon.
	   Banesto teamwork also successfully defended the overall
leadership position held by fellow Spaniard Abraham Olano ever
since he won the 9th stage time trial.
	   Jimenez covered the 143.7-kilometer (89-mile) run in northern
Spain in 3 hours, 28 minutes and 12 seconds, coming in 33 seconds
clear of his closest rivals.
	   This year's most successful rider in the Tour's mountain stages,
Jimenez launched his final attack just a few kilometers (miles)
from the finishing line.
	   ``It was wonderful. I saw that the rest were looking tired....I
saw the moment and I went for it,'' he told reporters after the
race. He dedicated the victory to Spain in general and to his
masseur in particular.
	   Olano, meanwhile, said he was relieved to see out the ``worst of
what is left in the Tour.''
	   ``That last climb was very difficult to me,'' he told reporters
referring to the final grueling mountain peddle upwards to the
finishing line.
	   No. 2 Laurent Jalabert of France and the ONCE-Deutsche Bank team
did manage to cut Olano's lead by 13 seconds to 22 seconds
	   Tuesday's 17th leg covers 188.5 kilometers (116.9 miles) between
the cities of Burgos to Leon as the tour heads east before wrapping
up with several stages in the mountains outside Madrid, and a key
time-trial in the town of Fuenlabrada.

Russian governor says Norway planning outreach to northern region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Norway plans to give 4.7 million kroner (dlrs
630,000) to a northern Russian region that has been hard hit by the
country's economic crisis, a news agency reported Monday.
	   The announcement was made by Yuri Yevdokimov, governor of the
Murmansk region, who just returned from a trip to Oslo, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Yevkokimov said he also had reached an agreement under which the
Norwegian Statoil company would build 10 gas stations on the Kola
Peninsula and ship oil to the region to allow residents to get
through the winter with adequate fuel supplies.

Italian Embassy confirms killing of two Italian tourists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Two Italian tourists were shot to death last
week outside the Cuban capital, the Italian Embassy in Havana
confirmed Monday.
	   An embassy spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the names of the victims had not been released.
Both were believed to be in their 30s.
	   The two men apparently were killed on Monday, Sept. 14, and
their bodies were found on the beach in Guanabo, outside Havana, on
Wednesday, the spokeswoman said. She said that ``firearms were
involved,'' but provided no other details.
	   Interpol has been asked to help in the investigation, she said.
	   Killings, especially involving guns, are extremely rare in Cuba.
	   Cuban authorities have issued no statements on the slayings.

Chemical weapons experts to discuss Iraq VX findings at U.N.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Chemical weapons experts from three
countries are expected at the United Nations this week to discuss
apparently conflicting test results on Iraqi warheads suspected of
carrying deadly VX gas, a U.N. spokesman said Monday.
	   Also next Monday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz was expected
at U.N. headquarters to meet with Secretary-General Kofi Annan
about the standoff over arms inspections, which have been paralyzed
since Aug. 5.
	   Annan is formulating a proposal of a comprehensive review of
U.N. resolutions regarding Iraq's disarmament as a way to break the
impasse.
	   Iraq must give up its chemical, biological and nuclear weapons,
and long-range missile systems before sweeping economic sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.
	   Experts from France and Switzerland, meanwhile, are expected to
deliver final results on their analysis of missile fragments on
Wednesday. Preliminary results from those countries have been
received, but have apparently failed to turn up traces of the
deadly nerve agent, according to published reports.
	   The Swiss and French results appear to contradict the findings
of the Aberdeen Proving Ground laboratory. In June, the Maryland
laboratory disclosed that it found traces of VX on fragments of
missile warheads that Iraq had filled before the 1991 Gulf War. A
few drops of the nerve agent can be fatal.
	   Pentagon officials and the U.N.'s chief weapons inspector
Richard Butler said that even if the European labs fail to turn up
VX, Baghdad still must explain the findings of the Aberdeen lab.
	   Ewen Buchannan, a spokesman for the U.N. Special Commission,
which is charged with disarming Iraq of weapons of mass
destruction, said, ``Iraq still has to explain in a coherent and
verifiable manner the presence of VX ... in the remnants that were
tested in the laboratory, which just happens to be in the U.S.''
	   Iraq admits that it experimented with VX, but maintains that it
failed to produce the gas in a form that could be loaded into
missile warheads. The presence of VX in missile fragments recovered
at al-Nibai, the site where Iraq in 1991 unilaterally destroyed and
buried warheads designed to carry chemical weapons, could
contradict that claim.
	   The Aberdeen lab tested missile fragments recovered from
al-Nibai. Swiss and French experts worked from swipes of fragments
stored in a shed near the excavation site.
	   Prior to taking their samples in July, the Swiss and French
experts met in Bahrain where they reviewed the Aberdeen results and
found them to be ``beyond doubt,'' Buchannan said.

battle
 &UR; Eds: Updates with party postponing decision

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy's hard-line Communists on Monday put off a
decision on their strategy for the upcoming battle with the
government over the 1999 budget until Oct. 3.
	   But after a bitter internal spat, the leaders of the Communist
Refoundation Party approved a statement once again criticizing the
government for not doing enough to create more jobs.
	   They decided to wait until Oct. 3 for a general party meeting to
approve their strategy plan. Parliament has until the end of the
year to approve the budget.

World leaders urge action on Asian financial crisis, terrorism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS comments from South African leader &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-General Assembly &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders opened the first day of the
General Assembly's annual debate by urging an international effort
to rein in the Asian financial crisis before it brings down more
economies and calling for a comprehensive attack on terrorism.
	   Brazil's foreign minister launched the 53rd session by warning
that a few countries alone cannot bail out nations suffering from
the effects of the crisis.
	   ``Experience teaches us that inaction can have a high cost,''
Luiz Felipe Lampreia told world leaders gathered for the first day
of the two-week speech-making forum.
	   ``The world cannot depend only on the willingness, capacity and
interest of a select number of countries to mobilize and lead
international efforts in this or that direction.''
	   In recent weeks, Brazil's stock and currency markets have been
battered by the Asian economic crisis that has seen investors
fleeing Asia, Russia and other developing markets. The collapse of
the Indonesian currency last year sparked the crisis.
	   Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, urged the creation
of a ``lender of last resort,'' to meet the needs of the volatile
markets because existing financial institutions couldn't handle all
the problems.
	   ``The maladies that spring from economic globalization require
remedies which are global in scope, remedies which must take
account of the ailments of all states, and not be based solely on
the prescriptions advanced by those who may seem to be secure,''
she said.
	   President Bill Clinton pledged the United States would do more
to minimize the turmoil. But he focused his address on the fight
against terrorism _ evidenced Monday in the unprecedented security
that greeted world leaders and will remain in place for the next
two weeks.
	   ``Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation with a powerful
military and a worldwide presence active in promoting peace and
security, we are often a target,'' Clinton said, referring to the
Aug. 7 dual bombings on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.
	   ``No one in this room, nor the people you represent, are
immune,'' Clinton said.
	   Kumaratunga decried what she said was the terrorism that has
wracked Sri Lanka for 15 years and killed an estimated 54,000
people.
	   ``A particularly cruel offense against the innocence of children
is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group in Sri Lanka to
serve as suicide killers in the name of a cause they are too young
to even comprehend,'' she said.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela decried human rights
abuses that afflict millions of people around the world _
particularly in Africa, where regional conflicts in Sudan, Congo
and Angola threaten to spill over.
	   ``The very right to be human is denied every day to hundreds of
millions of people,'' held hostage by conflict, nuclear terror and
brutal regimes, he told the audience in what was expected to be his
last speech at the assembly.
	   ``Many are still unable to participate in the determination of
the destiny of their family and to protect themselves from
tyranny,'' said Mandela, whose own country freed itself from the
oppression of apartheid only four years ago.

Security head says Palestinians will fight to defend future state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ A top Palestinian security official
said Monday that his troops would use ``all means available'' for
defense if attacked by Israel in response to a promised declaration
of Palestinian statehood in May, 1999.
	   ``We do not know exactly what the reaction of Israel will be and
we don't know if will be confrontational,'' the head of Palestinian
general intelligence, Amin al-Hindi, told a press conference in
Ramallah.
	   ``But I will say that we will fight to defend our state and
existence by all means available,'' al-Hindi added.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has repeatedly promised to
announce a Palestinian state on May 4, 1999, the date when the
interim five-year period of Palestinian autonomy expires.
	   Israel has said it might in reaction annex parts of the occupied
territories, a move that could bring military confrontation between
the sides.
	   Arafat was slated this week to seek international support for a
Palestinian state during the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
	   As the date inched closer, Israel and the Palestinians remained
stuck in an 18-month impasse in the peace talks whose end appeared
distanct as negotiators could not agree on the terms for an Israeli
troop withdrawal from parts of the West Bank.
	   In a sign of the lack of trust between the security forces,
Al-Hindi condemned the Israeli army for what he said was its
unjustified closure of the Palestinian territories.
	   Israel had sealed off the areas on Sept. 12 for fear of
retaliatory attacks by the military wing of Hamas, Izzedine
al-Qassam, after the army shot and killed two group leaders wanted
for their alleged part in attacks on Israelis.
	   ``In our monitoring of Izzedine al-Qassam, we do not believe
that they are preparing attacks from our areas,'' al-Hindi said.
	   ``Even the Israeli security doesn't have real information that
Hamas will carry out any attacks,'' al-Hindi said, based on his
conversations with Israeli military officials.
	   The intelligence official said he believed the brothers were
arrested, killed and then moved to the cottage outside the West
Bank city of Hebron.
	   The Israeli army says soldiers shot the armed fugitives without
knowing their identity.
	   Meanwhile, Israeli military sources said soldiers had arrested a
Palestinian from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Abu Dis on
Friday night for alleged involvement in Hamas but could not give
further details.
	   An army spokesman would not comment on the report.

Masked men make off with Monet and Sisley paintings from museum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with culture minister statement, other art thefts this
year in France

<TEXT>
	   NICE, France (AP) _ Two armed men wearing black masks made off
Monday with two valuable impressionist paintings from a museum in
Nice after taking the curator hostage.
	   The incident began about 7 a.m. Monday morning when the thieves
showed up at the home of Jean Fournis, the curator of the Fine Arts
Museum of Nice.
	   The robbers took Fournis hostage and drove him to the museum,
where they bound and gagged the caretaker as well as another
employee and shut all three men up in the museum library.
	   The museum alarm was turned off because the caretaker was on
duty.
	   The two thieves then proceeded to seize an 1897 painting by
Claude Monet called ``The Cliffs of Dieppe'' and another one by
Alfred Sisley dating from 1890 named ``The Alley of the Poplars.''
	   They sped off in the car belonging to the curator.
	   Both paintings belong to the French state. They are widely known
and would be difficult to sell, Fournis said. Police in Nice are
investigating the theft.
	   Several works of art have been stolen this year from French
museums, and Culture Minister Catherine Trautmann said Monday she
was ``deeply worried by the recent development of these new forms
of crime.''
	   In May, an oil painting by the 19th century French painter
Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot was stolen form the Louvre museum in
Paris. It was valued at dlrs 1.3 million. On Jan. 8, a stone
fragment from around 400 B.C. was also discovered missing at the
Louvre.
	   Also in May, thieves broke down the gates of a chateau in
northern France once used by Emperor Napoleon III and stole about
20 pieces of art.

Uruguay president expresses worry about global financial crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) - Uruguay's president on Monday expressed
fears that the global financial crisis might lead to instability in
Latin America and threaten democratic governments.
	   Addressing the U.N. General Assembly's general debate, President
Julio Maria Sanguinetti said that his country had made great
economic strides over the past year, but now feared the crisis
``which is touching us all.''
	   ``The last few years have shown a Uruguay which is making
strides in its economy, which is making strides in its
prosperity,'' Sanguinetti said.
	   ``However, we come here today to this session not only with
concerns over its institutions or peace ... but also seeing the
ghost of a crisis which began as a financial Asian crisis which is
today a global crisis, and which is touching us all,'' said
Sanguinetti.
	   He said the challenge today was how to ``play our cards in this
crisis, a crisis which could affect not only finances and economies
but also the democratic stability of our countries, our social
peace and our values.''

Blair on Tuesday, the News Agency of Nigeria reported.
	   From Britain, Abubakar will continue to France and the United
States, where he will visit the United Nations. The agency said
Abubakar had yet to confirm meetings with U.S. President Bill
Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac.
	   Relations between Nigeria and much of the international
community, particularly the West, have been strained since 1993,
when then dictator Gen. Sani Abacha annulled presidential elections
and imposed his own harsh brand of dictatorial rule.
	   Abacha's five years in power before his death in June were
marked by rampant human rights abuses, including the controversial
execution of author and environmental activist Ken Saro-Wiwa.
	   Abubakar, who came to power after Abacha's death, has been
working to improve relations with the rest of the world. He has
promised a return to civilian rule and has released many political
prisoners.

Albanian prime minister calls for cabinet changes, once situation

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with former news agency director arrested &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian prime minister said Monday
he would support changes in his Cabinet to help secure stability in
Europe's poorest country but only after the current political
unrest has ceased.
	   After meeting with his Cabinet, Prime Minister Fatos Nano told
state-run Albanian television ministers had discussed a package of
measures that would take Albania to a point of stability that would
prevent ever falling back to ``abnormality.''
	   Violence exploded in Albania last week, after the assassination
of popular opposition leader Azem Hajdari on Sept. 19. Hajdari's
death sparked demonstrations by followers of former President Sali
Berisha, who accused Nano of the killing and demanded he resign.
	   The protests turned violent last Monday, when armed crowds
calling for Nano's resignation stormed government buildings and
took control of the state radio and television.
	   Albania's parliament lifted Berisha's immunity last week, paving
the way for his arrest on charges of trying to overthrow the
government. But international mediators have urged the government
not to arrest Berisha to allow tempers to cool.
	   On Saturday officials from the multinational Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe visited Albania in an attempt to
open dialogue between the two sides. The officials criticized
Berisha for inciting the violence, but also said Nano's government
had been slow in fighting corruption.
	   ``We have not denied the need for changes,'' Nano said Monday.
``But we'll do one thing at a time. Now we're still cracking down
on the attempt of a coup d'etat.'' He said the changes would take
place over three months, but gave no further details.
	   Also Monday, the World Bank offered support for the government,
saying it would continue its ``intensive cooperation with the
authorities to improve public administration, fight corruption and
implement other high priority reforms.''
	   Yet despite international community efforts to defuse the
political climate, the capital remained tense Monday.
	   Berisha, who is determined the government should resign, called
together right-wing parties to ``institutionalize the front against
dictatorship.''
	   A group of government prosecutors charged with investigating
last week's violent events, said in a statement that one of the
members' house had been targeted with hand grenades early Monday.
The prosecutors accused Berisha of orchestrating the attack.
	   Late Monday, state-run ATA news agency reported its former
director Ilir Zhilla, was arrested on charges of taking part in an
armed uprising. Zhilla led the agency under Berisha.
	   He is the second journalist to be arrested in two days.

Milutinovic hired as new MetroStars coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with club VP quotes; adds Milutinovic's contract is
through end of season with agreement to negotiate longer-term deal;
CHANGES dateline &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEACAUCUS, New Jersey (AP) _ Bora Milutinovic, the only man to
guide four different teams into the second round of the World Cup,
on Monday became the New York-New Jersey MetroStars' fifth coach in
less than three years.
	   The Serbian-born Milutinovic, who also was one of four
candidates to replace Steve Sampson as coach of the U.S. national
team, was to arrive in New York from Mexico Monday evening and take
over the squad Tuesday.
	   Milutinovic has a contract through the end of the season with an
agreement to negotiate a longer-term deal. He replaces Alfonso
Mondelo, who took over the side following the departure of
Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira. Parreira left in December after
one season with the MetroStars to coach Saudi Arabia in the 1998
World Cup.
	   Despite clinching a playoff berth last month, the MetroStars
have lost their last six matches, fallen from second to third in
the Eastern Conference and dropped to 14-17 with one game remaining
before the post-season.
	   ``This was not a change just to make a change,'' MetroStars vice
president and general manager Charlie Stillitano said. ``It's less
than an indictment on Mondelo and more of the faith I have in Bora.
	   ``Bora knows our team, the core of our team. This is more than a
six-game slide. We haven't played well since the All-Star (Game,
Aug. 2) break.
	   ``Bora has a reputation of being the best to coach a team where
it's going into a tournament. And let's face it, we're going into a
tournament (the playoffs).''
	   Milutinovic is known throughout the world as a soccer mercenary
able to take a team on short notice and achieve immediate success.
He led Mexico to the quarterfinals at the 1986 World Cup, its
highest finish.
	   He took over Costa Rica just before the 1990 World Cup and
stunned many by getting it into the second round. He was introduced
by then U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg in 1991 as
a ``miracle worker'' and proceeded to qualify the United States for
the second round in 1994.
	   He left his post with the U.S. national team in 1995, saying he
was fired for not taking a larger role in player development.
	   Milutinovic appeared again on the world scene in France this
summer, guiding Nigeria into the second round before it was
eliminated by Denmark.
	   The 44-year-old Milutinovic continues the carousel of
high-profile coaches who have stood on the MetroStars' sideline.
Former New York Cosmos coach Eddie Firmani lasted less than two
months of the first season in 1996 before he was replaced by former
Portuguese national team coach Carlos Queiroz.
	   After Queiroz left to take a more lucrative offer with a
Japanese club following the 1996 season, Parreira was hired, but he
departed following the 1997 season for the Saudi job.
	   The hiring of Mondelo, who had coached the second-division Long
Island Rough Riders, was seen by many as an end to the MetroStars'
fascination with big-name coaches.
	   Milutinovic had been one of four names bandied about to replace
national team coach Sampson, along with Washington D.C. United
coach Bruce Arena, Queiroz and Parreira. Sampson's replacement is
expected to be announced before the end of October.
	   Stillitano said he had been concerned about the team's poor form
since the beginning of August, but that the organization's concern
reached a head following last Wednesday's 5-0 rout at home by D.C.
United.
	   With the MetroStars, Milutinovic will be reunited with four
players whom he coached during the 1994 World Cup: midfielders Tab
Ramos and Mike Sorber, goalkeeper Tony Meola and defender Alexi
Lalas.

Yemen executes two men for murder

<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Two Yemeni men were executed by a firing
squad in a public square for a 1996 murder, the attorney general
said.
	   Dozens of residents of the town of Al-Heimah turned out for the
execution of Mohammed Mohammed Ahmed and Abdullah Saleh al-Mustafa,
who were natives of the town. Al-Heimah is 35 kilometers (22 miles)
west of the Yemen capital San`a.
	   The two were convicted and sentenced to death in July for
killing Awad Saleh Dawoud, also came from Al-Heimah.
	   No details of the crime were given.

Track legend `FloJo' dies of heart seizure at 38
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECT that one other woman has run 200 nearly as fast; moves
up athletic awards, adds quotes and background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MISSION VIEJO, California (AP) _ Florence Griffith Joyner, the
triple gold medalist at the 1988 Olympics who captivated the world
with her meteoric speed and flamboyant style, died Monday of an
apparent heart seizure. She was 38.
	   Griffith Joyner was the wife of 1984 Olympic triple-jump gold
medalist Al Joyner and the sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
the six-time Olympic medalist and world heptathlon record-holder.
	   Greg Foster, the three-time world champion in the 110-meter
hurdles, said he had been told of the death by Joyner-Kersee, who
had heard of it from her brother Al.
	   ``We lost one of the great track and field athletes in
history,'' Foster said. ``She's going to be missed. It's definitely
a shock, a great loss.''
	   Griffith Joyner had suffered a heart seizure two years ago on a
flight to St. Louis.
	   Griffith Joyner still holds world records in the 100- and
200-meter dashes. She set the 100 mark of 10.49 seconds at the
quarterfinals of the 1988 Olympic trials at Indianapolis, and since
then, no woman has even broken 10.60. At the Seoul Games, she won
the gold medal in a wind-aided 10.54.
	   She then smashed the world 200 record in the Olympic final,
clocking 21.34. Marion Jones, with a 21.62 at the World Cup in
South Africa earlier this month, is the only other woman to run the
200 in under 21.70.
	   She also won a gold medal in the 400 relay and just missed a
fourth gold medal when the U.S. team finished second in the 1,600
relay, which Griffith Joyner anchored.
	   ``I gave it my all,'' she said in 1988. ``This is more than I
ever dreamed of. I'm just so happy. I'm just so happy.''
	   Griffith Joyner was voted The Associated Press Female Athlete of
the Year for 1988 and also won the Sullivan Award as the nation's
top amateur athlete.
	   Not only did ``FloJo'' dazzle fans with her stunning speed, she
caught their attention with her colorful bodysuits and her 6-inch
decorated fingernails.
	   She displayed a muscular physique, which prompted talk of
steroid use. Griffith Joyner insisted she never used performance
enhancers and she never failed a drug test.
	   At the 1988 trials, she set standards in track fashion.
	   One eye-catching outfit was a purple bodysuit with a turquoise
bikini brief over it, but with nothing on her left leg, a design
she referred to as a ``one-legger.''
	   At the Olympics, she painted three of her fingernails red, white
and blue, and she painted a fourth gold to signify her goal.
	   At the 1987 World Championships in Rome, she caused a sensation
by running the first two rounds in a skintight suit similar to a
speedskater's togs.
	   But her health was a concern.
	   In 1996, she suffered a seizure on an airplane flight from
California to St. Louis. She was hospitalized for one day, and the
family requested that no other details be released.
	   At the time, Griffith Joyner, accompanied by her husband and
daughter, Mary, was en route to the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Relays for
high school athletes.
	   ``The Olympic family is saddened and stunned by her passing,''
U.S. Olympic Committee president Bill Hybl said Monday. ``She was a
role model for girls and young women in sports and her legacy will
be one that included kindness and an interest in children. She will
be missed.''
	   After retiring from track in the wake of the Seoul Games, she
served for a time as co-chairman of the President's Council on
Physical Fitness. She began designing and modeling clothes and
working with children, both through sports programs and a series of
books.
	   She attempted a comeback before the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta,
but problems with the Achilles tendon in her right leg forced her
to abandon the attempt.
	   ``It's been hard for me. All the training I've done. I've never
had problems with my Achilles,'' she said at the time. ``My husband
tells me I'm getting older, I tell him to shut up.''
	   Griffith Joyner was born Dec. 21, 1959, in south Los Angeles,
one of 11 children whose father was an electrical technician and
mother was a teacher.
	   She graduated from Jordan High School in Los Angeles in 1978,
attended Cal State Los Angeles for two years, then graduated from
UCLA in 1983 with a degree in psychology.
	   She married Al Joyner on Oct. 10, 1987.
	   For many years, she was coached by Bob Kersee, husband of Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, but her husband acted as her coach after the 1988
trials.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street was rebounding from steep losses
Monday, returning to positive territory for the year and
interrupting a global selloff.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 100 points last
week, was down as much as 184.61 points in the morning. But it had
recovered all of the lost ground by midafternoon, when it was up
36.81 at 7,932.47.
	   Broader indicators were falling, but were well above their lows
for the day. With some traders absent because of the observance of
the Jewish New Year, trading that was running well below Friday's
heavy volume.
	   Stocks had plunged around the globe earlier in the day as
traders followed the latest disclosures on President Bill Clinton's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and worried about global economic
turmoil.
	   But with no immediate fresh surprises from the newly released
Clinton testimony, buying picked up.
	   Monday's small gain left the Dow above where it started the
year, at 7,908.25. As it began the session, the average of 30
blue-chip stocks still was 15.4 percent below the record 9,337.97
set July 17.

German foreign minister criticizes airing of Clinton testimony
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
criticized the broadcast of the U.S. president's grand jury
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky affair Monday, calling it an
``irresponsible excess.''
	   The world needs an America capable of acting, Kinkel told
reporters gathered for the General Assembly's annual debate.
``Therefore, this self-destructive process must come to an end.''
	   ``The publication of confidential testimony is an irresponsible
excess,'' Kinkel said. He was at the United Nations to meet with
China's foreign minister, and later the foreign minister of Russia
before he addresses the General Assembly on Tuesday.
	   When the first documents were released in the Lewinsky affair
last week, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl stressed that regardless
of their content, U.S. President Bill Clinton must be able to lead.

<TEXT>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) _ A suspect arrested last week in Germany
as an alleged terrorist involved in the bombings in Kenya and
Tanzania last month, underwent questioning in Munich on Monday, a
Bavarian state official said.
	   Christoph Hillenbrand, spokesman for the state interior
ministry, said that the suspect, identified as Mamdouh Mahmoud
Salim, told investigators he was in Germany on ``some minor private
business.''
	   The United States was seeking extradition of the suspect in
connection with the bombings, and a state justice ministry source
said the extradition proceedings were to begin Tuesday.
	   According to investigators, Salim had a visa issued by a German
embassy and the required invitation from a resident. He said that
person also was being checked out.
	   Salim was arrested Wednesday at a car dealership near Munich on
a tip from Interpol in Washington, officials said.
	   Hillenbrand said he could not confirm a report by the
Munich-based Focus magazine that said Salim was in Germany to work
out a financial network for internationally sought terrorist Osama
bin Laden.
	   Bin Laden is a millionaire Saudi dissident wanted by the United
States for alleged involvement in the bombings that killed 259
people, 12 of them Americans, and injured more than 5,000.
	   Bavarian Interior Minister Guenther Beckstein told German
television Sunday the man had arrived in Munich from Sudan.

Albanian prime minister calls for cabinet changes, once situation

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with former news agency director arrested in new final
grafs. No pick up &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ The Albanian prime minister said Monday
he would support changes in his Cabinet to help secure stability in
Europe's poorest country but only after the current political
unrest has subsided.
	   After meeting with his Cabinet, Prime Minister Fatos Nano told
state-run Albanian television ministers had discussed a package of
measures that would take Albania to a point of stability that would
prevent ever falling back to ``abnormality.''
	   Violence exploded in Albania last week, after the assassination
of popular opposition leader Azem Hajdari on Sept. 19. Hajdari's
death sparked demonstrations by followers of former President Sali
Berisha, who accused Nano of the killing and demanded he resign.
	   The protests turned violent last Monday, when armed crowds
calling for Nano's resignation stormed government buildings and
took control of the state radio and television.
	   Albania's parliament lifted Berisha's immunity last week, paving
the way for his arrest on charges of trying to overthrow the
government. But international mediators have urged the government
not to arrest Berisha to allow tempers to cool.
	   On Saturday officials from the multinational Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe visited Albania in an attempt to
open dialogue between the two sides. The officials criticized
Berisha for inciting the violence, but also said Nano's government
had been slow in fighting corruption.
	   ``We have not denied the need for changes,'' Nano said Monday.
``But we'll do one thing at a time. Now we're still cracking down
on the attempt of a coup d'etat.'' He said the changes would take
place over three months, but gave no further details.
	   Also Monday, the World Bank offered support for the government,
saying it would continue its ``intensive cooperation with the
authorities to improve public administration, fight corruption and
implement other high priority reforms.''
	   Berisha, who is determined the government should resign, called
together right-wing parties to ``institutionalize the front against
dictatorship.''
	   A group of government prosecutors charged with investigating
last week's violent events, said in a statement that one of the
members' house had been targeted with hand grenades early Monday.
The prosecutors accused Berisha of orchestrating the attack.
	   Late Monday, state-run ATA news agency reported its former
director Ilir Zhilla, was arrested on charges of taking part in an
armed uprising. Zhilla led the agency under Berisha.
	   He is the second journalist to be arrested in two days.

Moderate concedes defeat, vows to struggle for democracy

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The moderate Bosnian Serb
president conceded defeat Monday by a hard-liner in this month's
election. She vowed to continue fighting for democracy in the
Serb-ruled part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``I'm addressing the public not as the president, but as a
member of my coalition,'' incumbent President Biljana Plavsic said
in acknowledging her loss to extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
	   Although the final tally of Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 vote won't be
known until later this week, election officials have indicated that
Poplasen defeated Plavsic, the American favorite.
	   On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo advised Americans
against unnecessary travel to Serb-ruled parts of Bosnia because
``the emotional tone of the political rhetoric'' there is
increasing and ``may serve to heighten tensions in the area.''
	   A victory by Poplasen would deal an unexpected blow to a key
part of the West's strategy in Bosnia: bringing Serbs, Muslims and
Croats back together after a 3{ Bosnian war that ended in 1995 with
a U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   In an interview with the Associated Press, Poplasen denied fears
that he will not cooperate with the West, saying he would stick to
the Dayton agreement ``to the letter, nothing more and nothing
less.''
	   Poplasen said ``doors, even windows'' will be opened to the
West. And there will be no ``isolation'' of the Bosnian Serb
entity.
	   ``There is no reason for me not to continue what the previous
government has started,'' he said.

 &UR; Blair calls for new strategies at IMF, World Bank &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES to reflect speech delivered in New York. EDITS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Recent global economic turmoil highlights a need
to reform the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday.
	   ``The current crisis illustrates the weaknesses of the existing
international financial system,'' Blair said in a speech to about
20 business leaders at the New York Stock Exchange. ``It needs to
be modernized to meet the challenges of a new century.''
	   The prime minister said it was a good time to overhaul the
entire global economic system _ making finance more open to lessen
lending risks.
	   The IMF lent dlrs 25 billion over the last year as the Asian
economic crisis unfolded _ and it now urgently needs more money, he
said.
	   The IMF and its sister agency, the World Bank, were created in
1944 at a conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire, to help
create a new economic order in the aftermath of World War II.
Critics contend the institutions have failed to keep pace with the
dramatic changes in global economics.
	   Blair cited several priorities for a new global financial
system:
	   _Greater openness and transparency by national governments,
which will encourage them to pursue sounder monetary and fiscal
policies.
	   _Improved financial supervision and regulation _ with greater
coordination among regulators in different countries as they
supervise international financial institutions. Blair said the IMF
and the World Bank should also focus on the ways various countries
are preparing their financial institutions for any potential
computer problems occurring in the year 2000.
	   _Nations must have better ways to provide short-term capital to
troubled countries that are trying to shape up _ something that the
IMF is not equipped to do as it negotiates loans in exchange for
policy changes in affected countries.
	   _Massive capital flows across borders must be better assessed by
regulators and lenders alike, so loans can be more appropriately
priced in relation to their riskiness.
	   _More accountability by the big financial institutions
themselves.
	   The global nature of the modern economy means that any new order
cannot be developed only by governments or a few rich
industrialized nations, Blair said. They will need assistance from
developing nations and outside experts as well, he said.
	   Blair called for a new plan to be drawn up within one year ``so
that we can have the reformed institutions in place before the new
millennium.''
	   ``This is not a matter for a few technical changes,'' he said.
``We should not be afraid to think radically and fundamentally. We
need to commit ourselves today to build a new Bretton Woods for the
next millennium.''

Deforestation contributed to southern Mexico's flooding, official
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEJANDRO RUIZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) _ Deforestation and the spread of illegal
housing must take part of the blame for devastation wrought by
flooding along the southern coast of Chiapas state, according to a
government minister.
	   ``The tragedy occurred in the coastal and mountain ...
communities due to deforestation and the problem of irregular
settlements on the edges of rivers,'' Social Development Minister
Esteban Moctezuma Barragan said Sunday.
	   Farmers in the poor state have continued to clear forested land
for fields. Earlier this year, their traditional practice of
clearing fields by burning them was blamed for sparking an
unprecedented rash of forest and brush fires in Chiapas.
	   The loss of trees and other plants diminishes the ground's
ability to hold water and makes hillsides more likely to slide.
	   The government has confirmed 183 deaths in Chiapas from the
recent flooding. Thousands of people remain unaccounted for, the
government news agency Notimex said. With roads and bridges wiped
out, many towns have yet to reestablish communication links to the
outside world.
	   More than a dozen people died in other states when storms hit
Mexico from both the Pacific and the Gulf of Mexico in early
September.
	   On Saturday, flooding in the central state of Guanajuato killed
three people and left two others missing, state authorities
reported.
	   Tens of thousands have been left homeless in Chiapas. The
government has begun building new homes in some of the affected
regions and plans to distribute materials elsewhere for people to
construct homes on their own.
	   More than 23,000 people are living in 83 shelters. The federal
family assistance program said 25,000 people were receiving meals
each day at its 434 community kitchens. It intends to open 50 more
kitchens in isolated regions.

U.S. troops serving in Bosnia Clinton tapes

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ American troops serving in
Bosnia had the chance to watch President Clinton's grand jury
testimony on a big screen TV set up on base Monday _ but most of
them didn't.
	   ``We work too hard here to care about it,'' said Pvt. Elijah
J.Thompson, 20, of Silver Spring, Maryland.
	   Roughly 8,500 U.S. troops have been deployed in Bosnia as part
of NATO-led peace force since early 1996. Last December, Clinton
visited them to boost morale, after announcing he was extending
their deployment.
	   Of about 1,300 trrops posted at Eagle Base, 20 kilometers (12
miles) southwest of Tuzla, only 20 were in the recreation room to
watch their Commander in Chief on TV. Most of them spent the rainy
Monday afternoon on their regular duties. Others played video
games, pool, or read a book.
	   ``That is not for TV,'' said 27-year-old Sgt. Terry L.Welch of
St.John, Kansas, who showed up to watch for the viewing. ``In this
case, they've published too many of the details.''
	   ``Every man would have said the same in his place,'' said Welch.
``Behind the case is politics. Clinton is a very popular
president.''
	   Some of soldiers said the issue created out of Kenneth Starr's
investigation of Clinton and his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky looked unreal from the distance of
Bosnia. Others said that as ambassadors of the U.S., the problems
back home made them feel uncomfortable.
	   Gunner Sgt. Troy Masow, 37, from Washington DC, said it was
important to recognize the President had done something wrong.
	   ``The President has caused a lot of hardship to Americans who
trusted him,'' said Masow. ``He's been doing great job as
President, but I think, he should step down''.
	   But Pvt. First Class Joel Guinand, 22, from Clearwater, Florida
disagreed.
	   ``What he did was basically wrong, he did have affair, he did
disgrace his family, but he can finish his term'' said Guinand, his
eyes glued to the TV.
	   ``This is kind of wasting of time and money.''

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with reaction from Kuwait, Germany, Nigeria &QL; 
 &UR; With Clinton-Lewinsky &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Watching Bill Clinton in the videotaped deposition
on TV in a west London pub on Monday, Tony Charlesworth said he
already knew more than he wanted to know about the U.S. president's
sex life.
	   ``I don't need to be seeing this,'' said Charlesworth, a
31-year-old London businessman. ``They should only show it to
people who need to see it. They're just humiliating him.''
	   From Johannesburg to Jordan and beyond, many who watched
Clinton's televised grilling by special counsel lawyers seemed to
share a similar opinion. Some viewers said they felt sorry for
Clinton. Many agreed the tape never should have been made public.
	   But in Kuwait, former oil minister Ali al-Baghli called it a
historic day.
	   ``The head of the most important country is accounting for
breaking the law, just like any ordinary person. I hope this will
be a lesson to us in the Third World,'' said al-Baghli.
	   Maher bin Naji, a 39-year-old Kuwaiti banker, agreed that airing
the testimony was ``democracy at its peak,'' but said, ``The poor
guy did not do anything. It's his private life and he should not
resign.''
	   In London, Sky TV showed the entire deposition as it was
broadcast in the United States. Charlesworth, watching with
colleagues in the Sir Christopher Hatton pub, said he thought
Clinton did as well as he could with the probing, embarrassing
questions.
	   ``He seems like an ordinary man trying to keep his wife and kid
from hearing the facts,'' Charlesworth said.
	   In Germany, from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the man and woman in
the street, most people were outraged by what they saw as the
United States dragging its own leader through the mud.
	   ``I find the whole business extremely upsetting,'' Kohl told
reporters Monday. ``I can only repeat, in my blunt way of saying
it, that it makes me throw up.''
	   Germany's rail company ordered train stations to switch their
TVs away from the broadcast, so children waiting for trains
wouldn't hear the sordid details.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in New York at the United
Nations, called the broadcast an ``irresponsible excess.''
	   In Italy, Clinton's testimony was broadcast on two channels _
one private, one public _ with Italian voiceover.
	   ``Everything they're doing is ridiculous,'' said Andrea Amedeo,
19, a student in Rome. ``He's the leader of America and the world.
... Leave him in peace to worry about the real problems.''
	   In Hong Kong, where passers-by watched on a screen at a shopping
mall, Lisa Wong said she ``supposed most people would lie to keep
such an affair secret.''
	   In Lebanon, the private Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. appeared to
be the only station in the Middle East carrying the simultaneous
broadcast. In other countries, like Jordan, viewers could watch on
Cable News Network.
	   Many people were glued to television sets in Jordanian coffee
houses and at home.
	   ``I disapprove of broadcasting the tape because I think it is
purely an attack on the democrats and it will not serve any good
for the United States of America,'' said book publisher Usama
Sha'shaa, who was interviewed in the Jordanian capital, Amman.
	   In Lagos, Nigeria, civil engineer Ike Awokiora tuned into the
CNN broadcast.
	   ``It's pathetic,'' he said. ``The tape is disgusting and it is a
shame that the Congressmen opted to inflict such pain on people all
over the world by showing us this rubbish.''
	   Giorgos Dedemadis, a 42-year-old mathematics teacher, contrasted
the grilling of Clinton about Lewinsky to the affair between the
late Premier Andreas Papandreou and a much younger woman, whom he
married in 1989.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Furious at penpushing officials who know
little about soldiers' hard lives, India's tough-talking defense
minister said Monday he would have all of them travel to military
posts in the scorching desert, the icy Himalayas and the world's
rainiest forests.
	   ``They will have to go to the desert of Rajasthan in the summers
when the temperatures are 50 degrees centigrade, and see how
soldiers operate eyeball-to-eyeball with Pakistani rangers,''
George Fernandes said at a book release function Monday. With 1.2
million soldiers, India's army is the third largest in the world.
	   ``They will have to go the jungles in the east when there are
torrential rains,'' he said to loud applause, referring to some of
the world's rainiest places. ``They will go to Siachen ... in the
winters.''
	   Temperatures on Siachen, more than 20,000 feet high, usually are
far below zero, with wind speeds averaging 60 mph.
	   Fernandes said he wants to shake the sloth in a ministry he
believes had little idea of soldiers' tough working conditions.
	   A socialist leaders whose popularity has soared in India's armed
forces since he took over six months ago, Fernandes said
bureaucrats' insensitivity had brought down the morale of soldiers
whose combat skills are already getting jaded in unending
operations against insurgent groups in different parts of the
country.

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Furious at penpushing officials who know
little about soldiers' hard lives, India's tough-talking defense
minister said Monday he would have all of them travel to military
posts in the scorching desert, the icy Himalayas and the world's
rainiest forests.
	   ``They will have to go to the desert of Rajasthan in the summers
when the temperatures are 50 degrees centigrade (122 Fahrenheit),
and see how soldiers operate eyeball-to-eyeball with Pakistani
rangers,'' George Fernandes said at a book release function Monday.
With 1.2 million soldiers, India's army is the third largest in the
world.
	   ``They will have to go the jungles in the east when there are
torrential rains,'' he said to loud applause, referring to some of
the world's rainiest places. ``They will go to Siachen ... in the
winters.''
	   Temperatures on Siachen, more than 20,000 feet (6,100 meters)
high, usually are far below zero (32 degrees Fahrenheit), with wind
speeds averaging 60 mph (95 kilometers).
	   Fernandes said he wants to shake the sloth in a ministry he
believes had little idea of soldiers' tough working conditions.
	   A socialist leaders whose popularity has soared in India's armed
forces since he took over six months ago, Fernandes said
bureaucrats' insensitivity had brought down the morale of soldiers
whose combat skills are already getting jaded in unending
operations against insurgent groups in different parts of the
country.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Watching Bill Clinton in the videotaped deposition
on TV in a west London pub on Monday, Tony Charlesworth said he
already knew more than he wanted to know about the U.S. president's
sex life.
	   ``I don't need to be seeing this,'' said Charlesworth, a
31-year-old London businessman. ``They should only show it to
people who need to see it. They're just humiliating him.''
	   From Johannesburg to Jordan and beyond, many who watched
Clinton's televised grilling by special counsel lawyers seemed to
share a similar opinion. Some viewers said they felt sorry for
Clinton. Many agreed the tape never should have been made public.
	   But in Kuwait, former oil minister Ali al-Baghli called it a
historic day.
	   ``The head of the most important country is accounting for
breaking the law, just like any ordinary person. I hope this will
be a lesson to us in the Third World,'' said al-Baghli.
	   Maher bin Naji, a 39-year-old Kuwaiti banker, agreed that airing
the testimony was ``democracy at its peak,'' but said, ``The poor
guy did not do anything. It's his private life and he should not
resign.''
	   In London, Sky TV showed the entire deposition as it was
broadcast in the United States. Charlesworth, watching with
colleagues in the Sir Christopher Hatton pub, said he thought
Clinton did as well as he could with the probing, embarrassing
questions.
	   ``He seems like an ordinary man trying to keep his wife and kid
from hearing the facts,'' Charlesworth said.
	   In Germany, from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the man and woman in
the street, most people were outraged by what they saw as the
United States dragging its own leader through the mud.
	   ``I find the whole business extremely upsetting,'' Kohl told
reporters Monday. ``I can only repeat, in my blunt way of saying
it, that it makes me throw up.''
	   Germany's rail company ordered train stations to switch their
TVs away from the broadcast, so children waiting for trains
wouldn't hear the sordid details.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in New York at the United
Nations, called the broadcast an ``irresponsible excess.''
	   In Italy, Clinton's testimony was broadcast on two channels _
one private, one public _ with Italian voiceover.
	   ``Everything they're doing is ridiculous,'' said Andrea Amedeo,
19, a student in Rome. ``He's the leader of America and the world.
... Leave him in peace to worry about the real problems.''
	   In Hong Kong, where passers-by watched on a screen at a shopping
mall, Lisa Wong said she ``supposed most people would lie to keep
such an affair secret.''
	   In Lebanon, the private Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. appeared to
be the only station in the Middle East carrying the simultaneous
broadcast. In other countries, like Jordan, viewers could watch on
Cable News Network.
	   Many people were glued to television sets in Jordanian coffee
houses and at home.
	   ``I disapprove of broadcasting the tape because I think it is
purely an attack on the democrats and it will not serve any good
for the United States of America,'' said book publisher Usama
Sha'shaa, who was interviewed in the Jordanian capital, Amman.
	   In Lagos, Nigeria, civil engineer Ike Awokiora tuned into the
CNN broadcast.
	   ``It's pathetic,'' he said. ``The tape is disgusting and it is a
shame that the Congressmen opted to inflict such pain on people all
over the world by showing us this rubbish.''
	   Giorgos Dedemadis, a 42-year-old mathematics teacher, contrasted
the grilling of Clinton about Monica Lewinsky to the affair between
the late Premier Andreas Papandreou and a much younger woman, whom
he married in 1989.

Anti-abortion demonstrations mark eve of parliamentary debate
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Thousands of anti-abortion demonstrators
converged on the Spanish Congress on Monday, the eve of a
parliamentary debate on proposed legislation to relax abortion
restrictions.
	   A noisy mixed crowd of men and women, old and young chanted
``life yes, abortion no'' in front of the parliament building in
central Madrid. A police cordon kept the protesters from climbing
the steps.
	   On Tuesday legislators are due to debate three proposals aimed
at relaxing the 1985 legislation that decriminalized abortion.
	   The existing law allows abortion through the first 12 weeks of
pregnancies judged to be dangerous to the mother's life or mental
health, as well as in cases of rape, incest or fetal malformation.
	   The main opposition Socialist Party's proposal would also allow
the termination of any pregnancy in this period considered to be
creating a personal, social or family conflict for the woman.
	   This proposal has already been blocked twice since the
conservative Popular Party was voted into office in 1996 with a
simple parliamentary majority.
	   Last February it was stymied after three consecutive votes ended
with equal numbers of deputies in favor and against, and 20 months
before that it was rejected outright on the first vote.
	   Two other proposals to decriminalize abortion for up to 14 and
16 weeks after conception, tabled by smaller parties, were also due
to be debated Tuesday.
	   Although yes votes for any of the three projects would be seen
as victories for pro-choice activists, any approved proposal could
still suffer substantial modification before becoming law as it
passed through subsequent parliamentary stages.

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ American troops serving in
Bosnia had the chance to watch President Clinton's grand jury
testimony on a big screen TV set up on base Monday _ but most of
them didn't.
	   ``We work too hard here to care about it,'' said Pvt. Elijah J.
Thompson, 20, of Silver Spring, Maryland.
	   Roughly 8,500 U.S. troops have been deployed in Bosnia as part
of NATO-led peace force since early 1996. Last December, Clinton
visited them to boost morale, after announcing he was extending
their deployment.
	   Of about 1,300 troops posted at Eagle Base, 20 kilometers (12
miles) southwest of Tuzla, only 20 were in the recreation room to
watch their commander in chief on TV. Most of them spent the rainy
Monday afternoon on their regular duties. Others played video
games, pool, or read a book.
	   ``That is not for TV,'' said 27-year-old Sgt. Terry L. Welch of
St.John, Kansas, who showed up to watch for the viewing. ``In this
case, they've published too many of the details.''
	   ``Every man would have said the same in his place,'' said Welch.
``Behind the case is politics. Clinton is a very popular
president.''
	   Some of soldiers said the issue created out of Kenneth Starr's
investigation of Clinton and his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky looked unreal from the distance of
Bosnia. Others said that as ambassadors of the United States, the
problems back home made them feel uncomfortable.
	   Gunner Sgt. Troy Masow, 37, from Washington DC, said it was
important to recognize the president had done something wrong.
	   ``The President has caused a lot of hardship to Americans who
trusted him,'' said Masow. ``He's been doing great job as
president, but I think, he should step down''.
	   But Pvt. First Class Joel Guinand, 22, from Clearwater, Florida
disagreed.
	   ``What he did was basically wrong, he did have affair, he did
disgrace his family, but he can finish his term'' said Guinand, his
eyes glued to the TV.
	   ``This is kind of wasting of time and money.''

Asian parents of drowned children charge white teenagers spared by
</HEADLINE>
court &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LADYSMITH, South Africa (AP) _ The Asian parents of children who
drowned in a flood charged racism on Monday after a court
provisionally dropped charges against six white teenagers thought
to have caused their death.
	   The teenagers allegedly opened dam gates in July on the Klip
River as a prank, releasing a wall of water that killed four Indian
children _ three siblings and a cousin _ playing on rocks in the
river downstream.
	   ``The justice system has been slow and lax because the victims
were Indian and the perpetrators white,'' said Yusuf Pillay, a
Muslim imam and father of three of the children. ``I am echoing the
community's feeling which is asking if roles had been reversed,
would the system have been so lackadaisical?''
	   The six teenagers faced four counts of murder, malicious damage
to property and housebreaking after they allegedly broke into the
dam control area and forced open the sluice gates with
bolt-cutters, the South African Press Association reported.
	   The court withdrew the charges when the investigating officer
failed to attend the hearings with forensic evidence.
	   The case will be referred to Pietermaritzburg Attorney-General
once all evidence has been entered into the police docket, SAPA
reported.

Moderate concedes defeat, vows to struggle for democracy

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The moderate Bosnian Serb
president conceded defeat Monday to a hard-liner in this month's
election. She vowed to continue fighting for democracy in the
Serb-ruled part of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
	   ``I'm addressing the public not as the president, but as a
member of my coalition,'' incumbent President Biljana Plavsic said
in acknowledging her loss to extreme nationalist Nikola Poplasen.
	   Although the final tally of Bosnia's Sept. 12-13 vote won't be
known until later this week, election officials have indicated that
Poplasen defeated Plavsic, the United States' favorite.
	   On Monday, the U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo advised Americans
against unnecessary travel to Serb-ruled parts of Bosnia because
``the emotional tone of the political rhetoric'' there is
increasing and ``may serve to heighten tensions in the area.''
	   A victory by Poplasen would deal an unexpected blow to a key
part of the West's strategy in Bosnia: bringing Serbs, Muslims and
Croats back together after a 3 1-2 Bosnian war that ended in 1995
with a U.S.-sponsored Dayton peace agreement.
	   In an interview with the Associated Press, Poplasen denied fears
that he will not cooperate with the West, saying he would stick to
the Dayton agreement ``to the letter, nothing more and nothing
less.''
	   Poplasen said ``doors, even windows'' will be opened to the
West. And there will be no ``isolation'' of the Bosnian Serb
entity.
	   ``There is no reason for me not to continue what the previous
government has started,'' he said.
	   Since Plavsic, a former nationalist, turned moderate about a
year ago, the United States and other Western powers have invested
millions of dollars into the Serb-controlled half of Bosnia, hoping
to make Serbs forget their wartime goal of dividing Bosnia and
joining Serbia.
	   In Sarajevo Monday, the Organization for Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, or OSCE pulled nine Bosnian
Serbs from the candidate lists as punishment for violating election
rules, but stopped short of removing Poplasen.
	   In her first appearance since the elections, Plavsic said that
``Regardless of election results, my coalition `Harmony' will stick
to its policies ... based on respect of the Dayton peace agreement
and a legal state.''
	   A grim-faced Plavsic said she has no intention of leaving the
political scene and that her coalition's concept is a ``long-term
project, the only one that can bring progress to my countrymen.''
	   ``We were the ones who opened the door for Republika Srpska to
the rest of the world,'' Plavsic said. ``It would be absurd for
whoever wins these elections to attempt to close that door.''
	   Reformist Bosnian Serb Premier Milorad Dodik _ who will likely
be replaced by a hard-liner once Poplasen takes power _ predicted
``difficult political struggle in the times ahead.''
	   A last-minute candidacy by a Muslim for the presidency of the
Bosnian Serb sub-state appeared to have drawn away tens of
thousands of refugee and Muslim votes from Plavsic _ thereby
helping Poplasen.
	   ``I wouldn't blame them, it's normal for people who remain
homeless and poor to be bitter and dissatisfied,'' Plavsic said.
	   ``How could they have even voted for those who made them
refugees in the first place?'' Dodik asked.
	   ``Serbs seem to me obsessed with their own demise,'' he
concluded.

IMF warns about continued global economic troubles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HARRY DUNPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Global capital markets could face more
turbulence if Japan does not quickly solve its pressing economic
problems and financial difficulties in Asia and Latin America get
worse, the International Monetary Fund said Monday.
	   The IMF also said in its annual report on capital markets that
while the United States and Europe have not been affected by these
crises, there were risks of an economic downturn, particularly if
stock prices declined sharply.
	   The report focuses mainly on the effects of the Asian crisis,
which began last July. It does not deal with the economic meltdown
in Russia last month and the financial shocks Brazil and other
Latin American countries have experienced in recent weeks.
	   The report said net private capital flows to emerging market
countries around the world fell dramatically in 1997, the first
significant downturn in a decade.
	   Charles Adams, one of the report's authors, said, ``what we have
been seeing is a quite sizable and sharp drying up of financing''
for many of these economies.
	   He said there had been a spillover effect as countries in other
parts of the world, particularly Russia and Latin America,
experienced the same capital outflows as Asian nations.
	   The report said a key risk for the future is that Japan ``will
not move promptly and resolutely to address its financial sector
problems while ensuring adequate domestic demand ... Speed is
becoming increasingly critical.''
	   Japan's banks have an estimated dlrs 1 trillion in bad debts on
their books. Last week Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's government
announced a plan to stabilize the banking system.
	   Adams said a key message of the report is that Japan must act
not just to help itself but to spur recovery in other parts of
Asia.
	   The report emphasizes the importance of strong banking systems
as capital moves around the world faster than ever before.
	   It says efforts should be made to understand the ``waves of
excessive exuberance and pessimism'' that international investors
display, including their ``herding behavior.''
	   The report says investor behavior might improve if governments
of emerging market countries provided better financial information.
But the report says, ``it remains to be seen in practice to what
degree large swings in capital flows will be significantly reduced
by making this information available.''

Russia's Central Bank prints money, offers credits to help banks

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin met with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Monday to finalize Cabinet selections and
formulate a strategy to reactivate the country's moribund economy.
	   Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion rubles (dlrs
61 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid to prevent the
collapse of the country's commercial banks.
	   The financial crisis has caused a backlog of bank payments
totaling over 30 billion rubles (dlrs 1.9 billion), Andrei Kozlov,
first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, tod a news conference.
	   The bank launched an emergency rescue plan on Friday to help
settle 10 billion rubles (dlrs 613 million) of the payments, or
one-third of the total owed between banks and their clients, Kozlov
said.
	   As part of the effort, the Central Bank printed 900 million
rubles (dlrs 55 million) and issued short-term credits to banks,
Kozlov said. He stressed that the amount was too small to affect
the ruble's rate and inflation.
	   But many analysts feared the move may set a dangerous precedent,
and if such a policy is continued, it could fuel inflation and lead
to further declines in the the ruble, officially valued at 16 to
the U.S. dollar, down from six when the crisis began a month ago.
	   Critics have accused the government of responding slowly to the
economic crisis, which hit last month. The rescue plan for the
banks represents the biggest emergency effort so far.
	   Primakov has been in office 10 days, but has yet to outline an
overall economic strategy or put his cabinet in place. Key jobs,
such as the finance minister's post, have not been filled.
	   ``We are going to finalize the personnel issue with (Primakov)
today,'' Yeltsin said at the start of his meeting with the premier,
but no new Cabinet appointees had been announced by Monday night.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin, after meeting with
Yeltsin, said the government's plan would be unveiled on Wednesday.
He did not reveal any details of the program.
	   He also said that decisions on how much money the government
should print should be made jointly by the Finance Ministry and the
Central Bank.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ Russia's Finance Ministry will meet Thursday with
representatives of major Western banks who believe the government
has given preferential treatment to Russian bond-holding banks.
Acting Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told a news conference
they will seek a mutually acceptable plan for restructuring the
government's ruble-denominated debt and all investors will be
treated as equals. ``The treatment should be absolutely equal,'' he
said.
	   _ The ruble closed unchanged at 16.3 to the U.S. dollar after
the Central Bank canceled electronic currency trading on the
interbank exchange. The bank said it needed more time to determine
which banks should be allowed to participate on the currency
markets.
	   _ Russian stocks lost ground in sparse activity. The Russian
Trading System Index fell 4.6 percent to close at 47.81, down from
50.12 points Friday. It was the first time the index closed below
50 points.
	   _ Primakov named Gennady Kulik, 63, a Soviet-era agricultural
official and a member of parliament's Agrarian Faction, as deputy
prime minister for agriculture. Kulik, a defender of collective
farms and a staunch opponent of private land ownership, has been
among those who have blocked Yeltsin's plans to carry out land
reform.
	   _ Primakov also named Shokhin, considered a moderate reformer,
to head Russia's delegation to the International Monetary Fund. An
IMF mission is in Moscow for talks to follow up on Russia's loan
program. The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package in
July, but it did not ward off the crisis.
	   _ The State Statistics Committee announced that unemployment
increased slightly last month to 8.35 million people, or 11.5
percent of the workforce. The rate is expected to rise even higher
due to the worsening crisis.

Hurricane Georges pounds Caribbean

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges cut a swath
through the northeast Caribbean on Monday, packing 110 mph (180
kph) winds and churning up 20-foot (6-meter) seas. Thousands took
shelter in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as the storm
approached.
	   The hurricane toppled power lines, mangled trees and blew away
roofs as families huddled in shelters in St. Kitts, Antigua and
other islands earlier Monday.
	   No serious injuries were reported by midday, but officials said
they feared Georges would hit densely populated areas.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' warned Gov.
Pedro Rossello. ``Our people have very difficult days to come.''
	   At 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT), Georges' center was estimated near
latitude 17.9 north and longitude 64.7 west, passing near St.
Croix, one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where all power was knocked
out.
	   Moving west-northwest at 16 mph(26 kph), the storm extended up
to 85 miles (138 kilometers) from the eye, mostly to the northeast.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned that Georges' winds _
while diminished from the 150 mph (240 kilometers) recorded Sunday
_ remained ``extremely dangerous.''
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico. Both territories declared states of emergency and
called up National Guard troops.
	   The first strong winds were felt around noon on the Puerto Rican
island of Vieques, and the storm was expected to reach the San Juan
area, where almost half of Puerto Rico's 3.8 million people live,
within several hours.
	   Rossello banned liquor sales and ordered officials to open more
than 330 shelters. Banks and schools closed, airlines canceled
flights to and from the U.S. mainland, and ferry service was
suspended. Police ordered people off the beaches.
	   More than 9,700 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities.
	   With up to 15 inches of rain expected in Puerto Rico's
mountains, the threat of mudslides and flash floods drove many
mountain residents to the San Juan shelters.
	   ``The roof of my house is made of wood and cardboard, and I'd
rather be here before it goes flying,'' Miguel Mercado Romero, 66,
said in a shelter near the Old San Juan historic district.
	   Georges' path would also take it to island of Hispaniola, which
is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Many of that
island's 15 million people live in substandard housing that could
leave them exposed to Georges' fury.
	   Hurricane watches also went into effect for the southeastern
Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands.
	   Some cruise ships headed south to get out of Georges' way, and
others changed their schedules to make Caribbean stops before
heading to storm-free Mexico. Those affected included four Royal
Caribbean ships and three Carnival ships.
	   In Cuba, the Interior Ministry issued a hurricane warning to
residents of the island's easternmost provinces. The area has been
hit hard by a drought in recent months and additionally hurricane
damage could devastate any remaining crops.
	   Georges hit land Sunday night, downing trees and utility lines,
ripping wooden and galvanized roofs from homes and pelting sheets
of rain into residences on the northern Leeward islands.
	   In Antigua, where 5,700 people spent the night in shelters, the
storm split open government-built homes in northern Cedar Grove
Garden, ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses and
wrapped them around trees.
	   Antiguan shop owners erected sandbag barricades to stop
flooding. Civil defense workers distributed flashlights, mosquito
coils, water and toilet paper to nervous shelter residents.
	   All of the island's television and radio stations were off the
air, and rain washed out the road near Urlins, on the southern
coast, stranding a bus. It was pulled from the water by backhoe,
and no injuries were reported.
	   In the French island of Guadeloupe, swirling winds knocked out
power in several towns. One man trying to escape from jail with two
other men around midnight, was shot and killed by guards.
	   France was sending a team of 170 civil defense workers to help
recovery efforts.
	   Winds gusted above 90 mph in St. Martin, where Hurricane Luis
caused hundreds of millions of dollars' damage in 1995.

South Africa opposes Israeli plans to expand Yitzhar settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa on Monday said
Israeli plans to expand a Jewish settlement at Yitzhar on the West
Bank was provocative and dangerous.
	   A statement issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs said the
decision violates the spirit of the Oslo Accords and ``pre-empts
future negotiations on the final status of the occupied
territories.''
	   ``The timing of this announcement is particularly dangerous and
will be construed as provocative,'' the government said.
	   Israel plans to build 600 new homes in Yitzhar, where two
residents were killed last month in a drive-by shooting by
Palestinian militants, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
said last week.
	   He said the plans were Israel's response ``to terrorist
perpetrators.''
	   The United States has urged Israel to halt settlement expansion
on land which the Palestinians want for a hoped-for state.

Clinton calls terrorism `threat to all humankind'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with meeting with Pakistani premier, other
material, recasts; changes byline &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Keeping his public focus on international
events, President Bill Clinton renewed a global call to arms
against terrorism Monday and attacked the idea that it is mainly an
American problem of American making.
	   ``This is a threat to all humankind,'' Clinton said in a
21-minute speech to the opening of the 53rd session of the United
Nations General Assembly. The hundreds of delegates gave Clinton a
rare standing ovation as he was introduced in the cavernous hall at
U.N. headquarters.
	   White House aides were quick to tell reporters that Clinton was
moved by the warm greeting, which offered a measure of support for
a beleaguered president whose videotaped grand jury testimony in
the Monica Lewinsky matter was playing on TV even as he spoke.
	   Clinton also held a one-on-one meeting at the U.S. mission to
the United Nations with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Pakistan and neighboring India are locked in a nuclear arms
competition that Clinton has sought for months to bring to a halt.
	   Clinton is due shortly to decide whether to scrap his plan for
stop in India and Pakistan this fall during an Asia trip that was
scheduled before the two countries shocked the world by detonating
nuclear test devices in May in defiance of American warnings.
	   The president was participating in a symposium Monday at New
York University School of Law on the emergence of a global economy
and the challenges it presents to liberty and democracy. First lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton also was speaking at the forum, which drew
numerous foreign leaders, including British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and Italian Premier Romano Prodi.
	   Rather than focus on specific actions to combat terrorism,
Clinton sought in his U.N. speech to define the global scope of the
problem and dispel the idea that it is caused by an inevitable
clash of cultures and a Western disregard for poorer nations.
	   ``It is a grave misconception to see terrorism as only, or even
mostly, an American problem,'' Clinton said. ``Indeed, it is a
clear and present danger to tolerant and open societies and
innocent people everywhere.''
	   He listed terrorist incidents around the world over the past
decade, including killings in Northern Ireland, Saudi Arabia,
Turkey, Sri Lanka and Argentina, as well as the bombings last month
at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 12
Americans.
	   ``Some people believe that terrorism's principal fault lines
center on what they see as an inevitable clash of civilizations,''
he said. ``It is an issue that deserves a lot of debate in this
great hall. Specifically, many believe there is an inevitable clash
between Western civilizations and Western values and Islamic
civilizations and values. I believe this view is terribly wrong.''
	   Clinton sought to picture the United States as a friend, rather
than a foe, of Islam. He said Islam is one of the fastest growing
faiths in the United States, where there already are 1,200 mosques.
	   ``There is no inherent clash between Islam and America,'' he
said.
	   Clinton also attended a U.N. luncheon at which he offered a
toast to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan. He praised the U.N.
chief for his ``infinite patience'' and cooperative spirit.
	   ``He has truly been the right leader for this time,'' Clinton
said. He made no reference to tensions over Washington's failure to
keep up with its U.N. dues or to calls in Congress for more
far-reaching changes in the way the international organization
works.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ His t-shirt stained with blood and his
wounded 22-year-old son shaking beside him in the lobby of the
embattled U.S. Embassy, former Liberian warlord Roosevelt Johnson
knew Monday that it was time to be afraid.
	   ``I don't know how we're going to get out of here,'' said
Johnson, the chief rival of President Charles Taylor, nervously
glancing around the room that has suddenly become his refuge.
	   A few feet behind Johnson, shielded by thick panes of
bullet-proof glass, American soldiers in full battle gear, assault
weapons at the ready, patrolled the embassy's hallways, stepping
past supplies piled in the corridors.
	   The American embassy, which repeatedly found itself the only
safe haven in Liberia's capital during this West African country's
brutal 7-year civil war, has suddenly found itself again in the
middle.
	   Johnson fled to the embassy over the weekend to escape arrest in
a city tense after battles between his supporters and the
government.
	   The gunplay that began Friday night and continued through much
of Saturday left at least 47 people dead and shocked this war weary
capital. While the situation was largely calm on Monday, hundreds
of Liberian soldiers and West African peacekeepers were patrolling
the city.
	   At the embassy, though, the main question is what will happen to
Johnson?
	   Diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said State
Department officials in Washington were bearing the brunt of
negotiations with Taylor's government, but that the United States
was not planning to hand him over to the Liberians.
	   Inside the embassy, there is little comfort.
	   ``We've had three relatively sleepless nights here,'' said one
American diplomat, who spoke on condition his name not be used.
	   ``Everyone is endlessly busy dealing with this ongoing
situation,'' he said, his face etched with fatigue, his chest
protected by a green army flack jacket.
	   Johnson, who has spent the past couple days huddled on a few
sheets of cardboard on the floor of the lobby, came under attack
Saturday morning from Taylor's secret police as he tried to seek
shelter at the embassy.
	   Four of Johnson's supporters were killed in the attack, two were
wounded and two Americans were also injured.
	   Taylor has demanded that the Americans hand over Johnson and his
retinue.
	   ``If this man leaves (the country) and returns re-armed, he will
be dangerous to the security of the state and the region,'' said
Taylor's spokesman, Reginald Goodridge.
	   While no further attacks have been made against the embassy, and
the West African peacekeeping force that patrols Liberia has
stepped up security around the sprawling seaside compound, the
Americans are taking no chances.
	   At least half of the embassy's staff has been evacuated and
extra American soldiers have been choppered in. Nearly everyone on
the embassy's grounds wear bullet proof vests and helmets, and many
are heavily armed.
	   Johnson's group turned up Saturday morning at the embassy after
firefights erupted in the city Friday night, when the government
tried to arrest Johnson.
	   As embassy officials tried to find a way for Johnson and his men
to be escorted away to safety, Liberian secret police soldiers
drove up and fanned out in front of the compound, eventually aiming
their guns point blank at the men and opening fire as they stood
just outside the main gate.
	   Witnesses said at least one American opened fire as he and two
other American security officers struggled to get back inside the
compound, apparently shooting one Liberian soldier.
	   During the melee, Johnson and his men also made it through,
though one died inside the embassy compound, where his body
remains.
	   Three more of Johnson's supporters lay dead or dying outside,
said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   One of Taylor's sons, 22-year-old Puna, was shot in the shoulder
and the arms. Late Monday afternoon, he shook in pain from the
wounds, tears streaming down his face as one of Johnson's men
cradled his injured arm. Another of Johnson's aides was also
injured, but appeared in good condition.
	   After the shooting, one of the injured Americans was evacuated
to Sierra Leone and then to London where he was in good condition,
officials said. The other was grazed in the shoulder.
	   This isn't the first time a move by Taylor to arrest his
longtime foe has erupted into violence _ and embroiled a reluctant
U.S. Embassy.
	   Taylor's attempt to arrest Johnson in 1996 _ when both were
warlords in Liberia's civil war _ triggered wholesale bloodshed in
Monrovia that left thousands dead and the city a burned-out, looted
wreck.
	   Johnson fled to Ghana, after taking shelter in the U.S. embassy
and then flying out of the country in an American helicopter.
	   Johnson eventually returned from exile to become Liberia's rural
development minister after Taylor won last year's presidential
elections.
	   But tensions persisted and forces loyal to both sides have
clashed several times in recent months.
	   Now, Johnson and his men sit on the floor the lobby, munching on
crackers and jam.
	   ``We are thankful to the embassy,'' said Johnson.

Russia's Central Bank prints money, offers credits to help banks

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin met with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov on Monday to finalize Cabinet selections and
formulate a strategy to reactivate the country's moribund economy.
	   Russia's Central Bank has printed almost 1 billion rubles (dlrs
61 million) and issued short-term credits in a bid to prevent the
collapse of the country's commercial banks.
	   The financial crisis has caused a backlog of bank payments
totaling over 30 billion rubles (dlrs 1.9 billion), Andrei Kozlov,
first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, tod a news conference.
	   The bank launched an emergency rescue plan on Friday to help
settle 10 billion rubles (dlrs 613 million) of the payments, or
one-third of the total owed between banks and their clients, Kozlov
said.
	   As part of the effort, the Central Bank printed 900 million
rubles (dlrs 55 million) and issued short-term credits to banks,
Kozlov said. He stressed that the amount was too small to affect
the ruble's rate and inflation.
	   But many analysts feared the move may set a dangerous precedent,
and if such a policy is continued, it could fuel inflation and lead
to further declines in the the ruble, officially valued at 16 to
the U.S. dollar, down from six when the crisis began a month ago.
	   Critics have accused the government of responding slowly to the
economic crisis, which hit last month. The rescue plan for the
banks represents the biggest emergency effort so far.
	   Primakov has been in office 10 days, but has yet to outline an
overall economic strategy or put his cabinet in place. Key jobs,
such as the finance minister's post, have not been filled.
	   ``We are going to finalize the personnel issue with (Primakov)
today,'' Yeltsin said at the start of his meeting with the premier,
but no new Cabinet appointees had been announced by Monday night.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Shokhin, after meeting with
Yeltsin, said the government's plan would be unveiled on Wednesday.
He said it was particularly important for the government to set out
a schedule of when it intends to repay wage and pension arrears,
and aggressively increase tax revenues.
	   He also said that decisions on how much money the government
should print should be made jointly by the Finance Ministry and the
Central Bank.
	   In other economic developments:
	   _ Russia's Finance Ministry will meet Thursday with
representatives of major Western banks who believe the government
has given preferential treatment to Russian bond-holding banks.
Acting Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov told a news conference
they will seek a mutually acceptable plan for restructuring the
government's ruble-denominated debt and all investors will be
treated as equals. ``The treatment should be absolutely equal,'' he
said.
	   _ The ruble closed unchanged at 16.3 to the U.S. dollar after
the Central Bank canceled electronic currency trading on the
interbank exchange. The bank said it needed more time to determine
which banks should be allowed to participate on the currency
markets.
	   _ Russian stocks lost ground in sparse activity. The Russian
Trading System Index fell 4.6 percent to close at 47.81, down from
50.12 points Friday. It was the first time the index closed below
50 points.
	   _ Primakov named Gennady Kulik, 63, a Soviet-era agricultural
official and a member of parliament's Agrarian Faction, as deputy
prime minister for agriculture. Kulik, a defender of collective
farms and a staunch opponent of private land ownership, has been
among those who have blocked Yeltsin's plans to carry out land
reform.
	   _ Primakov also named Shokhin, considered a moderate reformer,
to head Russia's delegation to the International Monetary Fund. An
IMF mission is in Moscow for talks to follow up on Russia's loan
program. The IMF organized a dlrs 22.6 billion rescue package in
July, but it did not ward off the crisis.
	   _ The State Statistics Committee announced that unemployment
increased slightly last month to 8.35 million people, or 11.5
percent of the workforce. The rate is expected to rise even higher
due to the worsening crisis.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges cut a swath
through the northeast Caribbean on Monday, packing 110 mph (180
kph) winds and churning up 20-foot (6-meter) seas. Thousands took
shelter in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as the storm
approached.
	   The hurricane toppled power lines, mangled trees and blew away
roofs as families huddled in shelters in St. Kitts, Antigua and
other islands earlier Monday.
	   No serious injuries were reported by midday, but officials said
they feared Georges would hit densely populated areas.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' warned Gov.
Pedro Rossello. ``Our people have very difficult days to come.''
	   At 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), Georges' center was estimated near
latitude 17.9 north and longitude 65.2 west, passing St. Croix, one
of the U.S. Virgin Islands, where all power was down.
	   Moving west-northwest at 16 mph (28 kph), Georges packed
hurricane-force winds of up to 110 mph (180 kph) extending up to 85
miles (140 kilometers) from the eye, mostly to the northeast.

Milosevic denies humanitarian plight, Kosovo Albanian leader quits
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES and RECASTS with Milosevic meeting Hill; bodies
found; KLA captures ethnic Albanian politicians &QL; 
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic tried Monday to avert possible NATO intervention in
Kosovo, denying reports that tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees face hunger and disease because of his offensives.
	   ``The term 'humanitarian catastrophe' which we have been hearing
during the past weeks is not based on reality,'' Milosevic said in
a statement released by his office following talks in Belgrade with
U.S. envoy for Kosovo Christopher Hill.
	   Milosevic also met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky. In a statement issued from his office afterwards,
Milosevic declared the Kosovo Albanian ``terrorists'' have been
defeated.
	   ``Yugoslavia has been faced with unprecedented threats only
because it defends its sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   Despite international aid organizations' reports that some
275,000 people displaced in Kosovo since Serbs launched a violent
crackdown against Albanian separatists in February are facing
hunger and disease, Serbian officials say refugees are being
sheltered and cared for.
	   In an attempt to prevent a humanitarian disaster, NATO has
readied plans for possible military intervention to end the
crackdown in Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
present Yugoslavia. Kosovo is over 90 percent ethnic Albanian, but
is ruled by Serbia.
	   Also on Monday, officials in Serbia and Montenegro rejected an
ethnic Albanian proposal for Kosovo to gain equal status with those
two republics in the joint Yugoslav federation.
	   Miodrag Vukovic, an adviser to the president of Montenegro, told
Dnevni Telegraf daily territorial autonomy for Kosovo that would
change borders and position of Serbia in Yugoslavia is ``out of the
question.''
	   Montenegro, which is much smaller than Serbia, apparently fears
its position in the federation would be jeopardized if Kosovo
became a separate unit.
	   According to ethnic Albanian proposal, published Sunday in Koha
Ditore daily, Kosovo would be ``temporarily part of Yugoslavia, as
an independent entity equal to the other two republics in the
federation.''
	   A vice president in the Serbian government, Vojislav Seselj,
said ``Kosovo must remain in Serbia.'' He added the region could
only be granted ``territorial autonomy'' within Serbia.
	   Last week, Koha Ditore carried a formula suggested by the United
States which would grant the province a high level of self-rule but
leaving it within Serbia. Pacifist Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
has backed the plan, saying it was a good basis for the talks.
	   In Kosovo Monday, a political leader of the separatist Albanian
Kosovo Liberation Army resigned in an apparent sign of disarray
among the rebels.
	   Adem Demaci's office said he was withdrawing from political life
for health reasons. It said the doctors had warned 68-year-old
Demaci, who heads the KLA's political wing, of increased nervous
tension and worsening diabetes.
	   But analysts in the provincial capital believe that Demaci made
the decision because of differences with the KLA over hard-liners'
refusal to accept anything short of full independence for Kosovo.
	   Demaci's pullout came following the KLA's defeat by Serb forces
in much of the province. It is expected to further marginalize the
rebels and strengthen U.S.-backed Rugova's position.
	   Serb forces and KLA clashed Monday in the central Drenica
region, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported.
	   Residents of Dobratin village in northern Kosovo found two more
bodies Monday, bringing the total number of corpses found to eight,
since Serbs swarmed the area last week.
	   Two elderly men who buried the bodies of a 58-year-old man and
his 37-year-old cousin early Monday said one was riddled with
bullets, while the other had his jaw ripped off and his chest cut
open.
	   Also, the KLA detained 13 ethnic Albanian politicians, most of
whom are close to Rugova, Albanian sources said Monday. They said
the group was captured Sunday afternoon in Drenica, but gave no
reasons for the move.
	   The KLA did not confirm or deny the report.

U.S. Track legend `FloJo' dies of heart seizure at 38
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with additional background; ADDS White House statement
 &UR; By KEN PETERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MISSION VIEJO, California (AP) _ Florence Griffith Joyner, the
triple gold medalist at the 1988 Olympics who captivated the world
with her meteoric speed and flamboyant style, died Monday of an
apparent heart seizure. She was 38.
	   From the White House to fellow track stars, the sprinter known
as ``FloJo'' was mourned and remembered a decade after she turned
the women's sprints at the Seoul Games into her personal showcase.
	   ``We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent, and
captivated by her style,'' President Bill Clinton said. ``Though
she rose to the pinnacle of the world of sports, she never forgot
where she came from, devoting time and resources to helping
children _ especially those growing up in our most devastated
neighborhoods _ make the most of their own talents.''
	   Griffith Joyner was the wife of 1984 Olympic triple-jump gold
medalist Al Joyner and the sister-in-law of Jackie Joyner-Kersee,
the six-time Olympic medalist and world heptathlon record-holder.
	   The Orange County sheriff's office said an emergency call was
received early Monday from Al Joyner, who reported his wife was
``unresponsive and not breathing.''
	   ``She had passed away during the night,'' said spokesman Lt.
Hector Rivera.
	   An autopsy was scheduled.
	   Griffith Joyner had suffered a heart seizure two years ago on a
flight to St. Louis.
	   Primo Nebiolo, the head of the IAAF, track's international
federation, said he knew Griffith Joyner had ``some serious heart
problems in recent months'' but that the news still was ``a great
shock ... which makes me extremely sad.''
	   ``I will never forget this extraordinary athlete who stunned the
world in Seoul 10 years ago with her amazing sprints and
spectacular outfits,'' Nebiolo said in Brussels. ``Sadly, her life
has passed as rapidly as her races.''
	   Griffith Joyner still holds world records in the 100- and
200-meter dashes. She set the 100 mark of 10.49 seconds at the
quarterfinals of the 1988 Olympic trials at Indianapolis, and since
then, no one has even broken 10.60. At Seoul, she won the gold
medal in a wind-aided 10.54.
	   She then smashed the world 200 record in the Olympic final,
clocking 21.34. Marion Jones, with a 21.62 at the World Cup in
South Africa earlier this month, is the only other woman to run the
200 in under 21.70.
	   She also won a gold medal in the 400 relay and just missed a
fourth gold medal when the U.S. team finished second in the 1,600
relay, which Griffith Joyner anchored.
	   Not only did ``FloJo'' dazzle fans with her stunning speed, she
caught their attention with her colorful bodysuits and her
decorated fingernails.
	   ``What Florence brought to track was a flash and a flair that we
didn't have, which was probably good for the sport and got
attention for us,'' said Evelyn Ashford, the 1984 Olympic sprint
champion who competed with Griffith Joyner throughout the 1980s.
	   Griffith Joyner also displayed a muscular physique, which
prompted talk of steroid use. She insisted she never used
performance enhancers and she never failed a drug test.
	   At the 1988 trials, where she ran the three fastest 100-meter
times ever by a woman and set the American record in the 200, she
also set standards in track fashion.
	   One eye-catching outfit was a purple bodysuit with a turquoise
bikini brief over it, but with nothing on her left leg, a design
she referred to as a ``one-legger.''
	   At the Olympics, she painted three of her fingernails red, white
and blue, and she painted a fourth gold to signify her goal.
	   At the 1987 World Championships in Rome, she caused a sensation
by running the first two rounds in a skintight suit similar to a
speedskater's togs.
	   But her health was a concern.
	   In 1996, she suffered a seizure on an airplane flight from
California to St. Louis. She was hospitalized for one day, and the
family requested that no other details be released.
	   At the time, Griffith Joyner, accompanied by her husband and
daughter, Mary, was en route to the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Relays for
high school athletes.
	   ``We lost one of the great track and field athletes in
history,'' said Greg Foster, the three-time world champion in the
110-meter hurdles. ``She's going to be missed. It's definitely a
shock, a great loss.''
	   Griffith Joyner was voted The Associated Press Female Athlete of
the Year for 1988 and also won the Sullivan Award as the nation's
top amateur athlete.
	   After retiring from track in the wake of the Seoul Games, she
served for a time as co-chair of the President's Council on
Physical Fitness.
	   She began designing and modeling clothes and working with
children, both through sports programs and a series of books.
	   She was preparing for a comeback as a 400-meter runner in 1996
when she said an Achilles tendon injury halted her hopes of
reaching the Olympics in Atlanta. She said the injury developed in
March 1996.
	   Griffith Joyner was born Dec. 21, 1959, in south Los Angeles,
one of 11 children whose father was an electrical technician and
mother was a teacher.
	   She married Al Joyner on Oct. 10, 1987. For many years, she was
coached by Bob Kersee, husband of Jackie Joyner-Kersee, but Al
acted as her coach after the 1988 trials.

Liberal Islamic group loses second bid for party status
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The Egyptian government on Monday rejected
for the second time a bid by a liberal Islamic group to become a
political party.
	   Al-Wasat Al-Masri, which translates from Arabic as the Egyptian
Center, was turned down in May on grounds that its political agenda
resembled that of existing parties.
	   The government's Political Party Committee was expected to
release the reasons for its latest rejection on Tuesday.
	   The party's main founder, Abou-Elala Mady, said he would appeal
to Egyptian courts, as he did after the first rejection.
	   ``We are determined, no matter what the obstacles, to continue
our struggle until we get our rights and establish the party,''
Mady told The Associated Press.
	   Al-Wasat caused an uproar when it was organized in 1996. It
promised a modern approach to the Islamic movement and supported
the rights of women and members of Egypt's Coptic Christian
minority to assume leadership positions.
	   The Egyptian government has maintained that the group is a front
for the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, Egypt's largest fundamentalist
group. The government has accused the Brotherhood of supporting
Muslim extremists.
	   Brotherhood members, on the other hand, accused the founders of
Al-Wasat of trying to undermine their group.
	   In its second application for party status, Mady altered the
group's agenda to include a program to ease tensions between
Muslims and Christians and a demand that women be allowed to become

	   The new agenda also supports the independence of religious
institutions. Many such institutions are state-funded, and their
officials appointed by the government.

Dow rebounds, recovering from a 184-point loss, halting global

 &UR; Eds: TOPS throughout with close, Dow returning to positive

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Wall Street rebounded from steep losses Monday
amid relief there were no major surprises in a videotape of the
president's grand jury testimony in the Monica Lewinsky
investigation.
	   The Dow industrials not only charged back from a morning loss of
184.61 points, but returned to positive territory for the year
while interrupting a global selloff.
	   The Dow Jones industrial average, which rose 100 points last
week, added 37.59 to close at 7,933.25.
	   Monday's rise left the Dow slightly above where it started the
year, at 7,908.25. But the average of 30 blue-chip stocks still was
15 percent below the record 9,337.97 set July 17.
	   Broader indicators finished mostly higher, also recovering from
big losses earlier in the day. With some traders absent because of
the observance of the Jewish New Year, trading activity was below
Friday's heavy volume.
	   Stocks had plunged around the globe earlier in the day as
traders followed the latest disclosures on President Bill Clinton's
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and worried about global economic
turmoil.
	   But with no immediate fresh surprises from the newly released
Clinton video and thousands of pages of evidence, buying picked up
and traders looked for bargains.
	   ``The rumors rolling around Wall Street were far worse than
anything in the report,'' said Bill Meehan, chief strategist at
Cantor Fitzgerald.
	   U.S. Treasury bonds, a traditional haven for funds in times of
unrest, rallied this morning at the depths of the selloff. But as
stocks rebounded, money came out of bonds and the gains shrank.
	   Markets have been unsettled by economic crises in Asia and
Russia that are threatening to spread to Latin America and are
damaging corporate profits.
	   Asian markets were upset by disputes over banking reform in
Japan, Malaysian political troubles and Clinton's problems.
	   The selling spree sent Tokyo's main index falling 2.8 percent to
a new 12-year low, while Hong Kong shares dropped 3.7 percent and
Indonesia's market skidded 5.5 percent to a seven-year low.
	   Blue chips on the London Stock Exchange, Europe's biggest
market, closed down 1.3 percent, above the lows for the session.
Shares fell 3.6 percent in Frankfurt, Germany, and 3.5 percent in
Paris. In the Netherlands, trading was temporarily halted after a 5
percent plunge in the major index in Amsterdam, which closed with a
loss of 5.9 percent.

Economic reform needed to resolve world financial crisis, Argentina
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Hold for release until 2100 GMT (5 p.m. EDT) &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The worldwide economic crisis that has
spread to Latin America can be contained if the region's recent
economic reforms are continued, Argentina's foreign minster said
Monday.
	   ``To ease its negative effects, globalization requires policies
on education, social issues and the environment that benefits all
society equally,'' Guido Di Tella told world leaders gathered for
the 53rd session of the General Assembly.
	   Referring to the recent spate of terrorist attacks around the
world, Di Tella said Argentina supported countries that fight
terrorism, particularly considering Argentina's own experience with
the 1992 bombing attack on the Israeli Embassy and the 1994 bombing
of a Jewish cultural center.
	   ``The resurgence of terrorist attacks brutally reminds us that
no state can consider itself safe,'' he said.
	   On another matter, he noted India and Pakistan's recent nuclear
tests and pointed out that Argentina had renounced the possibility
of becoming a nuclear power.
	   The South Asia tests ``mean a step back in terms of global and
regional security and will postpone economic development and
well-being of the population,'' he said.
	   He repeated Argentina's claim to the British controlled Falkland
Islands _ known in Argentina as the Malvinas _ and urged Britain
restart talks over the archipelago, over which the two fought a war
in 1982.
	   ``I repeat Argentina's legitimate and founded rights in this
major dispute,'' he said.

 &UR; Duchess of York lost staunch ally in her mother &QL; 
 &UR; With Malaysia-Royal Visit &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The Duchess of York flew Monday
to the Argentine ranch of her late mother Susan Barrantes, mourning
her death in a weekend car crash.
	   Looking weary in a black dress, the former Sarah Ferguson
arrived by overnight flight from Britain and said nothing to
reporters before traveling to her mother's country estate near Tres
Lomas, 310 miles southwest of Buenos Aires.
	   The duchess, or ``Fergie,'' ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth II's
second son, Prince Andrew, heard the news early Sunday while on
vacation in Italy.
	   Police said Mrs. Barrantes, 61, was killed instantly Saturday
night when the Rover she was driving collided with a van near Tres
Lomas, while returning to the ranch where she raised polo ponies.
	   Mrs. Barrantes's passenger, nephew by marriage Rafael Barrantes,
25, escaped with minor injuries. The driver of the other car, Jose
Maria Rodriguez, suffered a broken ankle, police said.
	   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced Monday. But
aides to the duchess said Mrs. Barrantes would be buried alongside
her second husband at the estate.
	   Tight security kept reporters well back Monday from the horse
and cattle-raising estate surrounded by dusty country roads.
	   The duchess's sister, Jane Luedecke, who lives in Australia, was
flying separately to the Argentine capital.
	   In Britain, reports depicted the Duchess as devastated by the
loss.
	   With the death of her mother, ``Fergie'' has lost her staunchest
ally through years of divorce, debt and disgrace, a family friend
said Monday.
	   Mrs. Barrantes was ``the one person who throughout all (the
duchess's) tribulations remained most concerned,'' wrote the
friend, Ingrid Seward, in the Daily Express tabloid.
	   ``As Susie once told me: 'She is my daughter and that is good
enough reason for me to believe in her,''' recalled Seward, who
edits ``Majesty,'' a magazine about the royals.
	   Mrs. Barrantes, 61 was the widow of Hector Barrantes, an
Argentine polo player, and ex-wife of the duchess's father, Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, the queen's former polo manager.
	   Mrs. Barrantes left Ferguson for Barrantes and settled with him
in Argentina in 1975. Hector Barrantes died of cancer in 1990.
	   Through it all, Mrs. Barrantes and the duchess remained close.
Friends say the duchess relied on her mother for support during her
divorce from Prince Andrew, the second son of Queen Elizabeth II.

She was taken in a fast-moving motorcade, sirens wailing and dusty
flying, to the well-guarded home.
	   But police and security officers at the gate kept reporters well
back Monday from the horse and cattle-raising estate surrounded by
rural dirt roads on the pampas.

Respiratory congress: Western children getting asthma from dust in
</HEADLINE>
`clean' houses &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Asthma has been spreading among children
worldwide, but the hardest-hit are youngsters in wealthy countries,
according to studies presented to a conference of 9,000 respiratory
specialists from Europe and North America.
	   ``Why is there less asthma in Asia and Eastern Europe than in
Western countries?'' said a statement Monday by conference
organizers, the European Respiratory Society. ``It may be because
western infants spend too much time shut up at home.''
	   Preliminary results of a 56-country study showed a clear link
between the ``westernization'' of a country and the incidence or
asthma. For example, Britain, Australia and New Zealand have 5-8
times more cases than Greece, Russia and China.
	   Some 460,000 teen-agers are being observed in the study that was
begun after specialists noted that asthma attacks requiring
emergency treatment have been rising by 5 percent a year in the
United States.
	   ``Asthma is already very widespread and it is becoming
increasingly so, especially among children,'' said Professor Peter
Helms of the University of Aberdeen, Scotland.
	   Two theories have emerged: that children living in closed-up
homes in the West are exposed to more house dust and that elsewhere
children meet more microbes that stand them in good stead later in
life.
	   Helms presented a study of more than 18,000 Scottish children
that indicated up to 14.8 percent were affected by asthma.
	   The survey confirms that Britain leads the world in asthma, with
one child in seven suffering from the affliction in which the
airways inside the lungs become inflamed and contract, making it
difficult to breathe. The specialists said an attack often is
caused by an allergic reaction to pollen, dust or animal hair. But
it can be brought on or made worse by pollution, tobacco smoke,
colds, cold temperatures, exercise, excitement or stress.
	   Dr. Erika von Mutius of the University of Munich said Monday her
team had compared 5,600 children aged 9-11 in Munich, formerly in
West Germany, and Dresden, formerly in East Germany.
	   While hay fever affected children in both cities at about the
same rate, the western children suffered markedly more from asthma,
10.3 percent in Munich compared with 7.9 percent in Dresden, she
said.
	   Von Mutius said the children of Dresden were more likely to
attend nurseries and to have more brothers and sisters. The
increased exposure to the germs of other children stimulates their
immune systems and could prevent the development of asthma, she
said.
	   Another German study, which tracked more than 1,000 babies
during the first three years of life, found that the children who
developed allergies lived in apartments where the dust contained
four times more excrement from dust mites. It is these tiny
droppings that are a key cause of allergies.
	   Dr. Laurent Nicod of Geneva University said there is hope that a
vaccine could be developed against asthma, ``but we have not reach
that point yet.''

 &UR; Rebels capture town in eastern Congo near strategic air base &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of fighting, situation from
commander &QL; 
 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila have captured the eastern town of Kamituga in South
Kivu region, rebel officials said Monday.
	   Rebel commander Jean Pierre Ondekane said his forces faced heavy
fighting when they captured the town, which is about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) southwest of the Lake Kivu town of Bukavu on the way to
Kindu, a strategic air base, on Friday.
	   He said that during the battles, forces captured 10 Sudanese
soldiers who were fighting on the side of Kabila.
	   Speaking in the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma, Ondekane said
rebel soldiers also captured the the northeastern town of Isiro,
380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kisangani, Congo's third
largest city, which has been in rebel hands for several weeks.
	   Isiro, which sits on the northeastern crossroads of the route
west across northern Congo, was captured Thursday and the rebels
are now continuing north to the Sudanese border, he said.
	   The rebel commander said his forces were going to clean out
government troops from the Garamba National Park on the border.
	   Rebel officials said that on Thursday their troops also captured
Matila, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Shabunda also en route to
Kindu.
	   It was not possible to confirm the claims independently.
	   Ondekane added, however, that while rebels are headed to Kindu
and the southeastern town of Lubumbashi in the mineral-rich Katanga
region, the real objective was still the western capital Kinshasa.
	   He noted that the rebels were advancing by foot and the war
would therefore take more time.
	   ``The real enemy of the army is the distance. Our country is
huge,'' Ondekane said. ``We don't go by plane or by car. It takes
time because its a tactical progression.''
	   The rebellion, led by disgruntled soldiers and Kabila's
political opponents, broke out Aug. 2. The rebels made rapid
advances from their eastern base and even managed to capture
several key bases in the far west of the country.
	   But they were driven back when Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
poured men and equipment in to save the capital, Kinshasa, from
rebel capture.
	   Ondekane said rebel soldiers were still around Kinshasa, and
were blocking supplies from reaching the capital from the key
Atlantic Ocean port town of Matadi.
	   ``We are blocking the Matadi-Kinshasa road. Our men are waiting
there and they know we will reach them,'' the commander said.
	   Ondekane laughed when asked about reports from Kinshasa that the
airport in Bukavu had been bombed and said it was not true.
	   One week ago, local Mai-Mai traditional fighters and Rwandan
Hutu rebels allied with government forces attacked Goma for six
hours before withdrawing.
	   Kabila claims Uganda and Rwanda are the driving forces behind
the rebellion. Uganda admits it has troops in northeastern Congo to
defend its security interests, and Rwanda has reserved the right to
intervene to protect itself from Rwandan Hutu rebel attacks.
	   Both countries, which were instrumental in putting Kabila in
power 16 months ago, now say he has failed to get rid of Ugandan
and Rwandan rebels who are using eastern Congo as a base from which
to attack Uganda and Rwanda.

Milosevic denies humanitarian plight, Kosovo Albanian leader quits

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic tried Monday to avert possible NATO intervention in
Kosovo, denying reports that tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian
refugees face hunger and disease because of his offensives.
	   ``The term 'humanitarian catastrophe' which we have been hearing
during the past weeks is not based on reality,'' Milosevic said in
a statement released by his office following talks in Belgrade with
U.S. envoy for Kosovo Christopher Hill.
	   Hill made no comments after the meeting.
	   Milosevic also met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky. In a statement issued from his office afterwards,
Milosevic declared the Kosovo Albanian ``terrorists'' have been
defeated.
	   ``Yugoslavia has been faced with unprecedented threats only
because it defends its sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   Despite international aid organizations' reports that some
275,000 people displaced in Kosovo since Serbs launched a violent
crackdown against Albanian separatists in February are facing
hunger and disease, Serbian officials say refugees are being
sheltered and cared for.
	   In an attempt to prevent a humanitarian disaster, NATO has
readied plans for possible military intervention to end the
crackdown in Kosovo, a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in
present Yugoslavia. Kosovo is over 90 percent ethnic Albanian, but
is ruled by Serbia.
	   Also on Monday, officials in Serbia and Montenegro rejected an
ethnic Albanian proposal for Kosovo to gain equal status with those
two republics in the joint Yugoslav federation.
	   Miodrag Vukovic, an adviser to the president of Montenegro, told
Dnevni Telegraf daily territorial autonomy for Kosovo that would
change borders and position of Serbia in Yugoslavia is ``out of the
question.''
	   Montenegro, which is much smaller than Serbia, apparently fears
its position in the federation would be jeopardized if Kosovo
became a separate unit.
	   According to ethnic Albanian proposal, published Sunday in Koha
Ditore daily, Kosovo would be ``temporarily part of Yugoslavia, as
an independent entity equal to the other two republics in the
federation.''
	   A vice president in the Serbian government, Vojislav Seselj,
said ``Kosovo must remain in Serbia.'' He added the region could
only be granted ``territorial autonomy'' within Serbia.
	   Last week, Koha Ditore carried a formula suggested by the United
States which would grant the province a high level of self-rule but
leaving it within Serbia. Pacifist Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
has backed the plan, saying it was a good basis for the talks.
	   Serb forces and KLA clashed Monday in the central Drenica
region, the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Information Center reported.
	   Residents of Dobratin village in northern Kosovo found two more
bodies Monday, bringing the total number of corpses found to eight,
since Serbs swarmed the area last week.
	   Two elderly men who buried the bodies of a 58-year-old man and
his 37-year-old cousin early Monday said one was riddled with
bullets, while the other had his jaw ripped off and his chest cut
open.
	   Also, the KLA detained 13 ethnic Albanian politicians, most of
whom are close to Rugova, Albanian sources said Monday. They said
the group was captured Sunday afternoon in Drenica, but gave no
reasons for the move.
	   The KLA did not confirm or deny the report.

Rebels capture town in eastern Congo near strategic air base
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with details of fighting, situation from

 &UR; By DIANNA CAHN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels fighting to oust President
Laurent Kabila have captured the eastern town of Kamituga in South
Kivu region, rebel officials said Monday.
	   Rebel commander Jean Pierre Ondekane said his forces faced heavy
fighting when they captured the town, which is about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) southwest of the Lake Kivu town of Bukavu on the way to
Kindu, a strategic air base, on Friday.
	   He said that during the battles, forces captured 10 Sudanese
soldiers who were fighting on the side of Kabila.
	   Speaking in the eastern rebel stronghold of Goma, Ondekane said
rebel soldiers also captured the northeastern town of Isiro, 380
kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kisangani, Congo's third
largest city, which has been in rebel hands for several weeks.
	   Isiro, which sits on the northeastern crossroads of the route
west across northern Congo, was captured Thursday and the rebels
are now continuing north to the Sudanese border, he said.
	   The rebel commander said his forces were going to clean out
government troops from the Garamba National Park on the border.
	   Rebel officials said that on Thursday their troops also captured
Matila, 20 kilometers (12 miles) west of Shabunda also en route to
Kindu.
	   It was not possible to confirm the claims independently.
	   Ondekane added, however, that while rebels are headed to Kindu
and the southeastern town of Lubumbashi in the mineral-rich Katanga
region, the real objective was still the western capital Kinshasa.
	   He noted that the rebels were advancing by foot and the war
would therefore take more time.
	   ``The real enemy of the army is the distance. Our country is
huge,'' Ondekane said. ``We don't go by plane or by car. It takes
time because its a tactical progression.''
	   The rebellion, led by disgruntled soldiers and Kabila's
political opponents, broke out Aug. 2. The rebels made rapid
advances from their eastern base and even managed to capture
several key bases in the far west of the country.
	   But they were driven back when Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia
provided men and equipment to save Kinshasa from rebel capture.
	   Kabila claims Uganda and Rwanda are the driving forces behind
the rebellion. Uganda admits it has troops in northeastern Congo to
defend its security interests, and Rwanda has reserved the right to
intervene to protect itself from Rwandan Hutu rebel attacks.
	   Both countries, which were instrumental in putting Kabila in
power 16 months ago, now say he has failed to get rid of Ugandan
and Rwandan rebels who are using eastern Congo as a base from which
to attack Uganda and Rwanda.

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ His T-shirt stained with blood and his
wounded 22-year-old son shaking beside him in the lobby of the
embattled U.S. Embassy, former Liberian warlord Roosevelt Johnson
knew Monday that it was time to be afraid.
	   ``I don't know how we're going to get out of here,'' said
Johnson, the chief rival of President Charles Taylor, nervously
glancing around the room that has suddenly become his refuge.
	   A few steps behind Johnson, shielded by thick panes of
bullet-proof glass, American soldiers in full battle gear, assault
weapons at the ready, patrolled the embassy's hallways, stepping
past supplies piled in the corridors.
	   The American embassy, which repeatedly found itself the only
safe haven in Liberia's capital during this West African country's
brutal 7-year civil war, has suddenly found itself again in the
middle.
	   Johnson fled to the embassy over the weekend to escape arrest in
a city tense after battles between his supporters and the
government.
	   Although the embassy was under heightened security, an
Associated Press journalist was able to visit the compound for part
of the day to speak with Johnson and survey the situation.

Clinton calls terrorism `threat to all humankind'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with five grafs with Clinton to ask Congress for dlrs
1.8 billion in emergency money to fight terrorism; EDITS to
conform. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Keeping his public focus on international
events, President Bill Clinton renewed a global call to arms
against terrorism Monday and attacked the idea that it is mainly an
American problem of American making.
	   ``This is a threat to all humankind,'' Clinton said in a
21-minute speech to the opening of the 53rd session of the United
Nations General Assembly. The hundreds of delegates gave Clinton a
rare standing ovation as he was introduced in the cavernous hall at
U.N. headquarters.
	   White House aides were quick to tell reporters that Clinton was
moved by the warm greeting, which offered a measure of support for
a beleaguered president whose videotaped grand jury testimony in
the Monica Lewinsky matter was playing on TV even as he spoke.
	   Stressing that the United States is carrying its load in the
anti-terrorism battle, Clinton said he would submit a request to
Congress this week for emergency funding to repair damage to the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that were bombed last month
and to beef up embassy security worldwide. Aides later said he
would ask Congress for dlrs 1.8 billion.
	   Clinton also held a one-on-one meeting at the U.S. mission to
the United Nations with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Pakistan and neighboring India are locked in a nuclear arms
competition that Clinton has sought for months to bring to a halt.

Respiratory congress: Western children getting asthma from dust in
</HEADLINE>
`clean' houses &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEXANDER G. HIGGINS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Asthma has been spreading among children
worldwide, but the hardest-hit are youngsters in wealthy countries,
according to studies presented to a conference of 9,000 respiratory
specialists from Europe and North America.
	   ``Why is there less asthma in Asia and Eastern Europe than in
Western countries?'' said a statement Monday by conference
organizers, the European Respiratory Society. ``It may be because
western infants spend too much time shut up at home.''
	   Preliminary results of a 56-country study showed a clear link
between the ``westernization'' of a country and the incidence or
asthma. For example, Britain, Australia and New Zealand have 5-8
times more cases than Greece, Russia and China.
	   Some 460,000 teen-agers are being observed in the study that was
begun after specialists noted that asthma attacks requiring
emergency treatment have been rising by 5 percent a year in the
United States.
	   ``Asthma is already very widespread and it is becoming
increasingly so, especially among children,'' said Professor Peter
Helms of the University of Aberdeen, Scotland.
	   Two theories have emerged: that children living in closed-up
homes in the West are exposed to more house dust and that elsewhere
children meet more microbes that stand them in good stead later in
life.
	   Helms presented a study of more than 18,000 Scottish children
that indicated up to 14.8 percent were affected by asthma.
	   The survey confirms that Britain leads the world in asthma, with
one child in seven suffering from the affliction in which the
airways inside the lungs become inflamed and contract, making it
difficult to breathe. The specialists said an attack often is
caused by an allergic reaction to pollen, dust or animal hair. But
it can be brought on or made worse by pollution, tobacco smoke,
colds, cold temperatures, exercise, excitement or stress.
	   Dr. Erika von Mutius of the University of Munich said Monday her
team had compared 5,600 children aged 9-11 in Munich, formerly in
West Germany, and Dresden, formerly in East Germany.
	   While hay fever affected children in both cities at about the
same rate, the western children suffered markedly more from asthma,
10.3 percent in Munich compared with 7.9 percent in Dresden, she
said.
	   Von Mutius said the children of Dresden were more likely to
attend nurseries and to have more brothers and sisters. The
increased exposure to the germs of other children stimulates their
immune systems and could prevent the development of asthma, she
said.
	   Another German study, which tracked more than 1,000 babies
during the first three years of life, found that the children who
developed allergies lived in apartments where the dust contained
four times more excrement from dust mites. It is these tiny
droppings that are a key cause of allergies.
	   Dr. Laurent Nicod of Geneva University said there is hope that a
vaccine could be developed against asthma, ``but we have not
reached that point yet.''

Iran's Khatami denounces U.S. world dominance, Afghanistan's
</HEADLINE>
Taliban &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with meeting over Afghanistan, fresh quotes; Trims &QL; 
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's President Mohammad Khatami said
Monday that his country wanted good relations with the outside
world, but denounced ``the fantasy of a unipolar world'' dominated
by the United States.
	   ``The fantasy of a unipolar world ruled by a single superpower
is but an illusion,'' said Khatami, the first Iranian leader to
address the U.N. General Assembly in 12 years.
	   Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States but
Khatami has sought to tone down nearly two decades of hostility
with the country sometimes known in Iran as ``the Great Satan.''
	   In the highest level contact between the two nations in two
decades, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Iran's deputy
foreign minister were sitting in on a meeting over Afghanistan, but
the two are not expected to discuss their own relations.
	   Khatami, wearing the flowing black robe and turban of a senior
Shiite cleric, blasted the Taliban militia that rules most of
neighboring Afghanistan, and with which his country faces a
military stand-off.
	   ``Afghanistan, the land of people of dignity and culture, has
now been turned into a haven for violence, terrorism and production
and trafficking in narcotics,'' said Khatami, whose Islamic
government has accused the Taliban of giving the faith a bad name
with policies that restrict women's rights.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have risen since the
Taliban overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan
on Aug. 8 and killed several Iranian diplomats posted there.
	   Iran has since deployed about 200,000 troops on its border with
Afghanistan, amid growing demands for vengeance by mobs of Iranian
demonstrators.
	   Khatami met earlier Monday with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of
Pakistan, whose country is the main backer of the Taliban.
	   Khatami also denied U.S. charges that Iran is a sponsor of
international terrorism and is trying to acquire weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``Eradication of terrorism must be concurrent with a global
search for justice. This assertion should in no way be interpreted
as a justification for any form of terrorism,'' said Khatami.
	   ``At the threshold of the third millennium, the world also needs
to be liberated from the nightmare of nuclear war and weapons of
mass destruction,'' he said.
	   Khatami also called for reform at the United Nations, saying
that the veto power exercised by the five permanent members of the
Security Council should be abolished.
	   Khatami, a moderate whose landslide election in May 1997 was
largely due to the votes of women and young Iranians, said that
``the traditional outlook, based on the erroneous notion of
superiority of men over women, does injustice to men, women and
humanity as a whole.''

Government demands ETA convert truce into demobilization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The government demanded Monday that the
armed Basque separatist group ETA prove the sincerity of its recent
peace overtures by disbanding itself and surrendering its weapons.
	   Five days after the ETA announced an indefinite cease-fire,
government spokesman Josep Pique said the group must prove its
commitment to peace ``not just with a truce, but by abandoning its
arms.''
	   ``The objective is for the truce to become the launch pad of an
authentic peace process, which it isn't yet,'' Pique said on
national television, calling for ``prudence and caution.''
	   Ever since ETA announced the truce last Wednesday, the
government has been at pains to dampen hopes that a definitive
solution to the Basque conflict is just around the corner.
	   But it has admitted that ETA's first ever indefinite cease-fire
during its 30-year campaign for an independent Basque nation has
created a new situation.
	   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar met with Socialist leader
Joaquin Almunia on Monday, the first in a round of talks with
political leaders aimed at elaborating a common response to the ETA
truce.
	   Following the meeting Almunia told reporters that the Socialists
were ``willing to collaborate with the government'' to achieve
peace.
	   Almunia dismissed any possibility of discussions with ETA
regarding the group's objective of an independent Basque nation
straddling northern Spain and southern France, the national news
agency EFE reported.
	   ``We are not going to talk about politics (with ETA), but how
and when they are going to give up violence,'' EFE quoted Almunia
as saying.
	   ETA, a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland and Liberty,
has killed nearly 800 people since 1968.
	   The Socialist leader also criticized Basque nationalist
politicians for what he called ``opportunistically taking
advantage'' of the truce with a view to Basque regional elections
on Oct. 25.
	   Basque nationalist leaders, who support ETA's political ends but
condemn its violent means, have been pressuring for a more
enthusiastic response to the cease-fire.
	   Joseba Egibar, spokesman for the Basque Nationalist Party, on
Monday told the radio station SET that politicians should ``rise to
the challenge'' of the truce, from which he said there ``was no
going back.''

Milutinovic hired as new MetroStars coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS Milutinovic's age in 12th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEACAUCUS, New Jersey (AP) _ Bora Milutinovic, the only man to
guide four different teams into the second round of the World Cup,
on Monday became the New York-New Jersey MetroStars' fifth coach in
less than three years.
	   The Serbian-born Milutinovic, who also was one of four
candidates to replace Steve Sampson as coach of the U.S. national
team, was to arrive in New York from Mexico Monday evening and take
over the squad Tuesday.
	   Milutinovic has a contract through the end of the season with an
agreement to negotiate a longer-term deal. He replaces Alfonso
Mondelo, who took over the side following the departure of
Brazilian Carlos Alberto Parreira. Parreira left in December after
one season with the MetroStars to coach Saudi Arabia in the 1998
World Cup.
	   Despite clinching a playoff berth last month, the MetroStars
have lost their last six matches, fallen from second to third in
the Eastern Conference and dropped to 14-17 with one game remaining
before the post-season.
	   ``This was not a change just to make a change,'' MetroStars vice
president and general manager Charlie Stillitano said. ``It's less
than an indictment on Mondelo and more of the faith I have in Bora.
	   ``Bora knows our team, the core of our team. This is more than a
six-game slide. We haven't played well since the All-Star (Game,
Aug. 2) break.
	   ``Bora has a reputation of being the best to coach a team where
it's going into a tournament. And let's face it, we're going into a
tournament (the playoffs).''
	   Milutinovic is known throughout the world as a soccer mercenary
able to take a team on short notice and achieve immediate success.
He led Mexico to the quarterfinals at the 1986 World Cup, its
highest finish.
	   He took over Costa Rica just before the 1990 World Cup and
stunned many by getting it into the second round. He was introduced
by then U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg in 1991 as
a ``miracle worker'' and proceeded to qualify the United States for
the second round in 1994.
	   He left his post with the U.S. national team in 1995, saying he
was fired for not taking a larger role in player development.
	   Milutinovic appeared again on the world scene in France this
summer, guiding Nigeria into the second round before it was
eliminated by Denmark.
	   The 54-year-old Milutinovic continues the carousel of
high-profile coaches who have stood on the MetroStars' sideline.
Former New York Cosmos coach Eddie Firmani lasted less than two
months of the first season in 1996 before he was replaced by former
Portuguese national team coach Carlos Queiroz.
	   After Queiroz left to take a more lucrative offer with a
Japanese club following the 1996 season, Parreira was hired, but he
departed following the 1997 season for the Saudi job.
	   The hiring of Mondelo, who had coached the second-division Long
Island Rough Riders, was seen by many as an end to the MetroStars'
fascination with big-name coaches.
	   Milutinovic had been one of four names bandied about to replace
national team coach Sampson, along with Washington D.C. United
coach Bruce Arena, Queiroz and Parreira. Sampson's replacement is
expected to be announced before the end of October.
	   Stillitano said he had been concerned about the team's poor form
since the beginning of August, but that the organization's concern
reached a head following last Wednesday's 5-0 rout at home by D.C.
United.
	   With the MetroStars, Milutinovic will be reunited with four
players whom he coached during the 1994 World Cup: midfielders Tab
Ramos and Mike Sorber, goalkeeper Tony Meola and defender Alexi
Lalas.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Norway's Tore Andre Flo scored in the 82nd and
86th minute to lift Chelsea to a 4-3 victory Monday over struggling
Blackburn in the English Premier League.
	   The victory gave Chelsea eight points, six behind leaders Aston

51st as Chelsea went ahead again, but Sebastien Perez scored in the
57th to level and Sutton scored his second _ this time on a penalty
in the 79th _ which appeared to be the winning goal.
	   Chelsea rallied to the win in the wake of the sending off of
England international Graeme Le Saux in the 67th minute. Perez was
sent off at the same time on his second yellow card for his part in
the run-in with Le Saux.

`FloJo' set standards for women's track _ in speed and fashion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Florence Griffith Joyner was one of a kind.
	   The fastest women's sprinter in history, she also established
the standards for fashion in track and field.
	   No one has matched the feats she set 10 years ago _ world
records in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, marks that still stand.
And no one has duplicated the flair she displayed _ her flamboyant,
colorful, one-legged outfits, her elaborate, well-polished, 6-inch
(15-cm) fingernails.
	   Sprinter-hurdler Gail Devers and 400-meter hurdler Sandra Farmer
Patrick have tried to emulate the glamour of Griffith Joyner, who
died Monday of a heart seizure at 38. Devers has become noted for
her extremely long fingernails and Farmer Patrick for her stylish
attire, but neither star has received the acclaim nor captured the
imagination of the flashy, provocative ``FloJo.''
	   Farmer Patrick was devastated by Griffith Joyner's death.
	   ``Florence was like a sister to me,'' she said, crying
uncontrollably. ``We shared so much together. We shared lots of
childhood memories and career goals. We had similar values and
religious beliefs.''
	   Griffith Joyner was the godmother of Farmer Patrick's 4-year-old
daughter, Sierra.
	   ``I chose her because of her strength and her courage,'' Farmer
Patrick said. ``I loved her dearly.''
	   So did many others, even though there were rumblings during the
1988 Olympics that Griffith Joyner was using performance-enhancing
drugs because she appeared bulked up. Nothing ever was proven.
	   One special admirer was President Clinton.
	   ``We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent, and
captivated by her style,'' Clinton said in a statement. ``Though
she rose to the pinnacle of the world of sports, she never forgot
where she came from, devoting time and resources to helping
children _ especially those growing up in our most devastated
neighborhoods _ make the most of their own talents.''
	   Griffith was co-chair of the President's Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports.
	   ``She was very good with kids,'' said John Smith, one of the
premier sprint coaches in the world. ``Whenever she came to see me,
she brought a FloJo doll for my daughter, Noel.''
	   Smith also appreciated her discipline and personality.
	   ``She worked very hard,'' he said. ``She was relentless, she
never stopped. Besides being beautiful, she had a work ethic bar
none. The beauty of her was that she never changed. She was the
same FloJo before and she was the same FloJo after.
	   ``We're going to miss her. She made a great contribution to
track and field, like Wilma Rudolph did before her and like Marion
Jones is doing now.''
	   While many young girls saw FloJo as a role model, she never felt
that way.
	   ``Kids tell me: `FloJo, I want to be just like you,''' she used
to say. ``And I tell them, you have to be yourself first, and
strive to be better than me and set your own goals.''
	   Griffith Joyner authored many children's books, featuring the
character Barry Bam Bam; she wrote poems; she was a beautician, an
artist, a model and a clothes designer; she performed in movies and
television; she did numerous commercial endorsements; she made many
speaking engagements, and she designed the uniforms for the Indiana
Pacers.
	   She did them all with style and grace.
	   Just like she ran.
	   And in 1988, she ran like no one else, winning Olympic gold
medals in the 100, 200 and 400 relay, and a silver in the 1,600
relay.
	   ``I remember her from '88, just taking the world by storm and
surprising all of us,'' said Evelyn Ashford, whose world record in
the 100 Griffith Joyner broke. ``In '88 ... she was the one we all
had to beat.''
	   Greg Foster, a three-time world champion in the 110 hurdles who
was once engaged to FloJo, called her death ``a shock.''
	   ``We lost one of the great track and field athletes in
history,'' he said. ``She's going to be missed.''

First trial of Croats for wartime crimes against Serbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with suspects declining to enter a plea.
No pick up. Note contents of 7th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By EUGENE BRCIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Three Croats accused of atrocities
against Serb rebels and civilians in the 1991 Serbo-Croat war
declined to enter a plea Monday at the opening of the first such
trial in Croatia.
	   They and six others are charged with abduction, extortion,
attempted murder and murders committed in the Pakracka Poljana
region. Hundreds of ethnic Serbs allegedly were tortured _ and
dozens of them eventually killed _ in the area 70 miles (110
kilometers) southeast of the capital.
	   Three of the defendants, Munib Suljic, 39, Igor Mikola, 27, and
Miroslav Bajramovic, 41, appeared before the court Monday. Entering
a plea is not mandatory, and all three were silent when asked for
one. The six others remain at large and were being tried in
absentia.
	   More than 20 witnesses were expected to testify in the first
case in which Croats are being tried for atrocities against local
Serbs.
	   Until an interview with Bajramovic was published in the weekly
Feral Tribune in September 1997 _ which he since has partly
retracted _ most Croats viewed themselves only as victims in the
six-month war.
	   Serbs in Croatia, with help from the dominant Yugoslav republic
of Serbia, revolted against the government in Zagreb. The 1991
revolt was triggered by Croatia's declaration of independence from
Yugoslavia; about 10,000 Croats died in the war.
	   Bajramovic admitted in the interview to torturing and killing 72
people and being responsible for 14 more deaths in Pakracka Poljana
and Gospic, 110 miles (175 kilometers) south of Zagreb. He
described torture techniques that included electrocuting people
with hooks under their fingernails or cables up their rectums.
	   Bajramovic also implicated high-ranking army officials,
including the former interior minister and local commander. None of
the former soldiers, however, were charged with any of the most
severe crimes described in the newspaper interview.
	   A court statement issued shortly after Bajramovic's indictment a
year ago said he had retracted parts of his published confession in
his official account.
	   Some Croats, including many former soldiers, have denied any
Croat atrocities; others have pressed for a reevaluation of the
events of 1991.

Mexico calls for more democratic Security Council
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council should be reformed so
that it is more democratic and representative, Mexico's foreign
minister said Monday.
	   Rosario Green told the General Assembly's annual debate that the
15-member council should ``correct the deficiencies in its
composition'' and allow more members to better reflect the
185-member assembly.
	   The United States, Britain, China, France and Russia are
permanent members of the council and have veto power. Ten other
countries, elected by regional blocks, serve two-year rotating
stints on the council, effectively the U.N. board of directors.
	   The United States has proposed giving Germany and Japan
permanent seats on the council while allocating three other seats
for representatives from Asia, Latin America and Africa.
	   Green also said Mexico condemned the recent nuclear tests
conducted by India and Pakistan and called for renewed disarmament
efforts to rid humanity of weapons of mass destruction.
	   She called for an early warning system to avoid new financial
crises like the one that has shaken Asia and parts of Latin
America.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rudolf Nureyev, the Russian ballet star who
defected to the West during the height of the Cold War, has been
posthumously rehabilitated, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Nureyev, a star of Leningrad's Kirov ballet theater, was granted
political asylum in France in the summer of 1961, following his
defection. A year later, in the Soviet Union, he was convicted in
absentia of high treason and sentenced to seven years in jail.
	   Nureyev died of AIDS in 1993 at age 54.
	   Alexander Zvyagintsev, a senior official in the Prosecutor
General's office, told the ITAR-Tass news agency that Nureyev had
been forgiven under the law ``on rehabilitation of victims of
political repressions.''

World leaders urge action on Asian financial crisis, terrorism

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders opened the first day of the
General Assembly's annual debate Monday by urging an international
effort to rein in the Asian financial crisis before it brings down
more economies and calling for a comprehensive attack on terrorism.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair offered to host a high-level
conference in London this fall _ aimed at eliminating opportunities
for terrorists to raise money.
	   ``Effective new measures, on an agreed international basis,
could make a real difference,'' Blair said.
	   Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, used his speech to call for
a universal dialogue to promote peace and end violence, including
terrorism. He suggested the United Nations designate 2001 the
``Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations.''
	   Brazil's foreign minister launched the 53rd session by warning
that a few countries alone cannot bail out nations suffering from
the effects of the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``Experience teaches us that inaction can have a high cost,''
Luiz Felipe Lampreia told world leaders gathered for the first day
of the two-week speech-making forum.
	   ``The world cannot depend only on the willingness, capacity and
interest of a select number of countries to mobilize and lead
international efforts in this or that direction.''
	   In recent weeks, Brazil's stock and currency markets have been
battered by the Asian economic crisis that has seen investors
fleeing Asia, Russia and other developing markets. The collapse of
the Indonesian currency last year sparked the crisis.
	   Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, urged the creation
of a ``lender of last resort,'' to meet the needs of the volatile
markets because existing financial institutions couldn't handle all
the problems.
	   ``The maladies that spring from economic globalization require
remedies which are global in scope, remedies which must take
account of the ailments of all states, and not be based solely on
the prescriptions advanced by those who may seem to be secure,''
she said.
	   President Bill Clinton pledged the United States would do more
to minimize the turmoil. But he focused his address on the fight
against terrorism _ evidenced Monday in the unprecedented security
that greeted world leaders and will remain in place for the next
two weeks.
	   ``Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation with a powerful
military and a worldwide presence active in promoting peace and
security, we are often a target,'' Clinton said, referring to the
Aug. 7 dual bombings on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.
	   ``No one in this room, nor the people you represent, are
immune,'' Clinton said.
	   Kumaratunga decried what she said was the terrorism that has
wracked Sri Lanka for 15 years and killed an estimated 54,000
people.
	   ``A particularly cruel offense against the innocence of children
is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group in Sri Lanka to
serve as suicide killers in the name of a cause they are too young
to even comprehend,'' she said.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela focused on human rights
abuses that afflict millions of people around the world _
particularly in Africa, where regional conflicts in Sudan, Congo
and Angola threaten to spill over.
	   ``The very right to be human is denied every day to hundreds of
millions of people,'' held hostage by conflict, nuclear terror and
brutal regimes, he told the audience in what was expected to be his
last speech at the assembly.
	   ``Many are still unable to participate in the determination of
the destiny of their family and to protect themselves from
tyranny,'' said Mandela, whose own country freed itself from the
oppression of apartheid only four years ago.
	   Khatami, whose speech marked the first time an Iranian president
has spoken before the General Assembly in 12 years, also spoke of
tyranny, referring to the current conflict with Afghanistan's
Taliban militia over the deaths of eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist last month.
	   ``Afghanistan, the land of people of dignity and culture, has
now been turned into a haven for violence, terrorism and production
and trafficking in narcotics,'' said Khatami, whose Islamic
government has accused the Taliban of giving the faith a bad name.
	   ``The Afghan people, as other peoples in the world, have the
inalienable right to determine their own destiny,'' said Khatami.
	   The Taliban are mostly Sunni Muslims, while Iranians are
predominently Shiite.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Thousands fled Hurricane Georges
for the safety of shelters in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands Monday, as the 110-mph (180-kph) storm cut a swath through
the northeast Caribbean.
	   Packing howling winds and 20-foot (6-meter) seas, the hurricane
toppled power lines, mangled trees and blew away roofs as families
huddled in shelters in St. Kitts, Antigua and other islands earlier
Monday.
	   Although there were no serious injuries reported by midday,
Georges remained a terror because of its strength and fears it
would hit densely populated areas directly.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' warned Pedro
Rossello, the governor of the U.S. territory. ``Our people have
very difficult days to come... We are maximally prepared.''
	   At 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT), Georges' center was estimated near
latitude 18.0 north and longitude 65.6 west, bearing down on Puerto
Rico as it moved west at 16 mph (26 kph). Georges packed
hurricane-force winds of up to 110 mph (180 kph) extending up to 85
miles (140 kilometers) from the eye, mostly to the northeast.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned the storm winds _
while diminished from a monstrous 150 mph (240 kph) Sunday _
remained ``extremely dangerous,'' and Center director Jerry Jarrell
said there were indications Georges was intensifying.
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico _ and both territories declared states of emergency
and activated National Guard troops to help evacuations.
	   The first winds were felt around 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) in the San
Juan area, where almost half of Puerto Rico's 3.8 million people
live.
	   Rossello banned liquor sales and ordered officials to open more
than 330 shelters. Banks and schools closed, airlines canceled
flights to and from the U.S. mainland, and ferry service to nearby
islands was suspended. Police ordered people off the beaches.
	   More than 9,700 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities.
	   With up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain expected in Puerto
Rico's mountains, the threat of mudslides and flash floods drove
many mountain residents to the San Juan shelters too.
	   ``The roof of my house is made of wood and cardboard, and I'd
rather be here before it goes flying,'' said Miguel Mercado Romero,
66, as he waited for the storm in a shelter near the Old San Juan
historic district.
	   Georges' current path would also take it to the island of
Hispaniola, which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
Many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to Georges' fury.
	   Hurricane watches also went into effect for the southeastern
Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and there was concern as
far away as Florida, where workers put shutters over the windows at
Key West City Hall.
	   Georges first hit land Sunday night, downing trees and utility
lines, ripping wooden and galvanized roofs from homes and pelting
sheets of rain into residences on the northern Leeward islands.
	   In Antigua, where 5,700 people spent the night in shelters, the
storm split open government-built homes in northern Cedar Grove
Garden, ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses and
wrapped them around trees.
	   ``Hurricane mash up my life,'' said Verna McHenry as she
surveyed the remains of her home near Bolans.
	   Antiguan shop owners erected sandbag barricades to stop
flooding. Civil defense workers distributed flashlights, mosquito
coils, water and toilet paper to nervous shelter residents.
	   ``An incredible sound'' from a darkened, angry sea is how Jean
Barfleur, mayor of Port-Louis, described the hurricane's roar.
Raging seas flooded roads and forced residents living near the
beach on Guadeloupe to head for shelter inland.
	   France was sending a team of 170 civil defense workers to help
recovery efforts.
	   Winds gusted above 90 mph (144 kph) in St. Martin, where
Hurricane Luis caused hundreds of millions of dollars' damage in
1995.
	   In St. Croix, raging winds bent palm trees to a third of their
height, shook parked cars and destroyed part of the boardwalk. Gov.
Roy Schneider, speaking on WVWI-AM radio, said a 50-foot (15-meter)
sailboat had been driven aground. In St. Thomas, also part of the
U.S. Virgin Islands, winds were at about 75 mph and increasing.
	   Georges was expected to lose strength while shooting over the
north shore of Hispaniola but possibly intensify again at it sails
over open water about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Cuba.

Clinton calls terrorism `threat to all humankind'

remarks at New York University. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Keeping his public focus on international
events, President Bill Clinton renewed a global call to arms
against terrorism Monday and attacked the idea that it is mainly an
American problem of American making.
	   ``This is a threat to all humankind,'' Clinton said in a
21-minute speech to the opening of the 53rd session of the United
Nations General Assembly. The hundreds of delegates gave Clinton a
rare standing ovation as he was introduced in the cavernous hall at
U.N. headquarters.
	   White House aides were quick to tell reporters that Clinton was
moved by the warm greeting, which offered a measure of support for
a beleaguered president whose videotaped grand jury testimony in
the Monica Lewinsky matter was playing on TV even as he spoke.
	   ``It reflects the love and respect that the international
community feels for you,'' Clinton's national security adviser,
Sandy Berger, quoted Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif as
telling the president afterward.
	   Stressing that the United States is carrying its load in the
anti-terrorism battle, Clinton said he would submit a request to
Congress this week for emergency funding to repair damage to the
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that were bombed last month
and to beef up embassy security worldwide. Aides later said he
would ask Congress for dlrs 1.8 billion.
	   Clinton also held a one-on-one meeting at the U.S. mission to
the United Nations with Sharif. His Pakistani government and
neighboring India are locked in a nuclear arms competition and
tensions over the territory of Kashmir. Clinton has sought for
months to halt the former and ease the latter.
	   Berger later told reporters that Sharif indicated he would make
a ``positive statement'' on the subject of nuclear testing during
his address to the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday. Berger was
not more specific except to say the statement would be about the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which Clinton wants both India and
Pakistan to sign as a way of reducing tensions.
	   Clinton is due shortly to decide whether to scrap his plan for
stop in India and Pakistan this fall during an Asia trip that was
scheduled before the two countries shocked the world by detonating
nuclear test devices in May in defiance of American warnings.
	   On a busy day in Manhattan, where thousands of people lined the
streets to catch a glimpse of the president, Clinton also
participated in a symposium at New York University School of Law on
the emergence of a global economy and the challenges it presents to
liberty and democracy. First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton also spoke
at the forum, which drew many foreign leaders, including British
Prime Minister Tony Blair and Italian Premier Romano Prodi.
	   In brief opening remarks to the symposium, Clinton said the
world needs to think about ways to make the emerging global economy
``work for ordinary people.'' Part of that challenge, he said, is
to deal effectively with immediate problems such as Russia's
economic crisis.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The Duchess of York flew Monday
to the Argentine ranch of her late mother Susan Barrantes, mourning
her death in a weekend car crash.
	   Looking weary in a black dress, the former Sarah Ferguson
arrived by overnight flight from Britain and said nothing to
reporters before traveling on to her mother's country estate
outside Buenos Aires.
	   British Ambassador William Mardens met the duchess at the
capital airport early Monday before she flew on by private plane to
El Pucara, near the town of Tres Lomas, 310 miles (500 kilometers)
southwest of Buenos Aires.
	   Police said Mrs. Barrantes, 61, was killed instantly Saturday
night when the Rover she was driving collided with van near Tres
Lomas, while returning to the ranch on the pampas where she raised
polo ponies.
	   The duchess, or ``Fergie,'' ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth II's
second son, Prince Andrew, heard the news early Sunday while on
vacation in Italy.
	   Mrs. Barrantes's passenger, nephew by marriage Rafael Barrantes,
25, escaped with minor injuries. The driver of the other car, Jose
Maria Rodriguez, suffered a broken ankle, police said.
	   The family did not announce funeral arrangements, but
authorities in Tres Lomas said preparations had been made for a
private burial Tuesday. Aides to the duchess said Mrs. Barrantes
would be buried alongside her second husband at El Pucara, where a
media throng gathered.
	   Police kept the crush of journalists back on Monday after a
private plane carrying the duchess landed on a dusty airstrip near
El Pucara on a cold first day of spring in South America.
	   The duchess then sped off in a fast-moving motorcade, sirens
wailing and dust flying from car wheels as a chill wind blustered
over the pampas. As her silver car moved off to the highly guarded
estate home, television journalists followed in pursuit.
	   The duchess's sister, Jane Luedecke, who lives in Australia,
flew separately to the Argentine capital, arriving Monday afternoon
at the estate.

Empathy, sympathy for Clinton

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES to add fresh reax from England's Tuesday newspapers in

 &UR; With Clinton-Lewinsky &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCH STACY &QC;

	   LONDON (AP) _ Watching Bill Clinton in the videotaped deposition
on TV in a west London pub on Monday, Tony Charlesworth said he
already knew more than he wanted to know about the U.S. president's
sex life.
	   ``I don't need to be seeing this,'' said Charlesworth, a
31-year-old London businessman. ``They should only show it to
people who need to see it. They're just humiliating him.''
	   From Johannesburg to Jordan and beyond, many who watched
Clinton's televised grilling by special counsel lawyers seemed to
share a similar opinion. Some viewers said they felt sorry for
Clinton. Many agreed the tape never should have been made public.
	   But in Kuwait, former oil minister Ali al-Baghli called it a
historic day.
	   ``The head of the most important country is accounting for
breaking the law, just like any ordinary person. I hope this will
be a lesson to us in the Third World,'' said al-Baghli.
	   Maher bin Naji, a 39-year-old Kuwaiti banker, agreed that airing
the testimony was ``democracy at its peak,'' but said, ``The poor
guy did not do anything. It's his private life and he should not
resign.''
	   Early editions of some British newspapers on Tuesday gave mixed
reactions.
	   Rupert Murdoch's The Sun, a British tabloid, led its front page
with the headline, ''Greatest Humiliation in American History.''
	   But The Times, another Murdoch owned paper in Britain, ran a
front-page column by a former Conservative lawmaker that
sympathized with Clinton.
	   ''This was medieval. It was cruel. This was like bear-baiting,
witch-ducking ... The questions were more offensive than the
answers,'' columnist Matthew Parris wrote. ''It was humiliating
even to the viewer.''
	   In Germany, from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the man and woman in
the street, most people were outraged by what they saw as the
United States dragging its own leader through the mud.
	   ``I find the whole business extremely upsetting,'' Kohl told
reporters Monday. ``I can only repeat, in my blunt way of saying
it, that it makes me throw up.''
	   Germany's rail company ordered train stations to switch their
TVs away from the broadcast, so children waiting for trains
wouldn't hear the sordid details.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in New York at the United
Nations, called the broadcast an ``irresponsible excess.''
	   In Italy, Clinton's testimony was broadcast on two channels _
one private, one public _ with Italian voiceover.
	   ``Everything they're doing is ridiculous,'' said Andrea Amedeo,
19, a student in Rome. ``He's the leader of America and the world.
... Leave him in peace to worry about the real problems.''
	   In Hong Kong, where passers-by watched on a screen at a shopping
mall, Lisa Wong said she ``supposed most people would lie to keep
such an affair secret.''
	   In Lebanon, the private Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. appeared to
be the only station in the Middle East carrying the simultaneous
broadcast. In other countries, like Jordan, viewers could watch on
Cable News Network.
	   Many people were glued to television sets in Jordanian coffee
houses and at home.
	   ``I disapprove of broadcasting the tape because I think it is
purely an attack on the democrats and it will not serve any good
for the United States of America,'' said book publisher Usama
Sha'shaa, who was interviewed in the Jordanian capital, Amman.
	   In Lagos, Nigeria, civil engineer Ike Awokiora tuned into the
CNN broadcast.
	   ``It's pathetic,'' he said. ``The tape is disgusting and it is a
shame that the Congressmen opted to inflict such pain on people all
over the world by showing us this rubbish.''
	   Giorgos Dedemadis, a 42-year-old mathematics teacher, contrasted
the grilling of Clinton about Monica Lewinsky to the affair between
the late Premier Andreas Papandreou and a much younger woman, whom
he married in 1989.
	   ``They say the United States is a mature democracy and a serious
country and you have a spectacle like this,'' Dedemadis said. ``At
least in Greece we were sophisticated enough to separate a leader's
private and public lives. It's clear Clinton's political opponents
are just out to get him. It's sad.''
	   Swiss German Television showed the video on its second channel
for over an hour (until 1450gmt), with a voice-over by a
German-language interpreter.
	   The right-of-center watchdog Swiss Television and Radio
Association said, ``We cannot see what possible information the
Swiss public could get out of this broadcast beyond pure
voyeurism.''
	   In downtown Amsterdam, 45-year-old barkeep Ruud Knapp watched
from his post at the Cafe Kalkhover.
	   ``It's a soap, it's just about private sexual relationships,
it's crazy,'' he said. ``It's very sad for the man. It's
embarrassing. He's not strong anymore.''

Swiftly, court upholds Ben Johnson ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with comments from Johnson's lawyer; ADDS additional
background &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Ben Johnson remains an outsider in track and
field.
	   The star Canadian sprinter's hopes for one more comeback were
dimmed Monday when an appeals court refused to lift his lifetime
ban for steroid use.
	   The ruling was made so swiftly that Johnson appeared stunned.
Though 36, he still contends he could run world-class times if
allowed to compete again.
	   The decision comes practically on the 10-year anniversary of
Johnson's startling run at the Seoul Olympics when he was timed in
9.79 seconds in the 100 meters but was stripped of his gold medal
and world record.
	   Johnson was suspended for two years after testing positive for
steroids at the 1988 Seoul Games. The ban was imposed after a meet
in 1993, when Johnson tested positive a second time for steroids.
	   A three-judge panel of Ontario's appeals court rejected
Johnson's bid for reinstatement, ruling that a lower court was
correct last summer when it upheld the lifetime ban imposed by the
International Amateur Athletics Federation, track and field's
governing body.
	   The court heard from Johnson's lawyer, Gary Boyd, then ruled
without even seeking comment from lawyers representing the IAAF.
	   Johnson's agent and manager, Morris Chrobotek, has suggested
Johnson might try to take his case to Canada's Supreme Court if he
lost the appeal in Ontario. Neither of them had immediate comment
about Monday's decision, but Boyd spoke briefly to reporters.
	   ``Ben is disappointed and I'm disappointed at the outcome,''
Boyd said. ``At this point in time we are going to have to consider
what other options are open and decide where we're going to go from
here.''
	   Boyd argued that a four-year suspension plus a program of
regular drug testing would have been an acceptable alternative to a
lifetime ban.
	   Johnson trains almost full-time in hopes of becoming eligible to
race again. He says the ban is unfair because it prevents him from
working.
	   ``I'm a human being, allowed to make a living. This is my job,''
he said last week.
	   In 1987, Johnson set a world record time of 9.83 seconds and
then broke it at Seoul. He lost both records and the medal when he
tested positive for an anabolic steroid.
	   In 1993, Johnson tested positive for an abnormal level of
testosterone after a random test at a track meet in Montreal. At
the time, he was on a comeback from a two-year suspension after his
positive test at Seoul.
	   His return to sprinting had started at the 1991 Hamilton Indoor
Games, where he finished second in the 50 meters in 5.77 seconds.
It reached its peak when he raced in a semifinal of the 100 meters
at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, finishing last.
	   Athletics Canada, the ruling body for track and field in Canada,
assisted Johnson this year when he was seeking a hearing before the
IAAF.
	   But Hugh Wilson, director of athlete and coach development for
Athletics Canada, said the organization believes the lifetime ban
was proper.
	   ``Personally, people want Ben Johnson to have a good life and
make the most of the gifts that he has _ but not here in track and
field,'' Wilson said.
	   Johnson last week had been optimistic about his chances with the
appeals court and spoke of returning to world-class competition by
December or January at meets in Australia or South Africa.
	   He calculated he would need eight weeks of intense work to reach
peak form and said he could start his comeback with a 100-meter
time of around 10.10.
	   But he also sounded wistful about his past.
	   ``It kind of feels sad to think how fast I could have gone,'' he
said.

Daly cracking jokes about bout with alcoholism
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SCOTT SONNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RENO, Nevada (AP) _ John Daly boomed drives and cracked jokes
about his bout with alcoholism Monday at one of his first golf
exhibitions since he was overcome by the shakes and cried at a
tournament last month.
	   ``I'm doing real well,'' he said. Aside from his lousy golf
game, he joked, ``everything else is good in life.''
	   Daly, 32, shook so bad with chills from his ongoing battle to
stay sober that he began crying five weeks ago on the 15th hole of
the first round of the Greater Vancouver Open. He finished the
round and played the next day, missing the 36-hole cut.
	   But he appeared in good spirits Monday, trading barbs with Lee
Trevino, Tom Watson and Fuzzy Zoeller before they teed it up for a
best-ball competition at ArrowCreek Golf Club.
	   ``You all are talking about the senior tour. I just hope I'm
alive when I'm 50,'' Daly said, prompting laughter from the
contestants and an invitation-only gallery of several hundred.
	   Daly, who is set to join Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara on the
U.S. team at the 16-nation Dunhill Cup on Oct. 8, said fans have
showered him with cards and letters since the incident at
Vancouver.
	   ``There's been a lot of support,'' he said.
	   On Monday, the winner of two majors drank Diet Cokes and smoked
cigarettes as he joked about everything, including his past days of
drunkenness.
	   ``Are you guys going to hit balls all day or are we going to go
play golf?'' Daly shouted to the other three on the practice tee.
``You've got 200 years of golf between you, you'd think you'd have
it down by now.''
	   Master of Ceremonies Jack Sheehan asked Daly if he was healthy.
	   ``Well yeah, I'm healthy all right,'' Daly said.
	   Trevino said, ``I'd rather be sick with money, though.''
	   ``Hey, I am sick,'' Daly responded with a smile.
	   Known for his powerful, long drives, he acknowledged he got
violent and liked to break things in the days when alcohol was
getting the best of him.
	   ``Especially windows in cars. That was my fun stuff when I was
drinking. With my fists. When I was really mad and drunk, I used to
do that,'' he said. ``I haven't done that in a while.''
	   Daly, who won the PGA Championship in 1991 and the British Open
in 1995, said he played well early this year. But over his last six
tournaments he missed four cuts, withdrew once and was disqualified
once.
	   ``The putter just went,'' he said.
	   Daly teamed with Zoeller against Watson and Trevino in the
best-ball charity benefit at the course designed by Arnold Palmer
at the edge of the Sierra Nevada.
	   ``I don't know about next year,'' Daly said when asked about his
plans.
	   ``This year, the fun season starts. I like making that easy
cash, where you don't have to work for it,'' he said, referring to
the exhibitions and private tournaments where players receive
appearance fees.

Precede BALTIMORE
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; His streak over, Ripken is back to work &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ripken news conference; CHANGES byline &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ It was a short furlough for Cal Ripken.
	   A day after ending his astonishing streak of 2,632 consecutive
games, Ripken was back in the lineup for Baltimore on Monday
against Toronto, the same team he faced when the streak started on
May 30, 1982.
	   With time to contemplate his decision, Ripken was sure he made
the right move.
	   ``No regrets, no second thoughts,'' he said during a pregame
news conference at SkyDome. ``I felt great about how it went. It
was a great celebration instead of a sad event.''
	   He admitted feeling strange about watching a game from the
dugout, and sounded relieved to be returning to the field.
	   ``I still consider myself an everyday player,'' he said. ``I
have a lot of baseball left in me.''
	   Ripken closed his record run Sunday night, removing himself from
the starting lineup in the Orioles' final home game of the season
against the Yankees.
	   The move came more than three years after he broke 2,130-game
streak of Yankee iron man Lou Gehrig _ a record that had stood for
56 years.
	   ``The streak was born out of a desire to play and a lot of
managers wanting to put me in the lineup,'' Ripken said in
Baltimore. ``It's your job to come to the ballpark and be available
if the manager wants to put you in there you play. I feel very
proud, not necessarily with the numbers the streak is, but very
proud that my teammates and my manager could count on me.''
	   Now that he's finally taken a day off, the next question is: Can
anyone ever come close to duplicating his record run?
	   ``You wouldn't think so,'' said the Yankees' Joe Girardi.
``That's a lot of years to go so long without being injured. I
don't see that record ever being broken.''
	   Ripken isn't so sure.
	   ``If I did it someone else can do it. I don't see myself as
superhuman,'' he said after watching an Orioles' game from the
dugout for the first time since May 29, 1982.
	   There's no telling how long Ripken could have gone. Gehrig's
streak ended when he could no longer cope with a rare muscular
disorder that later became known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
	   Ripken was completely healthy. He just got tired of the
controversy surrounding the streak _ more than one columnist called
him selfish _ and decided that spring training in 1999 might be
more fun if he didn't have to talk about playing another full
season.
	   So, without tipping any of his teammates except Brady Anderson,
his best friend on the Orioles, Ripken walked into manager Ray
Miller's office a half-hour before the game and asked to have his
name removed from the starting lineup.
	   ``I was shocked,'' teammate Roberto Alomar said. ``I didn't
expect the record to end that way. But there was a lot of criticism
of him and I think that's why he ended it. That's sad, because
people don't know his work ethic.''
	   Anderson knew well in advance that Ripken would be watching
Sunday's game instead of playing in it. He tried to talk Ripken out
of it, but quickly realized his effort would be futile.
	   ``It's so much easier for me to want to keep the streak alive
because I'm not the one who has to do it,'' Anderson said.
``Playing every game in one season is tough enough.''
	   For Ripken, sitting out that one game proved to be the most
difficult thing he had done since breaking into the league in 1981.
For one thing, he had no idea what to do to keep himself occupied.
	   Ripken fidgeted on the bench before getting a call from reliever
Alan Mills.
	   ``He goes, `What are you doing?' And I said, `I'm going to sit
here and watch a ball game,''' Ripken said. ``I said, `You want me
to come out there and visit with you?'''
	   Ripken did just that. He talked with the fans and posed for
pictures between innings, but afterward he made it clear that most
of his days next season will be spent playing third base _ from the
first inning through the ninth.

New Guinea trying to mirror U.N. principles with peace accord
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Wracked by multiple natural disasters in
the past year, Papua New Guinea is trying to stay afloat in the
turmoil of the global economic crisis, the country's prime minister
told the General Assembly on Monday.
	   ``My government has had to address those multiple challenges
while dealing with natural disasters and carrying out a
comprehensive program of structural adjustment,'' Bill Skate said
in a speech that also touched on efforts by the Pacific island to
mirror the principles of the United Nations _ peacekeeping,
decolonization and human rights and the environment.
	   In July, giant waves swept away four villages on Papua New
Guinea's northern coast, killing at least 2,000 people.
	   Skate thanked neighboring countries and the United Nations for
their role in helping the island reach an accord with rebel leaders
on the island of Bougainville in early May. Since 1988, fighting
there has killed up to 20,000 people and driven 40,000 from their
homes.
	   ``The Bougainville peace process has shown in a practical and
constructive manner how people can seek reconciliation and
forgiveness,'' Skate said.
	   Bougainville, a copper-rich island of 200,000 people is the
largest of the Solomon Islands archipelago but politically a part
of Papua New Guinea.
	   Skate also said his government plans to ratify the Kyoto accord
on global warming and supports expansion of the 15-member Security
Council.
	   ``An effective Security Council should be a size and composition
which matches the enhanced role that the world expects it to play
in coordinating global approaches and actions directed to deal with
the issues we will face in the 21st century,'' he said.

Japan wants to regain role of regional financial leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Japan hopes to regain its role as
financial leader in Southeast Asia by channeling about dlrs 43
billion to help out its neighbors' shaky economies, the Japanese
prime minister said Monday.
	   The sum _ primarily in loans and some grants _ is the largest
single contribution of any nation in the world, Keizo Obuchi told
the U.N. General Assembly on Monday. The amount includes money
already distributed, such as the dlrs 10 billion bailout of
Indonesia.
	   The Asian economic crisis _ prolonged partly by recession in
Japan _ has also undermined its position as an economic financial
leader in the region.
	   ``Japan is making every effort possible, through such measures
as stabilizing our financial system, to put our own economy on a
recovery track within the next year or two,'' Obuchi said. ``We
believe that early recovery of our own economy is the best
contribution we can make to the economies of Asia and the world.''
	   Japan also is playing its part in trying to resolve ethnic and
religious conflicts around the world, Obuchi said.
	   ``Japan is actively promoting what we call Eurasian diplomacy,''
he said. ``This means redefining relations with countries of the
Eurasian continent, including the Russian Federation, the People's
Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and countries in the Silk
Road regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus range.
	   ``This is another example of Japan's policy of promoting both
peace and development in tandem,'' he said.
	   It is more important to focus on how to prevent conflicts rather
than on how to solve them once they break out, he said.
	   This is particular applicable to the nuclear test by neighboring
rivals India and Pakistan, said Obuchi, who urged all countries who
have not done so to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
	   In his speech, Obuchi also touched on North Korea's Aug. 31
rocket launch that flew over Japan during a failed attempt to put a
satellite into orbit. U.S. officials say it was just the latest
example of North Korea's aggressive program to develop a long-range
ballistic missile.
	   ``Even if it was an attempt to launch a satellite into orbit,
(it) poses a serious problem, which directly concerns both Japan's
national security and peace and stability in Northeast Asia,''
Obuchi said.

For QBs, learning on the job is rough work

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Ryan Leaf's line in Kansas City was almost
impossible to believe: 15 passes, 1 completion, 4 yards.
	   In fact, he had more turnovers (5) than yards.
	   Yes, on-the-job training for National Football League
quarterbacks can be embarrassing. But in a league where there
aren't enough capable quarterbacks, what other way to teach a
rookie?
	   ``I'm going to play 'til I'm 50,'' said 36-year-old Bubby
Brister, who relieved John Elway on Sunday and helped Denver to a
34-17 win in Oakland. ``There are certainly enough jobs for
experienced, old guys.
	   The problems for the young guys were evident Sunday for three
rookies _ Leaf, Peyton Manning of the Colts and Charlie Batch of
the Lions. Leaf and Manning were making their third NFL starts and
Batch his first.
	   But they were equally evident for some second-year starters _
Kordell Stewart of the Steelers, Bobby Hoying of the Eagles and
Jake Plummer of the Cardinals.
	   The Cardinals and Eagles struggled through three quarters at
0-0. That was the first scoreless three quarters in the NFL since
1987 in a strike-replacement contest between the Giants and Bills
that can hardly be considered major league football.
	   All this demonstrates is how hard it is for quarterbacks to step
right in.
	   The only instant success in the past two decades is Dan Marino,
who became Miami's starter late in his rookie season of 1983 and in
his second season set a passel of records, including 48 TD passes.
But he had the benefit of joining a team that had been to the Super
Bowl the previous season, unusual for a first-round quarterback.
	   But John Elway had problems, so did Terry Bradshaw, who at
various times lost his job to Terry Hanratty and Joe Gilliam. And
Brett Favre was so little thought of by Atlanta, which drafted him
in the second round in 1991 that he was traded to Green Bay after
the season. Even Roger Staubach, who came out of the Navy in his
late 20s, began his career as a backup to Craig Morton.
	   Some stats:
	   _Of the 30 first-string quarterbacks in the NFL, six are in
their first year as a starter, five more are in their second and
two more in their third. Thirteen essentially are undergoing
on-the-job training.
	   _Of the rest, five have more than 10 seasons in the league _
Marino, 37; Elway, 38; Warren Moon, 41; Steve Young, 36; and
Randall Cunningham 34.
	   _ Of the remaining dozen, only Drew Bledsoe, Mark Brunell, Jeff
George, Jim Harbaugh, Troy Aikman, Brad Johnson, Elvis Grbac and
Favre are first-rate starters in their prime. And with Harbaugh,
Johnson and Aikman hurt, the talent pool is reduced even more.
	   The backups?
	   Brister, 44-year-old Steve DeBerg and a few decent (or at least
experienced) quarterbacks _ Cunningham, filling in for Johnson;
Rich Gannon, Grbac's backup; the Eagles' Rodney Peete; the 49ers'
Ty Detmer; he Ravens' Eric Zeier; the Oilers' 40-year-old Dave
Krieg; the Jets' Vinny Testaverde; Doug Flutie, the Canadian
refugee in Buffalo; and maybe Kent Graham of the Giants, one of the
most sought-after free-agent quarterbacks this year, even though he
was a backup.
	   Then there are busted starters _ Dave Brown of Arizona, Scott
Mitchell of Detroit, Gus Frerotte of Washington.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Watching Bill Clinton in the videotaped deposition
on TV in a west London pub on Monday, Tony Charlesworth said he
already knew more than he wanted to know about the U.S. president's
sex life.
	   ``I don't need to be seeing this,'' said Charlesworth, a
31-year-old London businessman. ``They should only show it to
people who need to see it. They're just humiliating him.''
	   From Johannesburg to Jordan and beyond, many who watched
Clinton's televised grilling by special counsel lawyers seemed to
share a similar opinion. Some viewers said they felt sorry for
Clinton. Many agreed the tape never should have been made public.
	   But in Kuwait, former oil minister Ali al-Baghli called it a
historic day.
	   ``The head of the most important country is accounting for
breaking the law, just like any ordinary person. I hope this will
be a lesson to us in the Third World,'' said al-Baghli.
	   Maher bin Naji, a 39-year-old Kuwaiti banker, agreed that airing
the testimony was ``democracy at its peak,'' but said, ``The poor
guy did not do anything. It's his private life and he should not
resign.''
	   Early editions of some British newspapers on Tuesday gave mixed
reactions.
	   Rupert Murdoch's The Sun, a British tabloid, led its front page
with the headline, ``Greatest Humiliation in American History.''
	   But The Times, another Murdoch owned paper in Britain, ran a
front-page column by a former Conservative lawmaker that
sympathized with Clinton.
	   ``This was medieval. It was cruel. This was like bear-baiting,
witch-ducking ... The questions were more offensive than the
answers,'' columnist Matthew Parris wrote. ``It was humiliating
even to the viewer.''
	   In Germany, from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to the man and woman in
the street, most people were outraged by what they saw as the
United States dragging its own leader through the mud.
	   ``I find the whole business extremely upsetting,'' Kohl told
reporters Monday. ``I can only repeat, in my blunt way of saying
it, that it makes me throw up.''
	   Germany's rail company ordered train stations to switch their
TVs away from the broadcast, so children waiting for trains
wouldn't hear the sordid details.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, in New York at the United
Nations, called the broadcast an ``irresponsible excess.''
	   In Italy, Clinton's testimony was broadcast on two channels _
one private, one public _ with Italian voiceover.
	   ``Everything they're doing is ridiculous,'' said Andrea Amedeo,
19, a student in Rome. ``He's the leader of America and the world.
... Leave him in peace to worry about the real problems.''
	   In Hong Kong, where passers-by watched on a screen at a shopping
mall, Lisa Wong said she ``supposed most people would lie to keep
such an affair secret.''
	   In Lebanon, the private Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. appeared to
be the only station in the Middle East carrying the simultaneous
broadcast. In other countries, like Jordan, viewers could watch on
Cable News Network.
	   Many people were glued to television sets in Jordanian coffee
houses and at home.
	   ``I disapprove of broadcasting the tape because I think it is
purely an attack on the democrats and it will not serve any good
for the United States of America,'' said book publisher Usama
Sha'shaa, who was interviewed in the Jordanian capital, Amman.
	   American troops serving in Bosnia had the chance to watch the
testimony on a big screen TV set up on base _ but most of them
didn't.
	   Of about 1,300 troops posted at Eagle Base, 20 kilometers (12
miles) southwest of Tuzla, only 20 were in the recreation room to
watch their commander in chief on TV.
	   Some of soldiers said the issue created out of Kenneth Starr's
investigation looked unreal from the distance of Bosnia. Others
said that as ambassadors of the United States, the problems back
home made them feel uncomfortable. They were divided over whether
the president should step down.

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders opened the first day of the
General Assembly's annual debate Monday by urging an international
effort to rein in the Asian financial crisis before it brings down
more economies and calling for a comprehensive attack on terrorism.
	   British Prime Minister Tony Blair offered to host a high-level
conference in London this fall _ aimed at eliminating opportunities
for terrorists to raise money.
	   ``Effective new measures, on an agreed international basis,
could make a real difference,'' Blair said.
	   Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, called for a universal
dialogue to promote peace and end violence, including terrorism. He
suggested the United Nations designate 2001 the ``Year of Dialogue
Among Civilizations.''
	   Brazil's foreign minister launched the 53rd session by warning
that a few countries alone cannot bail out nations suffering from
the effects of the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``Experience teaches us that inaction can have a high cost,''
Luiz Felipe Lampreia told world leaders gathered for the first day
of the two-week speech-making forum.
	   ``The world cannot depend only on the willingness, capacity and
interest of a select number of countries to mobilize and lead
international efforts in this or that direction.''
	   In recent weeks, Brazil's stock and currency markets have been
battered by the Asian economic crisis that has seen investors
fleeing Asia, Russia and other developing markets. The collapse of
the Indonesian currency last year sparked the crisis.
	   Japan is hoping to regain its role as financial leader in the
region by implementing ``measures of support'' totalling about dlrs
43 billion _ most of it in loans _ to its neighbors, the Japanese
prime minister said Monday.
	   ``Japan is making every effort possible, through such measures
as stabilizing our financial system, to put our own economy on a
recovery track within the next year or two,'' Keizo Obuchi said.
``We believe that early recovery of our own economy is the best
contribution we can make to the economies of Asia and the world.''
	   Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, urged the creation
of a ``lender of last resort,'' to meet the needs of the volatile
markets because existing financial institutions couldn't handle all
the problems.
	   President Bill Clinton pledged the United States would do more
to minimize the turmoil. But he focused his address on the fight
against terrorism _ evidenced Monday in the unprecedented security
that greeted world leaders and will remain in place for the next
two weeks.
	   ``Because we are blessed to be a wealthy nation with a powerful
military and a worldwide presence active in promoting peace and
security, we are often a target,'' Clinton said, referring to the
Aug. 7 dual bombings on U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es
Salaam, Tanzania.
	   ``No one in this room, nor the people you represent, are
immune,'' Clinton said.
	   Kumaratunga decried what she said was the terrorism that has
wracked Sri Lanka for 15 years and killed an estimated 54,000
people.
	   ``A particularly cruel offense against the innocence of children
is their forced recruitment by a terrorist group in Sri Lanka to
serve as suicide killers in the name of a cause they are too young
to even comprehend,'' she said.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela focused on human rights
abuses that afflict millions of people around the world _
particularly in Africa, where regional conflicts in Sudan, Congo
and Angola threaten to spill over.
	   ``The very right to be human is denied every day to hundreds of
millions of people,'' held hostage by conflict, nuclear terror and
brutal regimes, he told the audience in what was expected to be his
last speech at the assembly.
	   ``Many are still unable to participate in the determination of
the destiny of their family and to protect themselves from
tyranny,'' said Mandela, whose own country freed itself from the
oppression of apartheid only four years ago.
	   Khatami, whose speech marked the first time an Iranian president
has spoken before the General Assembly in 12 years, also spoke of
tyranny, referring to the current conflict with Afghanistan's
Taliban militia over the deaths of eight Iranian diplomats and a
journalist last month.
	   ``Afghanistan, the land of people of dignity and culture, has
now been turned into a haven for violence, terrorism and production
and trafficking in narcotics,'' said Khatami, whose Islamic
government has accused the Taliban of giving the faith a bad name.
	   ``The Afghan people, as other peoples in the world, have the
inalienable right to determine their own destiny,'' said Khatami.
	   The Taliban are mostly Sunni Muslims, while Iranians are
predominently Shiite.

Iran's Khatami denounces U.S. world dominance, Afghanistan's

Taliban &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with US expressing regret over deaths of Iranian
diplomats, anti-Iranian protests &QL;

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iran's President Mohammad Khatami said
Monday that his country wanted good relations with the outside
world, but denounced ``the fantasy of a unipolar world'' dominated
by the United States.
	   ``The fantasy of a unipolar world ruled by a single superpower
is but an illusion,'' said Khatami, the first Iranian leader to
address the U.N. General Assembly in 12 years.
	   Iran has no diplomatic relations with the United States but
Khatami has sought to tone down nearly two decades of hostility
with the country sometimes known in Iran as ``the Great Satan.''
	   In the highest level contact between the two nations in two
decades, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Iran's deputy
foreign minister sat in on a meeting over Afghanistan, but the two
did not discuss their own relations.
	   Khatami, wearing the flowing black robe and turban of a senior
Shiite cleric, blasted the Taliban militia that rules most of
neighboring Afghanistan, and with which his country faces a
military stand-off.
	   ``Afghanistan, the land of people of dignity and culture, has
now been turned into a haven for violence, terrorism and production
and trafficking in narcotics,'' said Khatami, whose Islamic
government has accused the Taliban of giving the faith a bad name
with policies that restrict women's rights.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have risen since the
Taliban overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan
on Aug. 8 and killed several Iranian diplomats posted there.
	   Iran has since deployed about 200,000 troops on its border with
Afghanistan, amid growing demands for vengeance by mobs of Iranian
demonstrators.
	   At the meeting over Afghanistan, Albright expressed U.S. regret
over the deaths of the Iranian diplomats, and called for the
punishment of those involved in the killings, State Department
Spokesman James Rubin said.
	   Khatami met earlier Monday with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of
Pakistan, whose country is the main backer of the Taliban.
	   Khatami also denied U.S. charges that Iran is a sponsor of
international terrorism and is trying to acquire weapons of mass
destruction.
	   ``Eradication of terrorism must be concurrent with a global
search for justice. This assertion should in no way be interpreted
as a justification for any form of terrorism,'' said Khatami.
	   ``At the threshold of the third millennium, the world also needs
to be liberated from the nightmare of nuclear war and weapons of
mass destruction,'' he said.
	   His speech was disrupted by by an Iranian woman who shouted out
``Khatami is a murderer,'' before being whisked away by U.N.
security.
	   The woman, Laila Jazayeri, 37, entered the United Nations on a
valid U.N. pass for international organizations, U.N. officials
said. They wouldn't name the organization but said the woman was
based in London, U.N. officials said, speaking on condition they
not be identified.
	   Outside the U.N. building, two Iranian exile groups staged
protests timed to coincide with Khatami's speech.
	   The theme of both protests was that Khatami, who was widely
hailed as a moderate when he became president in August last year,
has proved as uncompromising and brutal toward dissenters as the
mullahs who ran Iran before him.
	   In his speech, Khatami also called for reform at the United
Nations, saying that the veto power exercised by the five permanent
members of the Security Council should be abolished.
	   Khatami, a moderate whose landslide election in May 1997 was
largely due to the votes of women and young Iranians, said that
``the traditional outlook, based on the erroneous notion of
superiority of men over women, does injustice to men, women and
humanity as a whole.''

Brazil creates nine new nature reserves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on
Monday signed a measure creating nine new nature reserves covering
4.6 million acres (1.87 million hectares) around the country to
commemorate Brazil's ``Day of the Tree.''
	   With newly created reserves, Brazil now has 44 national parks
covering some 5 percent of Brazilian territory is protected in
nature reserves.
	   Since 1994, when Cardoso took office, the number of protected
areas has increased by 29 percent, government officials said. Prior
to 1994, Brazil had only 19 national parks.
	   The new reserves are in the states of Amazonas, Para, Acre,
Piaui, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Goias, Tocantins and Bahia.
	   ``The most important thing is a lot of the new reserves are
outside of the Amazon, where we already have a lot of large
parks,'' Eduardo Martins, president of Brazil's Environmental
Protection Agency was quoted by the newsweekly Veja.

Norway intends to further its role in peace, development aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Norway wants to become a leader of peace
by pledging dlrs 2 million to establishing a fund to combat
proliferation and illegal use of small arms, the foreign minister
said Monday.
	   ``In recent years, it has become evident that small arms are a
formidable barrier to ending violent conflicts and consolidating
peace, political stability and reconstruction of war-torn
societies,'' Knut Vollebaek told the U.N. General Assembly's
opening session.
	   He also emphasized Norway's intention to become a leader in U.N.
donations to aid development in other countries.
	   Besides being home to the Nobel peace prize, Norway has played a
role in a number of other historic peace efforts. It hosted a
meeting that eventually led to the recent ratification by 40
countries of the treaty to ban anti-personnel land mines.
	   Its capital, Oslo, also was the setting of a 1993 accord aimed
at setting Palestinians on the road to eventual autonomy and
helping Israel extricate itself from an endless cycle of hatred and
violence in the Palestinian territories it ruled.
	   But the Middle East peace process is in serious difficulty,
Bollebaek said.
	   With no possibility to renege on the settlement, ``We therefore
urge the parties to do their utmost to build confidence and
cooperation and to refrain from all unilateral measures and actions
designed to preempt the outcome of the final status negotiations,''
he said.
	   Like a majority of countries, ``Norway is gravely concerned by
the recent underground nuclear tests by India and Pakistan,'' said
Vollebaek, who also called on all countries to sign treaties aimed
at stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the testing of
nuclear weapons and devices.
	   Norway, a country of 4.4 million people, is the world's
second-largest oil exporter. But despite its wealth, it too is
feeling the effects of the Asian economic crisis as faith in the
economy is being shaken by low oil prices and the danger of
economic overheating.
	   ``The current world economic crisis clearly illustrates that we
are all part of a single global economy,'' Vollebaek said. ``It
also illustrates that we are far from fully understanding the
powerful forces of globalization, and even further from being able
to adequately manage them.''
	   But the financial crisis should not prompt countries to decrease
official development aid to the United Nations _ an action also
known as ``donor fatigue.''
	   ``Norway ... is actively seeking to counter the growing donor
fatigue and intends to further increase its ... assistance in the
years ahead,'' he said.

	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ A pregnant 10-year-old rape victim in a
small town in central Brazil has been authorized to have an
abortion, but the local parish priest is trying to convince her and
her family to keep the child, press reports said Monday.
	   The, four-month pregnant girl who was not identified because she
is a minor, was repeatedly raped since the age of seven by two
neighbors, the O Globo newspaper reported. Aged 65 and 52, the two
men are under arrest.
	   The girl lives with her parents in Israelandia, a rural town of
about 3,000 in the state of Goias, about 200 kilometers (124 miles)
west of Brasilia.
	   Basing himself on a law that allows abortion in cases of rape or
to save a woman's life, Israelandia's judge, Joao Geraldo Machado
authorized the minor to interrupt her pregnancy.
	   The girl's parents have said they want their daughter to go
through with the abortion, but will change their minds if doctors
tell them such a move would endanger her life, O Globo said.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Military chiefs from four Central
American nations gathered Monday in Honduras for the start of their
annual discussion of national defense.
	   Attending the two-day session were: Gen. Marco Espinoza
Contreras of Guatemala; Gen. Juan Antonio Martinez Varela of El
Salvador; Gen. Javier Carrion of Nicaragua; and Gen. Roberto
Lazarus of Honduras.
	   The generals make up the Executive Committee of the Central
American Armed Forces Conference, which was created last year to
strengthen regional democracy and promote cooperation between the
militaries.
	   The conference replaced the Central American Defense Council
which had been virtually inactive since 1969 due to a 100-hour war
between El Salvador and Honduras.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The Popocaptepetl volcano southeast of Mexico
City spewed out ash and steam early Monday in a series of
``moderate intensity'' exhalations, the National Center for
Disaster Prevention reported.
	   The center recorded five releases between 12:17 a.m. and 6:51
a.m. local time, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   The 18,000-foot (5,500-meter) volcano, the name of which means
``Smoking Mountain'' in the Aztec Indian language, sent up a plume
of steam and gas but thick clouds blocked the view, the report
said.
	   A yellow alert signaling caution remained in effect and
authorities warned people against venturing within 2 1-2 miles (4
kilometers) of the crater.
	   The volcano, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of
downtown Mexico City, has been sputtering intermittently since
1994.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexican police seized more than 4 1-2 tons of
marijuana in two northbound trucks during separate operations in
Baja California and Zacatecas states.
	   Federal police discovered more than 2 tons (1.8 metric tons) of
the drug Monday in a truck carrying dry wall through Zacatecas, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
	   Officers arrested driver Roberto Diaz Garcia, who said he was
carrying the shipment from Mexico City to Ciudad Juarez, a border
city across from El Paso, Texas.
	   On Sunday, police confiscated more than 2 1-2 tons (2.3 metric
tons) of marijuana in a cargo truck in the U.S.-Mexico border city
of Mexicali.
	   Police arrested driver Sosimo Beltran, who had been traveling
from the Sinaloa state capital of Culiacan.

	   The government's Federal Savings Account bank said the winner,
whose identity was kept secret, placed the winning bet in
Uberlandia, a city in Brazil's southeastern farm belt 550 miles
(900 kms) northwest of Rio.
	   The bank said the winner marked one simple lottery card and
picked the winning numbers: 5, 6, 19, 34, 39 and 57.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Congress laid before a wary nation Monday the
raw footage of President Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony and
3,183 pages of evidence chronicling his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky in explicit detail. ``It's an embarrassing and personally
painful thing,'' Clinton told the grand jurors. The videotape of
Clinton's testimony began playing unedited on television sets
across America early Monday morning. The tape portrayed Clinton as
sometimes angry at prosecutors' questions and other times
expressing bitterness at how the Paula Jones lawsuit precipitated
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's criminal investigation of the
Lewinsky matter. (US-CLINTON-LEWINSKY)
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ World leaders opened the first day of the
General Assembly's annual debate Monday by urging an international
effort to rein in the Asian financial crisis before it brings down
more economies and calling for a comprehensive attack on terrorism.
British Prime Minister Tony Blair offered to host a high-level
conference in London this fall _ aimed at eliminating opportunities
for terrorists to raise money. Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami,
called for a universal dialogue to promote peace and end violence,
including terrorism. He suggested the United Nations designate 2001
the ``Year of Dialogue Among Civilizations.'' Brazil's foreign
minister launched the 53rd session by warning that a few countries
alone cannot bail out nations suffering from the effects of the
Asian financial crisis. (UN-ASSEMBLY ROUNDUP)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Thousands of supporters of
Malaysia's ousted deputy premier clashed Monday with police trying
to end two weeks of protest _ the biggest outpouring of dissent
during Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule. After calling on army
reservists and riot police to quell the unrest that reflected a
pitched battle for power in this Muslim nation, Prime Minister
Mahathir joined Queen Elizabeth II at the finale of the
Commonwealth Games. The arrest of former Deputy Prime Minister
Anwar Ibrahim added a volatile element to Malaysia's political and
economic troubles. Anwar, tossed out of the government earlier this
month, was expected to face charges of sexual misconduct and
disturbing the public order. He has vehemently denied the charges,
saying they were cooked up by Mahathir. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ His T-shirt stained with blood and his
wounded 22-year-old son shaking beside him in the lobby of the
embattled U.S. Embassy, former Liberian warlord Roosevelt Johnson
knew Monday that it was time to be afraid. ``I don't know how we're
going to get out of here,'' said Johnson, the chief rival of
President Charles Taylor, nervously glancing around the room that
has suddenly become his refuge. A few steps behind Johnson,
shielded by thick panes of bullet-proof glass, American soldiers in
full battle gear, assault weapons at the ready, patrolled the
embassy's hallways, stepping past supplies piled in the corridors.
The American embassy, which repeatedly found itself the only safe
haven in Liberia's capital during this West African country's
brutal 7-year civil war, has suddenly found itself again in the
middle. Johnson fled to the embassy over the weekend to escape
arrest in a city tense after battles between his supporters and the
government. (LIBERIA)
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Thousands fled Hurricane Georges
for the safety of shelters in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands Monday, as the 110-mph (180-kph) storm cut a swath through
the northeast Caribbean. Packing howling winds and 20-foot
(6-meter) seas, the hurricane toppled power lines, mangled trees
and blew away roofs as families huddled in shelters in St. Kitts,
Antigua and other islands earlier Monday. Although there were no
serious injuries reported by midday, Georges remained a terror
because of its strength and fears it would hit densely populated
areas directly. (CARIBBEAN-HURRICANE)

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Stocks closed higher Monday after taking in
stride the release of President Bill Clinton's videotaped grand
jury testimony and the potentially much more serious collapse of a
bank rescue deal in Japan. The Dow Jones industrial average rose
37.59 points _ or by 0.5 percent _ at 7,933.25, after bailing out
of a 184-point loss posted in the first 30 minutes of trading.
(US-CLOSING STOCKS, WORLD STOCK MARKETS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has printed almost 1 billion rubles (dlrs
61 million) in a bid to prevent the collapse of commercial banks,
the Central Bank said Monday, playing down concerns the move would
fuel inflation. The announcement came while President Boris Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov met to complete Cabinet
selections and work on a strategy to jump-start the moribund
economy. The financial crisis has caused a backlog of bank payments
totaling more than 30 billion rubles (dlrs 1.9 billion), Andrei
Kozlov, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank, told a news
conference Monday. The bank launched an emergency rescue plan on
Friday to help settle 10 billion rubles (dlrs 613 million) of the
payments, Kozlov said. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   LONDON (AP) _ The airline business will get a second super
alliance of carriers _ after American Airlines and British Airways
teamed up Monday with three partners, saying they will be able to
fly virtually anywhere in the world. The alliance also includes
Canadian Airlines, Australia's Qantas and Hong Kong's Cathay
Pacific Airways _ and they hope to expand soon with partners from
continental Europe and Japan. The airlines say their venture,
called ``oneworld,'' will be a tough competitor to the Star
Alliance put together by United Airlines and Germany's Lufthansa _
but one rival warns that passengers may end up paying too much as
competition dries up on some routes. (BRITAIN-AIRLINES)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union's finance
commissioner said Monday he expects the EU to be the strongest
growing region in the world next year, despite risks posed by the
Russian and Asian crises. Speaking before the monetary subcommittee
of the European Parliament, Yves-Thibault de Silguy reiterated the
EU commission's most recent economic forecasts pegging EU-wide
growth at 2.8 percent this year. De Silguy added that growth should
remain at a ``well supported'' level in 1999, but he declined to
indicate if the commission would revise its 3 percent 1999 growth
estimate when it publishes updated forecasts next month.
(EU-ECONOMY)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Recent global economic turmoil highlights a need
to reform the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair said Monday. ``The current crisis
illustrates the weaknesses of the existing international financial
system,'' Blair said in a speech to about 20 business leaders at
the New York Stock Exchange. ``It needs to be modernized to meet
the challenges of a new century.'' The prime minister said it was a
good time to overhaul the entire global economic system _ making
finance more open to lessen lending risks. The IMF lent dlrs 25
billion over the last year as the Asian economic crisis unfolded _
and it now urgently needs more money, he said. (BLAIR-GLOBAL
FINANCE)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Global capital markets could face more
turbulence if Japan does not quickly solve its pressing economic
problems and financial difficulties in Asia and Latin America get
worse, the International Monetary Fund said Monday. The IMF also
said in its annual report on capital markets that while the United
States and Europe have not been affected by these crises, there
were risks of an economic downturn, particularly if stock prices
declined sharply. The report focuses mainly on the effects of the
Asian crisis, which began last July. It does not deal with the
economic meltdown in Russia last month and the financial shocks
Brazil and other Latin American countries have experienced in
recent weeks. (IMF-MARKET TURBULENCE)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Associated Press announced Monday it has
completed the acquisition of Worldwide Television News from ABC
News and will combine it and the existing APTV service into a new
global video news agency, Associated Press Television News. APTN
will provide fast and reliable coverage of the day's top stories to
nearly 350 television news customers around the globe, making it
the world's leading video news agency. APTN will have dedicated
newsgathering resources in 83 news bureaus operating in 67
countries, which will be supplemented and supported by news
gathering in 154 other AP bureaus and news supply agreements with
more than 350 television news organizations. (AP-WTN)

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic insisted tens of thousands of ethnic Albanian refugees in
Serbia's troubled Kosovo province have received care and shelter,
hoping to avert possible NATO intervention.
	   In a statement released by his office Monday following talks in
Belgrade with U.S. envoy for Kosovo Christopher Hill, Milosevic
denied reports that some 275,000 displaced people in Kosovo face
hunger and disease.
	   ``The term 'humanitarian catastrophe' which we have been hearing
during the past weeks is not based on reality,'' the statement
said. Hill made no comments after the meeting.
	   NATO has readied plans for possible military intervention in an
attempt to prevent a humanitarian disaster and end the crackdown
Serbs launched in February against separatist Albanians in Kosovo,
a province in Serbia, the dominant republic in present Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic also met Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
Afanasyevsky. In a statement issued from his office afterwards, the
Yugoslav president declared the Kosovo Albanian ``terrorists'' have
been defeated.
	   ``Yugoslavia has been faced with unprecedented threats only
because it defends its sovereignty,'' the statement said.
	   German Defense Minister Volker Ruehe is pushing for NATO
intervention in the Serb-controlled province.
	   In Bonn Monday, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl reiterated support
for the possibility of sending German troops and other
international forces to quell violence in Kosovo, casting doubt on
whether his challenger in Sunday's national election, Gerhard
Schroeder, would support NATO intervention in the Serb-controlled
province.
	   At the opening of the U.N. General Assembly in New York Monday,
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel met his Chinese counterpart
Tang Jiaxuan, urging him to support a U.N. Security Council
resolution authorizing NATO intervention Kosovo.
	   China considers the crisis in Kosovo an internal matter in which
the 15-member U.N. Security Council should not become involved. As
a permanent council member, China could veto any resolution.
	   Also on Monday, officials in Serbia and Montenegro rejected an
ethnic Albanian proposal for Kosovo that envisages Kosovo as
``temporarily part of Yugoslavia, as an independent entity equal to
the other two republics in the federation.''
	   Miodrag Vukovic, an adviser to the president of Montenegro, told
Dnevni Telegraf daily territorial autonomy for Kosovo that would
change borders and position of Serbia in Yugoslavia is ``out of the
question.''
	   A vice president in the Serbian government, Vojislav Seselj,
said ``Kosovo must remain in Serbia'' and could only be granted
``territorial autonomy'' within Serbia.
	   Last week, Koha Ditore carried a formula suggested by the United
States which would grant the province a high level of self-rule but
leaving it within Serbia. Pacifist Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova
has backed the plan, saying it was a good basis for the talks.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Rudolf Nureyev, the Russian ballet star who
defected to the West during the height of the Cold War, has been
posthumously rehabilitated.
	   Nureyev, a star of Leningrad's Kirov ballet theater, was granted
political asylum in France in 1961. A year later, in the Soviet
Union, he was convicted in absentia of high treason and sentenced
to seven years in prison.
	   Nureyev died of AIDS in 1993 at 54.
	   Alexander Zvyagintsev, a senior official in the Prosecutor
General's office, was quoted Monday by the ITAR-Tass news agency as
saying that Nureyev had been forgiven under the law on the
rehabilitation of ``victims of political repressions.''
	   Zvyagintsev said a review of Nureyev's case found no evidence of
high treason.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The Duchess of York flew Monday
to the Argentine ranch of her late mother Susan Barrantes, mourning
her death in a weekend car crash.
	   Looking weary in a black dress, the former Sarah Ferguson
arrived by overnight flight from Britain and said nothing to
reporters before traveling on to her mother's country estate
outside Buenos Aires.
	   British Ambassador William Mardens met the duchess at the
capital airport early Monday before she flew on by private plane to
El Pucara, near the town of Tres Lomas, 310 miles (500 kilometers)
southwest of Buenos Aires.
	   Police said Mrs. Barrantes, 61, was killed instantly Saturday
night when the Rover she was driving collided with van near Tres
Lomas, while returning to the ranch on the pampas where she raised
polo ponies.
	   The duchess, or ``Fergie,'' ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth II's
second son, Prince Andrew, heard the news early Sunday while on
vacation in Italy.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Bush believes the institution of the
presidency remains strong despite the White House sex scandal.
	   In an interview with Newsweek, the former president refused to
discuss the scandal that threatens to bring down President Bill
Clinton. He referred to it only as ``current events.''
	   But Bush told Newsweek he believes the institution of the
presidency will emerge intact.
	   ``When (former President Jimmy) Carter left office, Lloyd Cutler
wrote an article saying maybe the (presidency) had become too big
for any individual to cope,'' he said. ``(Former President Ronald)
Reagan came in ... and made very clear that he could cope.''
	   Bush is calling attention to his own legacy, having written a
new book, ``A World Transformed,'' with his former national
security adviser, Brent Scowcroft. The book chronicles how Bush
handled the end of the Cold War.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ John Glenn's name will adorn a new
institute at Ohio State University aimed at getting young people
involved in public service.
	   The Ohio senator and astronaut said the John Glenn Institute for
Public Service and Public Policy will sponsor conferences, offer
students experiences such as managing dormitories and provide them
information about serving in Congress.
	   The center is a response to what he called the ``cynicism and
apathy'' that permeate society, especially among young people.
	   ``There's plenty wrong in politics _ no doubt about that _
there's plenty wrong in government. That doesn't mean we abandon
it. That means we get in there and do something about it,'' Glenn
said in announcing the project last week.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his estranged
wife, Anna, have put their Beverly Hills-area house on the market
for dlrs 19.5 million.
	   The couple, who filed for divorce in July, owned the home for 12
years.
	   The Mediterranean-style home, built for a film director in 1927,
has eight bedrooms and features a circular courtyard with a wishing
well, fancy gardens and a pool.

Mahathir's police disperse protesters, crowd applauds him

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Pro-reform campaigners braced for
dark days ahead after Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad used police
armed with tear gas and summary detention to subdue two weeks of
protest against his 17-year-rule.
	   Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, a former deputy prime minister
and finance minister, was placed under indefinite detention Monday
as a security risk, according to federal police.
	   Thousands of supporters who had chanted, ``Reform, reform''
outside the courthouse where they had expected Anwar to be
arraigned on a criminal charge, were dispersed by an army reserve
unit and riot police, beating batons on their shields, firing tear
gas and jets of water spiced with stinging chemicals.
	   Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, designated the leader of the reform
movement before his arrest, waited futilely at the courthouse all
day for her husband's arraignment.
	   Exhausted and shaken, she told reporters as she headed home,
``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by ordering the police to act like
gangsters he will frighten the people from supporting this
reformation movement, he is dreaming. I think he has cut himself
off from reality.''
	   She said police had acted wildly and described Mahathir as a
once-great leader who was now ``a political desperado, who is
willing to suppress his own people just to keep power.''
	   A human rights group, Suaram, said 34 people had been arrested
on the streets. Another six were detained under the Internal
Security Act, administered by Mahathir as home affairs minister,
which allows opponents to be silenced indefinitely.
	   The top four leaders of the fundamentalist Islamic Youth
Movement were arrested at the group's headquarters. The head of the
youth wing in Mahathir's own party, who had appeared by Anwar's
side after his dismissal from the government, was detained.
	   Anwar had been leading an increasingly vocal opposition to the
72-year-old prime minister since Sept. 2, when Mahathir fired the
man he once had designated his successor.
	   Anwar's detention, and police action against his supporters, had
threatened to overshadow the visit by Queen Elizabeth II and her
festive closing of the 16th Commonwealth Games, which feature
athletes from countries that once belonged to the British Empire.
	   As the queen drove Monday to her formal welcoming ceremony at
Parliament Square, she passed the thousands chanting ``Reform'' in
front of the courthouse and wondering where Anwar had been taken.
	   As the queen made sightseeing rounds and chatted with athletes,
the police chased protesters down side streets, broke up assemblies
and made arrests.
	   By Monday night, Mahathir had declared that the Games were such
a success he would make Sept. 28 a national holiday. He stood in
the center of the National Stadium absorbing several minutes of
applause, then greeted Queen Elizabeth, as well as Malaysia's queen
and king, at the closing ceremonies.

	   DAR ES SALAAM, Tanzania (AP) _ A Tanzanian and an Egyptian face
death by hanging after Tanzanian authorities charged the men with
murder in connection with the U.S. Embassy bombing in Tanzania.
	   Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed and Tanzanian Rashid Saleh
Hemed each were charged with 11 counts of murder. The Aug. 7
bombing killed 11 people, all Africans. Resident Magistrate Amiri
Maneto said no bail was allowed. A trial date will be set Oct. 5.
	   Police and soldiers stood guard while the two men arrived at the
courthouse, in the center of Dar es Salaam.
	   Three FBI agents also were present at the hearing.
	   Although no details were released in court, local media said
traces of chemicals that could have been used to make the bomb had
been found in Saleh's home and car. Police, the reports said, also
were seeking two unidentified men who had visited Saleh often
before the bombing.
	   No information was available on why charges were filed against
Ahmed, who authorities said also is known as Said Ahmed and Saleh
Aben Alahales.
	   Ahmed told the court he couldn't understand why he was charged
because he was not even in Dar es Salaam on the day of the bombing.
He said he was in the northern Tanzanian town of Arusha.
	   Ahmed, a heavyset and bearded man, wore glasses, a gray T-shirt
and faded slacks. Saleh, slender and bearded, did not make a
statement. He is a native of Zanzibar, an island off Tanzania.
	   A nearly simultaneous bombing at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring
Kenya, killed 248 people. The National Disaster Operation Center in
Nairobi confirmed on Monday the death of a woman injured in the
blast, bringing the death toll to 248.
	   Two men have been indicted in federal court in New York in the
murders of the 12 Americans slain in the bombing in Kenya, and
several other suspects were being sought. Among them is Saudi
dissident Osama bin Laden, who allegedly runs al Qaida, a radical
Islamic network accused of planning the bombings.

Indonesia creating own path for human rights, democracy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In its revolution of economic, social and
political reforms, Indonesia is marking its own path toward
promoting human rights and democracy, Indonesia's foreign minister
said.
	   Indonesia has launched a program to infuse the government and
society ``with values conducive to the promotion and protection of
human rights. We expect to sign and ratify in the near future
several more U.N. conventions on human rights,'' Ali Alatas told
the U.N. General Assembly on Monday.
	   His speech didn't focus on the Asian financial crisis, which has
hit Indonesia particularly hard, though Alatas did address the
issue last week when he opened a U.N. special session on the
problem of interdependent economies and the Asian financial crisis.
	   ``The experience of Southeast Asian countries in this financial
turmoil has shown that even the most dynamic economies are
vulnerable,'' he said Monday.
	   For four months now, Indonesia has been working to overcome the
32-year regime of President Suharto who stepped down as a result of
the Asian economic crisis and some of the worst rioting in that
country.
	   ``The reform-development government that is now in place in
Indonesia will carry out vigorous measures to further democratize
the national life,'' he said.
	   Alatas said the United Nations can solve regional conflicts and
help end the prolonged world economic crisis only if all countries
cooperate to work together.
	   In his speech, Alatas also criticized member countries who have
failed to pay their U.N. dues or contributed to the alarm of
nuclear proliferation.
	   ``Herein lies the tragedy of the human race: that our vast
capacity to alter the planet in which we live has been matched to a
parochial vision. Large and complex actions are motivated by narrow
self-interest,'' he said. ``And in the narrowness of our
perspective, we inflict great harm on one another.''
	   The United Nations can still provide solutions even though
``after five decades it has not yet brought us the global peace
that we envisaged to be its great promise.''
	   But the United Nations cannot do its job without financial
backing, said Alatas, making indirect reference to the United
States, which owes the United Nations at least dlrs 1.3 billion and
could lose its vote soon in the General Assembly.
	   ``It is therefore of the greatest importance that (the United
Nations) be provided with the resources with which to carry on its
work instead of being strapped for funds as it is now,'' Alatas
said. ``The legal obligation of every member state in that regard
must therefore be strictly met.''
	   Alatas also blamed the recent nuclear crisis spurred by India's
and Pakistan's nuclear testing on world powers _ including the
United States, Russia, China.
	   It is their ``unjustifiable privileges ... that have given rise
to a regime of discrimination and hypocrisy as well as a situation
where non-nuclear countries, wishing to enjoy the same privileges,
seek to become nuclear states themselves,'' he said.

	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Fifteen-year-old hepatitis victim Joey Hache
managed to get a meeting with the prime minister on Monday, but he
came out empty-handed.
	   Hache failed to convince Jean Chretien that the government
should compensate all people infected with hepatitis C through
tainted blood.
	   ``He (Chretien) said he didn't have the money to do this,'' said
Hache following the brief meeting. ``He tried to be nice but he
just couldn't.''
	   Hache cycled from Halifax to Vancouver during the summer to
promote government compensation for all victims infected with the
liver disease through tainted blood. He collected 50,000 signatures
in support of the cause.
	   He did not buy Chretien's claim of insufficient funds.
	   ``We (the victims) were given hep C, it wasn't our fault that we
got it,'' he said. ``We should be compensated.''

	   KEMPTVILLE, Nova Scotia (AP) _ A group of apostolic monks
embroiled in a fight with one of Canada's largest corporate giants
said Monday they will leave Nova Scotia on Oct. 1 over the dispute.
	   The Carmelite monks at the Nova Nada monastery said they are
tired of their yearlong fight with forestry giant J. D. Irving over
noise levels from logging machines.
	   ``As founder and abbot, I must remove (the monks) from this
battlefield,'' Nova Nada founder Rev. William McNamara said at a
news conference in the hermitage's main lodge.
	   The monks have insisted on a nearly two-mile no-cutting zone to
preserve the tranquility of their premises, which serve as a
spiritual retreat. The monks observe periods of total silence
during the day and periods of the year.
	   The forestry giant has offered a nearly 1-mile no-cutting zone
around the monastery, and only eight weeks of cutting every six
years in an area between .99 miles and 1.99 miles from the zone.
	   ---
	   CALGARY (AP) _ Canadian farmers faced more frustration getting
their hogs, cattle and grain into the United States Monday as
American politicians and farmers cranked up the heat in a
cross-border dispute.
	   A state-ordered blockade of Canadian trucks carrying cattle and
hogs continued in South Dakota with no end in sight.
	   About 50 people blocked a Canadian Pacific Railway freight train
for 30 minutes at Portal, N.D., just south of the Canada-U.S.
border. Protesters had warned both state police and the railway of
their blockade.
	   In a separate demonstration, about 500 people marched near the
U.S. customs checkpoint at Sweetgrass, Ontario _ 186 miles
southeast of Calgary _ against trade policies that have eased
Canadian access to U.S. markets. Trucks loaded with agricultural
products were being held on the Canadian side to avoid any
confrontation with the protesters.
	   ---
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Jean Chretien was welcomed back to Parliament on
Monday with demands to come clean, apologize and even resign over
his alleged role in security arrangements for last fall's
Asia-Pacific summit in Vancouver.
	   The prime minister was unmoved by the clamor, insisting that
Ottawa had a duty to provide security for visiting foreign leaders
and shrugging off charges that his real goal was to protect former
Indonesian President Suharto from political embarrassment at the
hands of demonstrators.
	   ``We were receiving 19 leaders from all the countries of the
world,'' Chretien told the Commons on its first day back from
summer recess.
	   ``It was the duty of the government to make sure that their
security was to be assured in Canada.''
	   But he repeatedly ignored opposition demands to explain what
personal directives, if any, he issued to officials in his office
or elsewhere about summit security.

	   GREENFIELD PARK, Quebec (AP) _ Ludger Ferlatte was finishing up
his third game Monday in a seniors' bowling league when he heard a
boom that definitely didn't come from anyone's strike.
	   Seconds later, the 68-year-old man found himself lying under
twisted metal, broken bits of a ceiling and wiring.
	   ``I hit the hardwood floor,'' said Ferlatte. He was one of 23
people injured when a part of the bowling alley's ceiling
collapsed. Earlier reports had 25 hurt.
	   ``The people taken to hospital mostly had head, neck and back
injuries,'' said Greenfield Park police Sgt. Pierre Giroux.
	   ``But the injuries aren't life-threatening.''

Hurricane Georges pounds Caribbean, threatens Puerto Rico

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Powerful Hurricane Georges plowed
into the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico Monday, killing three people
in a roof collape after leaving other parts of the northeast
Caribbean a shambles.
	   Packing howling winds and 20-foot (6-meter) seas, the hurricane
toppled power lines, mangled trees and blew away roofs as families
huddled in shelters in St. Kitts, Antigua and other islands earlier
Monday.
	   Mari Tere Pacheco, a spokeswoman for the civil defense authority
in Puerto Rico, said the three died when their home's roof
collapsed on top of them in the San Juan subirb of Bayamon. She did
not provide the victim's identities or other details.
	   ``This hurricane has the characteristics of being the strongest
that we have confronted in Puerto Rico in decades,'' Gov. Pedro
Rossello warned earlier. ``Our people have very difficult days to
come... We are maximally prepared.''
	   At 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), Georges' center was estimated near
latitude 19.1 north and longitude 66.0 west, moving west at 16 mph
(26 kph). Georges packed hurricane-force winds of up to 110 mph
(180 kph) extending up to 85 miles (140 kilometers) from the eye,
mostly to the northeast.
	   The U.S. National Hurricane Center warned the storm winds _
while diminished from a monstrous 150 mph (240 kph) Sunday _
remained ``extremely dangerous,'' and Center director Jerry Jarrell
said there were indications Georges was intensifying.
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico _ and both territories declared states of emergency
and activated National Guard troops to help evacuations.
	   The first winds were felt around 3 p.m. (1900 GMT) in the San
Juan area, where almost half of Puerto Rico's 3.8 million people
live.
	   Rossello banned liquor sales and ordered officials to open more
than 330 shelters. Banks and schools closed, airlines canceled
flights to and from the U.S. mainland, and ferry service to nearby
islands was suspended. Police ordered people off the beaches.
	   More than 9,700 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities.
	   With up to 15 inches (38 centimeters) of rain expected in Puerto
Rico's mountains, the threat of mudslides and flash floods drove
many mountain residents to the San Juan shelters too.
	   ``The roof of my house is made of wood and cardboard, and I'd
rather be here before it goes flying,'' said Miguel Mercado Romero,
66, as he waited for the storm in a shelter near the Old San Juan
historic district.
	   Georges' current path would also take it to the island of
Hispaniola, which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
Many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to Georges' fury.
	   Hurricane watches also went into effect for the southeastern
Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands, and there was concern as
far away as Florida, where workers put shutters over the windows at
Key West City Hall.
	   Georges first hit land Sunday night, downing trees and utility
lines, ripping wooden and galvanized roofs from homes and pelting
sheets of rain into residences on the northern Leeward islands.
	   In Antigua, where 5,700 people spent the night in shelters, the
storm split open government-built homes in northern Cedar Grove
Garden, ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses and
wrapped them around trees.
	   ``Hurricane mash up my life,'' said Verna McHenry as she
surveyed the remains of her home near Bolans.
	   Antiguan shop owners erected sandbag barricades to stop
flooding. Civil defense workers distributed flashlights, mosquito
coils, water and toilet paper to nervous shelter residents.
	   ``An incredible sound'' from a darkened, angry sea is how Jean
Barfleur, mayor of Port-Louis, described the hurricane's roar.
Raging seas flooded roads and forced residents living near the
beach on Guadeloupe to head for shelter inland.
	   France was sending a team of 170 civil defense workers to help
recovery efforts.
	   Winds gusted above 90 mph (144 kph) in St. Martin, where
Hurricane Luis caused hundreds of millions of dollars' damage in
1995.
	   In St. Croix, raging winds bent palm trees to a third of their
height, shook parked cars and destroyed part of the boardwalk. Gov.
Roy Schneider, speaking on WVWI-AM radio, said a 50-foot (15-meter)
sailboat had been driven aground. In St. Thomas, also part of the
U.S. Virgin Islands, winds were at about 75 mph and increasing.
	   Georges was expected to lose strength while shooting over the
north shore of Hispaniola but possibly intensify again at it sails
over open water about 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of Cuba.

transmitted &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Excerpts from Monica Lewinsky's initial Aug. 6 grand jury
testimony:
	   (Monica Lewinsky is advised of her rights before the grand
jury.)
	   ...
	   Q. Now, ordinarily, you could refuse to answer questions that
would tend to incriminate you. As I understand it, here you have
entered into an agreement with the government that provides you
with immunity, in exchange for which you will be cooperating with
the government. Is that right?
	   A. Correct.
	   ...
	   (PROSECUTOR):
	   Q. ... how long did you serve as an intern at the White House?
	   A. ... Four and a half months.
	   Q. And was there ever a time that you then assumed a staff
position that was not an intern position?
	   A. Yes.
	   Q. And when would that have been?
	   A. In November of 1995.
	   Q. When did you first notice the president of the United States.
	   A. Our first encounter, I guess a nonverbal encounter, was Aug.
9, 1995. ... It was a departure ceremony on the South Lawn and, as
he was going by on the rope line shaking hands, we made eye contact
and it was more intense eye contact than I had experienced with him
before.
	   Q. OK. And did you have any further such contact sort of later,
after that initial time?
	   A. Yes. The next day the president _ I guess that staff had a
birthday party for the president on the South Lawn and the interns
were invited to that later in the day. And at that party, there was
sort of a more intense flirtation that went on at a distance.
	   ...
	   Q. ... Was there ever a time that your relationship became more
of a romantic and sexual relationship?
	   A. Yes. ... On Nov. 15, 1995.
	   Q. OK. And although as I've told you, I'm not going to go into a
lot of specific dates, this is one that I wanted you to explain
sort of how it came about.
	   A. It was during the furlough. I was up in Mr. (Leon) Panetta's
West Wing office answering phones. The president came down several
times during the day.
	   There was the continued flirtation and around 8:00 in the
evening or so I was in the hallway going to the restroom, passing
Mr. (George) Stephanopoulos' office, and he was in the hall and
invited me into Mr. Stephanopoulos' office and then from there
invited me back into his study.
	   Q. OK. And what happened there?
	   A. We talked briefly and sort of acknowledged that there had
been a chemistry that was there before and that we were both
attracted to each other and then he asked me if he could kiss me.
	   Q. And what did you say?
	   A. Yes.
	   Q. And did you kiss on that occasion?
	   A. Yes.
	   Q. And where in the _ you mentioned you went back to the study
area.
	   A. Mm-hmm.
	   Q. Where exactly did the kiss occur?
	   A. Right outside his bathroom, in the hallway, inside _ adjacent
to the study, to the office.
	   Q. OK. And how did you end that _ was there anything more than a
romantic kiss on that sort of first encounter?

<TEXT>
	   Q. ... I take it you remained frustrated with the president's
efforts to try to get you back to the White House.
	   A. Mm-hmm. I mean, it always - and I did make this clear to him,
that it was always more important to me to have him in my life than
to get the job, but the job was something that was important to me.
	   Q. Did there come a time in about October when you gave up, more
or less, on your efforts to get back to the White House and you
turned your attention more to New York City?
	   A. Yes.
	   Q. All right. Tell us how that happened.
	   A. Linda Tripp called me at work on Oct. 6 and told me that her
friend Kate in the NSC had heard ... rumors about me and that I
would never work in the White House again and, if I did, I wouldn't
have a blue pass and her advice to me was ``get out of town.'' So
that meant to me that I wasn't going to be coming back to the White
House and I was very upset by that. ...
	   Q. Did you communicate your additional frustration and
disappointment to the president?
	   A. Yes, I did.
	   Q. Tell us how and when?
	   A. I believe I sent him a short note telling him that I really
needed to talk to him in person ... and he and I had an argument in
a conversation on the 9th of October. ...
	   Q. Did the name Vernon Jordan come up in the course of that
discussion?
	   A. It's possible. ...
	   I know that I had discussed with Linda and either I had had the
thought or she had suggest that Vernon Jordan would be a good
person who is a close friend of the president and who had a lot of
contacts in New York, so that that might be someone who might be
able to help me secure a position in New York ...
	   Q. What was the president's response?
	   A. ``I think that was a good idea.'' ...
	   Q. At some point, did you have an initial meeting with Vernon
Jordan?
	   A. Yes, I did.

New poll: Labor opposition still slightly ahead but election too
</HEADLINE>
close to call &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A new poll on Tuesday showed the Labor
opposition holds a slight lead over Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government in the windup to the Oct. 3 election, but
the race is too close to call.
	   Overshadowed by Australia's gold medal-winning performances at
the Commonwealth games in Malaysia and the upcoming rugby finals
this weekend, the election -- being largely fought out on economic
and tax policy issues -- has generated little passion among
Australians.
	   The Newspoll, conducted for The Australian newspaper, also shows
while support for the major parties has remained virtually stable
since the election campaign began, the right-wing populist One
Nation party's popularity has fallen three weeks in a row to its
lowest level since before the Queensland election.
	   One Nation's national vote has almost halved in the election
campaign, dropping from 10 percent at the end of August to 6
percent last weekend.
	   The Newspoll of 1,174 respondents also showed Labor was still in
front on by 52 to 48 percent.
	   Labor, led by Kim Beazley, requires a nationwide lead of about
3.7 percent to win the 27 seats it needs to take government, a feat
no Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   The Australian said Labor's continuing, but slightly diminished
lead means the election will be decided in the next 10 days of
campaign.
	   The poll of 1,754 registered voters had a margin of error of 2.3
percent.
	   Another poll, published in The Bulletin magazine, indicated u to
18 percent of voters are still undecided.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges, one of the most
powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years, killed three people
in a Puerto Rico roof collapse Monday as it swept across the island
packing howling winds of up to 110 mph (180 kph).
	   Georges caused extensive property damage in Antigua, St. Kitts,
St. Croix and other smaller Caribbean islands, toppling power
lines, mangling trees and ripping roofs off homes.
	   The hurricane appeared headed directly for the island of
Hispaniola, which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
Many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to Georges' fury.
	   The National Hurricane Center in Miami forecast a landfall in
the Domincan Republic as early as 2 a.m. (0600 GMT) Tuesday.
	   At 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), Georges' center was about 25 miles
south of San Juan at latitude 18.1 north and longitude 66.0 west,
moving west at 16 mph (26 kph). Georges packed hurricane-force
winds of up to 110 mph (180 kph) extending up to 85 miles (140
kilometers) from the eye, mostly to the northeast.
	   ``Our people have very difficult days to come,'' said Puerto
Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello. ``We are maximally prepared.''
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico _ and both territories declared states of emergency
and activated National Guard troops to help evacuations.
	   The hurricane hit Puerto Rico Monday afternoon, destroying at
least 60 homes on the small islands of Vieques and Culebra which
are part of the U.S. territory, said Mari Tere Pacheco, a
spokeswoman for the civil defense authority.
	   A few hours later, three people were killed in the San Juan
area, where almost half the island's 3.8 million residents live.
They died when the roof of their home in the Bayamon suburb
collapsed on top of them, she said. She did not provide the
victims' identities or other details.
	   Rossello has banned liquor sales and ordered officials to open
more than 330 shelters. Banks and schools closed, airlines canceled
flights to and from the U.S. mainland, and ferry service to nearby
islands was suspended.
	   More than 9,700 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities. Some were residents of
the central mountains who feared mudslides and flash floods
resulting from expected rainfall of up to 15 inches (38
centimeters).
	   ``The roof of my house is made of wood and cardboard, and I'd
rather be here before it goes flying,'' said Miguel Mercado Romero,
66, as he waited out the storm in a San Juan shelter.
	   A hurricane warning went into effect in the Dominican Republic,
and hurricane watches were posted for northern Haiti, eastern Cuba,
the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos islands. Concern
was growing even in Florida, where workers put shutters over the
windows at Key West City Hall.
	   Georges first hit the northern Leeward Islands Sunday night,
downing trees and utility lines, ripping wooden and galvanized
roofs from homes and pelting sheets of rain into residences.
	   In Antigua, where 5,700 people spent the night in shelters, the
storm split open government-built homes in northern Cedar Grove
Garden, ripped corrugated roofs off hundreds of other houses and
wrapped them around trees.
	   In the French island of Guadeloupe, swirling winds knocked out
power in several towns. One man trying to escape from jail with two
other men around midnight, was shot and killed by guards. France
was sending a team of 170 civil defense workers to help recovery
efforts.
	   Winds gusted above 90 mph (144 kph) in St. Martin, where
Hurricane Luis caused hundreds of millions of dollars' damage in
1995.
	   In St. Croix, which is one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, raging
winds bent palm trees to a third of their height, shook parked cars
and destroyed part of the boardwalk. Gov. Roy Schneider, speaking
on WVWI-AM radio, said a 50-foot (15-meter) sailboat had been
driven aground.
	   Georges was expected to lose strength while shooting over the
north shore of Hispaniola but could intensify again after it sails
over open water.

New poll: Labor slightly ahead but election too close to call
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A new poll on Tuesday showed the Labor
opposition holds a slight lead over Prime Minister John Howard's
conservative government in the windup to the Oct. 3 election, but
the race is too close to call.
	   Overshadowed by Australia's gold medal-winning performances at
the Commonwealth games in Malaysia and the upcoming rugby finals
this weekend, the election _ being largely fought out on economic
and tax policy issues _ has generated little passion among
Australians.
	   The Newspoll, conducted for The Australian newspaper, also shows
that while support for the major parties has remained virtually
stable since the election campaign began, the right-wing populist
One Nation party's popularity has fallen three weeks in a row to
its lowest level since before the Queensland election.
	   One Nation's national vote has almost halved in the election
campaign, dropping from 10 percent at the end of August to 6
percent last weekend.
	   The Newspoll of 1,174 respondents also showed Labor was still in
front by 52 to 48 percent.
	   Labor, led by Kim Beazley, requires a nationwide lead of about
3.7 percent to win the 27 seats it needs to take government, a feat
no Australian opposition party has ever achieved.
	   The Australian said Labor's continuing, but slightly diminished
lead means the election will be decided in the next 10 days of
campaigning.
	   The poll of 1,754 registered voters had a margin of error of 2.3
percent.
	   Another poll, published in The Bulletin magazine, indicated up
to 18 percent of voters are still undecided.
	   In the House of Representatives, Howard's governing Liberal
Party and rural National coalition holds 90 seats, the Labor Party
holds 49, independents 8 and the Northern Territory's Country
Liberal Party, 1.

Japan wants to regain role of regional financial leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous with North Korean reply &QL; 
 &UR; By SAU CHAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Japan hopes to regain its role as
financial leader in Southeast Asia by channeling about dlrs 43
billion to help out its neighbors' shaky economies, the Japanese
prime minister said.
	   The sum _ primarily in loans and some grants _ is the largest
single contribution of any nation in the world, Keizo Obuchi told
the U.N. General Assembly on Monday. The amount includes money
already distributed, such as the dlrs 10 billion bailout of
Indonesia.
	   The Asian economic crisis _ prolonged partly by recession in
Japan _ has also undermined its position as an economic financial
leader in the region.
	   ``Japan is making every effort possible, through such measures
as stabilizing our financial system, to put our own economy on a
recovery track within the next year or two,'' Obuchi said. ``We
believe that early recovery of our own economy is the best
contribution we can make to the economies of Asia and the world.''
	   Japan also is playing its part in trying to resolve ethnic and
religious conflicts around the world, Obuchi said.
	   ``Japan is actively promoting what we call Eurasian diplomacy,''
he said. ``This means redefining relations with countries of the
Eurasian continent, including the Russian Federation, the People's
Republic of China, the Republic of Korea and countries in the Silk
Road regions of Central Asia and the Caucasus range.
	   ``This is another example of Japan's policy of promoting both
peace and development in tandem,'' he said.
	   It is more important to focus on how to prevent conflicts rather
than on how to solve them once they break out, he said.
	   This is particular applicable to the nuclear test by neighboring
rivals India and Pakistan, said Obuchi, who urged all countries who
have not done so to sign the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.
	   In his speech, Obuchi also touched on North Korea's Aug. 31
rocket launch that flew over Japan during a failed attempt to put a
satellite into orbit. U.S. officials say it was just the latest
example of North Korea's aggressive program to develop a long-range
ballistic missile.
	   ``Even if it was an attempt to launch a satellite into orbit,
(it) poses a serious problem, which directly concerns both Japan's
national security and peace and stability in Northeast Asia,''
Obuchi said.
	   In response, North Korea reiterated that it hadn't committed any
wrongdoing, calling Japan's complaints ``crying'' that had become
extreme.
	   Japan is calling for sanctions against North Korea, inciting
assaults on North Koreans in Japan and seeking to strike North
Korean military bases, said Kim Chang Guk, deputy North Korean
ambassdor.
	   ``Japan is inviting disasters and destruction with these rash,
thoughtless acts,'' he said.
	   Japan has launched scores of satellites in the past without
warning, but do not consider them ``threats to peace and
security,'' he said.
	   This is ``thieves' logic _ Japanese style,'' he said.
	   ``Time is changing against Japan's wishes,'' he said. ``Today is
not 1950s when Japan earned big lumps of money by serving logistic
support for U.S. Army in Korean War.''

Economic reform needed to resolve world financial crisis, Argentina
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to ADD British reply &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The worldwide economic crisis that has
spread to Latin America can be contained if the region's recent
economic reforms are continued, Argentina's foreign minster said.
	   ``To ease its negative effects, globalization requires policies
on education, social issues and the environment that benefits all
society equally,'' Guido Di Tella told world leaders gathered
Monday for the 53rd session of the General Assembly.
	   Referring to the recent spate of terrorist attacks around the
world, Di Tella said Argentina supported countries that fight
terrorism, particularly considering Argentina's own experience with
the 1992 bombing attack on the Israeli Embassy and the 1994 bombing
of a Jewish cultural center.
	   ``The resurgence of terrorist attacks brutally reminds us that
no state can consider itself safe,'' he said.
	   On another matter, he noted India and Pakistan's recent nuclear
tests and pointed out that Argentina had renounced the possibility
of becoming a nuclear power.
	   The South Asia tests ``mean a step back in terms of global and
regional security and will postpone economic development and
well-being of the population,'' he said.
	   He repeated Argentina's claim to the British controlled Falkland
Islands _ known in Argentina as the Malvinas _ and urged Britain
restart talks over the archipelago, over which the two fought a war
in 1982.
	   ``I repeat Argentina's legitimate and founded rights in this
major dispute,'' he said.
	   In response, the British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said he
welcomed the high level of cooperation between the two governments.
However, the British government ``does not accept the foreign
minister's remarks about sovereignty,'' Greenstock said.
	   ``We have no doubt about Britain's sovereignty over the Falkland
Islands and the other British dependencies in the south Atlantic,''
he said. ``In the Falklands Islands, we must heed the wishes
people,'' who he said had no desire to become part of Argentina.

US joins eight nations to call for peace in Afghanistan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANWAR FARUQI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The United States, Russia and China joined
the five countries neighboring Afghanistan in calling for a
cease-fire among warring factions there, and urged them to work
toward forging a broad-based government.
	   The eight countries, which included Pakistan, Iran, Tajikistan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, also agreed Monday that Lakhdar
Brahimi, the chief U.N. negotiator for Afghanistan, should visit
the region to try to reduce tensions.
	   Brahimi said he expected to travel to the region sometime next
month.
	   The agreements were reached during a meeting Monday at the
United Nations on the sidelines of the General Assembly debate that
was attended by Brahimi and Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
	   ``The United States believes the time has come for serious
efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan,'' State Department Spokesman
James Rubin told reporters after the meeting, which was attended by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
	   He said that Washington called on other countries to stop
supplying arms to Afghanistan, and help in an effort to stamp out
the drug trade.
	   Washington believes that much of the war effort of the hard-line
Taliban militia that rules nearly all of Afghanistan is financed by
drug trafficking.
	   The Taliban rule nearly all of Afghanistan with an iron hand and
have imposed harsh Islamic rules that include depriving education
for girls and women. The Taliban are still engaged in fighting with
an opposition coalition.
	   The eight nations called for the need to reduce tensions between
the Taliban and Iran.
	   Tensions between Iran and the Taliban have risen since the
militants overran the city of Mazar-e-Sharif in northern
Afghanistan on Aug. 8 and killed several Iranian diplomats posted
there. Iran has massed 200,000 troops on its border with
Afghanistan since then.
	   The Taliban has returned the bodies of seven of the Iranians to
Tehran, and has released a total of 10 Iranian captives.
	   ``We have put our priority on a diplomatic solution and we will
continue every effort in order to make sure that this situation
finds a diplomatic solution,'' said Iran's deputy foreign minister,
Mohammad Javad Zarif.
	   Pakistan's minister of foreign affairs, Sartaj Aziz, whose
country is widely believed to be the force behind the Taliban,
called for the international community to engage in direct talks
with the Taliban, saying that would make them more responsible.
	   ``If you make them part of the international community they will
certainly feel accountable and answerable and responsible,'' Aziz
told reporters.
	   The so-called ``six-plus-two'' group agreed on the following
points, according to an outline of their agreement:
	   _ All warring forces should immediately release non-combatants,
including Iranians.
	   _ The Taliban should return the remains of the three Iranian
diplomats, and cooperate in an international investigation which
would bring the killers to justice.
	   _The United Nations should investigate the reports of mass
killings of ethnic groups by the Taliban.
	   _The Taliban should respect humanitarian law and human rights,k
including the rights of women, and cease providing a haven for
terrorists or engage in drugs trafficking.
	   _ All factions should provide safe conditions for the return of
suspended humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan.
	   _ All parties should exercise maximum restraint and solve their
problems peacefully.

Dollar higher, Tokyo stocks bounce back in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar rose against the yen early Tuesday
in Tokyo as worries about Japan's banking system weighed on market
sentiment. Japanese stocks bounced back moderately.
	   The dollar bought 134.48 yen in early trading, up 1.48 yen from
late Monday in Tokyo but marginally lower than its late New York
level of 134.49 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 134.32
points, or 0.99 percent, to 13,731.62 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Monday, the Nikkei closed down 385.82
points, or 2.76 percent, to 13,597.30, its lowest level in 12
years.
	   Traders said the dollar held its overnight strength in New York
on continued worries about a plan to help Japan's banking system,
which is saddled with a large mountain of bad debts.
	   Ruling and major opposition parties late Friday announced a
``basic agreement'' on banking bills aimed at resolving the
bad-debt problems.
	   But it later emerged that the parties remain far apart on key
issues _ especially on how to deal with troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan.
	   On the stock market, share prices opened slightly higher on
futures-led buying and position-adjustment before financial markets
in Tokyo close for a national holiday Wednesday.
	   LTCB shares fell to 20 yen (15 U.S. cents) in early trading,
down 1 yen from Monday's finish. On Friday, its shares dipped to an
all-time low of 18 yen (14 cents).
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all shares listed on the
exchanges's first section was up 5.75 points, or 0.55 percent, to
1,053.54. The TOPIX closed down 25.43 points, or 2.37 percent, the
day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese government
stood at 0.890 percent, unchanged from Monday's finish. Its price
also remained unchanged at 108.27 year

Brazil: Juice importers misled over child labor
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ The head of Brazil's trade union
movement on Tuesday told Australian orange juice importers there is
no practical way to avoid the use of child labor by Brazilian juice
companies.
	   Juice importers were deceived into thinking they were not
importing juice involving the use of children, he said.
	   The Australian orange-growing industry, with union backing, has
been fighting for its survival in the face of cheap Brazilian
imports it says owe their low prices to the exploitation of
children.
	   ``International agreements may be in place, but that doesn't
mean anything in the orchards where children are picking the
fruit,'' said Kjeld Jakobsen, international head of the Centrale
Unica dos Trabalhadores, Brazil's union federation.
	   ``Australian importers may place their faith in these
agreements, but there is no enforcement of labor laws and very few
inspections of orchards.
	   ``When they are inspected, there is always enough warning for
any children to be hidden.''
	   Brazilian children were picking 40 kilo (88 pound) boxes of
oranges for as little as 12 U.S. cents a box, with no health,
accident compensation or social security cover, he said.
	   Jakobsen denied claims by the importers' national body, the
Australian Food Council, that suppliers who used child labor were
boycotted.
	   He said they might sign agreements, but without the necessary
inspections and with no way of enforcing the laws in Brazil, they
could not be certain what they were importing.
	   Food council executive director Mitchell Hooke said Australian
fruit juice processors went to great lengths to establish that
child labor is not used in the production and supply of fruit juice
concentrate.
	   ``Australia's major fruit juice producers do differentiate
sources of concentrate, avoiding concentrate produced using child
labor and all forms of compulsory labor,'' Hooke said.

Southern right whale making comeback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The southern right whale, once on
the verge of extinction, is making a comeback, according to
scientists who spent the winter studying the species from the
remote sub-antarctic Auckland Islands.
	   The use of explosive-tipped harpoons almost exterminated many
whale species between the 1880s and the 1960s.
	   The ``right whale'' was given that name by whalers because it
floated after being killed, making it easy to retrieve and butcher.
	   The New Zealand scientific team recorded 165 whales in a single
day and probably 250 in total. Last year fewer than 150 southern
rights were seen.
	   Nathalie Patenaude, of Auckland University, has spent the past
four winters observing the whales and said Tuesday that this year's
field trip was the hardest she had experienced, with storms, snow
and strong winds buffeting the islands.
	   The expedition confirmed that the whales give birth around the
Auckland Islands.
	   The researchers are now going through photographic evidence and
genetic samples to determine accurately the population size and to
see whether the samples match DNA taken from whales found in the
waters of Africa, Argentina and Australia.
	   The challenge that remains for researchers is to solve the
mystery of where the whales go for summer and to monitor the
population long term.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair called for a
radical refurbishing of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank to deal with the crisis engulfing global financial
markets.
	   Blair said the institutions, set up in the aftermath of World
War II, needed to be refurbished ``for a new international
financial age.''
	   ``The current crisis, in my view, illustrates the weaknesses of
the existing international financial system,'' he said Monday in a
speech to about a dozen American business executives at the New
York Stock Exchange. ``It needs to be modernized to meet the
challenges of a new century.''
	   In his speech, the prime minister urged policymakers to adopt a
broad vision in revamping the financial system and seek ideas from
developing nations, business executives and others. Proposals
should be put forth in a year.
	   ``We should not be afraid to think either radically or
fundamentally,'' he said. ``We need to commit ourselves today to
build a new financial architecture, a new Bretton Woods for the
next millennium.''
	   The IMF and the World Bank, created at a conference in Bretton
Woods, N.H., have borne the brunt of the financial crisis that
began in Asia more than a year ago, spread to Russia and is now
rattling the stock and currency markets of Latin American nations.
	   Critics contend the institutions are unable to deal with the
vastness of the current financial turbulence. They also argue that
the IMF's prescription for healing ailing economies, which includes
high interest rates, has hurt more than helped some nations.
	   Blair offered few details in his speech. But the Financial Times
of London reported in Monday's editions that British officials
would flesh out the ideas later in the week at meetings in
Washington. The daily said the British government would seek a
partial merger of the IMF and World Bank ``so there is a single
institution charged with supervising and regulating the world
economic system.''
	   In the text of his speech, Blair set out five priorities for
overhauling the global financial system, including greater openness
through a set of common accounting standards and other codes of
good practice.
	   He called for improving supervision and regulation of financial
institutions that operate internationally and providing the means
to help countries with short-term cash problems. Global investors,
he said, should be more careful in assessing lending risks and
price their loans accordingly.
	   In the short term, Blair said financially troubled nations
should continue efforts to bolster their economies by, among other
things, improving tax collection systems and following
low-inflation policies.
	   ``The lesson from the current crisis,'' he said, ``is not that
market disciplines have failed, but that in a global economy, with
huge capital flows, the absence of such disciplines can have a
devastating effect.''
	   He urged Russia to resume efforts to rework its battered
economy, saying that only then would financial aid be continued.
	   ``So it is a two-way deal, for Russia and for any other
countries requiring short-term help: support but only in exchange
for reform,'' he said.
	   Blair was in New York for the opening of the 53rd session of the
United Nations General Assembly. Among executives attending his
speech were AT&AMP;T chairman Michael Armstrong, Alex Trotman,
chairman, president and chief executive of Ford Motor Co., and
Dennis Picard, Raytheon's chairman and chief executive.

Sunny Queensland's solar heat rebate plan revived
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Sun-baked Queensland has reintroduced
its 500 Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 300) rebate program for
households installing solar hot water systems.
	   The Labor government introduced the plan in the early 1990s as
an environment and energy saving measure but it was later dropped
by the conservative state government that followed it.
	   Relaunching the program, the new Labor government's Mines
Minister Tony McGrady said Queensland was well placed to use solar
power.
	   ``We are the Sunshine State but solar systems are currently used
by only 5 percent of households,'' McGrady said.
	   He said the rebate would help overcome the initial higher cost
of solar hot water systems.
	   ``And with growing concerns over the environment and greenhouse
gas emissions, the government recognizes the energy policy must
increasingly address the issue of environmental sustainability,''
McGrady said.

New Zealand scientists: Southern right whale making comeback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) _ The southern right whale, once on
the verge of extinction, is making a comeback, according to New
Zealand scientists.
	   The use of explosive-tipped harpoons almost exterminated many
whale species between the 1880s and the 1960s.
	   The ``right whale'' was given that name by whalers because it
floated after being killed, making it easy to retrieve and butcher.
	   The New Zealand scientific team recorded 165 whales in a single
day and probably 250 in total. Last year fewer than 150 southern
rights were seen. The scientists spent the winter studying the
species from the remote sub-antarctic Auckland Islands.
	   Nathalie Patenaude, of Auckland University, has spent the past
four winters observing the whales. Patenaude said Tuesday that this
year's field trip was the hardest she had experienced, with storms,
snow and strong winds buffeting the islands.
	   The expedition confirmed that the whales give birth around the
Auckland Islands.
	   The researchers are now going through photographic evidence and
genetic samples to determine accurately the population size and to
see whether the samples match DNA taken from whales found in the
waters of Africa, Argentina and Australia.
	   The challenge that remains for researchers is to solve the
mystery of where the whales go for summer and to monitor the
population over the long term.

Laotian coffee _ an old brew gets new life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY301 &QL; 
 &UR; By STEVEN MARTIN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PAKSE, Laos (AP) _ After decades of war and communism, the
coffee culture of colonial Laos looks poised to make a comeback.
	   The old plantations are being tended for the first time since
they were abandoned by the French planters during World War II and
went to seed during subsequent war, revolution and communist-era
neglect.
	   Glasses of the aromatic brew, served with a generous dollop of
sweetened-condensed milk, are again being served in humble cafes
across the Southeast Asian country and entrepreneurs hope that
Laotian coffee will soon be available worldwide.
	   Eric Sisombat, a Laotian-born French citizen who returned in
1994 to start a coffee brokerage firm, said the local robusta ``is
of good quality and is known in Europe to have better flavor than
robusta from Vietnam and Indonesia.''
	   ``Now, I am looking to introduce Lao coffee to markets in
California, Australia and Israel,'' Sisombat said.
	   When the French took control of Laos in the early 20th century,
they were certain that the newest addition to French Indochina was
going to make France an imperial power to be reckoned with.
	   The latte-colored Mekong River, which runs through the country,
was thought to be teeming with gold dust washed down from mountains
during the annual monsoon. All French colonists would have to do
was pan it up and melt it down.
	   The hopes were soon dashed _ there were minuscule amounts of
gold but lots of malaria. Retreating to the more hospitable high
altitudes of the Bolaven Plateau in southern Laos, the French hit
upon an alternative _ growing coffee.
	   Saplings were brought in from neighboring Vietnam. The French
cleared jungle, planted trees at varying elevations and carefully
nursed the rows of arabica and robusta. Those on the heights of the
Bolaven fared best.
	   ``The quality of the coffee was better than expected,'' said
Bounchit Sitthiboun, director of the French-funded Bolaven Plateau
Rural Development Project. ``French planters left their plantations
in Vietnam to grow coffee in Laos.''
	   By the 1940s, coffee plantations covered the plateau and the
future looked bright until blight caused the trees to wither and
die.
	   Before disease-resistant hybrids could be introduced, World War
II broke out, followed by two wars in Vietnam that spread to Laos,
bringing first independence, then communism. By the 1980s,
remaining trees had either died or gone wild.
	   But interest in Laotian coffee has been rekindled over the last
decade as the revolutionary regime that took power in 1975
gradually softened Marxist economic policies.
	   Foreign investment has again been directed at the old
plantations. A blight-resistant strain of arabica was introduced by
French experts in 1992. The national coffee exporters association
hopes to ship 20,000 tons annually by the year 2000.
	   The vast majority of current exports go to Europe.
	   ``The soil and climate here are perfect for coffee,'' Bounchit
said. ``Come harvest time, the coffee trees are so heavy with
beans, the branches sometimes snap under their weight.''
	   Most growers are small farmers with a few trees. Besides the
always-fluctuating world coffee price, they live with another
danger _ unexploded bombs and other ordnance littering the plateau.
Some are killed or maimed.
	   The coffee-drinking etiquette has a flavor all its own. The
tin-drip, used in Vietnam to filter coffee into a glass, is rare.
Laotians favor pouring hot water through a stocking-like bag filled
with ground coffee.
	   As in Vietnam, an order of hot coffee will come in a glass
half-filled with condensed milk. But perhaps more fitting for the
tropical climate is cafe yen, in which the same concoction is mixed
and poured into a mug of crushed ice.

Small American businesses scramble for success in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL WHITE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Business Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ From an office overlooking Beijing's crowded
streets, former Beverly Hills businessman Jian Lin plots what he
hopes will become China's next cultural revolution: family
entertainment American style.
	   ``We found a lot of young Chinese are doing well in business.
They are starving for entertainment,'' Jian said.
	   Along with big corporations such as Microsoft and Motorola,
small business entrepreneurs from the United States are starting to
launch their own businesses and joint ventures across China.
	   The obstacles to success can be daunting. Language is a barrier
for most Americans. They also must deal with bureaucratic
corruption and an unfamiliar business culture based on ``guanxi,''
the contacts needed to cut through governmental red tape.
	   ``A lot of Americans come here with a lot of hope, a lot of
money, but they are killed by doing business with the wrong
people,'' said Jian.
	   There are no reliable statistics for the number of American
entrepreneurs doing business in China. U.S. observers say
uncertainty probably has kept the number low.
	   ``American investors, especially small investors, have not
gotten much off the ground in China as far as I can see,'' said
James Dorn, vice president for academic affairs at the Cato
Institute, a Washington think tank, and editor of a book on China's
economic reforms.
	   For those who succeed, the potential rewards are great. As the
world's most populous country, with 1.2 billion people, China
represents a vast, largely untapped market.
	   Which is exactly how Jian and his Chinese partner, Liu Tie, see
it.
	   The joint venture launched by Liu's Beijing Dazhong Trading
Group and Jian's Innovation Capital Corp. includes a traveling
carnival, complete with cotton candy, corn dogs and midway games,
that played through the summer in Chinese coastal cities.
	   They are renovating space in Beijing's main railroad station to
house a motion simulation theater and two bars, one with a theme of
outer space and the other Bourbon Street. And the pair won rights
to turn a quiet park into a family-fun center with rides, arcades
and a cowboy-themed restaurant.
	   Eventually, Jian and Liu want to create an entertainment empire
of similar ventures in cities across China.
	   A Chinese native who immigrated to the United States as a child,
Jian speaks fluent Mandarin Chinese and knows China's culture. But
in Liu, chairman of a dlrs 5 million-a-year real estate and food
services company, Jian gained a partner with money to invest and
connections needed to secure permits and leases.
	   Jian brings American connections to the deal. He bought
equipment for the traveling carnival and hired an American carnival
company to run it. He also negotiated the purchase of a dlrs
700,000, 45-seat motion simulation theater from Los Angeles-based
Showscan Entertainment.
	   Younger Chinese business people, such as Liu, 30, understand
capitalism and are eager to reap its rewards, said Jian, who is 44.
	   ``The easiest way to do business in China is to find a young
entrepreneur,'' he said. ``They will take command of the problem.
All that you have to do is assist them in the way a normal American
does business. They love that.''
	   Finding the right partner can be difficult.
	   Dan Rebecca came to the southern city of Guangzhou from New
Jerasy in 1993 to manufacture glass bottles for sale to U.S.
cosmetics companies, but he lost money when Chinese producers were
unable to match the quality his customers demanded.
	   Then Rebecca hit on the unlikely idea of opening a bagel bakery
to cater to American expatriates.
	   He searched for months to find a Chinese partner. Most asked for
money up front without showing any real interest in the venture's
long-term prospects.
	   ``They didn't know anything about the business. All they cared
about was the money,'' he said.
	   Frustrated, Rebecca decided to go it alone.
	   After six months of operation, Danny's Bagels sells between
12,000 and 16,000 bagels a month to Chinese and American buyers
throughout the country, and he's thinking of opening a second
bakery in Shanghai.
	   Rebecca, 38, said he's never been asked to pay a bribe, and
believes that some tales of Chinese corruption are a result of
American ignorance of China's laws and bureaucracy.
	   ``A lot of foreigners we talk to don't trust the locals that
much,'' he said. ``When someone walks in and says you need to get
another license, the American thinks he's being robbed. Then he
starts to argue. The official thinks he's going to lose face, so
he's going to do everything in his power to make you look bad.''
	   ``Americans need to do their homework.''
	   Jian believes he has, and that the time is right for his
American-style entertainment venture.
	   Young Chinese, he says, ``have a lot of money and they didn't
know what to do with it.''

U.S. Embassy caught _ again _ in Liberia's crossfire

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Shielded behind thick plates of
bulletproof glass, American soldiers in full battle gear patrol
embassy hallways crammed with supplies, automatic weapons at the
ready.
	   Diplomats and soldiers _ most wearing flack jackets _ move
around the embassy worrying there might be another fight.
	   And sitting in the lobby, huddled with two of his sons and two
supporters, is the reason for all the trouble: Roosevelt Johnson,
the Liberian president's main rival who fled to the embassy
Saturday morning. A government attempt to arrest him Friday night
sparked gunbattles that killed 47 people.
	   One of Johnson's sons, 22-year-old Puna, was shot in the
shoulder and the arm. Monday afternoon, he shook in pain from the
wounds, tears streaming down his face as one of Johnson's men
cradled his injured arm.
	   When the former warlord arrived at the embassy, at least four
people were killed and four were injured, including two Americans,
when Liberian secret police opened fire on Johnson as he and a
group of supporters tried to reach safety in the embassy.
	   Witnesses said at least one American returned fire as he and two
other American security officers struggled to get back inside the
compound as the fighting broke out.
	   Dispirited and scared, Johnson has drawn a reluctant U.S.
Embassy into Liberia's potentially explosive politics.
	   ``I don't know how we're going to get out of here,'' Johnson
said Monday, his t-shirt stained with blood, as he nervously
glanced around the room that has become his temporary home.
	   The embassy, which repeatedly found itself the only safe haven
in Liberia's capital during this West African country's brutal
7-year civil war, is again caught in the middle. President Charles
Taylor's government has demanded that the Americans hand over
Johnson and his retinue.
	   ``If this man leaves (the country) and returns re-armed, he will
be dangerous to the security of the state and the region,'' said
Taylor's spokesman, Reginald Goodridge.
	   Embassy diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
United States was not planning to hand Johnson over to the police,
and said State Department officials in Washington were negotiating
with the government.
	   ``We've had three relatively sleepless nights here,'' said one
American diplomat.
	   ``Everyone is endlessly busy dealing with this ongoing
situation,'' he said, his face etched with fatigue, his chest
protected by a green army flak jacket.
	   One of the injured Americans was evacuated to London where he
was in good condition, officials said. The other was grazed in the
shoulder. At least half of the staff has been evacuated and extra
American soldiers have been flown in by chopper.
	   The capital was largely calm Monday after being shaken by the
weekend violence. Hundreds of Liberian soldiers and West African
peacekeepers patrolled the city, including squadrons of
peacekeepers standing guard in front of the embassy.
	   Meanwhile, Johnson and his men sit on the embassy's floor,
munching on crackers and jam.
	   ``We are thankful to the embassy,'' said Johnson.

Asia crisis hurts region's airlines, but consumers love it

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ When Japan's first new airline in 35 years rolled
out its planes for the first time, they wore big black question
marks on their sides.
	   The question marks are promotional gimmicks _ Skymark Airlines
is replacing them with billboard size ads as its operations get
started this weekend. But for Asian airlines fighting the region's
economic tailspin, nothing could make a better logo.
	   More than a year after Asia's financial crisis struck, it's hard
to find an airline in the region that isn't losing money,
struggling to maintain its profits or teetering on the verge of
collapse. They also are coping with major structural changes.
	   State-owned carriers and airline markets that have long been
heavily controlled by government regulations are opening to
reforms. Most carriers, even top-notch ones like Qantas Airways and
Singapore Airlines, are overhauling their strategies and routes.
Some battered lines are reaching out to consumers with deals and
service designed to take their breath away.
	   ``The prospect of negative economic growth for the next two
years has set the scene for a period of aviation history unlike any
other,'' said Peter Harbison, managing director of Aviation
Analyst-Asia Pacific, a think tank in Sydney, Australia.
	   ``In fact, there is no road map to help plot out the road
ahead'' in Asia, he said.
	   With the debut of Skymark, Japan's three leading airlines _
Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airlines, Japan Air Systems _ quickly
introduced discounts on a route where Skymark plans to cut fares by
50 percent, even though each one has been losing money.
	   They know five other companies hope to follow Skymark into the
discount domestic airline market, despite the fact that Japan is
suffering through its worst recession since World War II.
	   Asia's crisis is forcing bargains in other areas, too.
	   Even travelers who regularly surf the Internet for airline
bargains must have been shocked by an offer that appeared from
Korean Air. For as little as dlrs 500, they could fly round-trip
from one of 13 American cities to Bangkok, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur
or Jakarta during September. That was less than half the discount
fares being charged by U.S. airlines.
	   The offer must have left some customers wondering: How can an
airline so financially troubled that it recently had to sell 11
jetliners afford to offer such a deal?
	   China, a communist country with 25 airline companies, has long
been trying to transform them, and many other state-owned
enterprises, from money losers to money makers.
	   But the campaign in the Chinese airline business set off a price
war between some of the carriers, and the government eventually had
to limit the discounts they can offer to 20 percent.
	   That didn't stop one of them, Sichuan Airlines, from reaching
out to customers by delivering airline tickets to their homes, and
providing some with free bus and hotel service at airports.
	   In fact, Lau Xinguo, the airline's president, told Orient
Aviation magazine that he would like to win other passengers by
charging them less money to fly Sichuan's clunky Russian and
Chinese airplanes than they pay to travel on its Airbus jets.
	   Around the world, airlines have always been expensive and risky
ventures, even when they are financed by a government.
	   But little could have prepared Asia's carriers for the financial
crisis that began in Thailand in July 1997. It ended up decimating
many of the region's currencies and stocks markets, and hobbling
many countries with recessions.
	   In an area that had been enjoying booming economies and a
growing nouveau riche for years, many people, including
businessmen, were suddenly too poor to fly anywhere.
	   In the airline industry, even relatively small shifts in the gap
between a carrier's available seats and its paying customers can
reduce income, increase competition with other airlines for
passengers and trigger fare wars. But that was an especially
painful development in Asia, given how many of its airlines had
been growing quickly during the good times.
	   ``There is extensive evidence that all routes touching on Asia
have suffered discounting on a scale not seen for many years, if
ever. And that disease is spreading,'' Harbison said.
	   With most of their operating costs in U.S. dollars and most of
their revenues in weakened Asian currencies, some Asian airlines
have been forced to take radical steps to survive.
	   That includes selling jetliners, canceling orders with Boeing
and Airbus, renegotiating plane leases, scrapping unprofitable
routes, laying off or firing workers, and forming alliances with
foreign carriers.
	   The only plus for the airlines has been a recent decline in fuel
prices, thanks to an oversupply in the world's oil markets.
	   At one point, South Korea's two main airlines, Korean Air and
Asiana, felt compelled to run ads saying that flying their planes
is a form of patriotism, a way of helping to revive a battered
economy that now relies on an international bailout package.
	   ``Both companies are playing a survival game,'' said Ji
Hun-seok, an analyst at Daewoo Securities Co. Ltd.
	   Other carriers, such as the deeply indebted Philippine Airlines
and Garuda Indonesia, appear on the brink of collapse.
	   With Indonesia's rupiah having lost as much as 80 percent of its
value against the U.S. dollar during the crisis, Garuda says it
must cope with a daily operating loss of at least dlrs 240,000.
	   The country's third-largest airline, Sempati, went out of
business in June.
	   Few Indonesians can afford to fly anywhere now, but the crisis
is good news for Western visitors. For someone with dollars it
costs only dlrs 440 to fly on Garuda from one end of Indonesia to
another _ 3,620 miles (5,800 kms) _ with stops in Jakarta, the
capital; the resort island of Bali; and another major city, Ujung
Pandang.
	   Even Cathay Pacific, widely regarded as one of Asia's best
managed airlines, reported its first financial loss for the first
half of 1998, in part because Hong Kong's stable currency persuaded
many Asians to avoid traveling there.
	   With the year's peak summer travel season over, Harbison says,
airlines will be under even more pressure to reduce costs to remain
competitive.
	   Garuda, for one, plans to begin laying off at least 3,000 of its
nearly 13,000 workers in early October.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Anibal Perez stared
jealously at his shopping cart piled high with meat, chickens,
rice, bread and powdered milk as he waited in a half-hour checkout
line.
	   Perez, 48, works as a motorcycle messenger for a powerful police
colonel, and his boss had sent him to buy supplies to get his
family through Hurricane Georges, which appeared to be heading
straight this way after pounding Puerto Rico Monday.
	   Perez's family would have to make do on its own.
	   ``If I had any money, I'd stock up too,'' he said. ``But here
poor people aren't worth anything.''
	   Perez makes 1,500 pesos (dlrs 100) a month _ little even by the
standards of this poor Caribbean nation that shares an island with
even poorer Haiti.
	   Like many Dominicans, Perez' home is anything but
hurricane-proof. It is made of wood and sits by the side of a
river, and he worried for his wife and four children.
	   ``I don't want this to be happening,'' he said. ``I'm going to
pray to the Virgin so that it doesn't.''
	   Across the Dominican Republic, a nation of 8 million people,
residents were preparing for devastation on Monday. Hurricane
Georges, which hit the eastern Caribbean Sunday night and then cut
across Puerto Rico to the east, was likely to hit on Tuesday.
	   The government canceled classes in schools and universities, and
stores of all kinds were packed. At the Nacional supermarket in
downtown Santo Domingo, stocker Manuel Urena was leaving open
crates on the floor.
	   ``I don't have time to put things on the shelves,'' he said.
``They're finishing off everything. We're out of crackers, beans,
water _ everything.''
	   Pickup trucks shuttled around town with stacks of plywood
boards, and workers nailed them over windows.
	   ``I've been working since 5 a.m.,'' Ramon Osiris said Monday
evening as he boarded windows at the Napolitano Hotel. ``And when I
finish, I'll go home and do the same there.''
	   Traffic jams formed wherever a gas station was located as people
filled their tanks in expectation of power cuts.
	   ``The unleaded and the diesel is already gone,'' said Rafael
Rosario, a pump attendant at a Texaco station. ``We asked for a
truck, but they say it's the same everywhere.''

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Hurricane Georges, one of the most
powerful storms to hit the Caribbean in years, killed three people
in a Puerto Rico roof collapse Monday as it swept across the island
packing howling winds of up to 110 mph (180 kph).
	   Georges caused extensive property damage in Antigua, St. Kitts,
St. Croix and other smaller Caribbean islands, toppling power
lines, mangling trees and ripping roofs off homes.
	   President Clinton declared Puerto Rico a disaster area,
authorizing release of federal recovery aid.
	   The hurricane appeared headed directly for the island of
Hispaniola, which is shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti.
Many of that island's 15 million people live in substandard housing
that could leave them exposed to Georges' fury.
	   The National Hurricane Center in Miami forecast a landfall in
the Dominican Republic as early as 2 a.m. (0600 GMT) Tuesday.
	   At 7 p.m. EDT (2300 GMT), Georges' center was about 25 miles
south of San Juan at latitude 18.1 north and longitude 66.0 west,
moving west at 16 mph (26 kph). Georges packed hurricane-force
winds of up to 110 mph (180 kph) extending up to 85 miles (140
kilometers) from the eye, mostly to the northeast.
	   The storm caused power and water outages affecting more than
700,000 customers in Puerto Rico, shattered hotel windows and
spawned tornados in central Barranquitas and the island of Vieques.
	   ``Our people have very difficult days to come,'' said Puerto
Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello. ``We are maximally prepared.''
	   Advance teams from the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency,
the FBI and the American Red Cross arrived in the Virgin Islands
and Puerto Rico _ and both territories declared states of emergency
and activated National Guard troops to help evacuations.
	   The hurricane hit Puerto Rico Monday afternoon, destroying at
least 60 homes on the small islands of Vieques and Culebra which
are part of the U.S. territory, said Mari Tere Pacheco, a
spokeswoman for the civil defense authority.
	   A few hours later, three people were killed in the San Juan
area, where almost half the island's 3.8 million residents live.
They died when the roof of their home in the Toa Baja suburb
collapsed on top of them, she said. She did not provide the
victims' identities or other details.
	   Rossello banned liquor sales and ordered officials to open more
than 330 shelters. Banks and schools closed, airlines canceled
flights to and from the U.S. mainland, and ferry service to nearby
islands was suspended.
	   More than 20,000 people left their homes for shelters in San
Juan, Arecibo, Mayaguez and other cities. Some were residents of
the central mountains who feared mudslides and flash floods
resulting from expected rainfall of up to 15 inches (38
centimeters).

Mexican prosecutors weigh evidence against ex-president's brother
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Mexico's Attorney General's Office said
Monday it is analyzing a ``significant amount'' of evidence
regarding possible drug-related activity by Raul Salinas, brother
of former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
	   Prosecutors in Switzerland, where bank accounts belonging to
Raul Salinas were seized in 1995, have reportedly compiled evidence
that Raul Salinas may have accepted bribes to allow drugs to be
shipped through Mexico.
	   ``The Attorney General's Office is analyzing a significant
amount of documentary evidence which indicate specific lines of
investigation'' into Raul Salinas' alleged drug links, the office
said in a press statement.
	   The office said it would not make that evidence public ``to
avoid interfering with the investigation.''
	   The New York Times reported Saturday that Swiss investigators
say that Raul Salinas controlled ``practically all drug shipments
through Mexico,'' and may have received as much as dlrs 500 million
in drug bribes.
	   Lawyers for Raul Salinas have said the report is false.
	   Raul Salinas has been imprisoned and on trial for over three
years on charges of masterminding the 1994 murder of a political
rival, and for illicit enrichment while he held a mid-level
government post during his brother's administration.
	   No specifically drug-related charges have been brought against
him, but he was charged with money laundering and acquitted on a
technicality.

Milutinovic hired as new MetroStars coach
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN TRUSDELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SECAUCUS, New Jersey (AP) _ Former U.S. national team national
coach Bora Milutinovic will be returning to the United States, just
not with the team everybody expected.
	   Milutinovic, who guided the American squad from 1991-1995
including the World Cup and has been named as one of four
candidates to get that job back, was hired on Monday to coach the
foundering New York-New Jersey MetroStars at least through the end
of season.
	   He becomes the club's fifth coach in less than three years, and
replaces Alfonso Mondelo, who took over before this season.
	   Despite having clinched a playoff berth last month, the
MetroStars have lost their last six and vice president and general
manager Charlie Stillitano said the club had not played well since
the MLS All-Star Game on Aug. 2.
	   Last Wednesday's 5-0 rout by Washington D.C. United at home
dropped the club to 14-17 and convinced club management the trend
could not be reversed.
	   ``We would not have made a change just to bring in a new
coach,'' Stillitano said. ``If Bora was not available, a change
would have not been made.''
	   ``Bora has a reputation of being the best to a coach a team
where it's going into a tournament. And let's face it, we're going
into a tournament (the playoffs).''
	   Milutinovic was flying from Mexico to the New York area on
Monday and was to have his first workout with the squad on Tuesday.
	   Stillitano said the decision to try to acquire Milutinovic was
made after the Washington loss and negotiations became ``intense''
over the weekend.
	   Because of the short time frame, a long-term deal could not be
worked out.
	   ``Bora would like to enter a long-term agreement,'' Stillitano
said. ``But because of the short notice, we worked out an agreement
for the rest of this season and will work out a longer deal over
the next two weeks.''
	   Milutinovic's hiring does not necessarily remove him from the
U.S. national team picture, Stillitano said.
	   ``He has expressed interest in a longer-term deal (with the
MetroStars), but also in national team jobs,'' Stillitano said.
	   The MetroStars have only one regular-season game before it
begins its first-round playoff series against the Crew in Columbus
on Sept. 30.
	   Milutinovic is known throughout the world as a soccer mercenary
able to take a team on short notive and achieve immediate success.
He led Mexico to the quarterfinals at the 1986 World Cup, its
highest finish.
	   He took over Costa Rica just before the 1990 World Cup and
stunned many by getting it into the second round. He was introduced
by then U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg in 1991 as
a ``miracle worker'' and proceeded to qualify the United States for
the second round in 1994.
	   He left his post with the U.S. national team in 1995, saying he
was fired for not taking a larger role in player development.
	   Milutinovic appeared again on the world scene in France this
summer, guiding Nigeria into the second round before it was
eliminated by Denmark.
	   The 54-year-old Milutinovic continues the carousel of
high-profile coaches who have stood on the MetroStars' sideline.
Former New York Cosmos coach Eddie Firmani lasted less than two
months of the first season in 1996 before he was replaced by former
Portuguese national team coach Carlos Queiroz.
	   Queiroz left to take a more lucrative position with a Japanese
club and 1994 World Cup champion coach Carlos Alberto Parreira of
Brazil took over for the 1997 season. He left in December to coach
Saudi Arabia in the 1998 World Cup.
	   With the MetroStars, Milutinovic will be reunited with four
players whom he coached during the 1994 World Cup: midfielders Tab
Ramos and Mike Sorber, goalkeeper Tony Meola and defender Alexi
Lalas.
	   Milutinovic had been one of four names bandied about to replace
Sampson, along with Washington D.C. United coach Bruce Arena,
Queiroz and Parreira.
	   Sampson's replacement is expected to be announced before the end
of October.

His streak over, Ripken is back to work
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with result of Monday's game &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ A day after ending his astonishing streak of
2,632 consecutive games, Cal Ripken was back in the starting lineup
for Baltimore on Monday against Toronto, the same team he faced
when the streak started on May 30, 1982.
	   ``No regrets, no second thoughts,'' he said before the game. ``I
felt great about how it went. It was a great celebration instead of
a sad event.''
	   The SkyDome crowd rose to its feet when Ripken trotted to third
base in the bottom of the first inning, and he responded to the
ovation with a wave of his cap.
	   Then in his first at-bat, he singled off Roger Clemens in the
second inning. It was Ripken's 2,874th hit, moving him ahead of
Babe Ruth into sole possession of 34th spot on the career list.
	   Ripken finished 2-for-4 as Clemens struck out 15 in Toronto's
3-1 win over the Orioles.
	   With time to contemplate his decision, Ripken was sure he made
the right move in ending the streak Sunday night. He admitted
feeling strange about watching a game from the dugout, and sounded
relieved to be returning to the field.
	   ``I still consider myself an everyday player,'' he said. ``I
have a lot of baseball left in me.''
	   Ripken closed his record run by removing himself from the
starting lineup in the Orioles' final home game of the season
against the New York Yankees.
	   The move came more than three years after he broke 2,130-game
streak of Yankees iron man Lou Gehrig _ a record that had stood for
56 years.
	   Baltimore manager Ray Miller said he and Ripken had spoken a
couple of times over the past month about the idea of taking days
off.
	   ``I told him this a couple weeks ago ... that 10 or 12 games
off, or maybe 15 games, you would be 10 percent better,'' Miller
recounted Monday. ``I just think that common sense tells me you
would be fresher.''
	   But Miller said he planned to start Ripken for the rest of this
season, and he marveled at what his third baseman had accomplished.
	   ``The streak is mind-boggling,'' Miller said. ``He's 501 games
past an insurmountable number. No one will ever make 2,131.''
	   Ripken isn't so sure.
	   ``If I did it someone else can do it. I don't see myself as
superhuman,'' he said in Baltimore after watching an Orioles' game
from the dugout for the first time since May 29, 1982.
	   There's no telling how long Ripken could have gone. Gehrig's
streak ended when he could no longer cope with a rare muscular
disorder that later became known as Lou Gehrig's disease.
	   Ripken, 38, was completely healthy. He just got tired of the
controversy surrounding the streak _ more than one columnist called
him selfish _ and decided that spring training in 1999 might be
more fun if he didn't have to talk about playing another full
season.

Minor parties raise foreign ownership fears under Oct. 18 treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An international ownership treaty to
be signed Oct. 18 will allow many Australian assets to pass into
foreign hands, the Greens and Australian Democrats warned on
Tuesday.
	   Senate candidates for the two parties protested in Melbourne
over the treaty, titled the Multilateral Agreement on Investment,
or MAI, and intended to be signed by major developed countries.
	   If Australia became a signatory to the agreement, media
ownership, labor rights and the environment would be snapped up by
overseas investors, the candidates claimed.
	   The treaty's ``aim is to create a level playing field _ not for
us, not for countries and their citizens, not for the
environment,'' Greens candidate Charmaine Clarke said.
	   ``It's to create a level playing-field for big business ... to
invest in countries all over the world, unfettered, without any
conditions on how they invest and how they do their business.''
	   Australian Democrats candidate Jim Downey said countries that
signed the agreement would be bound for 20 years, and would be
obliged to roll back environmental restrictions while the agreement
was in force.
	   Both candidates also criticized the secrecy surrounding MAI
negotiations.
	   In New Zealand, leftist parties, Greens and indigenous Maori
groups mounted a strong campaign against the MAI and any New
Zealand participation in the agreement.

Japan's ruling party tries to salvage bank bill deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERIC TALMADGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party tried to keep a compromise
over a crucial set of banking bills alive Tuesday, vowing to stand
by an agreement not to bail out failed lenders with public funds.
	   Yoshiro Mori, secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party,
said the party would stick to its promise not to use a 13 trillion
yen (dlrs 97.5 billion) pool of public funds to bail out the
troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan.
	   Instead, he said, the institution should be dealt with under a
new law to place it temporarily under state control, as opposition
leaders have demanded.
	   Mori's remarks follow a flurry of public disputes between the
ruling party and opposition leaders that have threatened to derail
the proposed bank bill package.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi reached a basic agreement with the
opposition on the package last Friday, just before leaving for the
United States and his first summit with President Clinton.
	   Obuchi is under intense pressure to stabilize Japan's teetering
banking sector, which is awash in an estimated dlrs 1 trillion
worth of bad debt and is seen as a major factor in this country's
decade-long economic slump.
	   Progress on the economy is also of crucial political importance
for Obuchi, whose popularity ratings are among the lowest ever.
	   But signs the pact was unraveling began to emerge almost as soon
as it was announced.
	   The major dispute has been over continued support within the
ruling party for injecting public funds to prop up LTCB, one of
Japan's biggest banks, and other lenders staggering under the
weight of bad loans.
	   Party officials had hinted over the weekend that such a
``soft-landing'' through the use of public funds might still be
arranged for the LTCB, despite the compromise with the opposition.
	   LDP leaders also indicated they were backing away from the
opposition's demand that the Finance Ministry be stripped of its
authority to set policy for the financial industry.
	   Naoto Kan, head of the main opposition Democratic Party, said
the agreement might be scrapped and hinted that his party could try
to force early elections as a result.
	   Mori, speaking at a news conference Tuesday, had no comment on
the Finance Ministry's powers. But he said he hopes to resume talks
with opposition leaders as soon as possible.
	   The opposition has already called for talks with Obuchi as soon
as he returns Thursday.
	   Also Tuesday, Taichi Sakaiya, head of the Economic Planning
Agency, said that if the confusion about the banking bills
persists, ``confidence in Japan's ability, as a country and as a
society, to deal with this problem will decline.''
	   That already appeared to be happening. Concern over the banking
bills sent Tokyo stock prices plunging to a 12-year low on Monday.

Daly says alcoholic shakes a daily occurrence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Daly comments. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos ROG101, ROG102 &QL; 
 &UR; By SCOTT SONNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RENO, Nevada (AP) _ John Daly said the shakes that moved him to
tears at a recent golf tournament occur almost daily. Still, he
believes he has made strides in the past year dealing with his
alcoholism.
	   ``It's pretty much an everyday occurrence. Some days are better
than others,'' Daly said Monday after a golf exhibition at
ArrowCreek Golf Club.
	   ``A lot of people still have them after being 20 years without a
drink. So that scares me a little bit.
	   ``But having them at that time is not good. It scared the hell
out of me,'' he said about the chills and emotions that overcame
him last month in the first round of the Greater Vancouver Open in
late August.
	   Daly appeared relaxed Monday, booming 330-yard (300-meter)
drives and cracking jokes with Lee Trevino, Tom Watson and Fuzzy
Zoeller.
	   He said he took three weeks off to spend time with his wife and
daughter in Palm Springs, California and is looking forward to
teaming with Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara next month at the Dunhill
Cup.
	   ``I didn't even play golf. I thought it was just time to take
some time off,'' Daly said after the best-ball charity event at the
high desert course in the shadow of the Sierra Nevada.
	   ``This was fun today. Golf's not fun when I'm out there on the
tour playing right now. It's because of the way my body has
changed.''
	   Daly said cards and letters from fans along with support from
other alcoholics has been a big help.
	   ``I'm not alone,'' he said. ``Anybody who understands it would
understand what I just said.
	   ``I know I've got a place to go when I get in a situation like
Vancouver. I knew who to call. I knew I didn't want to quit. I
wanted to keep playing,'' said Daly, who played three more holes
that day in Vancouver to finish the round. He played the next day
but failed to make the 36-hole cut.
	   ``I've learned an awful lot about how to keep going in certain
situations when that happens. It's not easy. I wasn't prepared for
it at the U.S. Open like I was at Vancouver,'' he said, referring
to his withdrawing during the second round of the 1997 U.S. Open at
Congressional Country Club.
	   ``I went back and played the next day and really if I would have
made a few putts, I could have made the cut.''
	   Zoeller, a longtime friend, interrupted, ``I told him in
Vancouver, `Hell, you putt better when you are shaking.'''
	   Daly, 32, traded jabs throughout the day with Zoeller, 46, and
Trevino, 58, one of the leaders on the Senior PGA Tour.
	   ``You all are talking about the senior tour. I just hope I'm
alive when I'm 50,'' Daly said, prompting laughter from the
contestants and an invitation-only gallery of several hundred.
	   ``Are you guys going to hit balls all day or are we going to go
play golf?'' Daly shouted at his colleagues on the practice tee.
``You've got 200 years of golf between you, you'd think you'd have
it down by now.''
	   Master of Ceremonies Jack Sheehan asked Daly during a
pre-exhibition clinic if he was healthy.
	   ``Well yeah, I'm healthy all right,'' Daly said.
	   Trevino said, ``I'd rather be sick with money, though.''
	   ``Hey, I am sick,'' Daly responded with a smile.
	   Known for his powerful, long drives _ he drove it 377 yards (343
meters) on the last hole Monday _ he acknowledged he got violent
and liked to break things in the days when alcohol was getting the
best of him.
	   ``Especially windows in cars. That was my fun stuff when I was
drinking. With my fists. When I was really mad and drunk, I used to
do that,'' he said. ``I haven't done that in a while.''
	   Daly, who won the PGA Championship in 1991 and the British Open
in 1995, said he played well early this year. But over his last six
tournaments he missed four cuts, withdrew once and was disqualified
once.
	   ``The putter just went,'' he said.

Clemens wins 20th as Blue Jays down Orioles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be UPDATED with late games &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roger Clemens earned his 20th victory, winning
his 15th straight decision and striking out 15 as he pitched the
Toronto Blue Jays past Cal Ripken and the Baltimore Orioles 3-1 on
Monday night.
	   A day after ending his streak of playing 2,632 straight games,
Ripken returned to the Orioles lineup. He went 2-for-4 and passed
Babe Ruth for 34th on the career list with 2,875 hits.
	   Clemens (20-6), who tied Atlanta's Tom Glavine for the major
league lead in victories, has the longest winning streak since
Gaylord Perry won 15 straight in 1974 for Cleveland. The four-time
20-game winner pitched eight innings, allowing seven hits and three
walks.
	   Dan Plesac got one out for his fourth save.
	   Shawn Green hit his 33rd home run and Carlos Delgado hit his
35th.
	   Scott Erickson (15-13) struck out a career-high 12 in a complete
game.
 &UR; Red Sox 4, Devil Rays 3, 1st game &QC; 
	   In Boston, Keith Mitchell's RBI single in the sixth broke a tie
as Boston beat Tampa Bay to move closer to the American League
wild-card berth.
	   Mike Benjamin followed with another RBI single off Tony Saunders
(6-15). John Valentin hit his 23rd homer in the third to give
Boston a 2-0 lead.
	   Bret Saberhagen (15-7) was the winner. Tom Gordon gave up a
run-scoring single to Rich Butler in the eighth, but got his 43rd
save, extending his major league single-season record to 40
straight successful conversions.
 &UR; Indians 4, Yankees 1 &QC; 
	   In New York, Enrique Wilson hit his first grand slam, leading
Cleveland past New York in a matchup of American League division
champions.
	   The Indians, who beat New York in the first round of the
playoffs last year, are 4-4 this year against the Yankees with
three games remaining.
	   Charles Nagy (15-10) allowed five hits in eight innings, and
Paul Shuey got three outs for his second save. New York's Andy
Pettitte (16-11) gave up eight hits and four runs in seven innings.

`FloJo' set standards for women's track _ in speed and fashion
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to CORRECT that she died of a heart-related
problem. &QL; 
 &UR; By BERT ROSENTHAL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Track Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Florence Griffith Joyner was one of a kind.
	   The fastest women's sprinter in history, she also established
the standards for fashion in track and field.
	   No one has matched the feats she set 10 years ago _ world
records in the 100- and 200-meter dashes, marks that still stand.
And no one has duplicated the flair she displayed _ her flamboyant,
colorful, one-legged outfits, her elaborate, well-polished, 6-inch
(15-cm) fingernails.
	   Sprinter-hurdler Gail Devers and 400-meter hurdler Sandra Farmer
Patrick have tried to emulate the glamour of Griffith Joyner, who
died Monday of a heart-related problem at 38. Devers has become
noted for her extremely long fingernails and Farmer Patrick for her
stylish attire, but neither star has received the acclaim nor
captured the imagination of the flashy, provocative ``FloJo.''
	   Farmer Patrick was devastated by Griffith Joyner's death.
	   ``Florence was like a sister to me,'' she said, crying
uncontrollably. ``We shared so much together. We shared lots of
childhood memories and career goals. We had similar values and
religious beliefs.''
	   Griffith Joyner was the godmother of Farmer Patrick's 4-year-old
daughter, Sierra.
	   ``I chose her because of her strength and her courage,'' Farmer
Patrick said. ``I loved her dearly.''
	   So did many others, even though there were rumblings during the
1988 Olympics that Griffith Joyner was using performance-enhancing
drugs because she appeared bulked up. Nothing ever was proven.
	   One special admirer was President Clinton.
	   ``We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent, and
captivated by her style,'' Clinton said in a statement. ``Though
she rose to the pinnacle of the world of sports, she never forgot
where she came from, devoting time and resources to helping
children _ especially those growing up in our most devastated
neighborhoods _ make the most of their own talents.''
	   Griffith was co-chair of the President's Council on Physical
Fitness and Sports.
	   ``She was very good with kids,'' said John Smith, one of the
premier sprint coaches in the world. ``Whenever she came to see me,
she brought a FloJo doll for my daughter, Noel.''
	   Smith also appreciated her discipline and personality.
	   ``She worked very hard,'' he said. ``She was relentless, she
never stopped. Besides being beautiful, she had a work ethic bar
none. The beauty of her was that she never changed. She was the
same FloJo before and she was the same FloJo after.
	   ``We're going to miss her. She made a great contribution to
track and field, like Wilma Rudolph did before her and like Marion
Jones is doing now.''
	   While many young girls saw FloJo as a role model, she never felt
that way.
	   ``Kids tell me: `FloJo, I want to be just like you,''' she used
to say. ``And I tell them, you have to be yourself first, and
strive to be better than me and set your own goals.''
	   Griffith Joyner authored many children's books, featuring the
character Barry Bam Bam; she wrote poems; she was a beautician, an
artist, a model and a clothes designer; she performed in movies and
television; she did numerous commercial endorsements; she made many
speaking engagements, and she designed the uniforms for the Indiana
Pacers.
	   She did them all with style and grace.
	   Just like she ran.

FloJo, U.S. Olympic track star, dies at age 38
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By KEN PETERS &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MISSION VIEJO, California (AP) _ Florence Griffith Joyner died
Monday at age 38, just a decade after dazzling Olympic track with
speed and glamour that have never been matched.
	   A triple gold medalist at the Seoul Olympics and still the
fastest woman ever, ``FloJo'' was known as much as her skintight
running suits, her flowing hair and her glittering fingernails as
her stunning times.
	   An autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.
Her husband Al Joyner, himself a 1984 triple jump gold medalist,
called authorities after finding her ``unresponsive and not
breathing'' early Monday, according to the Orange County sheriff's
department.
	   Greg Foster, a three-time world champion in the 110-meter
hurdles, said he was told by her family that Griffith Joyner died
of a heart-related problem.
	   Primo Nebiolo, the head of the IAAF, track's international
federation, said he knew Griffith Joyner had ``some serious heart
problems in recent months,'' although one of her brothers, Weldon
Pitts, said she had shown no sign of illness recently.
	   Griffith Joyner had suffered a seizure two years ago on a flight
from California to St. Louis, and was hospitalized for one day. Her
family did not disclose the ailment.
	   Her muscular physique prompted talk of steroid use, but she
insisted she never used performance enhancers and she never failed
a drug test.
	   Griffith Joyner was remembered for her stunning speed and
fashion flamboyance that took track to new levels.
	   ``What Florence brought to track was a flash and a flair that we
didn't have, which was probably good for the sport and got
attention for us,'' said Olympic sprint champion Evelyn Ashford,
one of her main rivals and her Olympic teammate in 1984 and '88.
	   ``We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent, and
captivated by her style,'' added President Clinton. ``Though she
rose to the pinnacle of the world of sports, she never forgot where
she came from, devoting time and resources to helping children _
especially those growing up in our most devastated neighborhoods _
make the most of their own talents.''
	   Along with her sister-in-law, six-time Olympic medalist and
world heptathlon record-holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Griffith
Joyner turned the 1988 Seoul Olympics into a personal showcase.
	   Griffith Joyner still holds world records in the 100- and
200-meter dashes. She set the 100 mark of 10.49 seconds in the
quarterfinals of the 1988 Olympic trials at Indianapolis, and since
then, no one has even broken 10.60. At Seoul, she won the gold
medal in a wind-aided 10.54.
	   She then smashed the world 200 record in the Olympic final,
clocking 21.34. Marion Jones, with a 21.62 at the World Cup in
South Africa earlier this month, is the only other woman to run the
200 in under 21.70.
	   She also won a gold medal in the 400 relay and just missed a
fourth gold medal when the U.S. team finished second in the 1,600
relay, which Griffith Joyner anchored.
	   ``People are still trying to catch the records she set more than
10 years ago. It's an amazing legacy. Many have tried and all have
failed in terms of her records,'' said Carl Lewis, who won nine
Olympic gold medals. ``This (her death) is something that impacts
the sport when the sport is hurting very, very bad.''
	   At the 1988 trials, where she ran the three fastest 100-meter
times ever by a woman and set the American record in the 200, she
also made her mark with her apparel.
	   One eye-catching outfit was a purple bodysuit with a turquoise
bikini brief over it, but with nothing on her left leg, a design
she referred to as a ``one-legger.''
	   At the Olympics, she painted three of her fingernails red, white
and blue, and she painted a fourth gold to signify her goal.
	   At the 1987 World Championships in Rome, she caused a sensation
by running the first two rounds in a skintight suit similar to a
speedskater's togs.
	   ``She liked her fingernails and pretty hair,'' said Ashford.
	   Griffith Joyner was born Dec. 21, 1959, in south Los Angeles,
one of 11 children whose father was an electrical technician and
mother was a teacher.
	   She graduated from Jordan High School in Los Angeles in 1978,
attended Cal State Northridge for two years, then graduated from
UCLA in 1983 with a degree in psychology.
	   She married Al Joyner on Oct. 10, 1987. They have a 7-year-old
daughter, Mary Ruth.
	   For many years, she was coached by Bob Kersee, husband of Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, but Al acted as her coach after the 1988 trials.
	   After her performance in Seoul, Griffith Joyner was voted The
Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year for 1988 and also won
the Sullivan Award as America's top amateur athlete.
	   Griffith Joyner retired from track after the Seoul Olympics, and
she served as co-chair of the President's Council on Physical
Fitness. She tried a comeback before the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta,
but problems with her right Achilles' tendon forced her to abandon
the attempt.

Tokyo stocks lower at midday trading, dollar higher
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stocks fell back at midday Tuesday on
persistent worries about Japan's banking system, while the U.S.
dollar remained higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 31.92 points,
or 0.23 percent, to 13,565.38 at the end of morning trading. On
Monday, the Nikkei closed down 385.82 points, or 2.76 percent, to
13,597.30, its lowest level in 12 years.
	   Steep decline in blue chips and lingering concerns about the
future of key legislation aimed at stabilizing Japan's financial
system dampened sentiment in the stock market, traders said.
	   Earlier Tuesday, prices had risen on futures-led buying and
position-adjustment ahead of a market holiday Wednesday.
	   Japan's ruling and major opposition parties announced late
Friday a ``basic agreement'' on banking bills aimed at resolving
bad-debt problems in the country's banks.
	   But it later emerged that the parties remain far apart on key
issues _ especially on how to deal with troubled Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan.
	   LTCB shares were quoted at 21 yen (16 U.S. cents) a share at the
end of morning trading, unchanged from Monday's finish. Earlier in
the session, the price had slipped to 20 yen (15 cents). On Friday,
it dipped to an all-time low of 18 yen (14 cents).
	   Speaking at a regular news conference, chief government
spokesman Hiromu Nonaka said the government will provide ``public

Australia pressures Malaysia to restore communication links
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Censorship &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Australia on Tuesday put diplomatic
pressure on Malaysia to restore satellite links to foreign TV
stations that complain authorities are trying to stop them
reporting on civil unrest.
	   Australian, British and New Zealand television stations on
Monday said their television broadcasts of unrest in the capital
Kuala Lumpur were being jammed.
	   Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said Tuesday it was
unfortunate a satellite link shared between several television
stations appeared to have been cut by authorities.
	   He said he had called on Malaysia to restore communications.
	   ``This morning I spoke to the Malaysian High Commissioner about
the decision by Malaysia to cut off communications from Australian
television stations back to Australia,' Downer said.
	   ``I said to the High Commissioner I would like that satellite
feed resumed, it's important for Malaysia's international standing
that there is a continuation of free-flow of information in and out
of Malaysia,'' he said.
	   ``It's legitimate that given that we're a regional neighbor of
Malaysia, Australia would want to know what's happening with one of
their regional neighbors,'' Downer said.
	   ``To cut off the satellite link so that our television stations
can't transmit news from Malaysia, I think is unfortunate and we'd
like to see it resumed.''
	   ABC television reported its satellite feed from Kuala Lumpur had
been interrupted and said other Australian commercial stations had
also been affected.
	   On Monday, the BBC said its pictures of riot police cracking
down on protesters awaiting the arrival of ousted deputy premier
Anwar Ibrahim at a courthouse had been interfered with, while
footage of a visit by Queen Elizabeth II had passed without
difficulty.
	   New Zealand's TVNZ said it would demand answers from Malaysian
authorities after its television pictures of Kuala Lumpur riots
were blocked.
	   TVNZ said it believed the pictures, filmed by the Canadian
Broadcasting Corp., were being jammed at the main Malaysian
satellite transmission station.
	   Managing editor Paul Cutler said TVNZ would be seeking an
explanation from the Malaysian information ministry and the High
Commission in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Downer said a consular warning had been issued for Australians
in Malaysia to take care during the political unrest in the
country.

Sympathy for Clinton after release of grand jury deposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ As Bill Clinton's grand jury testimony was aired
around the world, many people expressed sympathy for the president
and revulsion at the spectacle of America dragging its leader
through a ritual of humiliation.
	   From Europe to Asia to the Middle East, men and women in the
street decried what the saw as an erosion of standards protecting
privacy and keeping explicit sexuality out of the mainstream media.
	   ``They didn't have to do this,'' Kensuke Sunato, a 27-year-old
company worker, said in Tokyo. ``I can't help but feel, so what?''
	   In London, the media likened the release of the testimony to
past ages of witch-hunts and inquisitions, and said the latest
development in the Lewinsky affair was as much a blow to America as
to the president.
	   ``This was medieval. It was cruel. This was like bear-baiting,
witch-ducking ... The questions were more offensive than the
answers,'' said a front-page column in the Times. ``It was
humiliating even to the viewer.''
	   Another British paper, The Independent, echoed that view.
	   ``Sordid hounding of the president demeans America,'' read the
headline of its editorial.
	   In Canada, one person reserved the harshest criticism for the
media, accusing it of broadcasting Clinton's deposition to boost
ratings.
	   ``No matter what they say, it's about sex; it's about ratings
and there's no denying that,'' said Gail MacLennan, a freelance
consultant and writer. ``This has just upped the ante in terms of
what is acceptable to expose.''
	   Japanese newspapers gave prominent coverage to Clinton's
deposition, carrying front-page photographs of the videotaped
testimony that showed the president lost in thought or displaying
irritation.
	   The mass-circulation Yomiuri and Mainichi newspapers focused on
how damaging the release of the tape would be to Clinton
politically.
	   ``How will the people judge (Clinton's) real face and natural
voice?'' read a headline in the Yomiuri.
	   In South Korea, one television station speculated on whether the
videotape would be enough to sink Clinton's presidency.
	   ``The Americans saw in their own eyes a new president who lied
before the grand jury. He is at a crossroads,'' MBC-TV said.
	   In Hong Kong, where passers-by watched Clinton on a television
screen at a shopping mall, Lisa Wong said she ``supposed most
people would lie to keep such an affair secret.''
	   And in Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald led with this
headline: ``Humiliation of a president ... in your living room.''
	   As Clinton's grilling by prosecutors played on TV in a London
pub, one man said he already knew more than he wanted to know about
the U.S. president's sex life.
	   ``I don't need to be seeing this,'' said Tony Charlesworth, a
31-year-old London businessman. ``They should only show it to
people who need to see it. They're just humiliating him.''
	   But in Kuwait, former oil minister Ali al-Baghli called it a
historic day.
	   ``The head of the most important country is accounting for
breaking the law, just like any ordinary person. I hope this will
be a lesson to us in the Third World,'' said al-Baghli.
	   Maher bin Naji, a 39-year-old Kuwaiti banker, agreed that airing
the testimony was ``democracy at its peak,'' but said: ``The poor
guy did not do anything. It's his private life and he should not
resign.''
	   In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed outrage.
	   ``I find the whole business extremely upsetting,'' Kohl told
reporters Monday. ``I can only repeat, in my blunt way of saying
it, that it makes me throw up.''
	   Germany's rail company ordered train stations to switch their
TVs away from the broadcast, so children waiting for trains
wouldn't hear the sordid details.
	   In Italy, Clinton's testimony was broadcast on two channels _
one private, one public _ with Italian voiceover.
	   ``Everything they're doing is ridiculous,'' said Andrea Amedeo,
19, a student in Rome. ``He's the leader of America and the world.
... Leave him in peace to worry about the real problems.''
	   In Lebanon, the private Lebanese Broadcasting Corp. appeared to
be the only station in the Middle East carrying the simultaneous
broadcast. In other countries, like Jordan, viewers could watch on
Cable News Network.
	   Many people were glued to television sets in Jordanian coffee
houses and at home.
	   ``I disapprove of broadcasting the tape because I think it is
purely an attack on the democrats and it will not serve any good
for the United States of America,'' said book publisher Usama
Sha'shaa, who was interviewed in the Jordanian capital, Amman.

Second typhoon in two days threatens western Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A powerful typhoon approached southwestern Japan on
Tuesday, just one day after another storm swept through the country
damaging buildings and affecting transport.
	   Typhoon Vicki, packing winds of 144 kilometers per hour (89
miles per hour), was located about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south
of Cape Muroto on the Pacific coast of Shikoku island late Tuesday
morning.
	   The storm was progressing north-northeast toward the Kii
Peninsula about 450 kilometers (280 miles) southwest of Tokyo, the
Meteorological Agency said.
	   A total of 28 domestic flights had been canceled as of 10 a.m.
(0100 GMT) Tuesday, Kyodo News agency reported.
	   Some train services and passenger ship operations in central and
western Japan were also canceled or delayed, Kyodo said.
	   On Monday, a less powerful storm hit western Japan smashing
windows and blowing away roof tiles as it crossed over wide swaths
of the country before dissipating in the Sea of Japan.
	   If Vicky hits land Tuesday, it will be the first time in 10
years that two typhoons have hit Japan on successive days.

Cambodian leaders begin negotiations led by king

<TEXT>
	   SIEM REAP, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's three top political
leaders began talks Tuesday chaired by King Norodom Sihanouk in an
attempt to end the nation's post-election turmoil and pave the way
toward the formation of a new government.
	   But signs that the ruling Cambodian People's Party and the
two-party opposition would be unable to solve their differences
quickly surfaced as junior opposition partner Sam Rainsy arrived in
this northwestern town about an hour before the negotiations were
scheduled to begin.
	   Sam Rainsy, leader of the Sam Rainsy Party which won 15 of 122
seats in the National Assembly, or parliament, told journalists at
the airport that he had been forced to come to the negotiating
table and abandon the opposition's plan to boycott Thursday's
opening of the legislative body.
	   ``I am under threat. This is coercion, so whatever I decide, by
legal standards, is not valid. Anything obtained, extorted under
duress is not valid,'' said Sam Rainsy, who along with opposition
ally Prince Norodom Ranariddh, had threatened to boycott
parliament's opening.
	   Sam Rainsy was referring to a ban on foreign travel Hun Sen
imposed on opposition members of parliament after a grenade attack
on his home earlier this month.
	   No one was hurt in the incident, which the opposition charged
was staged as a pretext for cracking down on dissent. Hun Sen also
threatened to arrest Sam Rainsy, accusing him of being behind the
attack.
	   Despite appeals from Thailand _ which helped mediate among the
rival parties to hold Tuesday's summit _ and the United Nations,
the ban so far has been lifted only for senior opposition leader
Ranariddh of the royalist FUNCINPEC party.
	   He spent the past weekend in Bangkok, Thailand, flying here
Tuesday morning and arriving a half hour late for the talks.
	   Hun Sen arrived in Siem Reap on Monday and visited a fortune
teller at a Buddhist temple located in the famous 12th-century
Angkor Wat temple complex.
	   Ngonh Kruoch, a 70-year-old monk, told him that in coming
activities, ``In search of fortune, you will succeed as you wish.''
	   Hun Sen's party captured a majority of seats in parliament in
the election but not the two-thirds necessary to form a government
by itself.
	   The party leaders will try to ease tensions that erupted into
violence when police suppressed protests against Hun Sen's victory
in the July parliamentary elections. The opposition claims the
ruling party used fraud and intimidation to win the polls.
	   Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, whose parties won 58 seats, organized
spirited street rallies in the capital of Phnom Penh after the
election.
	   The opposition leaders agreed last week, however, to attend the
opening of the National Assembly after violent clashes between
police and demonstrators in the capital threatened to get out of
control.
