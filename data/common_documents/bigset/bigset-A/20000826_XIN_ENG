<HEADLINE> Arafat Holds Talks With Mubarak on Negotiations With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat discussed with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Alexandria Saturday the peace talks with Israel and the future of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders started tete-a-tete talks with Arafat after his
arrival in the Mediterranean port city earlier, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They were later joined by Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Presidential adviser Osama Al Baz,
and Arafat's deputy Abu Mazen, Palestinian Minister of Culture
Yasser Abed Rabo and Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat, both
senior negotiators with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Arafat were expected to exchange views on the latest
developments of the Mideast peace process and the ongoing
consultations held by all parties concerned to the process, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said on Friday Arafat's talks were part of Egypt's
contacts with different sides and were aimed at narrowing the gap
between the Palestinians and Israelis while retaining justice and
balance and respect for U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli summit in Camp David of the United
States ended last month without an agreement largely due to failure
to overcome the differences over the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said earlier Saturday that contacts were under way to
reach a framework regarding the status of Jerusalem. At present,
there are several ideas and options that could resume the peace
talks between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is opposed to Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem,
which the Jewish state occupied in the 1967 Mideast War. Israel has
claimed that the whole of Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided
capital." The Palestinians want at least Arab East Jerusalem as the
capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who will
wrap up an African tour by stopping over in Cairo on Tuesday. The
Egyptian leader will travel to France soon for talks with President
Jacques Chirac on the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Boat Capsizes off Turkish Coast, 3 Illegal Immigrants Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish coast guards have found
three bodies on Saturday after a Turkish boat carrying 32 illegal
immigrants capsized off the coast.
</P>
<P>
The boat, setting off from western Bodrum township of Mugla
province in Aegean region to Kos Island of Greece, sank off Bodrum
shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Greek coast guard boats, backed by a helicopter,
were searching for survivors, but rescue efforts were hampered by
strong winds and rough waters, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Turkish coast guards rescued six people
including the Turkish skipper, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Bodrum township chief Cumhur Guven Tasbasi said that "there were
18 Iraqis, 5 Afghans, 8 Iranians and a woman whose nationality
could not be determined aboard the boat. Search and rescue efforts
are continuing to find missing people."
</P>
<P>
Three out of the six rescued were receiving medical treatment in
the State Hospital of Bodrum township.
</P>
<P>
Tevrat Yanik, 27, the skipper of the boat, was a fisherman from
the western port city Izmir. "I am a fisherman in Guzelbahce
township of Izmir. After I was offered 1,000 U.S. dollars to
smuggle those people to Kos Island, I came to Bodrum from Izmir
three days ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the Afghan immigrants said during interrogation that they
had paid 1,000 dollars per person to flee to Greece.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Turkish security forces intercepted 42 foreigners in
Bodrum as they were trying to proceed to Greece illegally. They
were taken into custody for violating Turkish borders and passport
law.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its geographical position. Many illegal immigrants
attempt to enter European countries via the country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Urges Decentralization of Government Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Saturday urged the decentralization of government powers and
called for participation in state affairs by the people.
</P>
<P>
All strata of the society have the right to participate in
managing state affairs, and power should not be held by a certain
group in order to dominate others, Khatami said at the opening day
of the third Shahid Rejaei Festival.
</P>
<P>
The festival is held annually to commemorate the martyrdom
anniversary of Mohammad Ali Rajaei and Mohammad Javad Bahonar, the
then president and prime minister of the country, who died in a
terrorist bomb explosion in August 1981.
</P>
<P>
Terming "centralization" as the main hurdle to development,
Khatami noted that development means decentralization and fair
distribution of power, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the "master-slave policy" within the governmental
organizations and urged Iranian managers to encourage employees to
participate in the decision-making process in an effort to
contribute to their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president urged the increasing of welfare for
government employees and called for more facilities to be put at
their disposal.
</P>
<P>
"With any rise in inflation, the government would increase
salaries," Khatami said, expressing hope that the government would
approve a decision to exempt those employees with monthly salaries
of less than 1 million rials (about 120 U.S. dollars) from tax.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who took office in 1997, is famous for his programs of
political and social reforms, which encourage freedom of speech and
public participation in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
But the reform programs have been severely hindered by the
conservatives, who have controlled most of the key state organs
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Irked by UAE Firms' Bid to Trade With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Direct representations made by
the companies based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for trade
with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food program has "annoyed" the
United Nations, the official WAM news agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the UAE permanent delegation based in New York,
the U.N. has complained that some companies having commercial ties
with Iraq, under the framework of the humanitarian program,
directly contact the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee to
have their transactions cleared, rather than go through the proper
channels.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials confirmed late last week that the repeated
representations being made had irked the U.N., which expressed its
dissatisfaction to the UAE permanent delegation over the matter,
and urged for a speedy solution in the interests of maintaining the
existing amicable relations.
</P>
<P>
The UAE Foreign Ministry has accordingly directed all the trade
chambers to require their members to route all such clearance
requests only through the country's permanent delegation in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Trade sources said a considerable amount of wheat, rice, corn,
flour, sugar and edible oils, and other essentials such as branded
soaps and unbranded detergents continue to go from the UAE to Iraq
in exchange for oil.
</P>
<P>
They, however, pointed out that such product assays, which were
earlier being conducted locally through Lloyds Register, have since
mid-1999 started to be conducted out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. Under the U.N. oil-for-food program which took
effect in 1996, Iraq is allowed to sell oil, only under U.N.
supervision, to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies
for its people.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Discuss Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Saturday
in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on the Palestinian-
Israeli peace negotiations and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Neither Mubarak nor Arafat spoke to reporters after the talks,
which began with a tete-a-tete meeting between the two leaders and
were later joined by their senior aides, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported. Arafat then left for Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Friday that
Arafat's talks were part of Egypt's intensive consultations with
all parties concerned to the Mideast peace process to help narrow
gaps between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David of the United
States ended last month without any agreement largely due to
failure to overcome the differences over the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Arafat, Mubarak said at a gathering of Egyptian
judges that Jerusalem is the most serious and difficult issue in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and a fair solution must be
found to the question.
</P>
<P>
Contacts and studies have been made in recent days with many
alternatives for a framework agreement, and all are far from
proposals for Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem, Mubarak was
quoted by Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif as telling
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would provide the Palestinians with advice, but would
resist pressure from other parties to influence them, the Egyptian
leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and
has claimed the whole of the city as its "eternal and undivided
capital." The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said on Saturday that he will soon visit France to
discuss the Mideast peace process with President Jacques Chirac.
And on Tuesday, he will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who
is due to conclude an African tour by stopping over in Cairo.

CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DUBAI -- The Autumn 2000 International Fair is due to be
held at Dubai World Trade Center on November 19-23, the Arabic-
language Al-Haiyat daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So far, 11 countries and regions have expressed willingness to
send exhibitors to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
China will send 200 exhibitors to display their products at the
fair. Moldavia will attend the fair for the first time.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has decided
to launch Rafah industrial park later this year, said Abdul-Rahman
Naim, the project director.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is expected to cost 35-40 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industrial park would focus on high-tech industries and it
would house "industrial incubators" which will be built with
foreign investments and in cooperation with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The park is one of the key industrial zones in the Palestinian
self-rule areas as it borders Egypt and funded by the World Bank,
U.S. Development Agency and other donor countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Cairo-based Arab League has decided to launch a
project on capital and trade management to pave the way for the
establishment of a pan-Arab regional financing institution, which
is designed to provide funds for technological development and
scientific research schemes.
</P>
<P>
The move is to meet the increasing needs to fund all applicable
scientific innovations serving the commodity and service sectors,
and give long-grace-period loans and grants to scientific research
centers. The Arab countries spend 5 percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP) on scientific research in the average every year.
</P>
<P>
ABU DUBAI -- For the first time in 20 years, the government of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) might consider lifting the subsidy
on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, still under discussions by domestic oil providers
and the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, was made to
address complaints by local fuel suppliers over the past months
that they suffered heavy losses due to the subsidized gasoline
prices which were in place since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline price should be liberalized in local market,
according to domestic fuel provider sources.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Speaker Reiterates Support for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Mehdi Karrubi here on Saturday reiterated the legislative body's
support for President Mohammad Khatami and his reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The sixth Majlis is a Majlis of reforms and is staunchly
supporting the president's reform policies, Karrubi was quoted by
the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Taro Nakayama, head of a Japanese
parliamentary delegation, Karrubi also praised Khatami's successful
policies of detente and confidence-building in foreign relations,
stressing the parliament's backing for those policies.
</P>
<P>
The sixth Majlis, dominated by Khatami's reformist allies,
started work on May 27. It has vowed to help push forward political
and social reforms in the country despite heavy pressures from the
conservative camp, which suffered a humiliating defeat in
February's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's reform programs, which encourage press freedom and
public participation in state affairs, have met strong opposition
from the conservatives, who have maintained a restrictive cleric
rule since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Karrubi also called for more regional
cooperation, especially cooperation among Asian states.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, Japan with its advanced technology and Iran with
its rich energy and other resources can have wide economic
cooperation, particularly in joint ventures, Karrubi said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Nakayama pointed to the world technology trend and
the process of globalization and called for more parliamentary
cooperation between Iran and Japan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The parliaments can play a significant role in promoting "
dialogue among civilizations," as initiated by President Khatami,
the Japanese official said.

MANAMA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A Boeing 767 carrying 56 bodies of
Egyptians killed in a Gulf Air plane crash three days ago took off
Saturday morning for Egyptian capital Cairo.

ANKARA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet:
</P>
<P>
-- John Wolf, energy adviser of United States President Bill
Clinton for Caspian Basin, came to Ankara on Friday to hold
contacts on Caspian oil and the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline project.
</P>
<P>
Wolf said he believed that the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline project
could be finalized in 2004 in accordance with the schedule as
Turkey would start main engineering works regarding the project
next week, the first step of construction of the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet:
</P>
<P>
-- The Greek Embassy in Ankara clarified on Friday the ambiguity
caused by the visa application for Turkish citizens who want to pay
excursions to Greek islands.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Embassy said the Greek Public Order Ministry had
earlier permitted two companies which organize excursions from
Turkey to Greek islands to bring Turkish citizens to the islands
without the necessity of visa.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that Greece decided to permit such excursions of
other tourism agencies until September 15 only if the companies
inform the Greek Public Order Ministry about the list of the

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Warns to Fight Israel "at Any Time" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese guerrilla group
Hezbollah has said it considers the present calm in south Lebanon "
temporary" and is ready to fight Israel at any time.
</P>
<P>
"We are at a temporary stage which could very easily break out
into warfare because the enemy (Israel) has an aggressive nature,"
Daily Star newspaper quoted Sheikh Naim Qassem, Hezbollah deputy
secretary-general, as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Qassem was responding to comments by Israel's ground force
commander, Major General Moshe Ivry-Sukenik, earlier in the week in
which he warned that Israeli troops would return temporarily to
Lebanon if the Jewish settlement along the border came under
attack.
</P>
<P>
Qassem told participants at a memorial service in the southern
city of Nabatieh that "due to these threats, the only solution is
to be ready to face the enemy."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah
threatened to fire rockets into Galilee if Israel sends troops back
into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"When their settlements were only kilometers away from us, they
were never immune to our danger. What about now when the
settlements are at the mercy of our resistance fighters?" Nasrallah
said in the town of Maaroub in the south.
</P>
<P>
"Does this Israeli general think that attacking Lebanon or its
south or any Lebanese village is a picnic? Does he think we are
still living in 1978 or 1982 (when Israel invaded Lebanon)? After
May 24,2000 we became something completely different," he said,
referring to the date of the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah mocked what he said was Israel's obsession with his
Iranian- and Syrian-backed group. "You are going to hear lots of
talk and threats because the biggest nightmare of the Zionists is
Hezbollah," he said. "They are obsessed with Hezbollah. They are
arresting Palestinians on the pretext that they belong to Lebanon's
Hezbollah."
</P>
<P>
Ivry-Sukenik's threats to send troops into south Lebanon was
directed more at the Israeli Finance Ministry than at Lebanon,
observers said. The Israeli military is locked in its annual battle
with the Finance Ministry over defense budget, which faces further
cuts now that the expense of maintaining the occupation is over.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Expects No Favors From Next Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed
Hassan Nasrallah has said that his party does not expect the
next government to offer it any special favors for ousting the
Israeli army, Daily Star newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow when the new government is formed and ministries are
set up, you will see that Hezbollah does not want any rewards,"
said Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a ceremony held in the town of Hermel in
east to drum up support for the party's election list in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The coming government should shoulder its responsibility and
ameliorate the plight of deprived areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said his party wants to merge the Baalbek-Hermel
region and the former occupation zone into a single administrative
unit.
</P>
<P>
"The liberated areas, Baalbek and Hermel should all be in one
district. This what I told President (Emile) Lahoud and I will
relay the same demand to Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad at our
next meeting," said Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Members of Parliament nor the party can save the area
from deprivation. They are not the government and they are not
ministries. They are parliamentarians who are tasked with following
up the matter. The state and the government are the responsible
parties," he added.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah also defended his election list in Baalbek-Hermel,
waving off allegations that the party's ticket is based on tribal
bias.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will hold parliamentary election since August 27.
Hezbollah now has nine seats in the 128-member parliament.

ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Minister for
Information and Media Development Javed Jabbar said in Lahore on
Friday that there is no danger of any war between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question by newsmen regarding Thursday's
skirmish between Pakistani and Indian troops in Rawalakot sector
of Kashmir, he said that such incidents do occur but it does not
mean that these clashes may lead to a total war between the two
countries, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said that the armed forces of Pakistan are
fully determined and capable of thwarting the enemy designs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the modern wars cannot be initiated on the whims of
a single person as there are many checks and balances in every
country.
</P>
<P>
"Even if some irresponsible ruler of some enemy country plans
for such a misadventurism, the checks and balances in their system
will intervene and prevent such an act," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Prosecutors Send Final Summons to Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's state prosecutors
have delivered a written summons to former president Soeharto
ordering him to appear in court next week to face charges of
massive corruption.
</P>
<P>
The document was handed over Friday to the Soeharto family, and
the 79-year-old former strongman's lawyers, at his Jakarta home by
Muchtar Arifin, the chief prosecutor handling the Soeharto case,
the Indonesian Observer daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a schedule, Soeharto will be tried on August 31 on
the charges of stealing 580 million U.S. dollars from the state by
channeling funds from several huge tax-free charitable foundations.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would happen if Soeharto failed to appear, Arifin
hinted there could be a postponement.
</P>
<P>
"If you are summoned by the court, of course you have to appear.
But it depends on his condition ... we'll see how it goes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto's lawyers said he is tool ill to face trial
on August 31.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Judge Lalu Mariyun said the onus was on the
prosecutors to bring Soeharto to court.
</P>
<P>
He said the trial would open whether or not Soeharto turned up,
but could be adjourned if the prosecutors gave a valid legal
reason for not immediately proceeding.
</P>
<P>
"Within one or two days Soeharto's medical team will determine
whether or not he is fit to stand trial," One of Soeharto's
lawyers Juan Felix Tampubolon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Arifin said an independent team of doctors from state-
owned Cipto Mangunkusumo general Hospital will verify Soeharto's
health before the first hearing scheduled for next Thursday.

<HEADLINE> One More New Bridge in Myanmar Capital Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- One more new bridge, the Aungzeya
Bridge, crossing the Hline River in Yangon division was opened to
traffic Friday, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The suspension steel bridge, which links the division's Insein
and Hlinethaya townships, was constructed by the Public Works of
the Myanmar Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth bridge crossing the Hline river after the
Bayintnaung, Uto and Hline.
</P>
<P>
The 1,135.8-meter-long and 19.2-meter-wide bridge is the second
longest one after the 1,793-meter-long Thanlyin Bridge on the Bago
River in the same division. It also has 90-meter high tower,
becoming the second highest bridge in the country.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was built to ensure smooth and secure transport for
the growing population and traffic of the Hlinethaya township
where a major industrial zone is located.
</P>
<P>
The building of the bridge started in April 1997 and completed
in August this year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf threatens to kill two hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Sayyaf has threatened to
kill two hostages unless police release two of its couriers
arrested with 240,000 U.S. dollars worth of alleged ransom money.
</P>
<P>
One of the Abu Sayyaf leaders, Galib Andang, alias Commander
Robot, raised the idea of beheading two Europeans or two Christian
evangelists at a meeting of the group Friday morning, the local
Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Andang called chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado by
satellite phone to inform him of "their plans if the money and the
couriers are not released as soon as possible," the paper said,
quoting a source present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado confirmed that he had spoken with Andang Friday
morning by phone, but denied that the matter of the seized money
had been raised. He also said the arrests were a "police matter"
that the negotiating panel would leave in police hands.
</P>
<P>
Policemen arrested the two Abu Sayyaf couriers in the southern
city of Zamboanga on Thursday when they were trying to exchange
240,000 dollars of ransom money into pesos at a bank there.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada expressed the hope Friday that the
arrests would not hamper ongoing negotiations for the release of
the 25 remaining hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo island in
the southern province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf rebels are still holding 10 of the 21 hostages
they abducted from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23,
and three French TV journalists and 12 local Christian evangelists
they seized last month in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
So far, the rebel group has freed all the nine Malaysians, one
German woman and one Filipino of the Sipadan group.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had agreed to release all its captives last Saturday
but reneged on its promise, claiming the military was planning
attacks against them.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Joint Efforts Urged to Curb Child Sex Tourism in Asia  by Yang Qingchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- International agencies,
governments, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and tourism
operators in Asia should take joint efforts to curb child sex
tourism in the region, an international meeting resolved here this
week.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), was held here
between August 24 and 25 to increase awareness and forge
coordination to stop the sexual exploitation of children in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Delegates included experts from U.N. agencies and Asian NGOs,
government officials and tourism operators form Australia,
Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has opened up the region, but it also increased
the number of destinations where paedophiles can seek sex with
children," ESCAP social expert Laura Skolnik said in a keynote
speech at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"To respond to this, U.N. agencies like ESCAP, governments,
NGOs and the tourism industry will need work closely to solve the
problem," she said.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper airfares, the opening of countries once closed for war
or politics, and the development of internet in the region have
provided more opportunities for tourist paedophiles to seek child
sex in the region, according to her.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourist paedophiles coming to the region is on
the rise, and the offenders, who have been traditionally from
western countries, now include an increasingly number of people
from some wealthy Asian countries, namely Japan and South Korea,
she said.
</P>
<P>
While Asian countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam have been
known as destinations for such tourists, Thailand, the Philippines
and the Sri Lanka are joining the group, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation are becoming more and more serious," she warned,
saying that latest U.N. figures suggested over one million
children worked in the underage sex trade in Asia.
</P>
<P>
These children are at high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases, said Christin Beddoe, an
expert from an Asian NGO named End Child Prostitution in Asian
Tourism (ECPAT).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said those young victims are facing numerous
social, psychological and emotional problems, such as self-
loathing, fear, humiliation, guilt, dejection and suicide
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
To make the things worse, she noted that there are few health
and social services available to those children, and those who can
get physical treatment often lacking of mental care.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for us to join hands to stop this spreading social
disease, and save those innocent children in the region," she
urged delegates at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, delegates agreed that since the tourism
operators are often the first point of contact for those
paedophile tourists, Asian tourism industry should play a major
role in fighting the illegal sex trade of children.
</P>
<P>
"Tour guides, taxi drivers and other related workers are often
asked by those tourists where to find children for sex," an ESCAP
official said," and frequently, they do not know what they can do
about it or how to report the crimes."
</P>
<P>
"So training tourism operators and other workers in the 'front-
line' to prevent child sexual exploitation is very important," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
To conduct such training, the ESCAP and some NGOs have
announced at the meeting that they will design a training program
on sexual exploitation prevention and awareness for tourism
industry staff and governments in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Delegates representing the tourism industry and governments
have also vowed to take a proactive role in bringing sexual
offenders to justice, and will also work to develop a region-wide
network of concerned organizations and tour operators to share
information on the prevention of child sex tourism.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from governments in Cambodia, the Philippines,
Vietnam and Thailand -- all hotspots for child sex tourism --
promised to set up training program for tour operators and other
related workers in the front line of combating the crime.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, we have not been very aware of the problem
with child sex tourism in our country," said Rafael Relucio, a
delegate from the government of the Philippines, "but that will
change from now on."
</P>
<P>
The Asian effort to curb child sex tourism is also gaining a
world-wide support, delegates said.
</P>
<P>
Several European airlines are now showing in-flight videos on
preventing child sex tourism, and at least 23 countries in the
world have laws allowing prosecution of their citizens for sex
offenses with children overseas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- At least six people died of
gastroenteritis and more than 30 were affected in the last week in
a village of Gorkha district in mid-western Nepal, The Kathmandu
Post said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Unclean water and unhygienic food are the cause of the spread
of the disease, regional health director Yeshobardhan Pradhan was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Unless people give up drinking contaminated water and unclean
food, such kinds of diseases cannot be controlled by providing
medical assistance to the affected areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most rural areas of Nepal are affected with contagious diseases
such as gastroenteritis, malaria, cholera and kala-azar due to
unclean water and unhygienic way of living, especially in the
monsoon season from mid-June to September.

<HEADLINE> AFP Always Loyal to President, Philippine Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) remains a professional organization and will
always be loyal to the president, National Security Adviser
Alexander Aguirre said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre issued the statement as he belied reports linking him
to a spy plot against President Joseph Estrada allegedly involving
some members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG).
</P>
<P>
"Whoever is the President, they will be loyal to that President.
There is no reason to do anything against an incumbent because he
is their Commander-in-Chief. That is always the tendency of our
professional soldiers," Aguirre assured the public in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
A former head of the PSG security and operations branch, Thomas
Dumpit, reportedly claimed that bugging devices have been
installed in the presidential palace by PSG members supportive of
the country's major opposition party, the Lakas-NUCD.
</P>
<P>
In a letter published by the Philippine Daily Inquirer on
Friday Dumpit accused Maj. Gen. Jose Calimlim, vice chief of staff
and head of the intelligence service of the AFP, as the brains of
the eavesdropping operations.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada Friday ordered an immediate investigation
into these claims. And the Senate was said to begin an
investigation into the alleged bugging operations.
</P>
<P>
Lakas leaders vehemently denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said that the only way the PSG can bug the president's
office is if he specifically orders it.
</P>
<P>
He also said the chances of former President Fidel Ramos of
Lakas benefiting from the alleged spy plot are slim, as he, or
Lakas, has nothing to gain from it.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who also served the Aquino and Ramos administrations,
was one of those linked to the alleged plot. But he said there is
no reason for him to do so, as "I was an original Erap (President
Estrada) man since he was Vice President."
</P>
<P>
Aguirre was appointed by then President Ramos as consultant of
then Vice President Estrada when he was head of the Presidential
Anti-Crime Commission, after Aguirre's failed bid for the Senate
in the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim also denied Friday in a statement that he ordered the
bugging on telephone lines of the presidential palace.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Landline Phones to Have Eight Digits by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- All landline telephone numbers in
the Philippines will consist of eight digits by the second quarter
of 2001, a government official said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
National Telecommunications Commission's Common Carrier
Authorization Division Chief Edgardo Cabarios said the move to
increase the landline numbers from seven to eight digits is
necessary to circumvent an anticipated shortage in numbers, the
Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme will be implemented on June 2, 2001,
initially in Metro Manila, and that telephone companies are
advised to inform their subscribers of the changes as early as now
to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
Cabarios said existing subscribers on or before June 2, 2001
will only have one common digit added ahead their seven digits,
while applicants for landline phones after that date will be given
eight-digit numbers, with each telephone company getting a
distinct one number.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 9.9 million landline subscribers as
against 6.8 million unsubscribed lines.

JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- An aftershock measuring 5.5 on
the Richter Scale jolted Bengkulu, capital of Bengkulu province,
Indonesia, early Saturday, but no casualty was reported.
</P>
<P>
The quake occurred at 1:33 a.m. local time and made many

JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputeri on Saturday took over the day-to-day
operations of the government from the president by presiding over
a meeting attended by two coordinating ministers and economic
ministers.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting was opened by President Abdurrahman Wahid and
chaired by Vice President Megawati," Coordinating Minister for
Economy Rizal Ramli said after the meeting held at the Merdeka
Palace here.
</P>
<P>
A 26-strong new cabinet was just sworn in Saturday morning. At

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Industrial Output Up 11.3 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's industrial output
grew by 11.3 percent year-on-year in July 2000, contributed mainly
by the electronics and engineering clusters which surged up 27.4
percent and 11.4 percent respectively, according to the monthly
report released by Singapore's Economic Development Board Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The robust hike in output of the electronics cluster was
boosted by unabated surging global demand for semiconductors which
brought about a robust growth in the outputs of memory chips, PC
processors, computers of newly-launched models, computer
peripherals such as printers and ink cartridges, the printed
circuits boards assembled as well as disk drives.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth in the engineering cluster was lifted by the
30.1 percent rise in output of the precision engineering segment
and the 8.5 percent expansion in output of the process engineering
segment as their advances exceed the declines in the transport
engineering segment which contracted 12.2 percent year-on-year in
July this year.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster recorded a decline of 15.2 percent in
July 2000, dragged down by the 44 percent drop in output of the
pharmaceuticals and 3.7 percent decrease in output of the
petroleum segment as their losses eroded the robust 25.4 percent
growth in output of the industrial/specialty chemicals segment.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative growth for the first seven months of 2000 in
Singapore's industrial output was 13.1 percent higher than in the
same period of last year with the electronics cluster surging up
23.2 percent, the chemicals cluster moving up by a marginal 1.4
percent and the engineering cluster growing by 9.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Urges Labor Sector to Support Pro-Poor Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada urged workers anew Saturday to unite behind his
administration in accomplishing his goal of making Filipinos enjoy
the fruits of sustainable growth and development.
</P>
<P>
"If we unite and if the labor sector cooperates with our
government, I believe we can achieve prosperity in the long run,"
Estrada said on a radio-TV program.
</P>
<P>
He also called on workers nationwide to wait for the regional
wage boards to decide on their petition for pay increases.
</P>
<P>
The labor sector filed a petition for a daily wage hike of 75.5
pesos (1.7 U.S. dollars) in Metro Manila earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need to balance the interests of both labor and
management, he said he must also make sure employers are not
forced to shut down their businesses in the event that the
regional wage and productivity boards decide on new wage
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
The president said generating enough jobs for Filipinos is the
foundation of the economy and would be one of his long-term
solutions to poverty.
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts on this front have already yielded
concrete results with the creation of more than one million jobs,
mostly in the agriculture sector, since he assumed office in 1998,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Department of Labor and Employment Secretary
Bienvenido Laguesma predicted an improvement in the employment
picture from April, when an unemployment rate of 13.9 percent was
recorded, the highest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The National Statistics Office is processing the figures for
July, but we believe the picture would be better than that in
April," he said,
</P>
<P>
He also said his department will meet next week with
petitioners from the labor sector.
</P>
<P>
"Any decision must be carefully considered so that we can take
into account the capacity of employers to grant wage hikes," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 800,000 Filipinos Leave to Seek Jobs Abroad Yearly: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 800,000 Filipinos leave
their country every year to seek jobs abroad, a government
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a TV program, Ang Pasada ng Pangulo, chief of the
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, also said there are
now some 5.5 million Filipinos working abroad.
</P>
<P>
These statistics, however, do not include undocumented Filipino
workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials estimate that the number of Filipinos working
abroad amounts to 7 million. Overseas Filipino workers remit back
some 7 billion U.S. dollars every year, a major source of the
country's foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Regalado said the Philippines remains to be a source of skilled
workers for many countries such as the United Kingdom and the
United States where there has been huge demand for Filipino nurses
since last year.
</P>
<P>
These two countries, according to him, also have high demand
for Filipino workers in health care services and information
technology,resulting in the increase of 6.4 percent in the
deployment of the skilled workers category to foreign countries
for the last six months.
</P>
<P>
Regalado noted that Saudi Arabia, despite its nationalization
policies, continues to hire the biggest number of overseas
Filipino workers.

<HEADLINE> Australians Debate on Nuclear Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A debate has started in
Australia on whether the country's Lucas Heights nuclear reactor
should be shut down.
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear campaigners and environmentalists urged that the
reactor should be shut down during the Olympic Games next month
after a possible terrorist plot to attack it during the Olympics
was revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press reported Saturday that
detectives in Auckland, New Zealand, were investigating an
immigration racket in March when they stumbled on plans which
appeared to point to an attack on the Lucas Heights reactor. New
Zealand police found those involved were sympathizers of alleged
terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Australian Science Minister Nick Minchin said however that the
Lucas Heights reactor would not be closed.
</P>
<P>
The reactor, built in Sydney's outskirts more than 40 years ago,
is now surrounded by housing in the city's south. It is used for
scientific and medical research and is much smaller than an
electricity-generating nuclear reactor, producing about 10
megawatts of thermal energy compared with 3,000 megawatts of an
electricity-generating reactor.
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear campaigners believe the reactor is dangerous. A
meltdown would take just eight minutes, leaving no time to
evacuate nearby suburbs, they said.

<P>
YANGON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's opposition political
party leader Aung San Suu Kyi continued to be barred by the
authorities from travelling further Saturday after she reached
Dala township in Yangon division on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Together with two other party leaders, Aung San Suu Kyi,
general secretary of the National League for Democracy, left
Yangon for Dala to carry out party activities on Friday morning,
crossing the Yangon River. She was blocked by the local
authorities from travelling further after arriving at Dala.
</P>
<P>
According to a government-released information sheet Saturday
afternoon, she had stayed at Sarpachaun ward in Dala by the
roadside until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The information sheet said the security conditions make it
unsafe for her to travel to Twante, a nearby area, adding that the
local authorities have told her to return home.
</P>
<P>
Heavy police presence remains around the clock at the nearby
area where she "rests," it said.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi's health condition is unknown.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban on Aung San Suu Kyi came two years after she was
prevented from doing so in August 1998. During that incident, she
remained in her car by the roadside for six days under the sun and
rain,endangering her life.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Aung San Suu Kyi, despite release from
nearly six years' house arrest in July 1995, seems to be still
under restriction to move outside Yangon.

NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A British woman and her son
were clubbed to death while her husband was seriously injured by
miscreants Friday in northwest India, the Press Trust of India (
PTI) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Local police said the family was on a trekking expedition in
the interior areas of Manikarn in Kullu District near Shimla, a
summer resort 340 kilometers northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
The assailants, armed with laths, attacked the family and threw
them away and then decamped with cash amounting to 500 U.S.
dollars, a sophisticated camera and their passports.
</P>
<P>
The husband survived the attack and was later taken to a local
hospital for treatment, police said, adding that the family
strangely did not take the help of a porter or guide and went into
the interiors without informing the authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
Tourists normally inform the district administration and take
some local people along as a precaution when they are on trekking
expeditions.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Protests India's Trespassing on Diplomat's Residence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan lodged a strong
protest on Friday with India against what it called trespassing on
the residence of an official of its high commission in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the Pakistani Foreign Office, the
protest was conveyed to India's deputy high commissioner in
Islamabad who was summoned to the Pakistani Foreign Ministry in
the evening.
</P>
<P>
At around 11:00 hours Friday, six persons in civilian clothes
forced their way into the residence of the air adviser and carried
out an unauthorized search, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the group introduced himself as Bindra, deputy
commissioner of police in the Central Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
"This incident of trespassing is in gross breach of the Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 and of the Code of
Conduct for Treatment of Diplomatic Personnel in Pakistan and
India signed by the two countries in 1992," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The trespassing on the residence of the air advisor followed
closely the expulsion by India on Thursday of an official of the
Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Pakistan has urged the government of India
to take immediate measures to ensure that such incidents are not
repeated," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added, "Furthermore, Pakistan has once again called upon
India to fully respect its obligations under international law to
ensure the safety and security of the Pakistan High Commission,its
personnel and their residences and property."

<HEADLINE> Rule of Law Not Determined by One Incident, Says Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of State for
Information and Publicity Jonathan Moyo Saturday said the rule of
law in the country cannot be said to have collapsed because of one
incident, The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from reporters at a Media Institute of
Southern Africa annual general meeting in Harare on Saturday, Moyo
said the rule of law could not be based on one thing only.
</P>
<P>
Farm occupations by the war veterans were not an indication of
a breakdown in law but a clear testimony of the need for land
redistribution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Journalists at the meeting had alleged that there was now a
breakdown of the rule of law in the country following farm
occupations by the war veterans and land hungry villagers.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said, "Rule of law does not collapse because one
particular thing is not being done, when all other things are
working. The courts, the economy and all other things are working.
"
</P>
<P>
He said the government policy was clear on the issue of war
veterans on the farms. Those occupying farms that were earmarked
for acquisition would not be moved. Nobody was allowed to touch
or damage the property at those farms they occupied.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said people needed to understand that correction of
historical imbalances had never been easy, as it was not a usual
event.
</P>
<P>
He said in other countries the governments there had
nationalized all the land. If the government resorted to that
there would be an even bigger outcry, indicating that the current
land acquisition was "the best and fairest" method under the
circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Rejects WB's Loan for Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- For fear of further swelling its
external debt burden, Malawi has rejected a loan of 40 million U.S.
dollars from World Bank (WB) aimed at curbing the further spread
of HIV/AIDS in the country, Zambia's Sunday Mail newspaper
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the country's Deputy Health Minister Philip Bwanali
as saying the loan was offered during the recent health and
finance ministers' AIDS summit in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's practically unthinkable to get such a loan for
non-productive usage like the fight against HIV/AIDS," he said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
Bwanali said Malawi needed at least 161 million dollars to
fight the incurable disease but had so far only sourced 121
million dollars, leaving a shortfall of 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that while the government took the fight against HIV/
AIDS seriously, taking a loan to fight the pandemic would not be
advisable since Malawi is already reeling under an external debt
of over two billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It could be immoral for Malawi which is already heavily
indebted to get another loan, the best thing the bank can do is to
give us a grant," he said.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- About 400 Angolans have just
crossed into Zambia through Zambezi District in the North Western
Province to seek refugee because of insecurity in their country,
Zambia's Sunday Mail newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zambezi District Administrator Willie Manjomba said on Saturday
that there was an influx of more refugees in the area.
</P>
<P>
Manjomba said he had just sent security officers to make a
physical count of the refugees to ascertain the exact number of
the asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugees started arriving in the country on
Thursday and that the latest influx was a source of concern as
more resources would be needed to meet their immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) statistics, there are about 224,500 refugees in
Zambia and the number is steadily rising.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Power Supply to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's electricity supply will
be significantly boosted in two months, easing the severe power
rationing by the end of October, said the Ministry of Energy.
</P>
<P>
Three World Bank-funded emergency diesel power plants will be
in operations in September and October with installed capacity of
over 110 megawatts, Sunday Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Taking into the additional 40 megawatts from independent power
producers in the next two months, the current shortfall of 180
megawatts could be negligible, an official at the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The extent of the short rains in October will determine whether
the rationing will be completely lifted because most power in
Kenya comes from hydropower plants.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has rationed power since last September,
which has hampered the industry sector and disrupted daily lives
of ordinary people.

LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is one of the sub-Sahara

complications, according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Saturday quoted Dr. Frida Kazemba, Chairperson of

NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for
Animal Welfare (IFAW) has granted 1.25 million U.S. dollars to the

Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The grant contract was signed here Friday between KWS Director

</P>
<P>
Part of the money, about 250,000 dollars, will be used to

tourist destination and a contributor to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that already 15 elephants and 10 giraffes had
been relocated to the park, and the number of giraffes is expected
to increase to 100 in next few months.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Risks EU Fish Ban Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Hardly a month after the
European Union (EU) lifted the fish export ban on Uganda, there
are fears that the ban could be reinstated, the Monitor daily, an
independent newspaper in Uganda, reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A team from the EU Veterinary Inspection Mission is scheduled
to come to Uganda from October 2 to 6 to assess how far Uganda has
fulfilled the conditions that were set when the ban was
provisionally lifted on August 4, said the report.
</P>
<P>
But the country lies far behind schedule, according to sources
from Uganda Investment Authority (UIA).
</P>
<P>
The government has delayed releasing money to facilitate the
modernization of landing sites, fish processing and documentation
to match the standards required of the EU, James Mutende, an
Investment Executive with UIA, told the Monitor Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are time barred. We risk having the ban reinstated if they
find that we haven't fulfilled the requirements," said Mutende.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has delayed releasing 116,200 U.S.
dollars to the department of fisheries to provide fences, gates,
water systems, floating jetty and offices for inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Should the government fail to release the money by the end of
next week, chances of our being ready for the team will be very,
very low," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fish ban was imposed on Uganda's exports in March last year,
citing poor hygiene, sanitation and the presence of pesticides in
the fishing waters. The ban cost the country close to 100 million
U.S. dollars of direct exports, revenues to the government,
incomes to fishermen and other related activities.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Re-negotiation of Lusaka Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has urged the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to ask Uganda and Rwanda to
go back to the drawing table and work on the one year-old Lusaka
peace pact so that it can be implemented more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The independent Guardian newspaper Saturday quoted Jakaya
Kikwete, Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation, as saying that the pact signatories should go back to
the drawing board if necessary.
</P>
<P>
"If the solution towards the implementation of the peace pact
can be obtained through re-negotiation, as demanded by the
Kinshasa government, then Tanzania supports it," the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said on Friday that Tanzania accepted Congolese
President Laurent Kabila's demand for the re-negotiation of the
pact in the light of new developments caused by the delay in
implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania's position on the Congo problem was still that
adopted by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)
extraordinary summit held in Lusaka last week to try to revive the
peace pact.
</P>
<P>
During the summit SADC heads of state and government asked the
DRC government to abide by the peace pact and give the necessary
cooperation to the United Nations peace observers currently in the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila said this week his government cannot in any
way implement the pact, which was supposed to bring an end to a
two-year civil war, as new developments have emerged since it was
sealed in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Congo's human rights minister Leonard She Okitundu told
diplomats at an open meeting in Kinshasa on Wednesday that Congo
had decided to suspend implementation of the Lusaka accord and
wanted to have fresh and direct talks with Rwanda, Uganda and
Burundi to try to solve the wider, regional issues that have
helped fuel the war.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda rejected that on Thursday, with Foreign Minister Andre
Bumaya saying the Lusaka accord offered the only way out of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the DRC started in 1998 when rebel forces, backed
by Kabila's former allies Rwanda and Uganda, turned on the
Congolese president, who fought them back with support from Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda-Uganda alliance fell apart after they backed rival
rebel groups, and the two countries have fought one another
intermittently in the northern Congolese city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire was agreed in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, in July
1999, but it has not been respected by any of the parties.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Africa to Prevent Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Under-Secretary
Ibrahim Gambari said here Sunday that Africa should make efforts
to prevent conflicts instead of falling back on the last option of
peacekeeping which yields few positive results.
</P>
<P>
Gambari, who is also Special Advisor to the U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, arrived here on Friday for a fact-finding
mission to establish the effects of the Angolan war on Zambia and
Namibia which share borders with the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with acting Zambian Foreign Minister Peter
Machungwa, Gambari said Annan is doing everything in his power to
try to bring lasting peace to Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official is expected to meet Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba Monday before going to Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa told the U.N. envoy that Zambia has been affected
adversely by the continuous war in Angola, because of which some
Zambians in the border areas have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the worsening refugee situation, Zambian lives and
property have been lost in the cross-border raids by Angolans,
Machungwa said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is faced with the challenge of
accommodating a growing number of refugees from Angola and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
There are at present over 230,000 refugees in Zambia, 160,000
of which are from Angola.

<HEADLINE> Iran still Wants to be WTO Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) Visiting Foreign Minister of Iran
Kamal Kharrazi Saturday said in Harare that his country will
pursue its application for membership in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) after being initially blocked on political
grounds.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who was on a three-day official visit to Zimbabwe,
Saturday told the Zimbabwe News Agency Iran is keen to become a
member of the WTO but the United States has been blocking it.
</P>
<P>
""We are still not a member of the WTO because the U.S. is
using its political and financial muscle to interfere in our own
affairs as a country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's hopes now lie on negotiations with WTO General
Council.
</P>
<P>
Iran first applied to join the WTO five years ago but was told
the application document had been lost and was asked to file a new
one. Iran re-applied and is still awaiting a response, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been accusing Iran, among other Islamic states, of
funding terrorist attacks on American interests.
</P>
<P>
However, since the coming into power of President Khatemi, the
relations between the two countries have been thawing and Kharrazi
hopes this will help his country join the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Namibia's Envoy on Land Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) The Namibian government has
managed to acquire just 20 farms on a willing-buyer-willing-seller
basis since independence in 1990 and is yet to decide what to do
next, a Namibia's envoy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Herald in Harare on Friday, just
before he met Zimbabwean vice-president Joseph Msika, Namibian
High Commissioner to Zimbabwe Ndali-Che Kamati spoke of the
Namibian government's efforts to acquire land.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have been trying the willing-buyer-willing-seller
strategy but it has proved to be unsuitable because the land is
very expensive."
</P>
<P>
Although his government had not yet made any firm decisions on
how to proceed next, farmers who own more than one farm, derelict
farms and farms owned by absentee landlords would be targeted for
acquisition, he said.
</P>
<P>
The High Commissioner said his country, like others in the
region, is watching the land redistribution in Zimbabwe with great
interest.
</P>
<P>
"I would like the vice-president to brief me of the latest
developments and the progress made so far. Namibia is having the
same problem and we have a lot to learn," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he also wanted to brief vice-president Joseph Msika on
the Namibian land experience, adding that most of the country's
arable land is still in the hands of the white minority.
</P>
<P>
The black community has no role to play in commercial farming,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss and negotiate with the owners of these farms
and the outcome will depend on their attitude. If they are
cooperative, the process will be smooth but if they are not, it
might be rough," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has adopted a policy to compulsorily
acquire land from white farmers who own more than one farm.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to acquire at least five million hectares
to resettle thousands of landless Zimbabweans.

<HEADLINE> S. African Cameraman Back Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking shortly after his return at the Johannesburg
International Airport, where he was met by his elated family and a
large media contingent, Radebe said: "The conditions (in jail) are
best described as hell."
</P>
<P>
Visibly relieved, the freelance cameraman said he was grateful
for the support he received from the South African government,
particularly former president Nelson Mandela during his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
Radebe said he plans to personally thank the elderly South
African statesman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Without Nelson I would be stuffed. Without Nelson I would
still be in jail. I don't think the words 'thank you' say enough,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Radebe, along with his three colleagues making a three-part
documentary in Liberia, has-been held in a central Monrovia jail
for a week after being charged with espionage by the Liberian
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
He was freed on Friday afternoon after Liberian authorities
bowed to mounting international pressure.
</P>
<P>
"I went to Liberia as a freelance cameraman to cover a story
about the Liberian people. I don't know how it became espionage,"
said Radebe.
</P>
<P>
Liberian ambassador to South Africa Llewellyn Witherspoon, who
attended the briefing, said he has not received an official
notification from his government informing him of the journalists'
detention.
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate but never should have happened. They (the
Liberian government) lost an opportunity on the first day and
could have limited the impact instead of drawing out the
allegations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Witherspoon added that the gains to improve the country's image
abroad has been negated by the debacle, saying "This has yet again
sunk us into the abyss".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Tolerance in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton called here on Saturday for religious and ethnic tolerance
in Nigeria, saying Nigeria must remain united in order to prosper.
</P>
<P>
His appeal was apparently relating to the frequent religious
and ethnic conflicts in recent years, which has threatened to tear
the most populous African country apart.
</P>
<P>
In his one-hour speech at a joint session of the country's top
legislature, the National Assembly, Clinton praised the role
Nigeria has played in making peace in the West African sub-region,
which he said had cost the country 10 billion U.S. dollars despite
the country's economic odds.
</P>
<P>
He said such a role could only be played by such a regional
power as Nigeria. However, it is unfair for Nigeria to play the
role alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged America's support for peacekeeping operations in the
sub-region, especially in Sierra Leone. He said American experts
had already begun the training of five battalions of Nigerian
troops for future peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
On debt remission, Clinton promised to push its Western allies
for a substantial reduction of Nigeria's 30 billion U.S. dollars
foreign debts. He enjoined the legislators to play their parts to
ensure the benefit from the debt reduction went to the average
Nigerian people.
</P>
<P>
Before his address, Clinton held talks with Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo on debt remission, military cooperation,
regional peace, oil price hike as well as AIDS among other topics.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here on Saturday morning for a two-day state
visit to Nigeria, accompanied by many high- ranking officials,
including Secretaries of Transport and Labor, Vice Trade
Representative, two assistant secretaries of state, chairman of
the U.S. Import and Export Bank and Jessi Jackson, U.S. special
envoy to Africa, as well as 13 congressmen and hundreds of
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was the second American president to visit Nigeria
after Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. It was also Clinton' s second
trip to Africa as U.S. president since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nigeria to Help Check Rising Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton appealed to his host Nigerian counterpart Olusegun
Obasanjo on Saturday to "do what he could" to help stabilize the
rising prices of oil in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint news conference at the State House in the
capital, Clinton said although Nigeria did not have the capacity
to effect any changes in the current prices of oil, it could still
work with its colleagues in the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to adjust their production capacities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, arrived in Abuja on Saturday morning for a two-day
visit to the most populous African country, said that the current
prices were too high, suggesting that the ideal rates should be
around 20 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Obasanjo assured his American counterpart that
Nigeria would collaborate with its OPEC colleagues at the summit
in Venezuela next month to bring down the prices of oil to a
reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
"Excessive high price is not good for both the producer and
consumer," said Obasanjo, adding that excessive low price of oil
was also not good for both parties.
</P>
<P>
A mechanism to bring the price to a reasonable level must be
evolved, added the president.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Nigeria is America's fifth largest supplier
of oil, accounting for about eight percent of the country's total
oil import.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Optimistic about Signing of Burundi Peace Accord Next Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The facilitator for
Burundi peace talks, former South African President Nelson Mandela
has expressed his optimism that the 19 parties involved in the
talks will sign a peace agreement next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived on Saturday in northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha where the signing ceremony will take place, said he is
positive that the outstanding issues will be resolved in the
remaining 48 hours to reach consensus on the draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic that a deal could be signed on Monday. I don't
see any problems at all. I think we are going to sign," Mandela
told journalists on his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's remarks came after reports from Bujumbura that pro-
Tutsi parties will not sign the accord until all details have been
completed.
</P>
<P>
The details include who is going to lead the transitional
government, electoral system and cease-fire arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed accord, the Tutsis, who have dominated
political and economic life in Burundi since its independence in
1962, would have to hand over power to an elected government in
three years' time.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Koffi Annan was considering
sending U.N. forces to enforce the peace agreement during the
transitional period, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was expected to meet leaders of the Burundi parties
individually beginning on Saturday to iron out remaining obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Twelve foreign heads of state including U.S. President Bill
Clinton have confirmed to witness the signing of the peace accord,
a culmination of two years of intensive talks aimed at ending the
seven-year civil war in the central African country between Hutu
rebels and the Burundian army and government dominated by Tutsi
minority.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Help Cut Nigeria's Debt Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting American President Bill
Clinton assured his host Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo
here on Saturday that he would personally plead with the Paris
Club of creditor states to lighten Nigeria's debt burden amounting
to 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference after his talks with
Obasanjo at the State House, Clinton said that the United States
would do all it could to make the Paris Club reschedule its debt.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived here Saturday for a two-day state visit,
said Nigeria should be awarded some debt relief in return for its
commitment to economic reform and democracy following the country'
s long-term military rule.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that Nigeria's major creditors might not
agree with the United States, which owned only four percent of
Nigeria's total debt, on granting debt relief.
</P>
<P>
The elected government of Obasanjo has been campaigning for
debt forgiveness as a crucial measure to revive the ailing economy
since its inauguration on May 29,1999.

<P>
ABUJA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton pledged here on Saturday to continue to work with a "
sense of urgency" in order to bring about a peace accord between
the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after talks with his host
Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo at the State House, Clinton
played down expectations for his scheduled meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the public should not expect too much out of
his meeting with Mubarak, who met Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli acting foreign minister last week.
</P>
<P>
"We are working with a sense of urgency given the timetable
that the parties have set for themselves," said Clinton, adding
that he was pleased the parties concerned were still working to
consolidate the gains so far made.
</P>
<P>
The tri-party marathon summit at Camp David between Clinton and
Israeli and Palestinian leaders collapsed on July 25 over a series
of disputes, especially on the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived in the Nigerian capital Abuja earlier
Saturday for a two-day state visit, is scheduled to leave for
Arusha, Tanzania to witness Monday's signing of a Burundi peace
deal, brokered by former South African president Nelson Mandela.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The British Defense Ministry said
here Saturday that 12 British soldiers in Sierra Leone have lost
contact with their base.
</P>
<P>
"We have lost contact with a group of 12 soldiers in Sierra
Leone about 12 hours ago. We would have expected to hear from them
by now," a Reuters report quoted a Ministry of Defense official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers have gone missing in the Benguema area where the
training camp is located," the spokesman said, adding that
Benguema is northeast of Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The British soldiers might have lost touch due to something as
simple as a radio malfunction. But the Ministry of Defense had not
ruled out a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 400 British troops in Sierra Leone,
training the government forces. Britain sent its soldiers to
Sierra Leone last may to intervene when rebels defied a 1999 peace
deal and marched on Freetown, wrong-footing an ill-prepared United
Nations operation.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage by the rebels
but were later released and Britain withdrew most of its forces,
except the training detachment, handing over to the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone has been a colony of Britain. A brutal civil war
broke out between the government and rebels on and off since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Freed by Liberia Arrive in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The four journalists released by
Liberia after a week of detention arrived here in Saturday,
telling a press conference that they had feared for their lives.
</P>
<P>
They told a news conference, held shortly after they arrived at
London's Heathrow airport, that they had been threatened by the
Liberian guards.
</P>
<P>
"They were brandishing a knife and said: 'we are going to split
your heart open' and I thought that was the end," said Sorious
Samura, a journalist from Sierra Leone who was among the four
arrested in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Liberian government agreed to drop all charges
against the journalists, two Britons, a South African and a Sierra
Leonean, who were working for London-based Channel 4 Television.
</P>
<P>
The journalists were requested to write a letter to Liberian
President Charles Taylor to apologize "for any offense" that their
"action or statements have caused."
</P>
<P>
The journalists had been in Liberia three weeks working on a
documentary when they were arrested a week ago at their hotel in
the capital, Monrovia. They were formally charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
The indictment said the Liberian government believed their
documentary would try to support British and U.S. allegations of
Liberian government involvement in diamond smuggling and
gunrunning for rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> BT to Double Price of Call From Payphone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications (BT)
is set to double the cost of a payphone call from the traditional
10p to a minimum 20p fee -- the first rise in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The company will also start charging for domestic and
international directory inquiries from phone boxes, which are
currently free.
</P>
<P>
BT said in an announcement released Saturday that the charge
revisions have been prompted by a decline in payphone users, who
are switching to mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Newing, the director of BT Payphones, said the rise was
in line with inflation since the last price hike in 1984 when the
minimum charge was increased from 2p to 10p.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Association has demanded an inquiry by telecoms
regulator Oftel into the effects of a new tariff structure, which
will into effect from 3 October.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's Office of Telecommunications said it
had no control over charges, even though BT has a legal obligation
to provide affordable access to payphones.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Keeps Reinforcing Border With Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran Armed Forces high
command is deploying elite units to reinforce the security of the
border with Colombia in the province of Esmeraldas as the
implementation of the Plan Colombia operations gets closer.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 paratroopers of the Special Forces Group, deployed in
Santo Domingo de los Colorados, in the center-west littoral of
Ecuador, are being sent to Esmeraldas, capital of the province of
the same name, in the western end of the country, authorities said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The operations began Monday this week and will conclude next
Monday, and is aimed at "reinforcing the security of the border
with Colombia and preventing the infiltration of rebel forces of
that country into Ecuadoran territory.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran government and the armed forces high command have
said that they will reinforce militarily all the border strip with
its neighbor to the north in preparation for the impending start
of the Plan Colombia operations.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Heinz Moeller said after the return
of President Gustavo Noboa from an official visit to Colombia that
his country "must maintain a status of constructive alertness"
toward the Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Noboa and his foreign minister have repeatedly said that the
Quito government gives its political, but not military, support to
the Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
They consider that this plan "has drifted into a warring plan
to combat the insurgent groups and militarize the war against drug
traffic" with the risk that the Colombian internal conflict will
expand and will encourage the United States to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the Plan Colombia, the United States
will pour 1.3 billion dollars in aid into Colombia over the next
two years, mostly in military backing for a drive against drug
traffickers and armed rebels protecting cocaine and heroin
production in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
Latin American nations including Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela
are keeping a wary eye on the situation of Colombia.

<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British police said Saturday that
they had uncovered a cache of explosives in a remote woodland area
some 96 kilometers west of London.
</P>
<P>
The cache was found in woods by a man walking his dog. Police
said a terrorist bombing campaign may have been averted after a
cache of "sophisticated" explosive devices were found in a copse
in the remote woodland near Oxford.
</P>
<P>
Anti-terrorist police officers and army bomb disposal officers
were called in, and forensic experts were still examining the
scene Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Detective Superintendent John
Donlon of Thames Valley Police said the eight devices were
contained in clear plastic water bottles, each packed with
explosives and three kilograms of brass nuts.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery was being linked to an identical device
found last Sunday on a stone wall at Syreford, near Cheltenham,
now thought to be a "test" device.
</P>
<P>
The incident was under further investigation.

<HEADLINE> New Ecuadoran Coins To Arrive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The new divisional coins made in
Mexico will arrive this weekend in Ecuador, said Central Bank
General Manager Leopoldo Baez Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The coins represent fractions of a dollar, meaning 50, 25, 10,
and five cents of a dollar, but with effigies of outstanding
Ecuadoran personalities.
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet whether the coins will enter circulation
immediately or if a special date will be waited for to present
them to the country, which will also receive coins minted in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The sucre currently in circulation will disappear as the local
currency on September 9 in agreement with the "dollarization"
program that imposes the dollar as a standard of exchange.
</P>
<P>
The "dollarization" process started in Ecuador in April, two
months after it was announced by the deposed president Jamil
Mahuad (August of 1998-January of 2000).
</P>
<P>
The Mahuad government determined the rate of exchange with the
dollar at 25,000 sucres. The quotation was in January of 1999 at
an average of 7,119 sucres for one dollar.

<HEADLINE> South African Swimming Coach Cleared After Drug Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African swimming coach
Graham Hill Friday was embarrassed, but in the clear, after a drug
seizure by the Australian Customs Service at Perth Airport.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials detained a small quantity of the dietary
supplement Hydroxycut, which contains 0.01 gm per tablet of the
banned substance Ethedrine, from Hill on Wednesday but Friday
described the incident as an "everyday event."
</P>
<P>
The Customs said in a media release that for the purposes of
Customs legislation, the substance was not classified as a
performance enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
It said Hill had not breached Customs legislation.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who took Hydroxycut to control his own weight, was
horrified Friday when radio reports claimed an unnamed South
African coach had been caught with 500 tablets of a banned
substance.
</P>
<P>
Knowing Australia's strong stance against performance-enhancing
drugs, Hill was desperate to clear the air on the eve of the last
competition before the Olympics, the Melbourne Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit embarrassing, now everybody knows I'm on a diet,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I arrived in Perth and went through Customs and told them I
was carrying a dietary supplement, and there were 14 tablets left
out of a bottle of 80," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They weren't aware of the product because it isn't sold here
and I told them it was available over the counter in South Africa,
" Hill said.
</P>
<P>
"They checked it out and found that I was right but they said
they had to detain the capsules anyway because it contains
Ethyedrine," he added.
</P>
<P>
South African manager, Dean Price, said Hill or any member of
his squad would be sent home and banned for life if they were
found guilty of using or supplying performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Price congratulated the Australian Customs Service on doing
such a thorough job.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Fuse to Link Olympic Stadium, Sydney Harbor Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A 14-kilometer river of
lightning linking the Olympic stadium and the Sydney Harbor Bridge
will trigger a massive fireworks spectacular to mark the end of
the 2000 Games, organizers said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The final seconds of a fireworks display at the closing
ceremony at Stadium Australia will start the 14-kilometer long
fuse, dubbed the river of lightning by organizers.
</P>
<P>
Two million spectators are expected to cram the harbor shores
to watch the display, while 16 giant screens will broadcast the
event to city and regional centers.
</P>
<P>
Olympic ceremonies artistic director David Atkins said the fuse
would take about two and a half minutes to trigger the fireworks
on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Ignatius Jones, artistic director of the closing night
festivities, said it was the first time the closing ceremony was
taken out of the stadium to the people.
</P>
<P>
Eight city buildings encompassing both sides of the harbor will
also shoot fireworks and a row of boats under the bridge will also
unleash giant candles.
</P>
<P>
Pyrotechnists from the five continents, representing the
Olympic rings, are taking part in the spectacular.
</P>
<P>
Each of the international participants will create a three-
minute display to be fired from four harbor locations.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A star-studded American squad
on Friday proved its form and flair for the coming Olympics by
winning seven out of 20 titles while chalking down two meet
records.
</P>
<P>
World champion and world record holder Maurice Greene stole the
day's limelight by clocking a season's best in the men's 100
meters.
</P>
<P>
The American sprinter clocked 9.88 seconds for a meet mark.
His previous season's best was 9.91 clocked in early May at Osaka,
Japan. He has hence boosted his chance for adding the Sydney
Olympic gold to his credit as he has clocked the top four times of
the season, the slowest being 9.94.
</P>
<P>
What's sweeter for Greene was that he moved a step closer to
splitting the 50 kilograms of gold offered as the prize for those
who win in their speciality event in five out of the seven legs
designated as the Golden League contests by the International
Amateur Athletic Federation.
</P>
<P>
Reigning Olympic titlist Donovan Bailey from Canada finished a
poor eighth at 10.20 though he was the sixth out of the starting
block in the 100.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyans, however, proved just too much for others in the
grueling 10,000-meter run as they swept the top three places with
Paul Tergat, who set a world record on the same track three years
ago, winning it on 27 minutes 3.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Though his winning time on Friday was well outside the standing
world record, Tergat still hoped that it was good enough to
persuade the Kenyan sports administrators to enter him for the
Olympic 10,000 meters as well.
</P>
<P>
Tergat was entered in the 5,000 meters in Sydney. "I felt very
good because I want to prove that I'm worth to represent my
country during the Olympic Games in the 10,000m race. I hope this
performance will help me convince everybody," he said after the
race.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones, the American sprinter going for five Olympic
titles in Sydney, won the women's 100 meters with a clocking of 10.
83 seconds despite the fact that she was the third out the
starting block.
</P>
<P>
This was Jones' second best time this season. The 25-year-old
ran 10.78 three weeks ago in London.
</P>
<P>
Her compatriot Inger Miller finished only a distant fifth at 11.
17.
</P>
<P>
Australian Cathy Freeman, the Sydney Olympic favorite, won her
speciality of 400 meters with a time of 49.78 seconds. Friday's
was her third victory in her current European tour, following
those earlier in Lausanne and Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson, who returned to run the 400m after his
hamstring injury at the United States Olympic trials last month,
won the event with complete comfort.
</P>
<P>
The world and Olympic champion came out clear on the home
straight only to slow down toward the end of the race, clocking 44.
07 seconds. He now boasts of all four top times in the distance
this season with the best at 43.68. His winning time Friday was
just a hundredth of a second outside his own meet record chalked
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Gail Devers of the United States had to be double happy on
Friday when she won the women's 100-meter hurdles event, a fifth
win in the Golden League contest that has actually qualified her
even before the Berlin grand finale to split the 50-kilogram gold.
</P>
<P>
T. Solberg-Hattestad also moved closer to splitting the gold
bar prize as she won the women's javelin event with a throw of 67.
76 meters. But the Norwegian still has to wait until Berlin to
see whether she could win another decisive time to grab the gold.
</P>
<P>
Also moved on the gold track were Russian woman long jumper
Tatyana Kotova and Moroccan man 5,000-meter runner Hicham el
Guerrouj who have both won their respective events in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin event is scheduled for next Friday.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Send 69 Olympic Athletes to Sydney Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is to send 69 athletes
including 32 sportswomen to the coming Sydney Olympic Games to
compete in 16 sports.
</P>
<P>
The team roster was finalized on Friday after the Memorial van
Damme track and field contest that was the sixth of the seven-leg
Golden League competition of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Belgian long jumper Erik Nys, who made his way into the finals
in the Atlanta Games four years ago, returned from leg injury to
jump 7.80 meters on Friday. He was allowed to join Sydney-bound
compatriots in that he had jumped 8.25 meters just prior to
Atlanta and jumped 8.08 meters in the finals in Atlanta. And he
showed recovery and progress from his injury.
</P>
<P>
The addition was announced by Roger Vanmeerbeeck, chef de
mission of the Belgian team shortly after Friday's van Damme event.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians are expected to do well in judo, cycling and
yachting, according to Guido de Bondt, secretary-general of the
Belgian National Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians will also compete in track and field, rowing,
badminton, canoeing, equestrian, gymnastics, weightlifting,
swimming, tennis, table tennis, archery, shooting and triathlon in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In the Sydney-bound squad, three athletes have participated in
the three previous Olympics. They are table tennis player Jean-
Michel Saive, swimmer Brigitte Becue and athlete Patrick Stevens.
Stevens finished third in Friday's van Damme event in his
speciality of 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Belgium won two gold, two silver and two bronze medals in
Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Committee to Rule on Wrestling Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of conflicting
decisions from an arbitrator and a federal court, the U.S. Olympic
Committee (USOC) said on Friday that it will issue a "fair ruling"
on who will compete in the Greco-Roman wrestling men's 76kg
category in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was raised between Matt Lindland and Keith Sieracki
as a string of protests and court arbitrations featured the past
few weeks concerning their eligibility to represent the United
States in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The arbitrator said Thursday that Sieracki, who won the U.S.
Wrestling Olympic Trials, was the rightful entrant for the Games.
Hours later, a federal appeals court in Chicago said Lindland, who
won a rematch ordered by another arbitrator, should get the
Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
"This didn't have to happen," said Ed Williams, a New York-
based attorney who helped formulate the 1978 Amateur Sports Act.
"Arbitration works in the vast majority of cases, but every once
in a while you get a flyer. There may be a little turmoil at
times, but it's a fair process."
</P>
<P>
The right to arbitrate was awarded to athletes by the Amateur
Sports Act. Its purpose was to eliminate the chance that the most
deserving athlete in a sport be left off the Olympic Team because
of parochial politics or favoritism and ensure "fair and open"
trials.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, a handful cases of the kind have
surfaced, and that has some questioning where arbitration fits
within the selection of American Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
Another case that made headlines this week involved women's
tennis doubles star Lisa Raymond, who lost her bid to replace
Serena Williams on the U.S. Olympic Team when an arbitrator ruled
against her.
</P>
<P>
"You don't fight your butt off to become the No. 1 doubles
player in the world and don't get chosen to go the Olympic Games,"
Raymond said.

<HEADLINE> LA Lakers Signs "Bad Boy" Rider for One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers has
signed problematic swingman Isaiah Rider for one year, but terms
of the deal were not disclosed, sources from the Lakers said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rider averaged 19.3 points and 4.3 rebounds for the Atlanta
Hawks last season, but appeared in just 60 games for the team. He
was waived in March after refusing to take a three-game suspension
for his late show up for a game.
</P>
<P>
Rider who was acquired in a trade that sent popular guard Steve
Smith to Portland, was a constant headache for Atlanta and might
have cost coach Lenny Wilkens his job with the team.
</P>
<P>
However, with impressive physical skills, the 29-year-old won
the 1994 Slam Dunk Contest and is a feared slasher who is a career
.350 three-point shooter.
</P>
<P>
Rider said he was grateful to Lakers general manager Mitch
Kupchak, coach Phil Jackson and owner Jerry Buss for "having the
faith in me to give me this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to a new start in my career," Rider said
in a statement released by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Rider jeopardizes the status of current
Lakers small forward Glen Rice. Rice was rumored to be on his way
to the New York Knicks as part of a four-team trade that would
have sent forward Christian Laettner to the Lakers, but the trade
never materialized.
</P>
<P>
Rider's career is checkered with suspensions, including missing
12 games during three seasons in Portland ranging from flagrant
fouls to spitting on fans.
</P>
<P>
His history of NBA offenses dates back to his first pro
practice with Minnesota in 1993, when he showed up late. Other
problems have included convictions for marijuana possession and
assault.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Expects Women Shuttlers to Reach Olympics Semi-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) training director Christian Hadinata hopes the
country's female shuttlers could reach the Olympic Games semi-
finals in both singles and doubles events.
</P>
<P>
"The highest target in the Olympics for our female shuttlers is
to reach the semi-finals. If they can do that, they will have
performed extraordinarily well as it's been difficult for them to
reach regular Grand Prix series semis," Hadinata was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to underestimate their skills ... they must
consider my statement as a challenge. They must prove that what I
said is wrong, that they can reach the semis. If they fail to
reach the semis, then our female shuttlers were stagnant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has qualified world number 17 Lidya Djaelawidjaja and
No. 21 Ellen Angelinawaty in the singles. It also qualified the
world No. 9 pair of Etty Tantri and Cynthia Tuwankotta and world
No. 11 duo Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban.
</P>
<P>
Hadinata said the shuttlers' low ranks have put them in the
edge position for the draw on September 7.
</P>
<P>
"They will meet top seeds in early rounds. Let's just hope
that they won't lose in the first round," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hadinata said Chinese and South Koreans no longer rule women's
competitions. "European shuttlers, who used to be underdogs
compared to us, have performed much better in international
tournaments lately. They are new threats for our shuttlers
despite our long-time rivalry with China and South Korea," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lidya is optimistic on her chances to reach the semi-finals. "
Based on my performance in the Indonesia and Malaysia Opens
recently, I believe my game has been improving. I only need to
focus more for the Olympics," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lidya reached the Indonesia Open semi-finals, losing to
eventual winner Carmilla Martin of Denmark, and the Malaysian Open
quarter-finals, losing to Kelly Morgan of Wales.
</P>
<P>
"I have evaluated my probable opponents at the Olympics and I
have been trying to visualize their form and anticipation," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Lidya named Chinese shuttlers Gong Zhichao, Dai Yun and Ye
Zhaoying; Martin and Indonesian-born Mia Audina, now playing for
the Netherlands, as strong candidates to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"With 64 players in the draw, I have to play four matches to
reach the semi-finals. I just hope I don't face any top seeds in
early rounds," she added.

<HEADLINE> French Cyclist Magnien out of Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- French cyclist Emmanuel Magnien's
participation of the Sydney Olympic Games was overruled on Friday
by the sport's world ruling body the International Cycling Union (
UCI).
</P>
<P>
By appealing against a suspended six-month ban for doping
handed down by the French Cycling League, UCI made sure that the
rider could not take part in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The UCI lodged the appeal with the Sports Arbitration Panel,
the only other body empowered to rule on suspending at least part
of a ban. "The rules call for a minimum sanction of a full six-
month ban," a UCI statment said.
</P>
<P>
UCI rules also say that a rider may not compete at the Games if
he has an ongoing process against him.
</P>
<P>
Magnien had admitted taking a cortisone-based medicine to
tackle a pollen allergy, he argued that he was the "victim of an
unjust decision which I will never accept."  The medicine is
banned under UCI regulations as well as French law.
</P>
<P>
Magnien also insisted that team doctor Gerard Guillaume had
administered the drug without his authorisation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Magnien, 29, had been named in the French team
for the Sydney Games, in the individual road race category, with
Laurent Brochard, Laurent Jalabert, Christophe Moreau and Richard
Virenque.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Deputy PM Denies Terror Plot Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Deputy Prime
Minister Jim Anderton denied an earlier press report that a
possible terrorist plot to target a nuclear reactor in Sydney had
been foiled, a Wellington-based newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner's Office had confirmed the previous report.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand detectives in Auckland have foiled the terrorist
plot, the Evening Post quoted Auckland-based Weekend Herald
Newspaper as reporting here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Weekend Herald newspaper reported that the plot against the
research reactor was "linked to Afghan sympathizers of Osama bin
Laden, the West's most wanted terrorist."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand national crime manager Bill Bishop was quoted as
saying New Zealand police found out about "the possible plot while
investigating people-smuggling and inappropriate use of passports.
This led to a reach of a Mt Albert House in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
"It appeared to us to be converted into a command center. A
Sydney street map was found ... the access to the nuclear reactor
was highlighted," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There was other material which gave us cause for concern," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say what that material was, nor who the
occupants of the house were.
</P>
<P>
Police are working closely with agencies in Australia and New
Zealand to determine the significance of the material, Bishop said,
adding New Zealand Minister of Police George Hawkins has been
briefed.
</P>
<P>
But earlier Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Anderton, who is on
the security intelligence and the external relations Cabinet
committees, denied the report, saying if there was a serious
security threat in New Zealand or Australia, he would know.
</P>
<P>
"No reports have reached me," he said.
</P>
<P>
People shouldn't have concerns about Afghan or other Muslim
refugees in New Zealand, he said.

<HEADLINE> Terrorist Plot on Australia's Nuclear Reactor Leads to Closure Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A terrorist plot targeting
Australia's nuclear reactor during the Olympic Games Saturday led
to angered new demands for its immediate closure.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand detectives reportedly foiled the plot, hatched by
Afghan sympathisers of wanted terrorist Osama Bin Laden, to attack
the reactor in Sydney's south.
</P>
<P>
Australia's New South Wales (NSW) state police Saturday said
they had been made aware of the plot and had been briefed by their
New Zealand counterparts.
</P>
<P>
But local residents said their fears had come true and the
federal government must follow the lead set by the United States
during the Atlanta Games and shut the reactor down.
</P>
<P>
NSW's Sutherland Shire Councilor Genevieve Rankin said the
federal government was risking the lives of Australians and
athletes during the Games by keeping the facility open.
</P>
<P>
Rankin said the council would immediately write to federal
Science Minister Senator Nick Minchin demanding the closure.
</P>
<P>
She said new calls would also be put to the Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), despite their past
response that security was a federal government matter.
</P>
<P>
"I feel this will be a wake up call to SOCOG, and it would be
totally irresponsible of SOCOG if they didn't insist that the
federal government shut the thing down," she said.
</P>
<P>
Police revealed the possible terrorist threat after raiding an
Auckland property, finding it set up like a command center with
detailed maps of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The maps included one highlighting access routes to and from
the Lucas Heights reactor, a New Zealand newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But federal Science Minister Nick Minchin's office said
Saturday the reactor would not be closed during the Olympics,
</P>
<P>
"Relevant Australian authorities have made an assessment and
have advised that the risk is low," a spokeswoman for Minchin said.
</P>
<P>
The office of federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams repeated
a similar line.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) said Friday that time constraints about long-lead
time projects such as infrastructure, transports, venue,
construction and technology are the common concerns of the Athens
Games organisers and the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Two months after the introduction of the new leadership team of
the Athens Organizing Committee (ATHOC), it is clear that a lot of
progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
The new ATHOC structure and the renewed commitment of the Greek
government at the highest level should enable the organization of
the Olympic Games to move forward decisively.
</P>
<P>
"Time is critical," said Jacques Regge, chairman of the IOC
Coordination Commission. "This concern is obviously shared by all
parties. We have been assured deadlines will be respected, and
even brought forward where necessary. ATHOC is now on track, but
the clock is ticking."
</P>
<P>
The IOC Coordination Commission working group studied the
issues of planning with ATHOC and responsible government agencies
over the last day and a half.
</P>
<P>
The will return to Athens on November 22-24 this year to review
with ATHOC the lessons learned from the Sydney Olympic Games
experience.

<HEADLINE> Reports About S. African Swimmer Coach Carrying Banned Drugs" Distorted" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Executive President of the
National Olympic Committee of South Africa Sam Ramsamy Saturday
described reports about South African swimming coach Graham Hill
being caught with banned drugs on his arrival in Australia for the
Sydney Olympics as "unfortunate distortions."
</P>
<P>
"There have been some unfortunate distortions in some news
agency reports, emanating from Australia, concerning some tablets
declared by one of our Olympic swimming coaches at Perth
International Airport," Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
One report, under the headline "Olympic doping drag-net snares
South African swimming coach" stated that Hill had admitted he had
arrived in Australia for the Olympics carrying banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
Australian customs officials detained a small quantity of the
dietary supplement Hydroxycut, which contains 0.01gm per tablet of
the banned stimulant Ephedrine, from Hill on Wednesday when he
flew into Perth.
</P>
<P>
Hill said he took Hydroxycut to control his weight and was "
embarrassed" by the media attention.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate the way the reports have reflected the
incident," said Ramsamy, who will stand for election to the IOC
executive after the arrival of the South African Olympic team in
Sydney in the first week of September.
</P>
<P>
"The facts regarding the matter are that the South African
Olympic swimming team and two of their coaches, Dean Price and
Graham Hill,travelled to Melbourne via Perth to take part in
training and competition as part of their build-up for the Sydney
Olympic Games," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"At Perth International Airport, the first point of entry from
South Africa for the travelling group, Hill declared to customs a
bottle containing tablets of Hydroxycut, which he uses for losing
weight. The tablets can be bought over the counter in South Africa
without prescription, but Hill declared them anyway," Ramsamy
noted.

<HEADLINE> Popov Beats Klim in Olympic Swimming Warm-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Star Alexander Popov
boosted his standing as favourite for the freestyle sprints at
next month's Sydney Olympics when he comfortably beat rival
Australian Michael Klim at a warm-up swimming meet in Melbourne on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, who completed the 50-100m freestyle double at both
the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics, powered his way to an easy win
in the 100m over Klim.
</P>
<P>
The pair are ranked first and third in the world this year but
Popov showed why he is still top dog as he cruised to victory in
49.59 seconds to Klim's 50.22.
</P>
<P>
His time was well outside his 1994 world record of 48.21 and
the 48.27 he clocked at the European championships in Helsinki in
July.
</P>
<P>
the 28-year-old Russian said he was unhappy with some of the
technical aspects of his swim and dismissed the significance of
beating Klim in such a convincing manner because of the nature of
the meet.
</P>
<P>
"The real showdown will be in Sydney, this is just a warm-up,"
Popov said in typically blunt fashion.

<P>
SYDNEY, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian customs officers have
stepped-up efforts to detect athletes who may try to smuggle
banned drugs into the country ahead of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald said bag and body searches would be
intensified when athletes begin arriving next week, although
Customs officials denied Saturday they had been issued with a "hit-
list" of athletes and nations.
</P>
<P>
Security will also be tightened, with staff at Sydney Airport
upped from 600 to 800.
</P>
<P>
One customs official said: "We will intensively target
performance-enhancing drugs to show we are taking it seriously and
hopefully that will discourage people from testing the system."
</P>
<P>
Customs' director of corporate communications Leon Bedington
said while efforts were constantly made to snare drug smugglers,
no national groups or athletes would be singled out during the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic coordinator of the Australian Customs Service, John
Hawksworth, told the Herald his organisation was determined to
detect any attempt to smuggle drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We see human growth hormone as an area where we will
try to concentrate our efforts because it's somewhere where we can
do something and the other solutions are not applicable."
</P>
<P>
Customs officials seized a small quantity of the dietary
supplement Hydroxycut, which contains 0.01gm per tablet of the
banned stimulant ephedrine, from South African swimming coach
Graham Hill when he flew into Perth on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Pollution Compliance Rate Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The State Environmental
Protection Administration said yesterday 214,500 of 238,000
targeted enterprises had met state pollution control standards by
the end of July, up 3,599 from June.
</P>
<P>
The number of polluting state-owned enterprises declined
markedly in July, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More factories and other pollution sources met state
environmental standards in July as the administration continued
its checks on them to enforce its plan, the administration
announced at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to eliminate industrial pollutants and bring
urban air and water into state standards by December.
</P>
<P>
The administration has closed down 31,800 enterprises that did
not meet the requirements. Today, 24,143 enterprises have failed
to meet sate environmental standards.
</P>
<P>
Environment officials said the summer statistics stem from the
forced closures of small polluters and some enterprises' own clean-
up efforts.

<HEADLINE> New Rules to Settle Internet Name Rows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Higher People's
Court has devised new rules to settle disputes over Internet
domain name registering.
</P>
<P>
The measures cover people registering names which harm, or have
the potential to harm, trademark owners, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations say anyone trying to register a trademark
name could be fined.
</P>
<P>
These new measures are due to be implemented soon in all courts
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Beijing courts have dealt with nine disputes
involving Internet domain name registering. Four of these have
been settled.
</P>
<P>
Most of these cases involved large international enterprises,
such as Microsoft and Procter &AMP; Gamble. They came after people
registered the companies' names with "CN" (China) and then asked
the firms for huge sums of money before they agree not to use the
companies' names any more.
</P>
<P>
According to the new measures, registering names of existing
companies will not be allowed and no Beijing court will allow such
an act.
</P>
<P>
Only when a domain owner has strong reasons to support
ownership, can judges grant registration, the report said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China's capital today started
construction on its third major east-west thoroughfare south of
and parallel to Chang'an Avenue, the city's main artery.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will invest a total of four billion yuan (482 million U.
S. dollars) to build the 8.5-kilometer and six-lane road.
</P>
<P>
The new thoroughfare will be built by broadening the present
Guang'an Street, constructed in the 1950s. Guang'an Street is
often the sight of frequent traffic jams, because it is less than
10 meters wide in most sections.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 households and hundreds of units will have to be
relocated to make way for the new Guang'an Avenue.
</P>
<P>
The new thoroughfare will run from the Guangqumen fly-over
bridge to the Guang'anmen fly-over bridge. Construction is
expected to be finished by September 2001. It will connect with
the Beijing-Shijiangzhuang Expressway in the west and the Fourth
Ring Road in the east.
</P>
<P>
Ping'an Avenue, Beijing's second avenue parallel to and north
of Chang'an Avenue, was opened to traffic last autumn.

<HEADLINE> China Ends Ozone Research on Tibetan Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China has completed the first
systematic research on ozone and ultraviolet radiation on the
Tibetan Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The research was jointly conducted by the Tibetan Institute of
Plateau Atmosphere Environment and the Belgern University of
Norway.
</P>
<P>
According to research results, a drop in ozone density on the
plateau is quicker than in other parts of the country. The ozone
content there goes down markedly in the summer every year. But
there was a slight variation in the amount of ozone in the past
four years.
</P>
<P>
The observation in other parts of China shows that ozone had
decreased in Heilongjiang, Zhejiang and Qinghai provinces and the
cities of Beijing and Kunming.
</P>
<P>
China has devoted much attention to ozone protection since the
country established ties with the World Meteorological
Organization's ozone monitoring network in 1978. Altogether five
monitoring stations have been launched in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a measure to protect ozone, China has decided to phase out
ozone-depleting substances as cleaning agents before 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda has set a new
world record by giving birth to her eleventh cub at the Chengdu
Zoo in this capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Qing Qing, 16, gave birth to her latest offspring on August 18
at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials say the cub-bearing period of female giant pandas
kept in zoos is from age four to 19 years. Giant pandas usually
give birth to less than 10 cubs, either in the wild or in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
It is the seventh time that Qing Qing had a baby. She now has
11 offsping who have all survived, making her the "super-heroine"
in the giant panda world with the biggest number of children.
</P>
<P>
Qing Qing is also a responsible mother, said Tian Yuzhong,
director of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
"She takes good care of all her offspring, no matter whether
they are twins or singles," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
According to zoo officials and giant panda specialists, the
mammals often just breed one and give up another if they give
birth to twins.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda has been listed as one of the most endangered
wild animals in the world. Experts estimate that there are only
about 1,000 giant pandas living in the wild and in captivity,
mainly in China.
</P>
<P>
Some seven female giant pandas, kept in Chinese zoos and
research centers, have given birth to 10 cubs this year, and nine
of them survived, Tian added.

<HEADLINE> Expo to Boost Youth Employment Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A two-day expo aimed to
promote the Youth Pre-employment Training Program (YPTP) opened
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department, organizer of the program, hopes the expo
will enhance visitors' understanding on the program, which was
launched last year and has received positive response.
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive survey on the YPTP conducted this April
revealed that over 90 percent of the trainees considered the
program worthwhile," said Secretary for Education and Manpower
Fanny Law at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The program enabled participants to better understand the real
situations at work and the true demands of employers, thus helping
them to adapt to the changes from learning in schools to working
in the society, Law said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the effectiveness of the YPTP should not depend
solely on the placement rate of participants as no training course
would guarantee employment.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the program's success hinged on whether participants
could grasp this opportunity to add value to themselves," Law said.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 trainees in the program for 1999-2000 has secured
employment, which constituted some 37 percent of the total number
of trainees. As reporting was voluntary, the actual number of
trainees who successfully found a job would be higher than this
figure, according to Commissioner for Labor Pamela Tan Kam Mi-wah.
</P>
<P>
The program for 2000-2001, offered free of charge, is expected
to benefit an estimated 12,000 school leavers aged between 15 and
19 in two phases, with the first phase to be started on October 16.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee of the Legislative Council has approved
246 million HK dollars (31.5 million U.S. dollars) for the YPTP in
the coming two years.

BELGRADE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav customs officials have
confiscated some 40 kilograms of drug this year, said the electro-

</P>
<P>
"Drug from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran passes through
Yugoslavia, then to West Europe and America. 90 percent of drug
come to Hungary from Yugoslavia, and 95 percent of narcotics
reaching the Czech Republic and Austria pass through Serbia," said
Marko Nicovic, vice-president of the Board of Directors of
International Police Association for Drug Suppression.
</P>
<P>
He added that great quantities of narcotics are confiscated at
borders with the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"Presence of KFOR (in Kosovo) makes the situation even worse. A
professional police for drug suppression doesn't exist in Kosovo.
KFOR is not capable for doing that," he added.

The presidents of Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica

WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- With the worst wildfire season in decades still raging
across the West, President Bill Clinton on Friday ordered federal
agencies to reassign as many as 2,000 supervisors and managers to
join the front lines of the blazes in support roles.
</P>
<P>
-- Faced with an ultimatum to live within its budget, the
Public Benefit Corp. on Friday laid off 550 of its 2,000 workers
and moved to convert D.C. General Hospital, which have served the
District's black communities for almost 200 years, into a smaller
facility for basic and urgent care only.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Charging that the Clinton administration had neglected Latin
America, Governor George W. Bush pledged Friday to put those
countries at the center of his foreign policy agenda and outlined
a way of thinking about the region that placed it on a par with
American interests in Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
-- A Burundi peace agreement is not there yet and that will
present a dilemma when President Clinton arrives in Tanzania on
August 28 to meet with former South African President Nelson
Mandela, broker of the Burundi peace process, and leaders of
warring parties in Burundi.

<HEADLINE> South African Swimming Coach Cleared After Drug Seizure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South African swimming coach
Graham Hill Friday was embarrassed, but in the clear, after a drug
seizure by the Australian Customs Service at Perth Airport.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials detained a small quantity of the dietary
supplement Hydroxycut, which contains 0.01 gm per tablet of the
banned substance Ethedrine, from Hill on Wednesday but Friday
described the incident as an "everyday event."
</P>
<P>
The Customs said in a media release that for the purposes of
Customs legislation, the substance was not classified as a
performance enhancing drug.
</P>
<P>
It said Hill had not breached Customs legislation.
</P>
<P>
Hill, who took Hydroxycut to control his own weight, was
horrified Friday when radio reports claimed an unnamed South
African coach had been caught with 500 tablets of a banned
substance.
</P>
<P>
Knowing Australia's strong stance against performance-enhancing
drugs, Hill was desperate to clear the air on the eve of the last
competition before the Olympics, the Melbourne Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
"It's a bit embarrassing, now everybody knows I'm on a diet,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I arrived in Perth and went through Customs and told them I
was carrying a dietary supplement, and there were 14 tablets left
out of a bottle of 80," he said.
</P>
<P>
"They weren't aware of the product because it isn't sold here
and I told them it was available over the counter in South Africa,
" Hill said.
</P>
<P>
"They checked it out and found that I was right but they said
they had to detain the capsules anyway because it contains
Ethyedrine," he added.
</P>
<P>
South African manager, Dean Price, said Hill or any member of
his squad would be sent home and banned for life if they were
found guilty of using or supplying performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Price congratulated the Australian Customs Service on doing
such a thorough job.

<HEADLINE> Fireworks Fuse to Link Olympic Stadium, Sydney Harbor Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A 14-kilometer river of
lightning linking the Olympic stadium and the Sydney Harbor Bridge
will trigger a massive fireworks spectacular to mark the end of
the 2000 Games, organizers said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The final seconds of a fireworks display at the closing
ceremony at Stadium Australia will start the 14-kilometer long
fuse, dubbed the river of lightning by organizers.
</P>
<P>
Two million spectators are expected to cram the harbor shores
to watch the display, while 16 giant screens will broadcast the
event to city and regional centers.
</P>
<P>
Olympic ceremonies artistic director David Atkins said the fuse
would take about two and a half minutes to trigger the fireworks
on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Ignatius Jones, artistic director of the closing night
festivities, said it was the first time the closing ceremony was
taken out of the stadium to the people.
</P>
<P>
Eight city buildings encompassing both sides of the harbor will
also shoot fireworks and a row of boats under the bridge will also
unleash giant candles.
</P>
<P>
Pyrotechnists from the five continents, representing the
Olympic rings, are taking part in the spectacular.
</P>
<P>
Each of the international participants will create a three-
minute display to be fired from four harbor locations.

<HEADLINE> Americans Dominate van Damme Athletics Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A star-studded American squad
on Friday proved its form and flair for the coming Olympics by
winning seven out of 20 titles while chalking down two meet
records.
</P>
<P>
World champion and world record holder Maurice Greene stole the
day's limelight by clocking a season's best in the men's 100
meters.
</P>
<P>
The American sprinter clocked 9.88 seconds for a meet mark.
His previous season's best was 9.91 clocked in early May at Osaka,
Japan. He has hence boosted his chance for adding the Sydney
Olympic gold to his credit as he has clocked the top four times of
the season, the slowest being 9.94.
</P>
<P>
What's sweeter for Greene was that he moved a step closer to
splitting the 50 kilograms of gold offered as the prize for those
who win in their speciality event in five out of the seven legs
designated as the Golden League contests by the International
Amateur Athletic Federation.
</P>
<P>
Reigning Olympic titlist Donovan Bailey from Canada finished a
poor eighth at 10.20 though he was the sixth out of the starting
block in the 100.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyans, however, proved just too much for others in the
grueling 10,000-meter run as they swept the top three places with
Paul Tergat, who set a world record on the same track three years
ago, winning it on 27 minutes 3.87 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Though his winning time on Friday was well outside the standing
world record, Tergat still hoped that it was good enough to
persuade the Kenyan sports administrators to enter him for the
Olympic 10,000 meters as well.
</P>
<P>
Tergat was entered in the 5,000 meters in Sydney. "I felt very
good because I want to prove that I'm worth to represent my
country during the Olympic Games in the 10,000m race. I hope this
performance will help me convince everybody," he said after the
race.
</P>
<P>
Marion Jones, the American sprinter going for five Olympic
titles in Sydney, won the women's 100 meters with a clocking of 10.
83 seconds despite the fact that she was the third out the
starting block.
</P>
<P>
This was Jones' second best time this season. The 25-year-old
ran 10.78 three weeks ago in London.
</P>
<P>
Her compatriot Inger Miller finished only a distant fifth at 11.
17.
</P>
<P>
Australian Cathy Freeman, the Sydney Olympic favorite, won her
speciality of 400 meters with a time of 49.78 seconds. Friday's
was her third victory in her current European tour, following
those earlier in Lausanne and Monaco.
</P>
<P>
Michael Johnson, who returned to run the 400m after his
hamstring injury at the United States Olympic trials last month,
won the event with complete comfort.
</P>
<P>
The world and Olympic champion came out clear on the home
straight only to slow down toward the end of the race, clocking 44.
07 seconds. He now boasts of all four top times in the distance
this season with the best at 43.68. His winning time Friday was
just a hundredth of a second outside his own meet record chalked
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Gail Devers of the United States had to be double happy on
Friday when she won the women's 100-meter hurdles event, a fifth
win in the Golden League contest that has actually qualified her
even before the Berlin grand finale to split the 50-kilogram gold.
</P>
<P>
T. Solberg-Hattestad also moved closer to splitting the gold
bar prize as she won the women's javelin event with a throw of 67.
76 meters. But the Norwegian still has to wait until Berlin to
see whether she could win another decisive time to grab the gold.
</P>
<P>
Also moved on the gold track were Russian woman long jumper
Tatyana Kotova and Moroccan man 5,000-meter runner Hicham el
Guerrouj who have both won their respective events in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Berlin event is scheduled for next Friday.

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Send 69 Olympic Athletes to Sydney Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Belgium is to send 69 athletes
including 32 sportswomen to the coming Sydney Olympic Games to
compete in 16 sports.
</P>
<P>
The team roster was finalized on Friday after the Memorial van
Damme track and field contest that was the sixth of the seven-leg
Golden League competition of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Belgian long jumper Erik Nys, who made his way into the finals
in the Atlanta Games four years ago, returned from leg injury to
jump 7.80 meters on Friday. He was allowed to join Sydney-bound
compatriots in that he had jumped 8.25 meters just prior to
Atlanta and jumped 8.08 meters in the finals in Atlanta. And he
showed recovery and progress from his injury.
</P>
<P>
The addition was announced by Roger Vanmeerbeeck, chef de
mission of the Belgian team shortly after Friday's van Damme event.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians are expected to do well in judo, cycling and
yachting, according to Guido de Bondt, secretary-general of the
Belgian National Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians will also compete in track and field, rowing,
badminton, canoeing, equestrian, gymnastics, weightlifting,
swimming, tennis, table tennis, archery, shooting and triathlon in
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
In the Sydney-bound squad, three athletes have participated in
the three previous Olympics. They are table tennis player Jean-
Michel Saive, swimmer Brigitte Becue and athlete Patrick Stevens.
Stevens finished third in Friday's van Damme event in his
speciality of 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Belgium won two gold, two silver and two bronze medals in
Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Committee to Rule on Wrestling Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- In the wake of conflicting
decisions from an arbitrator and a federal court, the U.S. Olympic
Committee (USOC) said on Friday that it will issue a "fair ruling"
on who will compete in the Greco-Roman wrestling men's 76kg
category in the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was raised between Matt Lindland and Keith Sieracki
as a string of protests and court arbitrations featured the past
few weeks concerning their eligibility to represent the United
States in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The arbitrator said Thursday that Sieracki, who won the U.S.
Wrestling Olympic Trials, was the rightful entrant for the Games.
Hours later, a federal appeals court in Chicago said Lindland, who
won a rematch ordered by another arbitrator, should get the
Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
"This didn't have to happen," said Ed Williams, a New York-
based attorney who helped formulate the 1978 Amateur Sports Act.
"Arbitration works in the vast majority of cases, but every once
in a while you get a flyer. There may be a little turmoil at
times, but it's a fair process."
</P>
<P>
The right to arbitrate was awarded to athletes by the Amateur
Sports Act. Its purpose was to eliminate the chance that the most
deserving athlete in a sport be left off the Olympic Team because
of parochial politics or favoritism and ensure "fair and open"
trials.
</P>
<P>
In the past few months, a handful cases of the kind have
surfaced, and that has some questioning where arbitration fits
within the selection of American Olympic athletes.
</P>
<P>
Another case that made headlines this week involved women's
tennis doubles star Lisa Raymond, who lost her bid to replace
Serena Williams on the U.S. Olympic Team when an arbitrator ruled
against her.

<HEADLINE> LA Lakers Signs "Bad Boy" Rider for One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers has
signed problematic swingman Isaiah Rider for one year, but terms
of the deal were not disclosed, sources from the Lakers said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rider averaged 19.3 points and 4.3 rebounds for the Atlanta
Hawks last season, but appeared in just 60 games for the team. He
was waived in March after refusing to take a three-game suspension
for his late show up for a game.
</P>
<P>
Rider who was acquired in a trade that sent popular guard Steve
Smith to Portland, was a constant headache for Atlanta and might
have cost coach Lenny Wilkens his job with the team.
</P>
<P>
However, with impressive physical skills, the 29-year-old won
the 1994 Slam Dunk Contest and is a feared slasher who is a career
.350 three-point shooter.
</P>
<P>
Rider said he was grateful to Lakers general manager Mitch
Kupchak, coach Phil Jackson and owner Jerry Buss for "having the
faith in me to give me this opportunity.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking forward to a new start in my career," Rider said
in a statement released by the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of Rider jeopardizes the status of current
Lakers small forward Glen Rice. Rice was rumored to be on his way
to the New York Knicks as part of a four-team trade that would
have sent forward Christian Laettner to the Lakers, but the trade
never materialized.
</P>
<P>
Rider's career is checkered with suspensions, including missing
12 games during three seasons in Portland ranging from flagrant
fouls to spitting on fans.
</P>
<P>
His history of NBA offenses dates back to his first pro
practice with Minnesota in 1993, when he showed up late. Other
problems have included convictions for marijuana possession and
assault.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Expects Women Shuttlers to Reach Olympics Semi-finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) training director Christian Hadinata hopes the
country's female shuttlers could reach the Olympic Games semi-
finals in both singles and doubles events.
</P>
<P>
"The highest target in the Olympics for our female shuttlers is
to reach the semi-finals. If they can do that, they will have
performed extraordinarily well as it's been difficult for them to
reach regular Grand Prix series semis," Hadinata was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I don't mean to underestimate their skills ... they must
consider my statement as a challenge. They must prove that what I
said is wrong, that they can reach the semis. If they fail to
reach the semis, then our female shuttlers were stagnant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has qualified world number 17 Lidya Djaelawidjaja and
No. 21 Ellen Angelinawaty in the singles. It also qualified the
world No. 9 pair of Etty Tantri and Cynthia Tuwankotta and world
No. 11 duo Elysa Nathanael and Deyana Lomban.
</P>
<P>
Hadinata said the shuttlers' low ranks have put them in the
edge position for the draw on September 7.
</P>
<P>
"They will meet top seeds in early rounds. Let's just hope
that they won't lose in the first round," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hadinata said Chinese and South Koreans no longer rule women's
competitions. "European shuttlers, who used to be underdogs
compared to us, have performed much better in international
tournaments lately. They are new threats for our shuttlers
despite our long-time rivalry with China and South Korea," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Lidya is optimistic on her chances to reach the semi-finals. "
Based on my performance in the Indonesia and Malaysia Opens
recently, I believe my game has been improving. I only need to
focus more for the Olympics," she said.
</P>
<P>
Lidya reached the Indonesia Open semi-finals, losing to
eventual winner Carmilla Martin of Denmark, and the Malaysian Open
quarter-finals, losing to Kelly Morgan of Wales.
</P>
<P>
"I have evaluated my probable opponents at the Olympics and I
have been trying to visualize their form and anticipation," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Lidya named Chinese shuttlers Gong Zhichao, Dai Yun and Ye
Zhaoying; Martin and Indonesian-born Mia Audina, now playing for
the Netherlands, as strong candidates to win the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"With 64 players in the draw, I have to play four matches to
reach the semi-finals. I just hope I don't face any top seeds in
early rounds," she added.

<HEADLINE> French Cyclist Magnien out of Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- French cyclist Emmanuel Magnien's
participation of the Sydney Olympic Games was overruled on Friday
by the sport's world ruling body the International Cycling Union (
UCI).
</P>
<P>
By appealing against a suspended six-month ban for doping
handed down by the French Cycling League, UCI made sure that the
rider could not take part in the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The UCI lodged the appeal with the Sports Arbitration Panel,
the only other body empowered to rule on suspending at least part
of a ban. "The rules call for a minimum sanction of a full six-
month ban," a UCI statment said.
</P>
<P>
UCI rules also say that a rider may not compete at the Games if
he has an ongoing process against him.
</P>
<P>
Magnien had admitted taking a cortisone-based medicine to
tackle a pollen allergy, he argued that he was the "victim of an
unjust decision which I will never accept."  The medicine is
banned under UCI regulations as well as French law.
</P>
<P>
Magnien also insisted that team doctor Gerard Guillaume had
administered the drug without his authorisation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Magnien, 29, had been named in the French team
for the Sydney Games, in the individual road race category, with
Laurent Brochard, Laurent Jalabert, Christophe Moreau and Richard
Virenque.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Deputy PM Denies Terror Plot Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Deputy Prime
Minister Jim Anderton denied an earlier press report that a
possible terrorist plot to target a nuclear reactor in Sydney had
been foiled, a Wellington-based newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner's Office had confirmed the previous report.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand detectives in Auckland have foiled the terrorist
plot, the Evening Post quoted Auckland-based Weekend Herald
Newspaper as reporting here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Weekend Herald newspaper reported that the plot against the
research reactor was "linked to Afghan sympathizers of Osama bin
Laden, the West's most wanted terrorist."
</P>
<P>
New Zealand national crime manager Bill Bishop was quoted as
saying New Zealand police found out about "the possible plot while
investigating people-smuggling and inappropriate use of passports.
This led to a reach of a Mt Albert House in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
"It appeared to us to be converted into a command center. A
Sydney street map was found ... the access to the nuclear reactor
was highlighted," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There was other material which gave us cause for concern," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to say what that material was, nor who the
occupants of the house were.
</P>
<P>
Police are working closely with agencies in Australia and New
Zealand to determine the significance of the material, Bishop said,
adding New Zealand Minister of Police George Hawkins has been
briefed.
</P>
<P>
But earlier Saturday, Deputy Prime Minister Anderton, who is on
the security intelligence and the external relations Cabinet
committees, denied the report, saying if there was a serious
security threat in New Zealand or Australia, he would know.
</P>
<P>
"No reports have reached me," he said.
</P>
<P>
People shouldn't have concerns about Afghan or other Muslim
refugees in New Zealand, he said.

<HEADLINE> Terrorist Plot on Australia's Nuclear Reactor Leads to Closure Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A terrorist plot targeting
Australia's nuclear reactor during the Olympic Games Saturday led
to angered new demands for its immediate closure.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand detectives reportedly foiled the plot, hatched by
Afghan sympathisers of wanted terrorist Osama Bin Laden, to attack
the reactor in Sydney's south.
</P>
<P>
Australia's New South Wales (NSW) state police Saturday said
they had been made aware of the plot and had been briefed by their
New Zealand counterparts.
</P>
<P>
But local residents said their fears had come true and the
federal government must follow the lead set by the United States
during the Atlanta Games and shut the reactor down.
</P>
<P>
NSW's Sutherland Shire Councilor Genevieve Rankin said the
federal government was risking the lives of Australians and
athletes during the Games by keeping the facility open.
</P>
<P>
Rankin said the council would immediately write to federal
Science Minister Senator Nick Minchin demanding the closure.
</P>
<P>
She said new calls would also be put to the Sydney Organising
Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), despite their past
response that security was a federal government matter.
</P>
<P>
"I feel this will be a wake up call to SOCOG, and it would be
totally irresponsible of SOCOG if they didn't insist that the
federal government shut the thing down," she said.
</P>
<P>
Police revealed the possible terrorist threat after raiding an
Auckland property, finding it set up like a command center with
detailed maps of Sydney.
</P>
<P>
The maps included one highlighting access routes to and from
the Lucas Heights reactor, a New Zealand newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But federal Science Minister Nick Minchin's office said
Saturday the reactor would not be closed during the Olympics,
</P>
<P>
"Relevant Australian authorities have made an assessment and
have advised that the risk is low," a spokeswoman for Minchin said.
</P>
<P>
The office of federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams repeated
a similar line.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Attorney-General said official inquiries
had revealed that at this stage "there was no credible threat to
Lucas Heights".
</P>
<P>
NSW police also said all threats and security issues were
treated seriously and fully investigated, but would not comment
further.

ATHENS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) said Friday that time constraints about long-lead
time projects such as infrastructure, transports, venue,
construction and technology are the common concerns of the Athens
Games organisers and the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Two months after the introduction of the new leadership team of
the Athens Organizing Committee (ATHOC), it is clear that a lot of
progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
The new ATHOC structure and the renewed commitment of the Greek
government at the highest level should enable the organization of
the Olympic Games to move forward decisively.
</P>
<P>
"Time is critical," said Jacques Regge, chairman of the IOC
Coordination Commission. "This concern is obviously shared by all
parties. We have been assured deadlines will be respected, and
even brought forward where necessary. ATHOC is now on track, but
the clock is ticking."
</P>
<P>
The IOC Coordination Commission working group studied the
issues of planning with ATHOC and responsible government agencies
over the last day and a half.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Reports About S. African Swimmer Coach Carrying Banned Drugs" Distorted" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Executive President of the
National Olympic Committee of South Africa Sam Ramsamy Saturday
described reports about South African swimming coach Graham Hill
being caught with banned drugs on his arrival in Australia for the
Sydney Olympics as "unfortunate distortions."
</P>
<P>
"There have been some unfortunate distortions in some news
agency reports, emanating from Australia, concerning some tablets
declared by one of our Olympic swimming coaches at Perth
International Airport," Ramsamy said.
</P>
<P>
One report, under the headline "Olympic doping drag-net snares
South African swimming coach" stated that Hill had admitted he had
arrived in Australia for the Olympics carrying banned drugs.
</P>
<P>
Australian customs officials detained a small quantity of the
dietary supplement Hydroxycut, which contains 0.01gm per tablet of
the banned stimulant Ephedrine, from Hill on Wednesday when he
flew into Perth.
</P>
<P>
Hill said he took Hydroxycut to control his weight and was "
embarrassed" by the media attention.
</P>
<P>
"It's unfortunate the way the reports have reflected the
incident," said Ramsamy, who will stand for election to the IOC
executive after the arrival of the South African Olympic team in
Sydney in the first week of September.
</P>
<P>
"The facts regarding the matter are that the South African
Olympic swimming team and two of their coaches, Dean Price and
Graham Hill,travelled to Melbourne via Perth to take part in
training and competition as part of their build-up for the Sydney
Olympic Games," the president said.
</P>
<P>
"At Perth International Airport, the first point of entry from
South Africa for the travelling group, Hill declared to customs a
bottle containing tablets of Hydroxycut, which he uses for losing
weight. The tablets can be bought over the counter in South Africa
without prescription, but Hill declared them anyway," Ramsamy
noted.

<HEADLINE> Popov Beats Klim in Olympic Swimming Warm-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Star Alexander Popov
boosted his standing as favourite for the freestyle sprints at
next month's Sydney Olympics when he comfortably beat rival
Australian Michael Klim at a warm-up swimming meet in Melbourne on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, who completed the 50-100m freestyle double at both
the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics, powered his way to an easy win
in the 100m over Klim.
</P>
<P>
The pair are ranked first and third in the world this year but
Popov showed why he is still top dog as he cruised to victory in
49.59 seconds to Klim's 50.22.
</P>
<P>
His time was well outside his 1994 world record of 48.21 and
the 48.27 he clocked at the European championships in Helsinki in
July.
</P>
<P>
the 28-year-old Russian said he was unhappy with some of the
technical aspects of his swim and dismissed the significance of
beating Klim in such a convincing manner because of the nature of
the meet.
</P>
<P>
"The real showdown will be in Sydney, this is just a warm-up,"
Popov said in typically blunt fashion.

<TEXT>
<P>
SYDNEY, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian customs officers have
stepped-up efforts to detect athletes who may try to smuggle
banned drugs into the country ahead of the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald said bag and body searches would be
intensified when athletes begin arriving next week, although
Customs officials denied Saturday they had been issued with a "hit-
list" of athletes and nations.
</P>
<P>
Security will also be tightened, with staff at Sydney Airport
upped from 600 to 800.
</P>
<P>
One customs official said: "We will intensively target
performance-enhancing drugs to show we are taking it seriously and
hopefully that will discourage people from testing the system."
</P>
<P>
Customs' director of corporate communications Leon Bedington
said while efforts were constantly made to snare drug smugglers,
no national groups or athletes would be singled out during the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic coordinator of the Australian Customs Service, John
Hawksworth, told the Herald his organisation was determined to
detect any attempt to smuggle drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We see human growth hormone as an area where we will
try to concentrate our efforts because it's somewhere where we can
do something and the other solutions are not applicable."
</P>
<P>
Customs officials seized a small quantity of the dietary
supplement Hydroxycut, which contains 0.01gm per tablet of the
banned stimulant ephedrine, from South African swimming coach
Graham Hill when he flew into Perth on Wednesday.

<P>
The Chinese continued to play solid defense in the fourth set
to lead at 10-6, but the Cubans leaned on their middle spikers to
even grabbed the upperhand at 23-20 on Regla Torres' defense-
cracking spike.
</P>
<P>
Getting morale supports from a small group of Fil-Chinese
cheerers, the Chinese came back with three straight points to tie
the set at 23-all and even have five chances to clinch the set.
</P>

they foiled every attempts of the Chinese to equalize the match
and force a deciding fifth set.
</P>
<P>
With their hard-earned victory, the Cubans advanced to the
final with still unblemished 10-0 record, keeping their bid to end

targeted enterprises had met state pollution control standards by
the end of July, up 3,599 from June.
</P>
<P>
The number of polluting state-owned enterprises declined

<P>
The plan aims to eliminate industrial pollutants and bring
urban air and water into state standards by December.

The administration has closed down 31,800 enterprises that did
not meet the requirements. Today, 24,143 enterprises have failed
to meet sate environmental standards.

<HEADLINE> New Rules to Settle Internet Name Rows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Higher People's
Court has devised new rules to settle disputes over Internet
domain name registering.
</P>
<P>
The measures cover people registering names which harm, or have
the potential to harm, trademark owners, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations say anyone trying to register a trademark
name could be fined.
</P>
<P>
These new measures are due to be implemented soon in all courts
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Beijing courts have dealt with nine disputes
involving Internet domain name registering. Four of these have
been settled.
</P>
<P>
Most of these cases involved large international enterprises,
such as Microsoft and Procter &AMP; Gamble. They came after people
registered the companies' names with "CN" (China) and then asked
the firms for huge sums of money before they agree not to use the
companies' names any more.
</P>
<P>
According to the new measures, registering names of existing
companies will not be allowed and no Beijing court will allow such
an act.
</P>
<P>
Only when a domain owner has strong reasons to support
ownership, can judges grant registration, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China's capital today started
construction on its third major east-west thoroughfare south of
and parallel to Chang'an Avenue, the city's main artery.
</P>
<P>
Beijing will invest a total of four billion yuan (482 million U.
S. dollars) to build the 8.5-kilometer and six-lane road.
</P>
<P>
The new thoroughfare will be built by broadening the present
Guang'an Street, constructed in the 1950s. Guang'an Street is
often the sight of frequent traffic jams, because it is less than
10 meters wide in most sections.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 households and hundreds of units will have to be
relocated to make way for the new Guang'an Avenue.
</P>
<P>
The new thoroughfare will run from the Guangqumen fly-over
bridge to the Guang'anmen fly-over bridge. Construction is
expected to be finished by September 2001. It will connect with
the Beijing-Shijiangzhuang Expressway in the west and the Fourth
Ring Road in the east.
</P>
<P>
Ping'an Avenue, Beijing's second avenue parallel to and north
of Chang'an Avenue, was opened to traffic last autumn.

<HEADLINE> China Ends Ozone Research on Tibetan Plateau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China has completed the first
systematic research on ozone and ultraviolet radiation on the
Tibetan Plateau.
</P>
<P>
The research was jointly conducted by the Tibetan Institute of
Plateau Atmosphere Environment and the Belgern University of
Norway.
</P>
<P>
According to research results, a drop in ozone density on the
plateau is quicker than in other parts of the country. The ozone
content there goes down markedly in the summer every year. But
there was a slight variation in the amount of ozone in the past
four years.
</P>
<P>
The observation in other parts of China shows that ozone had
decreased in Heilongjiang, Zhejiang and Qinghai provinces and the
cities of Beijing and Kunming.
</P>
<P>
China has devoted much attention to ozone protection since the
country established ties with the World Meteorological
Organization's ozone monitoring network in 1978. Altogether five
monitoring stations have been launched in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a measure to protect ozone, China has decided to phase out
ozone-depleting substances as cleaning agents before 2010.

<HEADLINE> Giant Panda Gives Birth to Eleventh Cub </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda has set a new
world record by giving birth to her eleventh cub at the Chengdu
Zoo in this capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Qing Qing, 16, gave birth to her latest offspring on August 18
at the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Zoo officials say the cub-bearing period of female giant pandas
kept in zoos is from age four to 19 years. Giant pandas usually
give birth to less than 10 cubs, either in the wild or in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
It is the seventh time that Qing Qing had a baby. She now has
11 offsping who have all survived, making her the "super-heroine"
in the giant panda world with the biggest number of children.
</P>
<P>
Qing Qing is also a responsible mother, said Tian Yuzhong,
director of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
"She takes good care of all her offspring, no matter whether
they are twins or singles," Tian said.
</P>
<P>
According to zoo officials and giant panda specialists, the
mammals often just breed one and give up another if they give
birth to twins.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda has been listed as one of the most endangered
wild animals in the world. Experts estimate that there are only
about 1,000 giant pandas living in the wild and in captivity,
mainly in China.
</P>
<P>
Some seven female giant pandas, kept in Chinese zoos and
research centers, have given birth to 10 cubs this year, and nine
of them survived, Tian added.

<HEADLINE> Expo to Boost Youth Employment Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A two-day expo aimed to
promote the Youth Pre-employment Training Program (YPTP) opened
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department, organizer of the program, hopes the expo
will enhance visitors' understanding on the program, which was
launched last year and has received positive response.
</P>
<P>
"A comprehensive survey on the YPTP conducted this April
revealed that over 90 percent of the trainees considered the
program worthwhile," said Secretary for Education and Manpower
Fanny Law at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The program enabled participants to better understand the real
situations at work and the true demands of employers, thus helping
them to adapt to the changes from learning in schools to working
in the society, Law said.
</P>
<P>
She said that the effectiveness of the YPTP should not depend
solely on the placement rate of participants as no training course
would guarantee employment.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the program's success hinged on whether participants
could grasp this opportunity to add value to themselves," Law said.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 trainees in the program for 1999-2000 has secured
employment, which constituted some 37 percent of the total number
of trainees. As reporting was voluntary, the actual number of
trainees who successfully found a job would be higher than this
figure, according to Commissioner for Labor Pamela Tan Kam Mi-wah.
</P>
<P>
The program for 2000-2001, offered free of charge, is expected
to benefit an estimated 12,000 school leavers aged between 15 and
19 in two phases, with the first phase to be started on October 16.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Committee of the Legislative Council has approved
246 million HK dollars (31.5 million U.S. dollars) for the YPTP in
the coming two years.

<P>
LHASA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Legqog, chairman of the Tibet
Autonomous Regional People's Government, met today with U.S.
ambassador to China Joseph Prueher.
</P>
<P>
Legqog told the ambassador and his entourage that under the
feudal serfdom, only children from the noble families had the
access to schooling. Nowadays serfs have become masters of the
their own destiny since democratic reform was carried out in 1959,
and 83.4 percent of school-age children can go to school.
</P>
<P>
Legqog said U.S. businessmen are welcome to invest in
infrastructure, agriculture and ecological protection since China
is implementing the strategy of developing its west.
</P>
<P>
Prueher, who is on his first visit to Tibet, said he and his
delegation were deeply impressed by the region's development over
the past years.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Law on Developing West China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Worried about possible damages
to the environment brought about by local development, some
experts have urged to make a special law to govern the activities
in the development of the underdeveloped west China.
</P>
<P>
Local governments should be asked to attach greater importance
to environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
They made the call here at today's symposium to discuss
developing China's western regions and Golmud, a fast developing
city in the west.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 officials and experts attended the meeting, sponsored
by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) and the municipal
government of Golmud.

Experts repeatedly questioned officials from Golmud how they
are planning to deal with the environment to prevent land erosion
and water pollution.

In June, a group of experts from CASS visited the city, which,
covering 124,500 sq.km., has a population of 200,000 with 26
nationalities. It is the third largest city on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, following Xining, provincial capital of Qinghai, and

<HEADLINE> Arafat Holds Talks With Mubarak on Negotiations With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat discussed with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in
Alexandria Saturday the peace talks with Israel and the future of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders started tete-a-tete talks with Arafat after his
arrival in the Mediterranean port city earlier, Egypt's Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
They were later joined by Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid,
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and Presidential adviser Osama Al Baz,
and Arafat's deputy Abu Mazen, Palestinian Minister of Culture
Yasser Abed Rabo and Minister of Local Government Saeb Erekat, both
senior negotiators with the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak and Arafat were expected to exchange views on the latest
developments of the Mideast peace process and the ongoing
consultations held by all parties concerned to the process, the
news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said on Friday Arafat's talks were part of Egypt's
contacts with different sides and were aimed at narrowing the gap
between the Palestinians and Israelis while retaining justice and
balance and respect for U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli summit in Camp David of the United
States ended last month without an agreement largely due to failure
to overcome the differences over the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said earlier Saturday that contacts were under way to
reach a framework regarding the status of Jerusalem. At present,
there are several ideas and options that could resume the peace
talks between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is opposed to Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem,
which the Jewish state occupied in the 1967 Mideast War. Israel has
claimed that the whole of Jerusalem as its "eternal and undivided
capital." The Palestinians want at least Arab East Jerusalem as the
capital of their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who will
wrap up an African tour by stopping over in Cairo on Tuesday. The
Egyptian leader will travel to France soon for talks with President
Jacques Chirac on the Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Boat Capsizes off Turkish Coast, 3 Illegal Immigrants Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish coast guards have found
three bodies on Saturday after a Turkish boat carrying 32 illegal
immigrants capsized off the coast.
</P>
<P>
The boat, setting off from western Bodrum township of Mugla
province in Aegean region to Kos Island of Greece, sank off Bodrum
shortly after midnight.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and Greek coast guard boats, backed by a helicopter,
were searching for survivors, but rescue efforts were hampered by
strong winds and rough waters, Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Turkish coast guards rescued six people
including the Turkish skipper, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Bodrum township chief Cumhur Guven Tasbasi said that "there were
18 Iraqis, 5 Afghans, 8 Iranians and a woman whose nationality
could not be determined aboard the boat. Search and rescue efforts
are continuing to find missing people."
</P>
<P>
Three out of the six rescued were receiving medical treatment in
the State Hospital of Bodrum township.
</P>
<P>
Tevrat Yanik, 27, the skipper of the boat, was a fisherman from
the western port city Izmir. "I am a fisherman in Guzelbahce
township of Izmir. After I was offered 1,000 U.S. dollars to
smuggle those people to Kos Island, I came to Bodrum from Izmir
three days ago," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the Afghan immigrants said during interrogation that they
had paid 1,000 dollars per person to flee to Greece.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Turkish security forces intercepted 42 foreigners in
Bodrum as they were trying to proceed to Greece illegally. They
were taken into custody for violating Turkish borders and passport
law.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a commercial and cultural bridge between Europe and
Asia because of its geographical position. Many illegal immigrants
attempt to enter European countries via the country.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Urges Decentralization of Government Powers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Saturday urged the decentralization of government powers and
called for participation in state affairs by the people.
</P>
<P>
All strata of the society have the right to participate in
managing state affairs, and power should not be held by a certain
group in order to dominate others, Khatami said at the opening day
of the third Shahid Rejaei Festival.
</P>
<P>
The festival is held annually to commemorate the martyrdom
anniversary of Mohammad Ali Rajaei and Mohammad Javad Bahonar, the
then president and prime minister of the country, who died in a
terrorist bomb explosion in August 1981.
</P>
<P>
Terming "centralization" as the main hurdle to development,
Khatami noted that development means decentralization and fair
distribution of power, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the "master-slave policy" within the governmental
organizations and urged Iranian managers to encourage employees to
participate in the decision-making process in an effort to
contribute to their own destiny.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president urged the increasing of welfare for
government employees and called for more facilities to be put at
their disposal.
</P>
<P>
"With any rise in inflation, the government would increase
salaries," Khatami said, expressing hope that the government would
approve a decision to exempt those employees with monthly salaries
of less than 1 million rials (about 120 U.S. dollars) from tax.
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who took office in 1997, is famous for his programs of
political and social reforms, which encourage freedom of speech and
public participation in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
But the reform programs have been severely hindered by the
conservatives, who have controlled most of the key state organs
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Irked by UAE Firms' Bid to Trade With Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Direct representations made by
the companies based in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for trade
with Iraq under the U.N. oil-for-food program has "annoyed" the
United Nations, the official WAM news agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the UAE permanent delegation based in New York,
the U.N. has complained that some companies having commercial ties
with Iraq, under the framework of the humanitarian program,
directly contact the U.N. Security Council Sanctions Committee to
have their transactions cleared, rather than go through the proper
channels.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials confirmed late last week that the repeated
representations being made had irked the U.N., which expressed its
dissatisfaction to the UAE permanent delegation over the matter,
and urged for a speedy solution in the interests of maintaining the
existing amicable relations.
</P>
<P>
The UAE Foreign Ministry has accordingly directed all the trade
chambers to require their members to route all such clearance
requests only through the country's permanent delegation in New
York.
</P>
<P>
Trade sources said a considerable amount of wheat, rice, corn,
flour, sugar and edible oils, and other essentials such as branded
soaps and unbranded detergents continue to go from the UAE to Iraq
in exchange for oil.
</P>
<P>
They, however, pointed out that such product assays, which were
earlier being conducted locally through Lloyds Register, have since
mid-1999 started to be conducted out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under crippling U.N. sanctions since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait. Under the U.N. oil-for-food program which took
effect in 1996, Iraq is allowed to sell oil, only under U.N.
supervision, to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies
for its people.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Discuss Palestinian-Israeli Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat Saturday
in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria on the Palestinian-
Israeli peace negotiations and the future of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Neither Mubarak nor Arafat spoke to reporters after the talks,
which began with a tete-a-tete meeting between the two leaders and
were later joined by their senior aides, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported. Arafat then left for Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Friday that
Arafat's talks were part of Egypt's intensive consultations with
all parties concerned to the Mideast peace process to help narrow
gaps between the Palestinians and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli summit at Camp David of the United
States ended last month without any agreement largely due to
failure to overcome the differences over the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Arafat, Mubarak said at a gathering of Egyptian
judges that Jerusalem is the most serious and difficult issue in
the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and a fair solution must be
found to the question.
</P>
<P>
Contacts and studies have been made in recent days with many
alternatives for a framework agreement, and all are far from
proposals for Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem, Mubarak was
quoted by Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sharif as telling
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Egypt would provide the Palestinians with advice, but would
resist pressure from other parties to influence them, the Egyptian
leader stressed.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied Arab East Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and
has claimed the whole of the city as its "eternal and undivided
capital." The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of
their future independent state.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said on Saturday that he will soon visit France to
discuss the Mideast peace process with President Jacques Chirac.
And on Tuesday, he will meet with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who
is due to conclude an African tour by stopping over in Cairo.

CAIRO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DUBAI -- The Autumn 2000 International Fair is due to be
held at Dubai World Trade Center on November 19-23, the Arabic-
language Al-Haiyat daily reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
So far, 11 countries and regions have expressed willingness to
send exhibitors to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
China will send 200 exhibitors to display their products at the
fair. Moldavia will attend the fair for the first time.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has decided
to launch Rafah industrial park later this year, said Abdul-Rahman
Naim, the project director.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project is expected to cost 35-40 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industrial park would focus on high-tech industries and it
would house "industrial incubators" which will be built with
foreign investments and in cooperation with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
The park is one of the key industrial zones in the Palestinian
self-rule areas as it borders Egypt and funded by the World Bank,
U.S. Development Agency and other donor countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Cairo-based Arab League has decided to launch a
project on capital and trade management to pave the way for the
establishment of a pan-Arab regional financing institution, which
is designed to provide funds for technological development and
scientific research schemes.
</P>
<P>
The move is to meet the increasing needs to fund all applicable
scientific innovations serving the commodity and service sectors,
and give long-grace-period loans and grants to scientific research
centers. The Arab countries spend 5 percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP) on scientific research in the average every year.
</P>
<P>
ABU DUBAI -- For the first time in 20 years, the government of
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) might consider lifting the subsidy
on gasoline.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, still under discussions by domestic oil providers
and the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources, was made to
address complaints by local fuel suppliers over the past months
that they suffered heavy losses due to the subsidized gasoline
prices which were in place since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline price should be liberalized in local market,
according to domestic fuel provider sources.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament Speaker Reiterates Support for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Majlis (parliament) Speaker
Mehdi Karrubi here on Saturday reiterated the legislative body's
support for President Mohammad Khatami and his reform programs.
</P>
<P>
The sixth Majlis is a Majlis of reforms and is staunchly
supporting the president's reform policies, Karrubi was quoted by
the Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Taro Nakayama, head of a Japanese
parliamentary delegation, Karrubi also praised Khatami's successful
policies of detente and confidence-building in foreign relations,
stressing the parliament's backing for those policies.
</P>
<P>
The sixth Majlis, dominated by Khatami's reformist allies,
started work on May 27. It has vowed to help push forward political
and social reforms in the country despite heavy pressures from the
conservative camp, which suffered a humiliating defeat in
February's parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
Khatami's reform programs, which encourage press freedom and
public participation in state affairs, have met strong opposition
from the conservatives, who have maintained a restrictive cleric
rule since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Karrubi also called for more regional
cooperation, especially cooperation among Asian states.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, Japan with its advanced technology and Iran with
its rich energy and other resources can have wide economic
cooperation, particularly in joint ventures, Karrubi said.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Nakayama pointed to the world technology trend and
the process of globalization and called for more parliamentary
cooperation between Iran and Japan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The parliaments can play a significant role in promoting "
dialogue among civilizations," as initiated by President Khatami,
the Japanese official said.

ALGIERS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's new Prime Minister Ali
Benflis has announced his government's line-up, which retains
almost all the ministers who held portfolios under his predecessor
Ahmed Benbitour who quit earlier Saturday.
</P>

Abdelaziz Belkhadem, the former parliamentary speaker who is
widely seen as an Islamic conservative opposed to any normalization

Benbitour, who assumed the post in December 1999, tendered his
resignation earlier in the day and President Abdelaziz Bouteflika
accepted his resignation after a meeting with him.

"The resignation was motivated by differences in understanding
over the functioning of the government's mission, and by a
divergent
approach to the ... program of reviving the economy, proposed
recently by the head of the government (Bouteflika)," an official
statement from Benbitour said.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Warns to Fight Israel "at Any Time" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese guerrilla group
Hezbollah has said it considers the present calm in south Lebanon "
temporary" and is ready to fight Israel at any time.
</P>
<P>
"We are at a temporary stage which could very easily break out
into warfare because the enemy (Israel) has an aggressive nature,"
Daily Star newspaper quoted Sheikh Naim Qassem, Hezbollah deputy
secretary-general, as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Qassem was responding to comments by Israel's ground force
commander, Major General Moshe Ivry-Sukenik, earlier in the week in
which he warned that Israeli troops would return temporarily to
Lebanon if the Jewish settlement along the border came under
attack.
</P>
<P>
Qassem told participants at a memorial service in the southern
city of Nabatieh that "due to these threats, the only solution is
to be ready to face the enemy."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah
threatened to fire rockets into Galilee if Israel sends troops back
into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"When their settlements were only kilometers away from us, they
were never immune to our danger. What about now when the
settlements are at the mercy of our resistance fighters?" Nasrallah
said in the town of Maaroub in the south.
</P>
<P>
"Does this Israeli general think that attacking Lebanon or its
south or any Lebanese village is a picnic? Does he think we are
still living in 1978 or 1982 (when Israel invaded Lebanon)? After
May 24,2000 we became something completely different," he said,
referring to the date of the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah mocked what he said was Israel's obsession with his
Iranian- and Syrian-backed group. "You are going to hear lots of
talk and threats because the biggest nightmare of the Zionists is
Hezbollah," he said. "They are obsessed with Hezbollah. They are
arresting Palestinians on the pretext that they belong to Lebanon's
Hezbollah."
</P>
<P>
Ivry-Sukenik's threats to send troops into south Lebanon was
directed more at the Israeli Finance Ministry than at Lebanon,
observers said. The Israeli military is locked in its annual battle
with the Finance Ministry over defense budget, which faces further
cuts now that the expense of maintaining the occupation is over.

<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed
Hassan Nasrallah has said that his party does not expect the
next government to offer it any special favors for ousting the
Israeli army, Daily Star newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Tomorrow when the new government is formed and ministries are
set up, you will see that Hezbollah does not want any rewards,"
said Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a ceremony held in the town of Hermel in
east to drum up support for the party's election list in the area.
</P>
<P>
"The coming government should shoulder its responsibility and
ameliorate the plight of deprived areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said his party wants to merge the Baalbek-Hermel
region and the former occupation zone into a single administrative
unit.
</P>
<P>
"The liberated areas, Baalbek and Hermel should all be in one
district. This what I told President (Emile) Lahoud and I will
relay the same demand to Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad at our
next meeting," said Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Members of Parliament nor the party can save the area
from deprivation. They are not the government and they are not
ministries. They are parliamentarians who are tasked with following
up the matter. The state and the government are the responsible
parties," he added.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Minister for
Information and Media Development Javed Jabbar said in Lahore on
Friday that there is no danger of any war between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question by newsmen regarding Thursday's
skirmish between Pakistani and Indian troops in Rawalakot sector
of Kashmir, he said that such incidents do occur but it does not
mean that these clashes may lead to a total war between the two
countries, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said that the armed forces of Pakistan are
fully determined and capable of thwarting the enemy designs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the modern wars cannot be initiated on the whims of
a single person as there are many checks and balances in every
country.
</P>
<P>
"Even if some irresponsible ruler of some enemy country plans
for such a misadventurism, the checks and balances in their system
will intervene and prevent such an act," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Prosecutors Send Final Summons to Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's state prosecutors
have delivered a written summons to former president Soeharto
ordering him to appear in court next week to face charges of
massive corruption.
</P>
<P>
The document was handed over Friday to the Soeharto family, and
the 79-year-old former strongman's lawyers, at his Jakarta home by
Muchtar Arifin, the chief prosecutor handling the Soeharto case,
the Indonesian Observer daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to a schedule, Soeharto will be tried on August 31 on
the charges of stealing 580 million U.S. dollars from the state by
channeling funds from several huge tax-free charitable foundations.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would happen if Soeharto failed to appear, Arifin
hinted there could be a postponement.
</P>
<P>
"If you are summoned by the court, of course you have to appear.
But it depends on his condition ... we'll see how it goes," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Soeharto's lawyers said he is tool ill to face trial
on August 31.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, Judge Lalu Mariyun said the onus was on the
prosecutors to bring Soeharto to court.
</P>
<P>
He said the trial would open whether or not Soeharto turned up,
but could be adjourned if the prosecutors gave a valid legal
reason for not immediately proceeding.
</P>
<P>
"Within one or two days Soeharto's medical team will determine
whether or not he is fit to stand trial," One of Soeharto's
lawyers Juan Felix Tampubolon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
However, Arifin said an independent team of doctors from state-
owned Cipto Mangunkusumo general Hospital will verify Soeharto's
health before the first hearing scheduled for next Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- One more new bridge, the Aungzeya
Bridge, crossing the Hline River in Yangon division was opened to
traffic Friday, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The suspension steel bridge, which links the division's Insein

the Myanmar Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth bridge crossing the Hline river after the
Bayintnaung, Uto and Hline.

<P>
The 1,135.8-meter-long and 19.2-meter-wide bridge is the second
longest one after the 1,793-meter-long Thanlyin Bridge on the Bago
River in the same division. It also has 90-meter high tower,
becoming the second highest bridge in the country.
</P>
<P>
The bridge was built to ensure smooth and secure transport for
the growing population and traffic of the Hlinethaya township
where a major industrial zone is located.
</P>
<P>
The building of the bridge started in April 1997 and completed
in August this year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf threatens to kill two hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Abu Sayyaf has threatened to
kill two hostages unless police release two of its couriers
arrested with 240,000 U.S. dollars worth of alleged ransom money.
</P>
<P>
One of the Abu Sayyaf leaders, Galib Andang, alias Commander
Robot, raised the idea of beheading two Europeans or two Christian
evangelists at a meeting of the group Friday morning, the local
Philippine Daily Inquirer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Andang called chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado by
satellite phone to inform him of "their plans if the money and the
couriers are not released as soon as possible," the paper said,
quoting a source present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Aventajado confirmed that he had spoken with Andang Friday
morning by phone, but denied that the matter of the seized money
had been raised. He also said the arrests were a "police matter"
that the negotiating panel would leave in police hands.
</P>
<P>
Policemen arrested the two Abu Sayyaf couriers in the southern
city of Zamboanga on Thursday when they were trying to exchange
240,000 dollars of ransom money into pesos at a bank there.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada expressed the hope Friday that the
arrests would not hamper ongoing negotiations for the release of
the 25 remaining hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf in Jolo island in
the southern province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf rebels are still holding 10 of the 21 hostages
they abducted from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan on April 23,
and three French TV journalists and 12 local Christian evangelists
they seized last month in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
So far, the rebel group has freed all the nine Malaysians, one
German woman and one Filipino of the Sipadan group.
</P>
<P>
The rebels had agreed to release all its captives last Saturday
but reneged on its promise, claiming the military was planning
attacks against them.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Joint Efforts Urged to Curb Child Sex Tourism in Asia  by Yang Qingchuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- International agencies,
governments, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and tourism
operators in Asia should take joint efforts to curb child sex
tourism in the region, an international meeting resolved here this
week.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized by the United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), was held here
between August 24 and 25 to increase awareness and forge
coordination to stop the sexual exploitation of children in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Delegates included experts from U.N. agencies and Asian NGOs,
government officials and tourism operators form Australia,
Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization has opened up the region, but it also increased
the number of destinations where paedophiles can seek sex with
children," ESCAP social expert Laura Skolnik said in a keynote
speech at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"To respond to this, U.N. agencies like ESCAP, governments,
NGOs and the tourism industry will need work closely to solve the
problem," she said.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper airfares, the opening of countries once closed for war
or politics, and the development of internet in the region have
provided more opportunities for tourist paedophiles to seek child
sex in the region, according to her.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourist paedophiles coming to the region is on
the rise, and the offenders, who have been traditionally from
western countries, now include an increasingly number of people
from some wealthy Asian countries, namely Japan and South Korea,
she said.
</P>
<P>
While Asian countries such as Cambodia and Vietnam have been
known as destinations for such tourists, Thailand, the Philippines
and the Sri Lanka are joining the group, the expert said.
</P>
<P>
"The situation are becoming more and more serious," she warned,
saying that latest U.N. figures suggested over one million
children worked in the underage sex trade in Asia.
</P>
<P>
These children are at high risk of contracting HIV/AIDS and
other sexually transmitted diseases, said Christin Beddoe, an
expert from an Asian NGO named End Child Prostitution in Asian
Tourism (ECPAT).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said those young victims are facing numerous
social, psychological and emotional problems, such as self-
loathing, fear, humiliation, guilt, dejection and suicide
tendencies.
</P>
<P>
To make the things worse, she noted that there are few health
and social services available to those children, and those who can
get physical treatment often lacking of mental care.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for us to join hands to stop this spreading social
disease, and save those innocent children in the region," she
urged delegates at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, delegates agreed that since the tourism
operators are often the first point of contact for those
paedophile tourists, Asian tourism industry should play a major
role in fighting the illegal sex trade of children.
</P>
<P>
"Tour guides, taxi drivers and other related workers are often
asked by those tourists where to find children for sex," an ESCAP
official said," and frequently, they do not know what they can do
about it or how to report the crimes."
</P>
<P>
"So training tourism operators and other workers in the 'front-
line' to prevent child sexual exploitation is very important," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
To conduct such training, the ESCAP and some NGOs have
announced at the meeting that they will design a training program
on sexual exploitation prevention and awareness for tourism
industry staff and governments in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Delegates representing the tourism industry and governments
have also vowed to take a proactive role in bringing sexual
offenders to justice, and will also work to develop a region-wide
network of concerned organizations and tour operators to share
information on the prevention of child sex tourism.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from governments in Cambodia, the Philippines,
Vietnam and Thailand -- all hotspots for child sex tourism --
promised to set up training program for tour operators and other
related workers in the front line of combating the crime.
</P>
<P>
"For many years, we have not been very aware of the problem
with child sex tourism in our country," said Rafael Relucio, a
delegate from the government of the Philippines, "but that will
change from now on."
</P>
<P>
The Asian effort to curb child sex tourism is also gaining a
world-wide support, delegates said.
</P>
<P>
Several European airlines are now showing in-flight videos on
preventing child sex tourism, and at least 23 countries in the
world have laws allowing prosecution of their citizens for sex
offenses with children overseas.

<HEADLINE> AFP Always Loyal to President, Philippine Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of the
Philippines (AFP) remains a professional organization and will
always be loyal to the president, National Security Adviser
Alexander Aguirre said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre issued the statement as he belied reports linking him
to a spy plot against President Joseph Estrada allegedly involving
some members of the Presidential Security Group (PSG).
</P>
<P>
"Whoever is the President, they will be loyal to that President.
There is no reason to do anything against an incumbent because he
is their Commander-in-Chief. That is always the tendency of our
professional soldiers," Aguirre assured the public in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
A former head of the PSG security and operations branch, Thomas
Dumpit, reportedly claimed that bugging devices have been
installed in the presidential palace by PSG members supportive of
the country's major opposition party, the Lakas-NUCD.
</P>
<P>
In a letter published by the Philippine Daily Inquirer on
Friday Dumpit accused Maj. Gen. Jose Calimlim, vice chief of staff
and head of the intelligence service of the AFP, as the brains of
the eavesdropping operations.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada Friday ordered an immediate investigation
into these claims. And the Senate was said to begin an
investigation into the alleged bugging operations.
</P>
<P>
Lakas leaders vehemently denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre said that the only way the PSG can bug the president's
office is if he specifically orders it.
</P>
<P>
He also said the chances of former President Fidel Ramos of
Lakas benefiting from the alleged spy plot are slim, as he, or
Lakas, has nothing to gain from it.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who also served the Aquino and Ramos administrations,
was one of those linked to the alleged plot. But he said there is
no reason for him to do so, as "I was an original Erap (President
Estrada) man since he was Vice President."
</P>
<P>
Aguirre was appointed by then President Ramos as consultant of
then Vice President Estrada when he was head of the Presidential
Anti-Crime Commission, after Aguirre's failed bid for the Senate
in the 1992 elections.
</P>
<P>
Calimlim also denied Friday in a statement that he ordered the
bugging on telephone lines of the presidential palace.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Landline Phones to Have Eight Digits by 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- All landline telephone numbers in
the Philippines will consist of eight digits by the second quarter
of 2001, a government official said over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
National Telecommunications Commission's Common Carrier
Authorization Division Chief Edgardo Cabarios said the move to
increase the landline numbers from seven to eight digits is
necessary to circumvent an anticipated shortage in numbers, the
Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the scheme will be implemented on June 2, 2001,
initially in Metro Manila, and that telephone companies are
advised to inform their subscribers of the changes as early as now
to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
Cabarios said existing subscribers on or before June 2, 2001
will only have one common digit added ahead their seven digits,
while applicants for landline phones after that date will be given
eight-digit numbers, with each telephone company getting a
distinct one number.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 9.9 million landline subscribers as
against 6.8 million unsubscribed lines.

JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Vice President

</P>
<P>
"The meeting was opened by President Abdurrahman Wahid and

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Industrial Output Up 11.3 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's industrial output
grew by 11.3 percent year-on-year in July 2000, contributed mainly
by the electronics and engineering clusters which surged up 27.4
percent and 11.4 percent respectively, according to the monthly
report released by Singapore's Economic Development Board Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The robust hike in output of the electronics cluster was
boosted by unabated surging global demand for semiconductors which
brought about a robust growth in the outputs of memory chips, PC
processors, computers of newly-launched models, computer
peripherals such as printers and ink cartridges, the printed
circuits boards assembled as well as disk drives.
</P>
<P>
The strong growth in the engineering cluster was lifted by the
30.1 percent rise in output of the precision engineering segment
and the 8.5 percent expansion in output of the process engineering
segment as their advances exceed the declines in the transport
engineering segment which contracted 12.2 percent year-on-year in
July this year.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster recorded a decline of 15.2 percent in
July 2000, dragged down by the 44 percent drop in output of the
pharmaceuticals and 3.7 percent decrease in output of the
petroleum segment as their losses eroded the robust 25.4 percent
growth in output of the industrial/specialty chemicals segment.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative growth for the first seven months of 2000 in
Singapore's industrial output was 13.1 percent higher than in the
same period of last year with the electronics cluster surging up
23.2 percent, the chemicals cluster moving up by a marginal 1.4
percent and the engineering cluster growing by 9.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Urges Labor Sector to Support Pro-Poor Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada urged workers anew Saturday to unite behind his
administration in accomplishing his goal of making Filipinos enjoy
the fruits of sustainable growth and development.
</P>
<P>
"If we unite and if the labor sector cooperates with our
government, I believe we can achieve prosperity in the long run,"
Estrada said on a radio-TV program.
</P>
<P>
He also called on workers nationwide to wait for the regional
wage boards to decide on their petition for pay increases.
</P>
<P>
The labor sector filed a petition for a daily wage hike of 75.5
pesos (1.7 U.S. dollars) in Metro Manila earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the need to balance the interests of both labor and
management, he said he must also make sure employers are not
forced to shut down their businesses in the event that the
regional wage and productivity boards decide on new wage
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
The president said generating enough jobs for Filipinos is the
foundation of the economy and would be one of his long-term
solutions to poverty.
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts on this front have already yielded
concrete results with the creation of more than one million jobs,
mostly in the agriculture sector, since he assumed office in 1998,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Department of Labor and Employment Secretary
Bienvenido Laguesma predicted an improvement in the employment
picture from April, when an unemployment rate of 13.9 percent was
recorded, the highest since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The National Statistics Office is processing the figures for
July, but we believe the picture would be better than that in
April," he said,
</P>
<P>
He also said his department will meet next week with
petitioners from the labor sector.
</P>
<P>
"Any decision must be carefully considered so that we can take
into account the capacity of employers to grant wage hikes," he
said.

<HEADLINE> 800,000 Filipinos Leave to Seek Jobs Abroad Yearly: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 800,000 Filipinos leave
their country every year to seek jobs abroad, a government
official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a TV program, Ang Pasada ng Pangulo, chief of the
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration, also said there are
now some 5.5 million Filipinos working abroad.
</P>
<P>
These statistics, however, do not include undocumented Filipino
workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Labor officials estimate that the number of Filipinos working
abroad amounts to 7 million. Overseas Filipino workers remit back
some 7 billion U.S. dollars every year, a major source of the
country's foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Regalado said the Philippines remains to be a source of skilled
workers for many countries such as the United Kingdom and the
United States where there has been huge demand for Filipino nurses
since last year.
</P>
<P>
These two countries, according to him, also have high demand
for Filipino workers in health care services and information
technology,resulting in the increase of 6.4 percent in the
deployment of the skilled workers category to foreign countries
for the last six months.
</P>
<P>
Regalado noted that Saudi Arabia, despite its nationalization
policies, continues to hire the biggest number of overseas
Filipino workers.

<HEADLINE> Australians Debate on Nuclear Reactor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A debate has started in
Australia on whether the country's Lucas Heights nuclear reactor
should be shut down.
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear campaigners and environmentalists urged that the
reactor should be shut down during the Olympic Games next month
after a possible terrorist plot to attack it during the Olympics
was revealed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press reported Saturday that
detectives in Auckland, New Zealand, were investigating an
immigration racket in March when they stumbled on plans which
appeared to point to an attack on the Lucas Heights reactor. New
Zealand police found those involved were sympathizers of alleged
terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Australian Science Minister Nick Minchin said however that the
Lucas Heights reactor would not be closed.
</P>
<P>
The reactor, built in Sydney's outskirts more than 40 years ago,
is now surrounded by housing in the city's south. It is used for
scientific and medical research and is much smaller than an
electricity-generating nuclear reactor, producing about 10
megawatts of thermal energy compared with 3,000 megawatts of an
electricity-generating reactor.
</P>
<P>
Anti-nuclear campaigners believe the reactor is dangerous. A
meltdown would take just eight minutes, leaving no time to
evacuate nearby suburbs, they said.

YANGON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's opposition political
party leader Aung San Suu Kyi continued to be barred by the
authorities from travelling further Saturday after she reached
Dala township in Yangon division on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Together with two other party leaders, Aung San Suu Kyi,
general secretary of the National League for Democracy, left
Yangon for Dala to carry out party activities on Friday morning,
crossing the Yangon River. She was blocked by the local
authorities from travelling further after arriving at Dala.
</P>
<P>
According to a government-released information sheet Saturday
afternoon, she had stayed at Sarpachaun ward in Dala by the
roadside until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The information sheet said the security conditions make it
unsafe for her to travel to Twante, a nearby area, adding that the
local authorities have told her to return home.
</P>
<P>
Heavy police presence remains around the clock at the nearby
area where she "rests," it said.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi's health condition is unknown.
</P>
<P>
The travel ban on Aung San Suu Kyi came two years after she was
prevented from doing so in August 1998. During that incident, she
remained in her car by the roadside for six days under the sun and
rain,endangering her life.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Aung San Suu Kyi, despite release from
nearly six years' house arrest in July 1995, seems to be still
under restriction to move outside Yangon.

Indian security forces gunned down a Pakistani intruder Friday
night in the Jammu division of the disputed area during the latest

ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan lodged a strong
protest on Friday with India against what it called trespassing on
the residence of an official of its high commission in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement from the Pakistani Foreign Office, the
protest was conveyed to India's deputy high commissioner in

At around 11:00 hours Friday, six persons in civilian clothes

<HEADLINE> Rule of Law Not Determined by One Incident, Says Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of State for
Information and Publicity Jonathan Moyo Saturday said the rule of
law in the country cannot be said to have collapsed because of one
incident, The Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Responding to questions from reporters at a Media Institute of
Southern Africa annual general meeting in Harare on Saturday, Moyo
said the rule of law could not be based on one thing only.
</P>
<P>
Farm occupations by the war veterans were not an indication of
a breakdown in law but a clear testimony of the need for land
redistribution, he said.
</P>
<P>
Journalists at the meeting had alleged that there was now a
breakdown of the rule of law in the country following farm
occupations by the war veterans and land hungry villagers.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said, "Rule of law does not collapse because one
particular thing is not being done, when all other things are
working. The courts, the economy and all other things are working.
"
</P>
<P>
He said the government policy was clear on the issue of war
veterans on the farms. Those occupying farms that were earmarked
for acquisition would not be moved. Nobody was allowed to touch
or damage the property at those farms they occupied.
</P>
<P>
Moyo said people needed to understand that correction of
historical imbalances had never been easy, as it was not a usual
event.
</P>
<P>
He said in other countries the governments there had
nationalized all the land. If the government resorted to that
there would be an even bigger outcry, indicating that the current
land acquisition was "the best and fairest" method under the
circumstances.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Rejects WB's Loan for Fight Against AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- For fear of further swelling its
external debt burden, Malawi has rejected a loan of 40 million U.S.
dollars from World Bank (WB) aimed at curbing the further spread
of HIV/AIDS in the country, Zambia's Sunday Mail newspaper
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the country's Deputy Health Minister Philip Bwanali
as saying the loan was offered during the recent health and
finance ministers' AIDS summit in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"We feel it's practically unthinkable to get such a loan for
non-productive usage like the fight against HIV/AIDS," he said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
Bwanali said Malawi needed at least 161 million dollars to
fight the incurable disease but had so far only sourced 121
million dollars, leaving a shortfall of 40 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that while the government took the fight against HIV/
AIDS seriously, taking a loan to fight the pandemic would not be
advisable since Malawi is already reeling under an external debt
of over two billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It could be immoral for Malawi which is already heavily
indebted to get another loan, the best thing the bank can do is to
give us a grant," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- About 400 Angolans have just
crossed into Zambia through Zambezi District in the North Western
Province to seek refugee because of insecurity in their country,
Zambia's Sunday Mail newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zambezi District Administrator Willie Manjomba said on Saturday
that there was an influx of more refugees in the area.
</P>
<P>
Manjomba said he had just sent security officers to make a
physical count of the refugees to ascertain the exact number of
the asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
He said the refugees started arriving in the country on
Thursday and that the latest influx was a source of concern as
more resources would be needed to meet their immediate needs.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) statistics, there are about 224,500 refugees in
Zambia and the number is steadily rising.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Power Supply to Improve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's electricity supply will
be significantly boosted in two months, easing the severe power
rationing by the end of October, said the Ministry of Energy.
</P>
<P>
Three World Bank-funded emergency diesel power plants will be
in operations in September and October with installed capacity of
over 110 megawatts, Sunday Nation newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Taking into the additional 40 megawatts from independent power
producers in the next two months, the current shortfall of 180
megawatts could be negligible, an official at the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The extent of the short rains in October will determine whether
the rationing will be completely lifted because most power in
Kenya comes from hydropower plants.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government has rationed power since last September,
which has hampered the industry sector and disrupted daily lives
of ordinary people.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is one of the sub-Sahara
African countries with the highest death rate due to maternal
complications, according to Zambia Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Saturday quoted Dr. Frida Kazemba, Chairperson of
the Medical Women's Association of Zambia (MWAZ), as saying here
on Friday that the maternal mortality rate in the country stands
649 per 100,000 live births in urban centers while remote rural
areas amount to about 800 per 100,000 live births.
</P>
<P>
"The association has been concerned with the increasing number
of maternal deaths in Zambia which go unnoticed. Efforts in the
past do not seem to have made any significant reduction in
maternal mortality in this country," she said at the third bi-
annual congress of the association.
</P>
<P>
Global statistics indicate that about 500,000 women and girls
die every year from 200 million pregnancies.

NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund for
Animal Welfare (IFAW) has granted 1.25 million U.S. dollars to the
Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) to improve park operations and
restock wildlife, the East African Standard newspapers reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The grant contract was signed here Friday between KWS Director
Nehemiah Rotich and IFAW regional director Michael Wamithi for
East Africa.
</P>
<P>
Part of the money, about 250,000 dollars, will be used to
restore the Meru National Park in central Kenya which is being
upgraded to attract more tourists.
</P>
<P>
Ritch said his organization is determined to restore the
conservation status of the Meru park and to make it a major
tourist destination and a contributor to the national economy.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that already 15 elephants and 10 giraffes had
been relocated to the park, and the number of giraffes is expected
to increase to 100 in next few months.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is well-known for its wildlife with over 50 national
parks across the country. Last year it received nearly 900,000
foreign tourists and the number this year is expected to increase
to one million.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Risks EU Fish Ban Again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Hardly a month after the
European Union (EU) lifted the fish export ban on Uganda, there
are fears that the ban could be reinstated, the Monitor daily, an
independent newspaper in Uganda, reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A team from the EU Veterinary Inspection Mission is scheduled
to come to Uganda from October 2 to 6 to assess how far Uganda has
fulfilled the conditions that were set when the ban was
provisionally lifted on August 4, said the report.
</P>
<P>
But the country lies far behind schedule, according to sources
from Uganda Investment Authority (UIA).
</P>
<P>
The government has delayed releasing money to facilitate the
modernization of landing sites, fish processing and documentation
to match the standards required of the EU, James Mutende, an
Investment Executive with UIA, told the Monitor Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We are time barred. We risk having the ban reinstated if they
find that we haven't fulfilled the requirements," said Mutende.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government has delayed releasing 116,200 U.S.
dollars to the department of fisheries to provide fences, gates,
water systems, floating jetty and offices for inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"Should the government fail to release the money by the end of
next week, chances of our being ready for the team will be very,
very low," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fish ban was imposed on Uganda's exports in March last year,
citing poor hygiene, sanitation and the presence of pesticides in
the fishing waters. The ban cost the country close to 100 million
U.S. dollars of direct exports, revenues to the government,
incomes to fishermen and other related activities.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges Re-negotiation of Lusaka Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has urged the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to ask Uganda and Rwanda to
go back to the drawing table and work on the one year-old Lusaka
peace pact so that it can be implemented more smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The independent Guardian newspaper Saturday quoted Jakaya
Kikwete, Tanzanian Minister for Foreign Affairs and International
Cooperation, as saying that the pact signatories should go back to
the drawing board if necessary.
</P>
<P>
"If the solution towards the implementation of the peace pact
can be obtained through re-negotiation, as demanded by the
Kinshasa government, then Tanzania supports it," the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete said on Friday that Tanzania accepted Congolese
President Laurent Kabila's demand for the re-negotiation of the
pact in the light of new developments caused by the delay in
implementing the agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania's position on the Congo problem was still that
adopted by the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC)
extraordinary summit held in Lusaka last week to try to revive the
peace pact.
</P>
<P>
During the summit SADC heads of state and government asked the
DRC government to abide by the peace pact and give the necessary
cooperation to the United Nations peace observers currently in the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila said this week his government cannot in any
way implement the pact, which was supposed to bring an end to a
two-year civil war, as new developments have emerged since it was
sealed in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Congo's human rights minister Leonard She Okitundu told
diplomats at an open meeting in Kinshasa on Wednesday that Congo
had decided to suspend implementation of the Lusaka accord and
wanted to have fresh and direct talks with Rwanda, Uganda and
Burundi to try to solve the wider, regional issues that have
helped fuel the war.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda rejected that on Thursday, with Foreign Minister Andre
Bumaya saying the Lusaka accord offered the only way out of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Fighting in the DRC started in 1998 when rebel forces, backed
by Kabila's former allies Rwanda and Uganda, turned on the
Congolese president, who fought them back with support from Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Rwanda-Uganda alliance fell apart after they backed rival
rebel groups, and the two countries have fought one another
intermittently in the northern Congolese city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire was agreed in the Zambian capital, Lusaka, in July
1999, but it has not been respected by any of the parties.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Africa to Prevent Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Under-Secretary
Ibrahim Gambari said here Sunday that Africa should make efforts
to prevent conflicts instead of falling back on the last option of
peacekeeping which yields few positive results.
</P>
<P>
Gambari, who is also Special Advisor to the U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, arrived here on Friday for a fact-finding
mission to establish the effects of the Angolan war on Zambia and
Namibia which share borders with the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with acting Zambian Foreign Minister Peter
Machungwa, Gambari said Annan is doing everything in his power to
try to bring lasting peace to Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official is expected to meet Zambian President
Frederick Chiluba Monday before going to Namibia.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa told the U.N. envoy that Zambia has been affected
adversely by the continuous war in Angola, because of which some
Zambians in the border areas have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the worsening refugee situation, Zambian lives and
property have been lost in the cross-border raids by Angolans,
Machungwa said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is faced with the challenge of
accommodating a growing number of refugees from Angola and the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
There are at present over 230,000 refugees in Zambia, 160,000
of which are from Angola.

<HEADLINE> Iran still Wants to be WTO Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) Visiting Foreign Minister of Iran
Kamal Kharrazi Saturday said in Harare that his country will
pursue its application for membership in the World Trade
Organization (WTO) after being initially blocked on political
grounds.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi, who was on a three-day official visit to Zimbabwe,
Saturday told the Zimbabwe News Agency Iran is keen to become a
member of the WTO but the United States has been blocking it.
</P>
<P>
""We are still not a member of the WTO because the U.S. is
using its political and financial muscle to interfere in our own
affairs as a country," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's hopes now lie on negotiations with WTO General
Council.
</P>
<P>
Iran first applied to join the WTO five years ago but was told
the application document had been lost and was asked to file a new
one. Iran re-applied and is still awaiting a response, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been accusing Iran, among other Islamic states, of
funding terrorist attacks on American interests.
</P>
<P>
However, since the coming into power of President Khatemi, the
relations between the two countries have been thawing and Kharrazi
hopes this will help his country join the WTO.

<HEADLINE> Namibia's Envoy on Land Problem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 26 (Xinhua) The Namibian government has
managed to acquire just 20 farms on a willing-buyer-willing-seller
basis since independence in 1990 and is yet to decide what to do
next, a Namibia's envoy said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Herald in Harare on Friday, just
before he met Zimbabwean vice-president Joseph Msika, Namibian
High Commissioner to Zimbabwe Ndali-Che Kamati spoke of the
Namibian government's efforts to acquire land.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have been trying the willing-buyer-willing-seller
strategy but it has proved to be unsuitable because the land is
very expensive."
</P>
<P>
Although his government had not yet made any firm decisions on
how to proceed next, farmers who own more than one farm, derelict
farms and farms owned by absentee landlords would be targeted for
acquisition, he said.
</P>
<P>
The High Commissioner said his country, like others in the
region, is watching the land redistribution in Zimbabwe with great
interest.
</P>
<P>
"I would like the vice-president to brief me of the latest
developments and the progress made so far. Namibia is having the
same problem and we have a lot to learn," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he also wanted to brief vice-president Joseph Msika on
the Namibian land experience, adding that most of the country's
arable land is still in the hands of the white minority.
</P>
<P>
The black community has no role to play in commercial farming,
he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss and negotiate with the owners of these farms
and the outcome will depend on their attitude. If they are
cooperative, the process will be smooth but if they are not, it
might be rough," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has adopted a policy to compulsorily
acquire land from white farmers who own more than one farm.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to acquire at least five million hectares
to resettle thousands of landless Zimbabweans.

he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will discuss and negotiate with the owners of these farms
and the outcome will depend on their attitude. If they are
cooperative, the process will be smooth but if they are not, it
might be rough," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean government has adopted a policy to compulsorily
acquire land from white farmers who own more than one farm.
</P>
<P>
The government wants to acquire at least five million hectares
to resettle thousands of landless Zimbabweans.

<HEADLINE> S. African Cameraman Back Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking shortly after his return at the Johannesburg
International Airport, where he was met by his elated family and a
large media contingent, Radebe said: "The conditions (in jail) are
best described as hell."
</P>
<P>
Visibly relieved, the freelance cameraman said he was grateful
for the support he received from the South African government,
particularly former president Nelson Mandela during his ordeal.
</P>
<P>
Radebe said he plans to personally thank the elderly South
African statesman on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Without Nelson I would be stuffed. Without Nelson I would
still be in jail. I don't think the words 'thank you' say enough,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Radebe, along with his three colleagues making a three-part
documentary in Liberia, has-been held in a central Monrovia jail
for a week after being charged with espionage by the Liberian
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
He was freed on Friday afternoon after Liberian authorities
bowed to mounting international pressure.
</P>
<P>
"I went to Liberia as a freelance cameraman to cover a story
about the Liberian people. I don't know how it became espionage,"
said Radebe.
</P>
<P>
Liberian ambassador to South Africa Llewellyn Witherspoon, who
attended the briefing, said he has not received an official
notification from his government informing him of the journalists'
detention.
</P>
<P>
"It was unfortunate but never should have happened. They (the
Liberian government) lost an opportunity on the first day and
could have limited the impact instead of drawing out the
allegations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Witherspoon added that the gains to improve the country's image
abroad has been negated by the debacle, saying "This has yet again
sunk us into the abyss".

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Tolerance in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton called here on Saturday for religious and ethnic tolerance
in Nigeria, saying Nigeria must remain united in order to prosper.
</P>
<P>
His appeal was apparently relating to the frequent religious
and ethnic conflicts in recent years, which has threatened to tear
the most populous African country apart.
</P>
<P>
In his one-hour speech at a joint session of the country's top
legislature, the National Assembly, Clinton praised the role
Nigeria has played in making peace in the West African sub-region,
which he said had cost the country 10 billion U.S. dollars despite
the country's economic odds.
</P>
<P>
He said such a role could only be played by such a regional
power as Nigeria. However, it is unfair for Nigeria to play the
role alone, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged America's support for peacekeeping operations in the
sub-region, especially in Sierra Leone. He said American experts
had already begun the training of five battalions of Nigerian
troops for future peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
On debt remission, Clinton promised to push its Western allies
for a substantial reduction of Nigeria's 30 billion U.S. dollars
foreign debts. He enjoined the legislators to play their parts to
ensure the benefit from the debt reduction went to the average
Nigerian people.
</P>
<P>
Before his address, Clinton held talks with Nigerian President
Olusegun Obasanjo on debt remission, military cooperation,
regional peace, oil price hike as well as AIDS among other topics.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived here on Saturday morning for a two-day state
visit to Nigeria, accompanied by many high- ranking officials,
including Secretaries of Transport and Labor, Vice Trade
Representative, two assistant secretaries of state, chairman of
the U.S. Import and Export Bank and Jessi Jackson, U.S. special
envoy to Africa, as well as 13 congressmen and hundreds of
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was the second American president to visit Nigeria
after Jimmy Carter in the 1970s. It was also Clinton' s second
trip to Africa as U.S. president since 1998.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Nigeria to Help Check Rising Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton appealed to his host Nigerian counterpart Olusegun
Obasanjo on Saturday to "do what he could" to help stabilize the
rising prices of oil in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint news conference at the State House in the
capital, Clinton said although Nigeria did not have the capacity
to effect any changes in the current prices of oil, it could still
work with its colleagues in the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) to adjust their production capacities.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, arrived in Abuja on Saturday morning for a two-day
visit to the most populous African country, said that the current
prices were too high, suggesting that the ideal rates should be
around 20 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Obasanjo assured his American counterpart that
Nigeria would collaborate with its OPEC colleagues at the summit
in Venezuela next month to bring down the prices of oil to a
reasonable level.
</P>
<P>
"Excessive high price is not good for both the producer and
consumer," said Obasanjo, adding that excessive low price of oil
was also not good for both parties.
</P>
<P>
A mechanism to bring the price to a reasonable level must be
evolved, added the president.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Nigeria is America's fifth largest supplier
of oil, accounting for about eight percent of the country's total
oil import.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Optimistic about Signing of Burundi Peace Accord Next Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The facilitator for
Burundi peace talks, former South African President Nelson Mandela
has expressed his optimism that the 19 parties involved in the
talks will sign a peace agreement next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived on Saturday in northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha where the signing ceremony will take place, said he is
positive that the outstanding issues will be resolved in the
remaining 48 hours to reach consensus on the draft agreement.
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic that a deal could be signed on Monday. I don't
see any problems at all. I think we are going to sign," Mandela
told journalists on his arrival.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's remarks came after reports from Bujumbura that pro-
Tutsi parties will not sign the accord until all details have been
completed.
</P>
<P>
The details include who is going to lead the transitional
government, electoral system and cease-fire arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposed accord, the Tutsis, who have dominated
political and economic life in Burundi since its independence in
1962, would have to hand over power to an elected government in
three years' time.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary General Koffi Annan was considering
sending U.N. forces to enforce the peace agreement during the
transitional period, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was expected to meet leaders of the Burundi parties
individually beginning on Saturday to iron out remaining obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Twelve foreign heads of state including U.S. President Bill
Clinton have confirmed to witness the signing of the peace accord,
a culmination of two years of intensive talks aimed at ending the
seven-year civil war in the central African country between Hutu
rebels and the Burundian army and government dominated by Tutsi
minority.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Help Cut Nigeria's Debt Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting American President Bill
Clinton assured his host Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo
here on Saturday that he would personally plead with the Paris
Club of creditor states to lighten Nigeria's debt burden amounting
to 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint press conference after his talks with
Obasanjo at the State House, Clinton said that the United States
would do all it could to make the Paris Club reschedule its debt.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived here Saturday for a two-day state visit,
said Nigeria should be awarded some debt relief in return for its
commitment to economic reform and democracy following the country'
s long-term military rule.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that Nigeria's major creditors might not
agree with the United States, which owned only four percent of
Nigeria's total debt, on granting debt relief.
</P>
<P>
The elected government of Obasanjo has been campaigning for
debt forgiveness as a crucial measure to revive the ailing economy
since its inauguration on May 29,1999.

<P>
ABUJA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. President Bill
Clinton pledged here on Saturday to continue to work with a "
sense of urgency" in order to bring about a peace accord between
the Israelis and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after talks with his host
Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo at the State House, Clinton
played down expectations for his scheduled meeting with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the public should not expect too much out of
his meeting with Mubarak, who met Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli acting foreign minister last week.
</P>
<P>
"We are working with a sense of urgency given the timetable
that the parties have set for themselves," said Clinton, adding
that he was pleased the parties concerned were still working to
consolidate the gains so far made.
</P>
<P>
The tri-party marathon summit at Camp David between Clinton and
Israeli and Palestinian leaders collapsed on July 25 over a series
of disputes, especially on the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who arrived in the Nigerian capital Abuja earlier
Saturday for a two-day state visit, is scheduled to leave for
Arusha, Tanzania to witness Monday's signing of a Burundi peace
deal, brokered by former South African president Nelson Mandela.

<HEADLINE> British Soldiers Missing In Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The British Defense Ministry said
here Saturday that 12 British soldiers in Sierra Leone have lost
contact with their base.
</P>
<P>
"We have lost contact with a group of 12 soldiers in Sierra
Leone about 12 hours ago. We would have expected to hear from them
by now," a Reuters report quoted a Ministry of Defense official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers have gone missing in the Benguema area where the
training camp is located," the spokesman said, adding that
Benguema is northeast of Freetown, capital of Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The British soldiers might have lost touch due to something as
simple as a radio malfunction. But the Ministry of Defense had not
ruled out a kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 400 British troops in Sierra Leone,
training the government forces. Britain sent its soldiers to
Sierra Leone last may to intervene when rebels defied a 1999 peace
deal and marched on Freetown, wrong-footing an ill-prepared United
Nations operation.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers were taken hostage by the rebels
but were later released and Britain withdrew most of its forces,
except the training detachment, handing over to the U.N. force.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone has been a colony of Britain. A brutal civil war
broke out between the government and rebels on and off since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Freed by Liberia Arrive in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The four journalists released by
Liberia after a week of detention arrived here in Saturday,
telling a press conference that they had feared for their lives.
</P>
<P>
They told a news conference, held shortly after they arrived at
London's Heathrow airport, that they had been threatened by the
Liberian guards.
</P>
<P>
"They were brandishing a knife and said: 'we are going to split
your heart open' and I thought that was the end," said Sorious
Samura, a journalist from Sierra Leone who was among the four
arrested in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Liberian government agreed to drop all charges
against the journalists, two Britons, a South African and a Sierra
Leonean, who were working for London-based Channel 4 Television.
</P>
<P>
The journalists were requested to write a letter to Liberian
President Charles Taylor to apologize "for any offense" that their
"action or statements have caused."
</P>
<P>
The journalists had been in Liberia three weeks working on a
documentary when they were arrested a week ago at their hotel in
the capital, Monrovia. They were formally charged Monday.
</P>
<P>
The indictment said the Liberian government believed their
documentary would try to support British and U.S. allegations of
Liberian government involvement in diamond smuggling and
gunrunning for rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> BT to Double Price of Call From Payphone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British Telecommunications (BT)
is set to double the cost of a payphone call from the traditional
10p to a minimum 20p fee -- the first rise in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
The company will also start charging for domestic and
international directory inquiries from phone boxes, which are
currently free.
</P>
<P>
BT said in an announcement released Saturday that the charge
revisions have been prompted by a decline in payphone users, who
are switching to mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Newing, the director of BT Payphones, said the rise was
in line with inflation since the last price hike in 1984 when the
minimum charge was increased from 2p to 10p.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers' Association has demanded an inquiry by telecoms
regulator Oftel into the effects of a new tariff structure, which
will into effect from 3 October.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's Office of Telecommunications said it
had no control over charges, even though BT has a legal obligation
to provide affordable access to payphones.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Keeps Reinforcing Border With Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ecuadoran Armed Forces high
command is deploying elite units to reinforce the security of the
border with Colombia in the province of Esmeraldas as the
implementation of the Plan Colombia operations gets closer.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 paratroopers of the Special Forces Group, deployed in
Santo Domingo de los Colorados, in the center-west littoral of
Ecuador, are being sent to Esmeraldas, capital of the province of
the same name, in the western end of the country, authorities said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The operations began Monday this week and will conclude next
Monday, and is aimed at "reinforcing the security of the border
with Colombia and preventing the infiltration of rebel forces of
that country into Ecuadoran territory.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadoran government and the armed forces high command have
said that they will reinforce militarily all the border strip with
its neighbor to the north in preparation for the impending start
of the Plan Colombia operations.
</P>
<P>
Ecuadoran Foreign Minister Heinz Moeller said after the return
of President Gustavo Noboa from an official visit to Colombia that
his country "must maintain a status of constructive alertness"
toward the Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Noboa and his foreign minister have repeatedly said that the
Quito government gives its political, but not military, support to
the Plan Colombia.
</P>
<P>
They consider that this plan "has drifted into a warring plan
to combat the insurgent groups and militarize the war against drug
traffic" with the risk that the Colombian internal conflict will
expand and will encourage the United States to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Within the framework of the Plan Colombia, the United States
will pour 1.3 billion dollars in aid into Colombia over the next
two years, mostly in military backing for a drive against drug
traffickers and armed rebels protecting cocaine and heroin
production in the South American country.
</P>

Latin American nations including Ecuador, Brazil and Venezuela

LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- British police said Saturday that
they had uncovered a cache of explosives in a remote woodland area
some 96 kilometers west of London.
</P>
<P>
The cache was found in woods by a man walking his dog. Police

cache of "sophisticated" explosive devices were found in a copse

Anti-terrorist police officers and army bomb disposal officers
were called in, and forensic experts were still examining the
scene Saturday evening.

Speaking at a press conference, Detective Superintendent John
Donlon of Thames Valley Police said the eight devices were
contained in clear plastic water bottles, each packed with
explosives and three kilograms of brass nuts.
</P>
<P>
He said the discovery was being linked to an identical device
found last Sunday on a stone wall at Syreford, near Cheltenham,
now thought to be a "test" device.

QUITO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The new divisional coins made in
Mexico will arrive this weekend in Ecuador, said Central Bank
General Manager Leopoldo Baez Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The coins represent fractions of a dollar, meaning 50, 25, 10,
and five cents of a dollar, but with effigies of outstanding
Ecuadoran personalities.
</P>
<P>
It is not known yet whether the coins will enter circulation
immediately or if a special date will be waited for to present
them to the country, which will also receive coins minted in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
The sucre currently in circulation will disappear as the local
currency on September 9 in agreement with the "dollarization"
program that imposes the dollar as a standard of exchange.
</P>
<P>
The "dollarization" process started in Ecuador in April, two
months after it was announced by the deposed president Jamil
Mahuad (August of 1998-January of 2000).
</P>
<P>
The Mahuad government determined the rate of exchange with the
dollar at 25,000 sucres. The quotation was in January of 1999 at
an average of 7,119 sucres for one dollar.
