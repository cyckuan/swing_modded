Smith &AMP; Wesson Pursues Gun Safety
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gunmaker Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed Friday to make its weapons
more childproof by including safety locks with all of its handguns and pistols.
The company also will devote 2 percent of firearms revenues every year to
developing ''smart'' technology that limits a gun's use to its rightful owner.
In exchange, governments would drop lawsuits seeking damages for gun violence.
The National Shooting Sports Foundation, a firearms industry organization,
condemned Smith &AMP; Wesson, saying it had violated a trust with consumers and the
domestic firearms industry.

   MIDDLE RIVER, Md. (AP) -- A man accused of killing four people after
kidnapping his estranged girlfriend last week was holding up to five people
hostage in a house Friday night, police said. Joseph Palczynski was said to be
armed with at least three firearms. He was holding three to five people hostage,
said said Baltimore County police Cpl. Vickie Warehime. Police converged on the
home just east of Baltimore around 9:30 p.m. Friday, and were negotiating by
telephone for the release of the hostages.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton welcomed a parade of Northern Ireland's
quarreling leaders to the White House, hoping to use the cheer of St. Patrick's
Day to nudge them toward compromise. The president and first lady played host
for a Celebration of Ireland reception that featured a reading by Irish poet
Seamus Heaney and three renditions of ''Danny Boy'' -- one by a children's bell
choir from Belfast. Clinton compared the quest for peace in Northern Ireland to
the saga of the ''fortunate wind'' that blew Ulysses along on his voyage.

Taiwan Election Too Close to Call
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As the three top candidates running to succeed
President Lee Teng-hui wrapped up their campaigns, the election on Saturday was
too close to call. The ruling Nationalist Party could lose the presidency for
the first time since Taiwan was separated politically from China in 1949. Chen
Shui-bian, the candidate from the opposition Democratic Progressive Party has
had to back off from his party's independence stance in order to stand a chance
at the polls. Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji this week sought to sway Taiwanese
voters by indicating that if they pick Chen, Taiwan could find itself on the
brink of war.

Mozambique Food Shortages Feared
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- A U.N. agricultural expert said Friday that
thousands of Mozambican flood victims could face further hunger unless their
fields dry up enough for planting soon. Saturated soil and a shortage of seed
are threatening the start of the planting season, which traditionally begins in
early April. If the farmers can't plant, they'll miss the September harvest,
meaning they will be dependent of food aid until April 2001, the World Food
Program said last week.

High-Tech Visa Allotment Exhausted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took less than half the fiscal year to exhaust the
annual allotment of visas for skilled foreign professionals, the government said
Friday. The announcement likely boosts the prospects for congressional action
temporarily raising the ceiling on the visa program. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, given authority by Congress to dole out 115,000 H-1B
visas for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30, said it already has handed out
74,300 visas and has more than 45,000 petitions pending.

<HEADLINE> Predators 4, Coyotes 3, OT  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Greg Johnson scored with 1:04 left in overtime
Friday night, sending the Nashville Predators to a 4-3 victory over
Phoenix that kept the Coyotes from moving up in their division.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, who led the NHL after one of the best starts in
their history, lost second place in the Pacific Division to Los
Angeles this week and needed two points to pull even with the
Kings, who lost to St. Louis earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Predators forced Phoenix to settle for a point and
a 3-9-1 record in its last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie David Gosselin, playing his third NHL game, scored in the
third period to rally the Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville goalie Tomas Vokoun gave up goals to Jeremy Roenick,
Travis Green and Mika Alatalo in the first period, but made 23 of
his 33 saves the rest of the way to snap his four-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastien Bordeleau and Scott Walker had the goals that put the
Predators in position to tie when Gosselin, who was called up from
Milwaukee on Monday, got his first NHL goal.
</P>
<P>
   He took a pass from Craig Millar and let fly from the slot 8:07
into the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Vokoun made spectacular saves on shots by Shane Doan, Alatalo
and Roenick in the final minute of the third period, and smothered
a shot by Dallas Drake on a 2-on-1 midway through overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Then Johnson, speeding toward the net, took a pass from Walker
at the crease and flipped it past Sean Burke for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville outshot the Coyotes 13-7 in the second period, but
Burke, who had 27 saves in all, overcame his early lapses and
preserved his 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick and Green scored unassisted in the first period, Roenick
on his third career penalty shot and second straight successful
conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick, tackled by defenseman Richard Lintner to set up the
free shot 4:44 into the game, skated down the slot, faked left and
went right, tucking the puck behind Vokoun for his 33rd goal this
season.
</P>
<P>
   It gave Roenick one more point (73) than he had last season, and
his most in six years.
</P>
<P>
   Green made it 2-0 with a conventional goal 1:42 later, taking
the puck off the stick of Randy Robitaille for a shot that bounced
between Vokoun's legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators got on the board when Ville Peltonen picked up a
loose puck, passed to Bordeleau and screened Burke's line of vision
while Bordeleau scored with 8:20 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville tied it at 2-2 with 3:56 to go on Walker's slap shot
from the circle, but Alatalo scored 49 seconds later after a pass
from Yuha Ylonen off the boards behind the net.

<HEADLINE> US: No Cause for Alarm in N. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- While attention is focused on the
threat of war across the Taiwan Straits, U.S. officials say they
see steady, but not alarming, improvements in North Korea's
military, much of which is stationed within striking distance of
this South Korean capital.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen visited U.S. troops at an Army
post north of Seoul on Friday, and met with Defense Minister Cho
Seong Tae and other senior government officials Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference with Cho, Cohen said he welcomed China's
decision in recent days to tone down its rhetorical threats against
Taiwan, which is in the midst of a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think all concerned would see this as perhaps a sign, now
that the elections are about to be concluded at the end of this
day, that the Chinese leaders and whoever is elected by the
Taiwanese people can take whatever measures necessary to sit down
at a table and negotiate their differences,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he also hoped that whoever is elected in Taiwan will
make a goodwill gesture toward Beijing shortly after the election.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea for years has stationed hundreds of thousands of
troops and much of its artillery near the Demilitarized Zone that
separates the communist North from the capitalist South, a standoff
that has forced the United States to keep 37,000 troops permanently
based in South Korea as a deterrent to war.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Friday, Army Gen. Thomas Schwartz, the
commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, said of the Korean
People's Army, ''They're getting better, day-to-day and
year-to-year.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz refused to say specifically how the North Korean
military has gotten stronger, but he said, ''We're not alarmed by
what we see.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
later that the Korean People's Army has stepped up the pace of its
artillery exercises. North Korea also has made widely noted
progress in developing longer-range ballistic missiles, although it
agreed last fall to suspend missile test launches.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Bosworth, the U.S. ambassador in Seoul, said North
Korea's long-moribund economy is in ''steady and accelerating
decline'' and that it is suffering from a severe energy crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Before Cone's arrival Friday, about 100 demonstrators angered by
the permanent presence of American soldiers in South Korea gathered
near the main U.S. Military base in Seoul. They displayed
photographs of South Korean victims of rapes and beatings allegedly
committed by U.S. Servicemen and unfurled a banner that read:
''Apologize for Continuing Barbarism of U.S. Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked his reaction to the demonstrations, said he was not
troubled. ''I think they are inconsequential,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving Friday at Osan Air Base, south of Seoul, Cohen
flew by helicopter to Camp Stanley, on the northern outskirts of
the capital. There he stood atop a military trailer bed to thank
the troops for their work and assure them that the Pentagon is
committed to improving their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a red-white-and-blue windbreaker with the ''Indianhead''
symbol of the 2nd Infantry Division on the back, Cohen presented
Army achievement awards to four soldiers, re-enlisted three and
promoted two to sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen told a few hundred soldiers in his audience that he was
working on getting former National Football League greats Terry
Bradshaw and Mike Singletary to come visit the troops. ''We'll do
everything we can to get as much attention focused on you to say
we're grateful,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has about 47,000 troops in Japan and about
37,000 in South Korea, but there are no outward signs of alarm in
either country that tensions between China and Taiwan will trigger
a crisis on the Korean peninsula. Cohen visited Tokyo and a U.S.
Navy base in Japan before going to Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, the American commander, said that whenever there is
heightened military tensions outside Korea, such as the current
case in the Taiwan Straits, U.S. intelligence looks closer at what
the North Korean military is doing in case it might launch a
surprise attack on the South. He would not discuss details, but he
said there has been ''about normal'' North Korean military activity
during the recent runup to Taiwan's elections.

<HEADLINE> Car plunges into creek, 5-year-old narrowly escapes drowning  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- When a car slid off a snowy country road,
tumbled down an embankment and landed upside down in a creek, a
5-year-old passenger escaped drowning when her seatbelt kept her
suspended just inches above the icy water.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandmother, who was driving to the store at nightfall to
pick up some groceries, ended up slightly under water in the front
seat and died.
</P>
<P>
   ''Life is a game of inches, isn't it?'' said Gordon Dibble, a
deputy chief with the Genesee County sheriff's department.
''Accidents are a matter of seconds and split-seconds, and it's the
difference between living and dying most of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   A storm dropped 2 to 4 inches of snow in much of western New
York on Thursday night, making for dangerous driving. Just 45
minutes after the fatal crash in the town of Bethany, 40 miles
southwest of Rochester, a 64-year-old man was killed when he lost
control of his car and slammed into a utility pole less than 10
miles away in Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Eileen Punches, 62, had just left home with her granddaughter,
Briana Vicker, when her car apparently skidded on a bend on Mill
Road, which winds its way alongside Tonawanda Creek.
</P>
<P>
   The car plunged down a steep embankment, rolled over and came to
rest in the creek bed in pitch dark, partly submerged in about 3
feet of water. Investigators suspect Mrs. Punches drowned, but an
autopsy will determine the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   The front of the car was tipped into the water more so than the
rear, and the girl was belted in place in the middle of the rear
seat. If she had ended up in water, ''I would say there's a very
good chance'' she would have drowned, Dibble said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hypothermia is another possibility in that kind of water,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the crash -- police couldn't say how much time passed
-- a Good Samaritan came running. ''It's too bad he couldn't save
the driver but it wasn't from lack of trying,'' the police chief
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Krtanik, 41, a network specialist at Buffalo State College
who was driving north to Batavia, jumped out of his car and
scrambled down to the creek.
</P>
<P>
   He said he heard the girl yelling as he yanked open a door,
quickly calmed her down and pulled the grandmother out and
attempted to resuscitate her. When that failed, he got the girl out
and later tried again in vain to revive the woman, who was his
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Krtanik was treated for hypothermia. The girl also was treated
at a hospital and released.

<HEADLINE> Pataki aide agrees to pay $2,000 to settle ethics charges  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state Ethics Commission said it
considers its case closed against a top aide to Gov. George Pataki
who was suspected of improperly accepting meals from Philip Morris'
chief lobbyist in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   James Natoli, Pataki's director of state operations, paid $2,000
to the Ethics Commission to settle its inquiry of whether meals he
and his family accepted from Philip Morris' lobbyist Sharon Portnoy
between 1996 and 1999 exceeded the $75-per-year limit imposed by
the state Ethics Law.
</P>
<P>
   The gifts included admission to a hospitality trailer for Natoli
and his wife Eileen at an auto race in Nazareth, Pa., in April
1998, worth $199.47 and a $251.20 meal for Natoli and his family at
a restaurant in San Diego in August 1996 when the Pataki aide was
in town for the National Republican Convention.
</P>
<P>
   There were also charges of $106.86 for Natoli and his wife at an
Albany restaurant in August 1996, for $157.84 for the couple in
April 1998 in New York City and $148 for the couple in Albany in
May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Natoli admitted no guilt in making the deal with the Ethics
Commission, which called his $2,000 check a payment ''in lieu of
assessment.'' He could have faced a fine of up to $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Ethics Commission announced the agreement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Portnoy paid for the meals on a Philip Morris credit card, and
some of the receipts came to light last year when the cigarette
manufacturer released reams of documents as part of the tobacco
company's settlement with the state over cigarette-related health
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Natoli released a statement Friday saying he and his wife have
known Portnoy and her family for nearly 20 years, long before she
started working for Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result, I thought the dinners, which included our spouses
and on one occasion my children, were social in nature, not
business related, and well within the bounds of state guidelines,''
Natoli said.
</P>
<P>
   State ethics rules stipulate that officials cannot accept any
gift worth $75 or more if it can ''reasonably be inferred'' that
the gift was intended to influence the official in his or her
official capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Natoli said he was ''disappointed'' to learn Portnoy put the
meals on her corporate credit card and reported them as business
expenses. Natoli said when he found that out in 1999, he offered to
reimburse Philip Morris for the cost of the meals.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that the company refused to accept my check
reinforced my belief that the dinners were in fact social,'' Natoli
said.
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement signed Thursday with Natoli, Ethics Commission
Executive Director Donald Berens Jr. said the commission
acknowledged the long-time social relationship the Natolis had with
Portnoy and her family, and also Natoli's offer to repay the cost
of the meals.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki issued a statement Friday praising Natoli as a
''dedicated public servant and a valued member of my
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   As director of state operations, Natoli is in Pataki's inner
circle and among the top four or five most powerful members of his
Executive Chamber. He is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day
operations of state agencies. Natoli makes $147,490 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Three government reform groups, Common Cause, the League of
Women Voters and the New York Public Interest Research Group, asked
the Ethics Commission to look into the propriety of Philip Morris
paying for the Natoli meals.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her failure to report thousands of dollars of
spending charged to Philip Morris accounts in Albany to entertain
state legislators and officials, Portnoy has been suspended from
lobbying in New York state for three years and Philip Morris has
been fined $75,000 by the state Lobbying Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Her activities have also been referred to Albany County District
Attorney Sol Greenberg for a possible criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris officials have said they did not know or condone
Portnoy's lobbying activities in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The state Ethics Commission is also investigating whether trips
Pataki took in 1995 and 1996 to Hungary were thinly veiled gifts
from Philip Morris and other companies contributing to the
Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce that paid for the trips.
Philip Morris contributed a total of $30,000 to the group around
the time of the excursions.

<HEADLINE> Senators say 'video voyeurism' should be crime  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The secret videotaping of people's bodies
should be recognized for the crime it is, especially when those
images are distributed over the Internet, state senators say.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dean Skelos, a Nassau County Republican, said Friday state
laws currently do not appear to bar the videotaping in public
places of unsuspecting people -- typically young women -- with hidden
cameras. Specifically, these ''video voyeurs'' angle cameras in
ways that can take images up women's skirts or down their blouses,
Skelos said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the images are then collected or swapped on the Internet.
Skelos said entire sites devoted to ''upskirt'' or ''down blouse''
photographs are available, as is information on how to get the
special cameras needed for such surreptitious videotaping.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have discovered that a virtual
''subculture'' of people who get sexual gratification from seeing
such materials has begun to crop up, Skelos said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must empower our local police departments to apprehend and
convict these sexual offenders,'' the legislator said. ''It is
crucial that we stay current with the advances in modern technology
and that we protect the privacy and dignity of our wives and
daughters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate legislation would make it a Class A misdemeanor to
secretly make such videotapes and a Class E felony to transmit the
images of people taken without their consent over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Convictions of Class A misdemeanors carry fines of up to $1,000
and jail sentences of up to a year in New York. A Class E felony
carries with it a prison sentence of up to four years.
</P>
<P>
   The new provisions are being added to legislation introduced
last year by Sen. Carl Marcellino, another Long Island Republican,
prohibiting other forms of unauthorized videotaping. That bill was
drafted in response to a case where a landlord had planted several
video cameras to secretly record the activities of his tenants,
said an aide to Marcellino.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Jan. 1, California has had a law making it a
misdemeanor to secretly photograph someone under their clothing for
sexual gratification.
</P>
<P>
   The California law was prompted by the discovery of hidden
cameras at Disneyland, the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival and at
the beach in Orange County, Calif. Many of the images of young
women taken at those tourist spots were placed on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   California law enforcement officials were unable to file charges
against the photographers because there was no specific law against
the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Similar legislation is pending in Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Pepperdine 77, Indiana 57  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Pepperdine made Bob Knight's week a lot
worse.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-seeded Waves beat sixth-seeded Indiana 77-57 on Friday
night in the opening round of the NCAA East Regional, ending a week
in which the Hoosiers coach was forced to defend himself against
allegations he once choked a former player.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight NCAA tournament loss by at least 20
points for Indiana, beaten 86-61 by St. John's in the second round
last season. That was the worst tournament loss in school history.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (25-8) took control right away against the Hoosiers
(20-9), using a 12-0 run for a 24-8 lead with 10:07 left in the
first half. The Waves were relentless in their defensive intensity
and the Hoosiers missed 12 of their first 14 shots from the field.
A 9-0 run made it 39-19 with 3:35 left and the West Coast
Conference regular-season champions took a 45-27 lead into the
locker room at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves will face third-seeded Oklahoma State, which beat
14th-seeded Hofstra 86-66, on Sunday in the second round. It will
be the first time Pepperdine has played in the second round since
1982 when Jim Harrick was the coach. The Waves, who were making
their first appearance since 1994, had lost six straight NCAA
games.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended a two-year run of second-round appearances by the
Hoosiers, who were in their 15th straight NCAA tournament. Prior to
the last two years, Indiana had lost three straight first-round
games.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who has led Indiana to three of its five national
championships in his 29 seasons, was accused earlier this week by
former player Neil Reed of choking him during a practice in 1997.
Knight didn't address the matter specifically in his pre-tournament
news conference Thursday night, instead issuing a 20-minute opening
statement defending his program and saying he didn't think he had
anything to apologize for.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong had 18 of his 22 points in the first half for
the Waves, while Nick Shephard added 17.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana senior All-America A.J. Guyton had only three points --
all on free throws in the first half -- and took only two shots, one
in each half.
</P>
<P>
   It matched the lowest point total of the year for Guyton, who
had three points in an 87-63 loss to Illinois, the Hoosiers' worst
of the season. Guyton averaged 20.3 points this season and finished
as the fourth-leading scorer in school history with 2,100 points.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Hornsby had 15 points to lead Indiana, and Jeffrey Newton
added 13.
</P>
<P>
   First-year Pepperdine coach Jan van Breda Kolff was working as
hard as his players on the sideline, spending most of the game with
his hands up and dropping into a defensive stance. It was van Breda
Kolff's second NCAA tournament game; he lost in the first round
with Vanderbilt in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves shot 50 percent in the first half (17-for-34), while
Indiana was just 9-for-31 (29 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine went after every pass and rebound and seemed to
corral all the loose balls.
</P>
<P>
   The sellout crowd of 19,357 at the HSBC Arena was solidly behind
the Waves except for the solid block of Indiana fans behind the
Hoosiers bench.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana lost starting center Kirk Haston to a right knee injury
early in the first half. He was on the bench in the second half,
using crutches.

<HEADLINE> UN To distribute Condoms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a precaution against AIDS, the United
Nations has decided to distribute a condom a day to each of the
16,000 male peacekeeping troops it plans to send to Congo and
Sierre Leone this year, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to distribute condoms in high-risk countries, which
in effect acknowledges that U.N. peacekeepers visit brothels, came
after weeks of pressure by Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. ambassador
to the United Nations, the Post said in its Saturday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke told a meeting of U.N. diplomats last month that the
United States would not support any future peacekeeping operations
that failed to address the threat of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations does not keep track of HIV infections or
sexually transmitted diseases among its peacekeeping troops, the
Post said. But Holbrooke testified before Congress on March 8 that
it was a significant problem. He said he learned on a trip to Asia
several years ago that ''U.N. peacekeepers were coming to Cambodia
to bring peace to the area, but were in fact spreading AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Eckhard, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
told the Post there were no statistics to back up the contention
that U.N. peacekeepers were spreading AIDS. ''However, because U.N.
civilian and military personnel in peacekeeping or humanitarian
operations can be exposed to the dangers of contracting or
spreading AIDS, the United Nations has been stepping up
preventative measures,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Stanford 84, South Carolina St. 65  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Casey Jacobsen, Mark Madsen and Stanford
easily passed their first test.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, one of eight players who took final exams the day
before in a Birmingham hotel room, scored 18 points and Madsen had
14 points and 13 rebounds as the Cardinal routed South Carolina
State 84-65 on Friday night in the first round of the South
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has a No. 16 seed won, and top-seeded Stanford made
sure it did not happen this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (27-3) won its opening-round game for the sixth
straight year. Next up is eighth-seeded North Carolina, an 84-70
winner over Missouri, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford held a size advantage in every matchup, and even its
tree mascot pushed South Carolina State's big-headed Bulldog to the
floor at halftime. For good measure, the Cardinal hit 13 3-pointers
-- a school record in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wiatre scored 17 points for South Carolina State (20-14).
The Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference champions fell to 0-4 overall
in NCAA tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   A transfer from the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York,
the 6-foot Wiatre was the only Bulldogs player to score for the
first 10 minutes. By then, his teammates were an unstylish 0-for-12
and trailed by 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, leading Stanford with a 15-point average, scored the
first basket of the game and it was 7-0 after two minutes. He later
hit a long 3-pointer and soon it was 26-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific-10 team, ranked No. 1 in the nation for part of the
season, started the night pounding the ball inside.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford wound up making 17-of-30 free throws as the Bulldogs
ran into foul trouble trying to stop their oversized opponents.
South Carolina State tried to pack the inside and often left the
Cardinal open from the outside -- Stanford shot 13-for-23 on
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   David Moseley had 13 points and Jarron Collins and Ryan Mendez
each had 10 for Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatre had half of South Carolina State's points at halftime,
which ended with Stanford ahead 47-26. The Cardinal led the country
with a 20.2-point margin of victory, and cruised through the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs made their third NCAA appearance in five years.
They have typically faced formidable opposition, previously playing
Duke, Kentucky and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina State's season ended much like it started. In its
opener, it fell behind 20-0 in a lopsided loss to Oregon State.

<HEADLINE> North Carolina 84, Missouri 70  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- North Carolina saved its talk for the
basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels refused to be goaded into a war of words with
Missouri, instead letting Brendan Haywood and Ed Cota lead them to
an 84-70 victory over the Tigers on Friday night in the first round
of the NCAA South Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Haywood had a career-high 28 points and 15 rebounds, and Cota
had 10 assists to become only the third player in NCAA history to
reach 1,000 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Tar Heels (19-13) declined to comment a day
earlier when told Missouri guard Clarence Gilbert said none of the
current Carolina players were any good and all were too slow to
guard him.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as talking goes, we didn't put anything in the paper
because we knew we could play like this,'' Haywood said. ''Anyone
can talk, but it takes heart to play.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, it looked like Gilbert might be right. He opened the
game with consecutive 3-pointers, then mugged to the Missouri crowd
for support.
</P>
<P>
   But North Carolina quickly found an answer, taking advantage of
its sizable height advantage -- seven Tar Heels are 6-feet-8 or
taller compared to just two for Missouri -- by pounding the ball
inside to the 7-foot Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to use our strength, so I was just trying to get the
ball inside,'' Cota said. ''I guess that worked.''
</P>
<P>
   But Carolina coach Bill Guthridge had initially worried it
wouldn't because first-year Missouri coach Quin Snyder -- a former
Duke player and assistant coach -- was too familiar with it. It
ultimately didn't matter because nothing could stop Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to say it was getting easier and easier, but I
was using my will on them and I could definitely see them getting
tired,'' said Haywood, who was 11-of-15 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina, which needs one more win to continue its streak
of 28 straight 20-win seasons, will play top-seeded Stanford in the
second round Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert led Missouri with 16 points -- but was just 4-for-15 from
3-point range -- and Keyon Dooling had 13. Dooling was 1-for-7 from
behind the arc.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some nights we can't miss and some nights we can't throw it in
the ocean,'' Dooling said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert was still talking after the loss. Although he
acknowledged Haywood was the difference against the Tigers, he said
he wouldn't be enough to carry the Tar Heels through the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Haywood was the question and we didn't have the answer,''
Gilbert said. ''But he won't be able to get them past Stanford.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels, who lost 76-74 to Weber State in the first round
of last year's tournament, led 41-31 with 1:19 to play in the first
half. But ninth-seeded Missouri (18-13) finished the half with 10
straight points to close within three at 44-41.
</P>
<P>
   But Haywood took early control of the second half, grabbing the
rebound of Jason Capel's missed free throw and dunking, then
scoring on a turnaround jumper 32 seconds later to give Carolina a
48-41 lead.
</P>
<P>
   He and Cota then hooked up for Cota's milestone assist. With
12:11 to play, Cota whipped a line drive under the basket to
Haywood, who dunked for a 59-49 North Carolina lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it was our best game of the year,'' Guthridge said.
''Of course, Cota and Haywood had unbelievable games.''
</P>
<P>
   Capel added 14 points and 11 rebounds for Carolina, Joseph Forte
scored 13 and Kris Lang added 11.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri found itself in trouble less then two minutes into the
game when senior guard Jeff Hafer picked up two fouls in about two
seconds. He was whistled for his first foul with 18:57 to play,
then hit again at the 18:55 mark when he reached in on the inbound
pass. Hafer played just 2:16 of the first half and failed to score
or take a shot.

<HEADLINE> Md. Police Surround Accused Killer  </HEADLINE>
By MARTY NILAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A man accused of killing four people last
week was holding up to three people hostage in a house Friday
night, police said. Authorities surrounded the house and were
negotiating for the hostages' release.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Palczynski had at least three firearms and was holding at
least three hostages, said Baltimore County police Cpl. Vickie
Warehime. Police said the home belongs to a relative of Tracy
Whitehead, Palczynski's former girlfriend, whom he is accused of
kidnapping last week. She escaped a day later.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Collins, a cousin of Whitehead, said he believed her
mother, her stepfather and her 12-year-old brother were in the
home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was coming home from the grocery store and I heard a lot of
gunshots,'' said Collins, who lives in the neighborhood. ''The
police tell me he was trying to shoot his way into the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Police converged on the home just east of Baltimore around 9:30
p.m. Friday, and were negotiating with Palczynski by telephone.
Police blocked off the area and evacuated residents from the block.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski, 31, had broken into another home earlier and stolen
weapons before breaking into the home where the hostages were being
held. Warehime said.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff came at the end of the tenth day in which police
searched for Palczynski. Police posted a $10,000 reward for his
capture on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The killings began March 7. Whitehead said Palczynski beat her
four days earlier when she moved out of their apartment and moved
in with a co-worker, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Palczynski abducted Whitehead at gunpoint after
fatally shooting George and Gloria Shenk, the couple who had
sheltered her. Outside the Shenk home, he allegedly shot and killed
David Meyers, 42, a neighbor who tried to help Whitehead during the
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead escaped the next day by running to a police officer
who happened to be at a motel where Palczynski took her.
</P>
<P>
   Also that day, police said, Jennifer McDonel was fatally shot
and a 2-year-old boy was wounded when they drove by as Palczynski
fired shots during an attempted carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, eastern Baltimore County residents have nervously
awaited word of Palczynski's capture, keeping their children
indoors and closing stores at dusk.
</P>
<P>
   Police, meanwhile, have responded to more than 1,000 calls from
residents reporting everything from open shed doors to suspected
sightings.

<HEADLINE> Kansas 81, DePaul 77, OT  </HEADLINE>
By JOE MACENKA, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- The scoop all season on the Kansas
Jayhawks has been that their tenacity left something to be desired.
That talk stopped Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Making key defensive plays and closing the game with a 10-0 run
in the final 1:57 of overtime, Kansas spoiled DePaul's return to
the NCAA tournament with an 81-77 victory in the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people questioned our toughness all year long,
including ourselves,'' said coach Roy Williams, whose Jayhawks have
been inconsistent all season and were eliminated in the second
round of the Big 12 tournament. ''I liked our toughness tonight,
especially through the overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks failed to score on their first four possessions of
the extra period, clearing the way for the Blue Demons to build a
77-71 lead on Paul McPherson's free throw with 2:23 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas rallied, then sealed it with a key block from Nick
Bradford in the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''These kids didn't necessarily have the smoothest ride,''
Williams said, ''but they did come up big down the stretch on the
defensive end.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Gregory evened it at 77 when he stole an errant pass and
went the length of the court for a dunk. Gregory was fouled on the
play. He missed the free throw, but Kansas got the rebound, leading
to a driving layup by Bradford that put the Jayhawks ahead to stay
at 79-77 with 48 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was in doubt until Bradford blocked a 3-point shot
by Quentin Richardson with three seconds left and Kansas up by
three. The Jayhawks' Lester Earl grabbed the loose ball, was fouled
and made one free throw to account for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory made 11-of-12 field-goal attempts and matched his
season-high with 22 points to help the eighth-seeded Jayhawks
(24-9) win their first-round game for the 17th consecutive time.
Kansas will play Duke on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford finished with 14 points and two blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a great win for us as far as stepping up to the
plate when we were in a deficit,'' Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   DePaul (21-12) was making its first appearance in the tournament
since 1992. McPherson and Richardson had 21 points apiece, but it
wasn't enough to give the Blue Demons their first victory in the
event since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just have a tendency to get relaxed at the end of games and
lose focus and lose concentration,'' McPherson said. ''Maybe we can
turn that into a positive and use that for a great starting block
for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a contest pitting teams seeded eighth and ninth, there
were 17 ties, 11 lead changes and no lead of more than six points.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas shot 57 percent but hurt itself with 19 turnovers that
the Blue Demons converted into 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really put ourselves in very good position,'' coach Pat
Kennedy said. ''We just couldn't close it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson hit his first three field-goal attempts and had eight
points in the opening three-plus minutes before twisting his left
ankle. Richardson was sidelined briefly, but when he returned, he
spent the rest of the game limping up and down the floor, wincing
and adjusting the tension in the laces on his left shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rolled it real bad,'' he said. ''I really couldn't get real
explosive after that. If I tried to push off on my foot, it was
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory hit his first seven shots before a 14-foot jumper from
the left wing banged over the rim with 10:32 left. He didn't miss
again, and his block of a short baseline jumper by Richardson with
46 seconds left kept the score tied it 70 and helped force
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson had a chance to prevent the extra period, but his
12-foot jumper bounced long, and McPherson missed the tip.

<HEADLINE> Duke 82, Lamar 55  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DROSCHAK, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke needed just a half to make Lamar
look like a team with the worst record in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 Blue Devils started sluggish against the 16th-seeded
Cardinals on Friday night, but picked it up over the final 20
minutes for an 82-55 victory in the first round of the East
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams led the way with 18 points and seven assists,
while Carlos Boozer added 16 points. The 6-foot-9 Boozer made five
straight baskets in the second half as he had his way inside and
Duke pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   Top-seeded Duke (28-4), last year's NCAA runner-up, will now
play No. 8 seed Kansas, an 81-77 overtime winner over DePaul, on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lamar (15-16) was making its first NCAA trip in 17 years, but
the 32-point underdog refused to back down from the high-powered
Blue Devils, whose 66 NCAA tourney wins rank fourth all-time.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals pulled within two points 14 minutes into the game
as Kenyon Spears had 14 of his 19 on four 3-pointers as the Duke
fans, who had to drive only about an hour from the Durham campus,
grew restless.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear this wasn't going to be as easy at Duke's two
previous first-round games -- a 41-point victory over Florida A&AMP;M
last year and a 36-point win over Radford in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Duke was greeted with the chant of ''over-rated'' from the Lamar
fans as it entered the court for second-half warmups.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams sank a 3-pointer, made a driving layup and sank a
shot in the lane as Duke opened its 11-point halftime lead to 65-45
midway into the second period. At one point, the Blue Devils scored
eight straight baskets in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who had lost eight of 10 prior to winning the
Southland Conference tourney by a combined 14 points, survived a
six-minute scoreless drought in the opening half to hang close.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Deane called three timeouts early to break up any
momentum the Blue Devils could muster.
</P>
<P>
   Duke led 34-31 with four minutes left before the break, closing
the half with a 10-2 run as Nate James made a pair of 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Krzyzewski's rotation was cut short with the absence
of reserve big man Matt Christensen, who sustained a head injury in
practice earlier in the week and wasn't even on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved Krzyzewski within three of his 500th at Duke.

<HEADLINE> La. Tech Coach Barmore To Quit  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUSTON, La. (AP) -- Leon Barmore of Louisiana Tech, one of the
most prominent coaches in women's basketball, will resign after his
team finishes play in the NCAA women's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore is completing his 18th season at the school. He has the
best winning percentage (.872) in Division I basketball -- men or
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave all I have,'' he said Friday. ''I have one more run at
the national championship and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Barmore, 55, made the tearful announcement at the end of a news
conference leading to the NCAA Midwest Regional. Louisiana Tech
(28-2) opens play Saturday at home against Alcorn State.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana Tech and Tennessee are the only women's teams to play
in all 19 NCAA women's tournaments. Under Barmore, the Techsters
reached the Final Four nine times and won the championship in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things I'm most proud of is that every girl that's
played here for the full four years has gone to a Final Four,''
Barmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore said he timed the announcement so Louisiana Tech would
have enough time to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to answer questions and said he would fully discuss
his resignation once the Lady Techsters have won, or been
eliminated from, the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love this school,'' Barmore said. ''I don't want this story
to be about me. But I didn't think it would be fair to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Jim Oakes tried to get Barmore to change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say that for women's basketball, this is akin to what
the day John Wooden announced his retirement was for men's
basketball,'' Oakes said. ''Leon is a pioneer and a giant in the
women's game.''
</P>
<P>
   His record is 517-76, he reached 500 wins faster than any other
active coach, and he was Sun Belt Conference coach of the year five
times.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore told his players just before the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were stunned,'' Betty Lennox said. ''I feel bad for the
freshmen. I can't imagine this program without him.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakes said assistant coach Kim Mulkey-Robertson is a strong
candidate to replace Barmore. A Tech player from 1980-84,
Mulkey-Robertson has been on the Louisiana Tech staff for 15 years,
the associate head coach the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Barmore began as an assistant in 1977-78 under Sonja Hogg, who
made the team a national power as interest in women's college
basketball grew. He was hired as associate head coach for the
1980-81 season, and was made co-head coach the next season. He
became the lone head coach when Hogg left in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Before other schools were selling out gyms for women's games or
dominating play, the Techsters were well established. In a school
with less than 10,000 students, in a town of about 20,000, the Lady
Techsters regularly draw better than 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tech guard Tamicha Jackson said Barmore's resignation is certain
to provide additional motivation for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not that we needed one,'' she said. ''But we certainly want to
go out with a bang now.''

   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Boyd Devereaux scored three goals for
the first time in his career Friday night to lead the Edmonton
Oilers to a 4-2 win over the Ottawa Senators.
</P>
<P>
   Devereaux broke a 2-2 tie 2:04 into the third, tapping a Georges

   VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Cliff Robinson scored 27
points and Rodney Rogers added 26 off the bench as the Phoenix Suns
beat Vancouver 101-86 Friday night to send the Grizzlies to their
11th straight loss, matching their longest slump of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns won for the 17th time in their last 22 outings and
extended their winning streak over the Grizzlies to 10 straight.
</P>
<P>
   Shareef Abdur-Rahim and Michael Dickerson had 14 each for the
lifeless Grizzlies, who committed a season-high 28 turnovers. It
was the fifth time in seven games that the Grizzlies had 20 or more
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd was two rebounds shy of another triple-double,
picking up 15 points and 12 assists for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Despite shooting 39 percent and committing 15 turnovers in the
opening 24 minutes, the Grizzlies were still in the contest at
halftime, trailing 42-36 as Phoenix also had 15 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   With Vancouver point guard Mike Bibby picking up three fouls in
the first half, the Grizzlies were forced into a variety of
defensive schemes in an effort to slow down Kidd. Bibby was
frustrated throughout the game by Kidd, finishing with seven points
in 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies went to a four-guard offense through a large
portion of the second half, but the move did little to get
Vancouver back into the contest.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Suns forward Tom Gugliotta had successful knee surgery
Friday in Phoenix. He will be out for one year. .. The Grizzlies
began play Friday having allowed their last four opponents to shoot
50 percent or better from the field. ... The game marked the start
of a nine-game homestand for Vancouver.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A Trinity College student died Friday,
and three of his roommates were hospitalized after taking an
unidentified narcotic, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Josh Doroff, a 21-year-old senior from Harrison, N.Y., was
unconscious when friends brought him to Hartford Hospital's
emergency room shortly after noon Friday. He was pronounced dead at
12:27 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old roommate, whose name was not released, was
admitted to the hospital in critical condition. Two other students
were admitted for observation and later charged with possession of
narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Bachman, 21, of South Natick, Mass., and Joshua B.
Eaves, 22, of Dowington, Pa., were scheduled to be arraigned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they believe the men all took the same drug. They
are awaiting toxicology reports on the victim and drug residue
found in the dorm room to determine exactly what that was, said
Sgt. Norberto Huertas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information we have is leading us to believe that it could
be possibly opiates or heroin,'' Huertas said.
</P>
<P>
   Huertas said the four may have been partying to celebrate the
end of mid-term exams.
</P>
<P>
   ''Spring break officially started today,'' he said. ''Certainly
we are going to investigate that possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity officials released a brief statement expressing their
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our principal concern at the moment is with the individuals
and family members most directly affected and with all members of
the Trinity community for whom the death of a student represents a
great loss,'' said Linda Campanella, the college's senior vice
president of operations and planning.

<HEADLINE> Suspects Surrounded in Death Valley  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Three suspects were
surrounded by authorities in Death Valley late Friday after a
100-mph car chase that included gunfire and shots that forced down
a Highway Patrol helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter crew was unharmed and no other officers were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The two men and a woman were surrounded by 80 officers in the
Furnace Creek area Friday night, authorities said. They planned to
wait until daylight before moving in on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are prepared to wait it out, nighttime favors no one,''
said Inyo County sheriff's Cpl. Scott Stell. ''We are confident in
our containment boundaries, where we'll remain until daylight. We
have water, they don't.''
</P>
<P>
   There was gunfire Friday night whenever an aircraft hovered over
the area where the three were holed up.
</P>
<P>
   The trio's car contained a cache of high-powered rifles and
bullets, Stell said. Warrant checks on the car showed it had not
been stolen, and investigators did not immediately have a motive
for the chase and shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began after Nevada Highway Patrol officers
attempted to pull over the car when they spotted it speeding on
U.S. 95 near Lathrope Wells, Nev., about 60 miles north of Las
Vegas. The chase began shortly after 5 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A chase ensued, with the suspects shooting at authorities, who
did not return fire, Stell said. The car left the highway on a side
road near Furnace Creek, then broke down on a dry lake bed.
</P>
<P>
   As the suspects fled on foot, they allegedly fired at a CHP
helicopter carrying three people, damaging the craft badly enough
that it had to land.

<HEADLINE> 'The Exorcist' Revived After 25 Yrs  </HEADLINE>
By PATRICIA M. LaHAY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- The spinning head. The scary voice. The
projectile vomiting. ''The Exorcist'' is back.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 years after the horror movie won Academy and Golden
Globe awards, a new version of the film was released Friday in
three college towns as a preview to its national release later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Exorcist -- The Version You've Never Seen'' was released
here, in Austin, Texas, and in Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the best-selling novel by William Peter Blatty, the
film graphically depicts the demonic possession of a 12-year-old
girl (Linda Blair) and the efforts by a priest (Max von Sydow) to
exorcise her demons. In the new film, a full reel of material was
restored to director William Friedkin's 1973 version.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new scenes is an eerie depiction of the girl, Regan,
''spider walking'' down a flight of stairs upside down and chasing
two other characters. It was one of the few scenes that drew gasps
from the audience Friday at the Beechwood Stadium 11 theater.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most famous scene, showing Regan's head spinning 180
degrees and projectile vomiting, drew laughs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't as scared as I thought I would be,'' said Amanda
Janilus, 27, who attended Friday's screening but had not seen the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Blatty said that scaring movie-goers was not his original
intention.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I wrote the novel and also when I wrote the screenplay,
frightening people was not my primary intention. It was the
furthest thing from my mind,'' he told Atlanta radio station WSTR.
''I meant it as a supernatural detective story and a psychological
thriller.''
</P>
<P>
   The original film was a critical and a commercial success,
winning awards on at least two continents and becoming the second
biggest money-maker in American cinematic history, after the 1972
classic ''The Godfather.''
</P>
<P>
   Blatty won an Oscar for the screenplay and the film was awarded
a Golden Globe for best picture in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Eight months ago, after watching some of the outtakes, Friedken
finally admitted the lost scenes improved the movie. He said the
film was more suspenseful and spiritually deeper.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we left the building, on the Burbank lot, he laughed and
said 'Bill, after 26 years I am finally understanding what you were
trying to do with this movie,''' Blatty said.
</P>
<P>
   Blatty said he first saw the unedited version of the movie with
many of the scenes restored in this new release.
</P>
<P>
   ''It took my breath away,'' he said. ''I thought it was just
incredible.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Commission Orders Cooperation  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Civilian overseers have ordered the Police
Department to cooperate with the district attorney in hopes of
ending a bitter turf war in the unfolding police corruption
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   By unanimous vote on Friday, the five-member Los Angeles Police
Commission ordered Chief Bernard Parks to tell his command staff
and everyone involved in the probe to fully cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   The vote followed weeks of public sniping between Parks and Los
Angeles County District Attorney Gil Garcetti.
</P>
<P>
   At least 29 officers have been relieved of duty, and dozens of
convictions have been overturned amid allegations that anti-gang
officers at the Rampart station shot, beat and framed innocent
people.
</P>
<P>
   Parks has criticized Garcetti for not bringing criminal charges
against any of the officers the LAPD has investigated. Garcetti has
said he doesn't want to jeopardize any cases by rushing the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti said Wednesday that Parks was impeding his
investigation. Police, he said, had quit cooperating with his
department in favor of the U.S attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have never withheld information from the DA,'' Parks told
reporters after the commission meeting. He released a letter he
sent Thursday to Garcetti that said he intended to cooperate and
described Garcetti's view as a ''misunderstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti praised the commission's decision and stuck by his
allegations that police had refused to cooperate with his office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very hopeful now that the Police Commission has acted,
that we will in fact have the complete cooperation of LAPD,''
Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   The five-member civilian panel said it would investigate whether
the LAPD cooperated.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a system of providing investigative materials to
prosecutors after they have been ''cleaned'' of statements that
officers are compelled to make to Internal Affairs. Conceivably,
such coerced statements might violate the officers' Fifth Amendment
rights against self-incrimination at a criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Parks said the LAPD will turn over documents to both federal and
county prosecutors at the same time under new protocols.

<HEADLINE> Indian Casino Plan Stirs Opposition  </HEADLINE>
By DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- Nearly two-thirds of California voters
backed Indian gambling last week, with some seeing it as a way to
help tribes help themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in Placer County, a fast-growing area northeast of
Sacramento where the United Auburn Indian Community plans a $100
million casino. There, 56 percent of voters opposed Proposition 1A
and so did 51 percent of those in neighboring El Dorado County.
</P>
<P>
   ''People here are a bit more educated about what tribal gaming
can be. It can expand and it can come close to your community,''
said Brian Swearingen, chairman of the Placer County opposition
group Citizens for Safer Communities. ''This thing is going to come
within four miles of my house.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to Indian gambling has been sporadic across
California. There is concern in Palm Springs that tribes will make
it a casino center, but last week's ballot measure allowing
Nevada-style games on tribal land was supported by 65 percent of
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal and Placer County officials want to put a
200,000-square-foot casino in an industrial park, where its nearest
neighbors are a county landfill, several factories, a towing yard,
sludge treatment plant and recycling center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the same fears and hopes as everyone else,'' said
Jessica Tavares, chairwoman of the tribe. ''I wouldn't want to have
my house back up to a casino. Here we're talking a place where
there aren't any homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But that won't last long. Already, subdivisions are popping up
near the site, a grassy field where cattle now graze.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe already has a signed compact with the state, but
opponents still hope to block the casino as the tribe applies to
the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and Department of Interior,
then through local zoning decisions and ultimately in the courts if
other avenues fail.
</P>
<P>
   That could push back the casino's opening, slated as early as
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''It brings an element to the community that we don't want,''
Roseville Mayor Harry Crabb said. ''We want to place a lot of
emphasis on the families, and certainly gambling is not a family
activity. No one is saying there is no compassion for the Indians.
There is. But we can only go so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino would draw a projected 8,000 gamblers each day,
around the clock. Tribal spokesman Douglas Elmets pointed to the
1,100 new jobs and $80 million a year in expected revenue. Gamblers
from as far as San Francisco may stop there instead of continuing
along the main route over the Sierra to casinos in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But critics and supporters alike say the casino would likely
draw many of its customers from the surrounding area, including two
nearby retirement communities.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not the type of thing people think about when they
moved here,'' said Yvonne Maxfield, who relocated to Rocklin in
July. ''It doesn't matter who's running it -- it's just the wrong
place for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Schmit opposed the casino, but credits tribal officials
with going beyond federal law to work with the community. That
effort came as the tribe tried to rebuild relations after its
unsuccessful attempt four years ago to put the casino near Schmit's
home, close to two day-care centers and a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the tribe agreed to make up for lost local property
taxes, pay $900,000 a year to compensate for increased police, fire
and emergency services and contribute $50,000 annually to fight
compulsive gambling in the county.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly to Schmit, the tribe agreed to create an
advisory committee that will hear community grievances and submit
to arbitration despite the tribe's immunity from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Tavares and tribal vice-chair David Keyser say they have sensed
resentment since the Indian community was recreated by an act of
Congress in 1994, 27 years after it officially ceased to exist. The
ill will was particularly noticeable after the tribe began pushing
for a casino, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really resent the Indian privilege that goes along with all
this,'' said Steve Hare, who lives near the tribe's reservation in
Newcastle. ''Number two, they're trashy, the Indian casinos I've
seen. They're more like arcades.''
</P>
<P>
   Tavares acknowledged the reservation, called the Auburn
Rancheria, isn't pretty, with dozens of junk cars and deteriorating
house trailers scattered among the small homes.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe hopes to use money from the casino to buy 1,100 acres
near Sheridan, to be divided among as many of the approximately 220
tribal members as wish to relocate.
</P>
<P>
   A school and medical facility would be built there, in
accordance with federal requirements for the money, and individual
tribal members would get some share of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Tavares and Keyser hope that will help compensate for the
childhoods they spent in unheated trailers and hand-me-down
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Money is at the base of all things. I'm not saying it can buy
happiness, but it ought to buy a little bit of something,'' Keyser
said. ''It's not like we're going to all be rich -- but not poor, I
guess.''

<HEADLINE> Christians in Gaza Await Pope  </HEADLINE>
By DANA BUDEIRI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- It took a papal visit to win Saleh
Sahlieh permission to get out of the crowded, fenced-in Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old retired driver, one of only about 2,000
Christians among Gaza's 1 million Muslims, has for years been
unable to leave the 147-square-mile strip and visit Israel both
because of Israeli travel restrictions and political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sahlieh, along with other Gaza Christians, is registered to
travel to the Mount of the Beatitudes in northern Israel, where
Pope John Paul II will celebrate an outdoor Mass on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The pope is skipping Gaza during his six-day visit to the Holy
Land, but the tiny Christian flock still hopes his presence will
ease their sense of being cut off from the Christian world.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is like being in a big prison,'' Sahlieh, a Roman Catholic,
said of Gaza, speaking in his whitewashed living room decorated
with a picture of the Last Supper.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that his two daughters, Therese, 31, and Samia, 32,
have not married because the number of potential Christian suitors
in Gaza is so small.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gaza's rich Christian history -- the Mediterranean strip
was one of the first places missionized by Constantine the Great in
the 4th century -- only 20 percent of its Christians have deep roots
here. The others are refugees who fled or were expelled in the 1948
Mideast war from homes in what is now Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees settled in the ''Christian camp,'' a
neighborhood on the outskirts of the Shati refugee camp north of
Gaza City.
</P>
<P>
   Once bustling with more than 1,000 residents, the neighborhood
now has just a few dozen Christian families. Most are Greek
Orthodox. Out of 15 Roman Catholic families, only four have
remained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maria and her daughter are dead, the Qubursi family has left
... nobody is left,'' Sahlieh said, folding the fingers of his hand
as he counted. He said he would have accepted a job in the Persian
Gulf long ago, but had to stay to take care of his parents.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians in Gaza -- like their brothers in the West Bank --
have emigrated over the years, lured by economic prospects in the
Americas, Europe and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Those who remained have two houses of worship, the Greek
Orthodox St. Porphyrius church dating back to the 5th century, and
a Roman Catholic church. A 19th century Protestant church was
turned into a hospital long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wadi Abunassar, a spokesman for Latin Patriarch Michel Sabbah in
Jerusalem, the top Roman Catholic clergyman in the Holy Land, said
the church is encouraging West Bank Christians to visit Gaza to
maintain ties.
</P>
<P>
   Even though most Christians have left the ''Christian camp,'' it
still stands out from its surroundings. The homes are generally
large and the streets paved and quiet, in contrast with Shati's
small shacks and sandy alleys crowded with young, barefoot
children.
</P>
<P>
   Daoud Nakhleh, 37, a Roman Catholic, moved from the Christian
Camp to Gaza City 14 years ago. His two brothers have settled in
Romania and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Leaning against his car during a recent visit, Nakhleh said the
pope's visit was of special spiritual importance. ''Any devout
Christian waits for the day when he will be blessed by the pope,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Catholic church is arranging buses to take Gaza
Christians hoping to greet the pope to the Mount of the Beatitudes.
</P>
<P>
   For many, it is the first trip out of Gaza in years. Sahlieh
hopes to visit Jaffa, the town of his boyhood, which he last saw in
the 1970s. Others expect to pray at Christian shrines in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the best of times, Palestinian access to Israel is
restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 100,000 of more than 2.5 million Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip have permission to enter Israel regularly.
Others get day permits for special trips. Sahlieh said he submitted
several applications to visit Israel, but was only permitted to
travel to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes the pope's visit will help lead the Gaza
Christians out of their isolation -- and perhaps even bring better
marriage prospects for his daughters. ''God willing,'' Sahlieh
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hope is the greatest virtue of all,'' said Father Manuel, the
local Roman Catholic priest. ''Without hope, how can one survive
Gaza?''

<HEADLINE> China's Corruption Problem Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Over and over, Lu Jingyi tried to warn the
authorities that the Communist Party boss of his city was crooked.
The party leader retaliated by having Lu thrown in jail and, when
that didn't silence him, allegedly hired hitmen who killed Lu's
wife.
</P>
<P>
   A series of recently publicized cases like Lu's have shed light
on how graft works in China and how corrupt officials cover their
tracks. They also show how far Chinese leaders have to go in their
renewed war against rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply stunning that so many public servants are bad,''
the official China Daily lamented recently. ''How many corrupt
officials are still out there lurking in muddy waters? Who are
they?''
</P>
<P>
   By keeping a tight grip on power while liberalizing China's
economy, the Communist Party has opened up a myriad of ways for
party officials and state workers to cash in on their power and
influence.
</P>
<P>
   Many Chinese say corruption is worse now than under the
notorious Nationalist government, which was ousted by the
communists in 1949. Party leader and President Jiang Zemin has
warned that the communists could themselves be toppled if the
problem is not curbed.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption ranging from petty bribery to massive scandals
affects the highest party ranks. Sometimes the law can't touch
corrupt officials because, in their localities, they are the law.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of this month's annual meeting in Beijing of the national
legislature, where corruption was a focus of debate, police
descended on street peddlers of illegally pirated films and music
CDs. To recover their confiscated stock, peddlers say they bribed
police with $24 and a carton of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In China's largest corruption case, hundreds of officials have
been questioned and dozens reportedly arrested for their
involvement in smuggling $9.5 billion of oil and other goods
through the southeastern port city of Xiamen. The wife of Jia
Qinglin, a member of the party's elite 21-member Politburo and an
ally of President Jiang, is among those said to be implicated.
</P>
<P>
   Although smaller, the case Lu was caught up in illustrates the
risks faced by those who denounce dishonest officials. Lu's reports
ended up in the hands of the very official he was trying to unmask:
Li Changhe, the former party leader of Wugang city in central Henan
province, whose trial opened Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The party boss put Lu's reports through a shredding machine.
Then, he used his influence to have Lu imprisoned for a year, the
official Legal Daily said.
</P>
<P>
   Lu continued filing complaints after his release. Li, who had
since been promoted, teamed up with a local businessman to hire a
team of thugs who attacked Lu at home, severely injuring him and
killing his wife, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   The former party boss was charged with hiring the killers and
taking $19,800 worth of bribes. Wang Hong, a spokesman for the
Intermediate People's Court in Henan's Anyang city, said a verdict
was expected in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   State media reports suggest intimidation of whistle-blower is
not uncommon. Chen Miaozhen, a lawmaker, told the Xinhua News
Agency that officials put a coffin outside her house after she
exposed them for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have tackled increasingly prominent officials in
their drive to discourage officials from becoming corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Hu Changqing, a vice governor of Jiangxi province, was executed
March 8 for taking $658,000 in bribes. He was the highest ranked
official to be put to death for corruption in 50 years of communist
rule.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Orders Rail Merger Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are flagging the rapidly
consolidating railroad industry to a halt, ordering a moratorium
all new mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We recognize that our action is unprecedented. But these are
not ordinary circumstances,'' the federal Surface Transportation
Board, or STB, said Friday in announcing its action.
</P>
<P>
   The board acted following a hearing into the future of the
railroad industry. That session was called after a series of
mergers in the 1990s led to service disruptions in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is good news for shippers and good news for the American
public,'' Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, D-N.D., said of the moratorium.
</P>
<P>
   But the Canadian National Railway promptly threatened legal
action over the blocking of its planned $6 billion merger with
Burlington Northern Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   The STB, part of the Transportation Department, ordered
railroads to suspend any merger activity while it develops new
rules for mergers, a process expected to take about 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the financial and service instability that exists in the
rail sector as a result of the most recent round of major railroad
consolidations, I cannot in good conscience allow further actions
to occur,'' board chairwoman Linda Morgan said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The decision upset two railroad companies that had planned to
merge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will immediately initiate an appeal of the STB's decision
and vigorously pursue all avenues that are open to us under
applicable law,'' said Canadian National Chairman Paul M. Tellier.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are extremely disappointed with the STB decision,''
Burlington Northern Chairman Robert D. Krebs said. ''While
Chairwoman Linda Morgan's action may be well-intentioned, as it
stands it has the effect of denying our proposed combination with
Canadian National Railway Company before receiving our application
and giving it a proper review.''
</P>
<P>
   Shippers who use trains to move products have experienced
service problems in recent mergers that have consolidated the
railroad industry. Still, the National Industrial Transportation
League, which represents shippers who use all modes of
transportation, found the merger moratorium disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a bit puzzled,'' league spokeswoman Kathy Luhn said.
''Whose interest is really being served here? What's the effect on
shippers? It's going to be another 15 months before we get anybody
to look at problems in the industry. This keeps the status quo for
another year and a half -- poor service and, at the same time,
rising rates.''
</P>
<P>
   Diane Duff, who directs the Alliance for Rail Competition, a
coalition of rail customers pushing for laws and regulations that
promote more competition, said she was encouraged by the board's
decision to call for revisiting some issues. But she also said the
moratorium's 15-month length ''seems like kind of a long time,
particularly given how much information has been out there for some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rail competitors who have completed their own mergers welcomed
the decision.
</P>
<P>
   CSX Chairman John Snow said the ruling recognizes that more rail
mergers now are not in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although a longer pause would have been preferable,'' Snow
said, ''the board's action clearly reflects the unstable nature of
the industry and the overwhelming concern expressed by rail
customers, railroad employees, the financial community and the
public -- all of which are so dependent upon a financially strong
and stable freight rail system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Union Pacific Railroad said the move takes a big step toward
stabilizing the rail industry. The major recent mergers included
the combination of the Union Pacific and Southern Pacific and CSX
and Norfolk Southern's takeover of Conrail.
</P>
<P>
   ''The railroad industry and the shipping public have not yet
fully recovered from the service disruptions associated with the
previous round of mergers,'' the transportation board said in its
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern and Canadian National had asked the board to
let their merger move forward while the government developed new
rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the board rejected that plea, contending it did not want to
be creating new merger regulations in the middle of what might turn
out to be the final round of railroad combinations.
</P>
<P>
   If that happened, it said, the companies would not know what
evidence to present and might be forced to repeat the entire
approval process once the new standards were in place.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Tournament Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Bob Knight went quietly.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Indiana coach, engulfed in controversy over allegations that
he once choked a player, could do little as 11th-seeded Pepperdine
routed his Hoosiers 77-57 Friday night in the first round of the
East Regional in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just got pounded,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, who has led Indiana to three national championships, was
accused earlier this week by former player Neil Reed of choking him
during a practice in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (25-8) took control right away against the Hoosiers
(20-9), using a 12-0 run to take a 24-8 lead. Indiana missed 12 of
its first 14 shots from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Armstrong scored 18 of his 22 points in the first half
for the Waves, and Nick Shephard added 17.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana senior All-America A.J. Guyton had only three points --
all on free throws in the first half -- and took only two shots.
Guyton averaged 20.3 points this season.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Hornsby led Indiana with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine will play Oklahoma State on Sunday. The Cowboys
routed Hofstra 86-66.
</P>
<P>
   While the Waves breezed into the second round, Connecticut's
Khalid El-Amin limped off as the defending NCAA champion advanced,
while Kansas, Seton Hall and Florida survived overtime games.
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin sprained his right ankle late in Connecticut's 75-67
victory over Utah State in the South Regional in Birmingham, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays were negative, and the star point guard most likely will
not practice Saturday. The Huskies play Tennessee on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts right now, but hopefully I can be ready,'' El-Amin
said. ''I did not get hit. I turned to pivot and drive, but I heard
something pop.''
</P>
<P>
   El-Amin and Mouring each had 14 points for the fifth-seeded
Huskies (25-9). Troy Rolle had 18 points for Utah State (28-6).
</P>
<P>
   In the East Regional in Winston Salem, N.C., eighth-seeded
Kansas outscored DePaul 10-0 in the final 1:57 of OT to advance to
the second round for the 17th consecutive year. The Jayhawks (24-9)
face top-seeded Duke, an 82-55 winner over Lamar.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Gregory matched his season-high with 22 points, shooting
11-for-12 from the field, and Nick Bradford added 14 points and had
a key block in the final seconds. Paul McPherson and Quentin
Richardson each had 21 points for DePaul (21-12).
</P>
<P>
   In the opening game in Buffalo, Seton Hall beat Oregon 72-71 on
Shaheen Holloway's full-court dash in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Executing a play called ''Quick'' to perfection, Holloway banked
in a shot with 1.9 seconds left. The last of Holloway's 27 points
sent 10th-seeded Seton Hall (21-9) into the second round against
second-seeded Temple, a 73-47 winner over Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   ''Growing up as a little kid, you watch the NCAA tournament and
you see people doing stuff like this and you say to yourself, 'One
day I want to be a part of that,''' said Holloway, who also had a
fast-break layup in overtime off a steal.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon's Frederick Jones hit two free throws with 8.7 seconds
left in overtime to give the Ducks (22-8) a 71-70 lead.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later in Winston Salem, Mike Miller scored on
Florida's ''Home Run'' play to give the fifth-seeded Gators a 69-68
overtime victory over Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Miller drove through the lane to hit the winning shot at the
buzzer. Officials went to video replay, using a rule that was added
at midseason, to verify the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who finished with 16 points, got the chance to win the
game after Butler's LaVall Jordan missed two attempts with 8.1
seconds left. Florida (25-7) plays Illinois, a 68-58 winner over
Pennsylvania. Andrew Graves led Butler (23-8) with 20 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the other games in Birmingham, it was Tennessee 63,
Louisiana-Lafayette 58; North Carolina 84, Missouri 70; and
Stanford 84, South Carolina State 65.
</P>
<P>
   In South Regional games in Nashville, Tenn., it was Cincinnati
64, North Carolina-Wilmington 47; Tulsa 89, UNLV 62; Ohio State 87,
Appalachian State 61; and Miami 75, Arkansas 71.
East Regional:
At Buffalo. N.Y.:
Temple 73, Lafayette 47:
</P>
<P>
   Pepe Sanchez had a career-high 15 assists for Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, who did not score, came within one assist of the East
Regional record set by Sam Crawford of New Mexico State in 1993.
The NCAA tournament record is 18 by Mark Wade of UNLV in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Wadley led Temple (27-5) with 17 points. Tyson Whitfield
had 15 for Lafayette (24-7).
Oklahoma St. 86, Hofstra 66:
</P>
<P>
   Desmond Mason scored 30 points, two off his career high, as
third-seeded Oklahoma State improved to 16-1 in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Jonzen added 13 points as the Cowboys (25-6) gave coach
Eddie Sutton his 30th tournament win. Speedy Claxton and Norman
Richardson each had 20 points for Hofstra (24-7).
At Winston-Salem, N.C.:
Duke 82, Lamar 55:
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams has 18 points and seven assists and Carlos Boozer
added 16 points for top-seeded Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-9 Boozer made five straight baskets in the second
half to help the Blue Devils (28-4) pull away. Kenyon Spears led
Lamar (15-16) with 19 points.
Illinois 68, Pennsylvania 58:
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Frank Williams compensated for a poor outing by Cory
Bradford with a season-high 21 points, sending fourth-seeded
Illinois into the next round.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford, averaging 15.3 points, managed only five points.
Marcus Griffin added 17 points and 10 rebounds to help Illinois
(22-9) snap Penn's 16-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Ugonna Onyekwe had 17 points for Penn (21-8).
South Regional:
At Birmingham, Ala.:
Stanford 84, South Carolina St. 65:
</P>
<P>
   Casey Jacobsen scored 18 points and Mark Madsen had 14 points
and 13 rebounds for top-seeded Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal (27-3) won its opening-round game for the sixth
straight year. They will play North Carolina on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Wiatre scored 17 points for South Carolina State (20-14).
North Carolina 84, Missouri 70:
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Haywood had a career-high 28 points and 15 rebounds for
eighth-seeded North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cota had 10 assists to become only the third player in NCAA
history to reach 1,000 for his career. Capel added 14 points and 11
rebounds for the Tar Heels (19-13). Clarence Gilbert led Missouri
(18-13) with 16 points.
Tennessee 63, Louisiana-Lafayette 58:
</P>
<P>
   Tony Harris made two free throws with 10.8 seconds left to lift
fourth-seeded Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   After Harris missed a free throw with 15 seconds to play and
Tennessee up 60-58, Ron Slay got the rebound and was flagrantly
fouled by Smith -- allowing Tennessee to keep the ball after the
free throws. After Slay missed both free throws, the Vols inbounded
to Harris, who was fouled.
</P>
<P>
   Harris and Slay led Tennessee (25-6) with 15 points each. Lonnie
Thomas led Louisiana-Lafayette (25-9) with 19 points.
At Nashville, Tenn.:
Cincinnati 64, N.C.-Wilmington 47:
</P>
<P>
   Pete Mickeal scored 15 points as second-seeded Cincinnati,
without injured All-American Kenyon Martin, easily advanced.

</P>
<P>
   Scoonie Penn scored 23 points as third-seeded Ohio State opened
its bid for a second straight Final Four appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Penn was 9-for-11 from the field, hitting 5-of-7 3-pointers.
Michael Redd added 21 points for Ohio State (23-6), which will face
Miami on Sunday. Tyson Patterson led Appalachian State (23-9) with
15 points.
Miami 75, Arkansas 71:

<HEADLINE> Former Hostages Divided Over Iran  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The highest ranking former American hostage
held in Iran welcomes the olive branch the United States is
extending to his former captors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the right thing to do,'' said Bruce Laingen, chief of
mission when the U.S. Embassy was seized by militants in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   But enthusiasm is by no means unanimous following the
announcement Friday that the United States is seeking what
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called a ''new relationship''
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't have anything to do with them,'' said Malcolm Kalp,
the former embassy commercial officer, who along with Laingen and
50 other hostages was held in Iran for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the ban will be lifted on U.S. imports of Iranian
nuts, caviar and carpets and invited Iran to work with the United
States to stabilize the Persian Gulf and reverse more than two
decades of estrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iran lives in a dangerous neighborhood,'' Albright said. ''We
welcome efforts to make it less dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Laingen, now president of the American Academy of Diplomacy in
Washington, said he is curious to see how the Iranians will react,
''what signal they give.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This has to be a mutual process, and we haven't been getting
enough from them for the past year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kalp, who remains bitter about the 1983 terrorist bombing
fatalities in Lebanon, said he believes Iran should first
demonstrate ''major corrections in their international behavior,''
including ceasing to send arms ''through Syria to attack Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Let them pay major sums of money to the 241 U.S. servicemen
they killed at the Marine barracks and the embassy people they
killed in Beirut -- and then I'd be more than happy to eat their
nuts, eat their caviar and lay on their rugs,'' Kalp said.
</P>
<P>
   Others with long-held grievances against Iran agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Former AP Middle East correspondent Terry Anderson, who holds
Iran accountable for his seven years in captivity, said in a
statement that Tehran should ''take responsibility for its acts and
offer compensation to American victims'' as a prerequisite to
improved relations.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Flatow of New Jersey, who blames Iran for the 1995
bombing in Gaza that killed his daughter, Alisa, said the Clinton
administration is putting ''caviar, carpets and pistachio nuts''
before the fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Flatow, Anderson and three other hostages held with Anderson in
Beirut -- David Jacobsen, Joseph Cicippio and Frank Reed -- all sued
Iran in American courts under a 1996 law allowing Americans to seek
damages from nations that sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   In her announcement, made during a speech to the
American-Iranian Council, a private group, Albright called the
seizure of the Tehran embassy disgraceful and traumatic. She also
criticized Iran as a supporter of terrorism, an opponent of Mideast
peacemaking and as bent on acquiring weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   But conciliatory statements by Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami and then the election last month to parliament of
candidates considered moderate by some American analysts apparently
set the stage for the administration's overtures.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said: ''Iran
thinks it is positive and welcomes it.'' But there was no
indication Iran was taking the administration up on its proposal
for formal talks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dialogue must take place devoid of sanctions,'' said Hadi
Nejad Hosseinian, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations. ''Iran
will seriously consider the steps announced this morning, and is
ready to adopt proportional and adequate steps but is not prepared
for drastic change.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiative drew mixed reactions on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the Clinton administration would now look for ways
to increase contacts between American and Iranian scholars,
artists, professionals, athletes and groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this will serve to deepen bonds of mutual
understanding and trust,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Clinton booed at parade; cardinal too ill to attend  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton should have been green
with envy.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani basked in the adoration of crowds at the
St. Patrick's Day parade Friday while Clinton soldiered 42 blocks
up Fifth Avenue to taunts of ''Go back to Arkansas!''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cardinal John O'Connor's deteriorating health kept
him bedridden for the day. This is the first time in 16 years that
the 80-year-old cardinal, who had a brain tumor removed in August,
has not stood on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral to bless the
parade as it passes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I missed him at the Mass and I missed him in front of St.
Patrick's,'' said Giuliani, who took part in an early morning
service in the cathedral that was also attended by Clinton. The
two, who are rivals for a U.S. Senate seat, sat several rows apart
in the church and did not interact.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with a protest on Fifth Avenue by the Irish
Lesbian and Gay Organization in which 69 people were arrested. The
Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Catholic fraternal organization
that organizes the parade, excludes ILGO on the grounds that the
Catholic church does not accept homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   ILGO supporters were angry that the first lady, who portrays
herself as a strong supporter of gay rights, participated in the
parade. It was the first time she had marched.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's marching with bigots. The exclusion of gays and lesbians
is anything but Christian or Catholic,'' said Florence Sullivan of
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she had ''hoped the parade would be inclusive'' but
decided to march anyway because ''this is a day also to honor the
values and contributions of Irish Americans ... When you're in
public life, you have to balance competing values.''
</P>
<P>
   The ILGO controversy keeps many prominent Democrats away from
the parade. City Public Advocate Mark Green, city Comptroller Alan
Hevesi and U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer were among the no-shows.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton marched with City Council President Peter Vallone,
former Mayor Ed Koch, and U.S. Reps. Carolyn Maloney, D-Manhattan,
and Joseph Crowley, D-Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's supporters -- wearing green shamrock stickers with
''HILLARY'' printed on them -- clapped and shouted her name when
they spotted her, but were frequently drowned out by the more vocal
Giuliani supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go back to Arkansas, carpetbagger!'' shouted Mary Coyne, a
secretary from Farmingdale, Long Island. ''I can't stand her. She's
a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's not from New York,'' said Patrick Torney, a history
teacher from the Bronx. ''Anybody can buy a house in New York and
say they're a New Yorker.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, wearing a green scarf, kept waving and had a smile
frozen on her face despite the jeers, but never ventured from the
center of the avenue to make contact with parade-goers on the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, in contrast, made so many detours to shake hands and
hug supporters screaming ''We love you, Rudy!'' along the side of
the route that he was often left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gotta catch up, huh?'' he said as he sprinted, along with
his security team, to rejoin Gov. George Pataki and city Police
Commissioner Howard Safir, who were among the lead marchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is her first parade, this is my 20th,'' said Giuliani.
''I've lived in this state all my life, I've lived in this city all
my life. I've marched in this parade when I was a little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Clinton had said: ''It is just a great pleasure to be
here as a New Yorker for St. Patrick's Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president's wife to have visited Northern
Ireland. President Clinton has been deeply involved in the peace
process there and was meeting in Washington on Friday with leaders
from both sides of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The parade grand marshal, Kevin Cahill, is O'Connor's personal
physician and president of the Irish-American Historical Society.
He is also a former state health commissioner and one of the
doctors who attended to the pope after he was shot.
</P>
<P>
   One spectator, Jerry McGowan, made fun of Clinton's wishing that
the parade had been ''inclusive'' of the gay groups.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the parade has always been political and added:
''It's good that both Hillary and Rudy are here. That way it IS
inclusive.''

<HEADLINE> US Exploring China Trade Provisions  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is reviewing ideas
being floated by members of Congress to make voting for a China
trade agreement more politically palatable.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley said in an interview Friday
that several ideas are being advanced in discussions now beginning
in earnest on what the administration says is its biggest remaining
foreign policy objective before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Members have been dealing with lots of other things in the
last couple of months,'' Daley said. ''This is just beginning to
get seriously on their radar screens.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is asking Congress to pass legislation that
would award China permanent normal trade status with the United
States in return for China's elimination of trade barriers that
American manufacturers and farmers complain cost billions of
dollars in lost export sales. China made the market-opening offers
to get U.S. support for its membership in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents on Capitol Hill vow to fight the effort, which would
do away with Congress' annual review of tariff rates for Chinese
products destined for the United States. That vote has been used to
keep pressure on China in a variety of areas from human rights to
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Several proposals are being circulated among lawmakers looking
for a way to keep the annual review, but with penalties not tied to
China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri told reporters
Thursday that he believes Congress can find a way to continue
annual reviews of China's human rights record that would be
compatible with WTO rules, which require that countries in the
organization grant all other member countries the same low tariff
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he wanted something ''with teeth,'' Gephardt said,
''There are penalties that we could use to enforce whatever this
might be that are consistent with the WTO.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gephardt was not more specific, one proposal being
discussed among Democrats would link continued loans to China from
the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, the U.S.
Export-Import Bank and the U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp.
to China's records on human rights, labor issues and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The United States lacks the power to block loans to particular
countries within the IMF or the World Bank, but as the member with
the largest number of votes in both organizations it wields
significant influence over both organizations.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said any requirement for continued annual reviews of China in such
areas as human rights would have to be consistent with WTO trade
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The official said linking loan support to China's performance
rather than trade preferences did appear to be a way to avoid WTO
problems, but he stressed that the administration has not settled
on any specific proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., already put forward a proposal that
would set up a U.S. government commission to monitor China on human
rights, core labor standards and adherence to past trade
agreements. Levin recommends that in areas where it was determined
that China was not living up to proper performance, economic
sanctions could be used.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, he said he was finding growing support
in Congress for his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is growing recognition that we need to engage, but we
also need to confront China,'' Levin said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges More Oil Production  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Optimistic that oil exporters will increase
production later this month, President Clinton nevertheless plans
some ''modest'' measures aimed at helping to ease the impact of
high fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals, which Clinton planned to unveil in his weekly
radio address today, would not include any freeing of oil from the
government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as many lawmakers have
sought, White House officials said. Instead, they said, he would
announce ''a modest package of proposals ... to help Americans
who've suffered some hardship'' by the rising oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the president appealed to members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to ''substantial
production increase'' when they meet March 27-- big enough to
rebuild depleted reserves and bring down high prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he said oil producers deserve ''a fair
return'' that would avoid the see-sawing market that produced
$10-a-barrel oil in 1998 and more than triple that price now, 14
months later.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton gave no details about his package of proposals
Friday, options that have been under consideration include:
</P>
<P>
   --A halt to Alaska oil exports -- about 60,000 barrels a day -- to
Asia, allowing the oil to be shipped to West Coast markets, where
gasoline prices have been among the highest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   --Postponing some additional oil scheduled to be put into the
emergency reserve from government leases, diverting it to the open
market.
</P>
<P>
   A drawdown, in the form of an oil ''swap'', from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve has been ''an option, but we're not considering
it now,'' said an administration official, reinforcing a view
expressed by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had spoken with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd about
the need to stabilize oil prices at levels that satisfy both
producing and consuming nations. Saudi Arabia already has said it
favors increasing production.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think everybody's struggling now to find a consensus'' on
easing oil prices, Clinton told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC oil ministers are expected to agree to additional
production when they meet in Vienna, but no one knows how much or
how soon. Administration officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a use of the emergency oil reserve stocks might be
warranted if the new OPEC production levels are insufficient, or
delayed to cause problems with supplies during heavy demand this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department reported recently that oil inventories and
gasoline stocks already are at precariously low levels as refiners
move into the period when they seek to build inventory for the
heavy summer driving season.
</P>
<P>
   According to the department, refineries need to increase their
crude oil amounts by 1 million barrels a day to build gasoline
inventories during March and April to meet summer demand. With
stocks already low and a shortage of crude, ''the situation is
ripe'' for further gasoline price spikes, the department's Energy
Information Administration in a report last week.
</P>
<P>
   Should OPEC increase production beginning in April, it would
still take four to six weeks for any of the additional oil to reach
the U.S. market, officials said.

<HEADLINE> White House Admits E-mail Problems  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of incoming White House e-mail
messages on campaign fund raising and other matters could not be
searched in response to House subpoenas, and it would be a massive
undertaking to reconstruct them, Clinton administration officials
say.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming ''unintentional'' computer failures, White House counsel
Beth Nolan wrote a Republican lawmaker Friday, ''We do not know if
any responsive information is contained in the unrecorded
e-mails.''
</P>
<P>
   She told Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House
Government Reform Committee, that reconstructing the incoming
e-mails from 1996-1999 would involve a costly and time-consuming
undertaking: up to $3 million and up to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's panel sought information on campaign fund-raising
irregularities, the 1993 siege at the Waco, Texas, Branch Davidian
compound and President Clinton's grant of clemency to 16 imprisoned
Puerto Rican separatists.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman James Kennedy said administration
officials were not making a commitment to the restoration effort
but would discuss the matter with Burton.
</P>
<P>
   While researching the computer failures, an additional problem
was discovered that could result in missing e-mails in Vice
President Al Gore's office, Nolan said. The scope of that problem
is unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ''These configuration errors were the sole result of human
mistakes and entirely unintentional,'' Nolan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The mostly technical letter did not address statements in court
papers by a former White House contract employee that she was
warned not to reveal the e-mail problem that concealed the messages
from the Justice Department and Burton's committee.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Betty Lambuth, said a subordinate told her some
of the e-mails dealt with ''Vice President Al Gore's involvement in
campaign fund-raising controversies'' and ''the sale of Clinton
Commerce Department trade mission seats in exchange for campaign
contributions.'' The subordinate said the e-mails also contained
information on the White House's improper gathering of FBI
background files of former Republican appointees and the Monica
Lewinsky scandal, Lambuth said in her declaration.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan said there were two separate computer failures that made
it impossible for document searches to find the e-mails. One
problem lasted from August 1996 through November 1998, and affected
incoming messages to 526 White House users, she said. Incoming mail
for another 200 accounts were affected by the second error, lasting
from November 1998 to May 1999.

<HEADLINE> Nestle Recalls Baby Formula  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- About 2.5 million cans of Nestle concentrated
baby formula are being recalled because they may not have been
properly sterilized.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle of Glendale, Calif., recalled 33 batches of the formula
after the company discovered that during processing, the liquid
concentrate formula may not have reached high enough temperatures
to be sterilized, the company and the Food and Drug Administration
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported, and Nestle said it has tested
the batches and found no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our concern is the remote possibility that there could be a
bacteria in there that could make a child sick when they drank
it,'' said John Guzewich, a scientist with the FDA's Center for
Food Safety. ''Even though there's no evidence that that has
happened, rather than taking a chance, they're removing it from the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   He said anyone concerned about an illness should contact a
doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The recalled Nestle Carnation products are 13-ounce cans of Good
Start, Follow-Up and Alsoy concentrate baby formula. The lower left
side of the front label has three lines of text that reads: ''Iron
Fortified. Concentrated Liquid. Add Water.''
</P>
<P>
   The concentrate formula, after being mixed with water, is used
as a supplement or replacement for breast milk and is given to
infants less than a year old.
</P>
<P>
   The baby formula was produced between Oct. 18, 1999, and March
13 of this year and was sold nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA advises consumers to avoid feeding the products to
infants and to return them to the stores where they were purchased
for a refund or exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Nestle urges consumers to call 1-800-510-7493 to see if they
have purchased any of the recalled cans.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan: America Ready for Me  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan says American voters are ready to
''roll the dice'' and elect him president over Republican George W.
Bush and Democrat Al Gore, despite the conservative commentator's
dismal showing in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''The establishment of both parties lacks the hold on the
country (they) used to have,'' Buchanan said Friday. ''The
allegiance to the two parties is smaller than it's ever been. The
willingness to take a look at a third party is greater than it's
ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   During an hour-long interview with The Associated Press,
Buchanan predicted his candidacy would ''re-shape'' Ross Perot's
factionalized Reform Party into an anti-abortion, anti-trade,
anti-establishment voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ''What will come out will be populist, traditionalist,
conservative, very strongly supportive of the ideas of mine on
trade and foreign policy and immigration policy,'' Buchanan said.
''At the end, it'll look like the Rockettes'' for precision.
</P>
<P>
   The former Nixon administration aide bolted the Republican Party
last October and has criss-crossed the nation in pursuit of enough
Reform Party support to acquire its presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   He is not assured the nomination. There's no sign Perot is
preparing to run, but he hasn't ruled it out and supporters of the
Texas billionaire have gathered thousands of signatures for a
petition to draft him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Am I afraid? Nope,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   His strong views on social and cultural issues clash with the
Reform Party's, whose platform is silent on such matters as
abortion because most member do not believe government should have
a say in those subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan said he would find broad common ground with Reform
Party members on trade and immigration issues, and he predicted
that an alliance even with those on the far left would boost his
standing in the polls out of their current low single digits.
</P>
<P>
   He cringed, however, at a suggestion that some of his new allies
subscribe to ''political collectivism'' -- a term he apparently
associated with communism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever I hear the term 'collectivism' I release the safety
clip from my revolver,'' Buchanan said with a deep-throated laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said Sen. John McCain's now-abandoned challenge to Bush
for the GOP nomination underscores the public's yearning for
anti-establishment candidate such as himself. ''The American
electorate is more ready to roll the dice than it has ever been in
my lifetime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Buchanan also:
</P>
<P>
   --Said Bush hasn't ''demonstrated the grasp of foreign policy or
international affairs that would justify putting the presidency of
the United States in his hands.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He sounds like a federal version of Ann Richards,'' Bush
spokesman Ari Fleischer replied, referring to Bush's Democratic
opponent in his successful run for the first Texas governorship,
who argued in 1994 that he was not ready to run the state.
</P>
<P>
   --Accused Gore and President Clinton of capitalizing on violence
in America, such as the outbreak of high-profile shootings. ''I do
believe both the president and vice president exploit and demagogue
tragedies and horrors in this country every time they occur to
advance their agenda, first, and, secondly, to demonize their
political opponents,'' Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   --Said he agrees with Bob Jones University elders ''on all manner
of social and cultural issues'' and objects to attacks on the
school for its former ban on interracial dating.
</P>
<P>
   ''These folks haven't killed anybody down there,'' he said.
Asked whether he agrees with the interracial dating ban, he
replied: ''They claim that policy goes back to their interpretation
of the Old Testament. It's not my interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   --Agreed with the Clinton administration's decision Friday to
lift a ban on U.S. imports of Iranian goods. ''I think we should
engage with the Iran regime'' in response to its movements toward
democracy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   --Would suspend normal trade relations with China as long as the
nation made threatening gestures toward Taiwan or the United
States. He accused Clinton of accepting ''anything short of war''
from China in order to maintain trade with the Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   --Won't return to the GOP, even if he loses in November. Buchanan
said he has affinity for party regulars, but ''at it's upper levels
the Republican Party is snobbish. It's exclusive.''
</P>
<P>
   --Plans to complain to the Federal Election Commission to force
his inclusion in presidential debates. Buchanan said he expects to
hit the 15 percent in polls to meet a threshold set by a debate
commission. Even if he fails to do so, he said he should be
included in the fall debates because the Reform Party qualifies for
federal campaign money.
</P>
<P>
   -- Revealed that he won the endorsement of liberal activist
Lenora Fulani with a promise to support same-day voter
registration. He announced the proposal this week, along with
several other campaign finance initiatives he unveiled in 1995. Yet
Buchanan, who hopes to court McCain supporters, said campaign
finance reform, a top McCain priority, ''is not some cutting edge
issue with me.''

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Teemu Selanne scored twice and Oleg
Tverdovsky had his third in as many games Friday night as the
Anaheim Might Ducks beat the San Jose Sharks 4-2 to boost their
playoff bid.
</P>
<P>
   Tverdovsky, playing in his 400th NHL game, gave Anaheim a 3-0
lead on a power-play goal with 6:28 left in the second period, and
the Might Ducks survived a Sharks rally.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose peppered Mighty Ducks goalie Guy Hebert with 13 shots
in the first 10 minutes of the third period, and Todd Harvey
connected to make it 3-1 1:10 in.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Friesen's short-handed goal at 14:45 brought San Jose to
within 3-2. But Selanne scored an empty-net goal as time expired
for the 4-2 final.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim moved within four points of San Jose for the eighth and
final Western Conference playoff spot. Each team has 10 games
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim took a 1-0 lead in the first period on a sensational
individual effort by Selanne, who streaked down the right side and
launched a shot at a tough angle stopped by goalie Steve Shields.
Selanne, never breaking stride, skated behind the goal and was in
perfect position to net Paul Kariya's rebound for his 27th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Fredrik Olausson made it 2-0 for the Mighty Ducks 4:30 into the
second period, scoring his 12th goal with assists from Kip Miller
and Ladislav Cohn.

<HEADLINE> Speed Trap Sparks Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- It was last August when Alan and Matt
Dayton decided to have a little fun with the speed trap down the
road from their parents' house in Ogden.
</P>
<P>
   They made a sign out of poster board that read ''Radar Trap, 25
mph'' and held it up along the road, much to the delight of passing
motorists. Before long, the two brothers had the full attention of
police and the beginning of an odd free speech squabble that has
wound up in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was actually my idea,'' said Matt Dayton, 25. ''We were
just having fun. It's a Saturday afternoon, and we were having a
few laughs.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first 20 minutes last Aug. 28, motorists driving by
honked their approval and gave thumbs up signs. Then a patrol car
stopped and a few minutes later, Alan Dayton was unconscious on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Dayton, 31, started a scuffle with police and
resisted arrest, but the brothers say he was manhandled by an angry
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I managed to get Dayton in a headlock and after several
seconds he stopped struggling. I put Dayton face down on the grass
and handcuffed him,'' Officer Bob Hanselman wrote in his police
report.
</P>
<P>
   ''After handcuffing Dayton I noticed that he appeared to be
semiconscious and he began shaking. This lasted 5 to 10 seconds,
and Dayton was alert and conscious after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dayton was arrested and charged with obstruction of justice,
resisting arrest and disorderly conduct. That was only the start --
Dayton, after all, is an attorney and adviser for a Salt Lake
County commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton refused prosecutors' offer of a plea bargain, which would
have meant fines of about $2,750. Instead, he paid his attorneys
more than $10,000 to defend him. All charges against Dayton were
thrown out during a Feb. 25 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Michael Glassman said Dayton had a right to be where he
was, holding the sign. The judge also said Dayton wasn't lawfully
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had only the sign, they searched me and found a golf ball
and two tees in pockets,'' Dayton recalled.
</P>
<P>
   His longtime friend and attorney, Jere Reneer, plans to sue the
city of Ogden and the police for civil rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a law-and-order guy and so is Alan. This is a very
conservative Republican. Here he is expressing his views about
something and he gets beat up,'' Reneer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the beauty of this case. I don't have a drug dealer
that was beat up. I have someone that I know was telling the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge has not yet signed off on his ruling. After that
happens, the city will have 30 days to appeal. Paul Olds, the Ogden
assistant city attorney who prosecuted Dayton, said he has not
decided whether to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union is tracking the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do agree that it was a violation of his First Amendment
rights and used as a way to charge him criminally,'' said Carol
Gnade, executive director of the Utah chapter of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Highway Patrol spokesman Chris Kramer would not comment
directly on Dayton's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anything that slows people down and makes people drive in a
more cautious manner, we're in favor of,'' Kramer said. ''The
ultimate goal here is to make people safe.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cop who shot unarmed man put on desk duty  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The undercover narcotics officer who killed an
unarmed black man during a buy-and-bust operation in midtown
Manhattan has been stripped of his gun and badge amid a grand jury
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Detective Anthony Vasquez, will remain on desk duty
pending the outcome of the probe of the shooting of Patrick
Dorismond, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's family joined the Rev. Al Sharpton and other black
activists in calling on federal authorities to investigate the
incident, which followed last month's acquittal of four officers in
the killing of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo and the fatal
police shooting of another unarmed black man a week later. They
also accused officials of demonizing the victim by releasing his
record of petty crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody killed my son!'' Marie Dorismond, a Haitian
immigrant, wailed during a news conference outside her Brooklyn
apartment building. ''My son was never a criminal. ... What is this
lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he had asked Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch
to meet with him on Monday; Lynch declined comment. A spokesman for
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said she would be monitoring
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for urging the
news media ''not to jump to conclusions'' about the officer's
conduct. ''He ought to tell the police to stop jumping to
conclusions,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, appearing at the St. Patrick's Day parade, and police
officials refused to discuss the shooting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was killed shortly after midnight Thursday during a
struggle with undercover officers on Eighth Avenue near West 37th
Street. Police sources said Dorismond, 26, an off-duty security
guard, grew angry when one of the officers approached and asked if
he and another man knew where he could buy marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the two men attacked the undercover officer,
prompting Vasquez and another back-up officer to move in. During
the ensuing scuffle, Vasquez's pistol somehow went off, and a
bullet hit Dorismond in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Thursday what sparked the deadly confrontation,
Police Commissioner Howard Safir responded in part by reciting
Dorismond's arrest history: as a teen-ager for robbery and assault;
in 1993 for attempted robbery and assault; and in 1996 for criminal
possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials and prosecutors said Friday that the 1993 and
1996 charges were all misdemeanors. In both cases, Dorismond was
allowed to plead guilty to disorderly conduct and perform community
service. The earlier juvenile case was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The National Coalition for Haitian Rights called on Safir to
apologize to Dorismond's family and the city's Haitian community.
''We are outraged that Mr. Safir stooped to using character
assassination as the first line of defense to explain away the
senseless killing,'' the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   At his mother's home on Friday, the victim was remembered as a
devoted father of two daughters, ages 5 and 1, a lover of reggae
music and someone who spoke of one day becoming a police officer.
Mourners had erected a makeshift shrine in the lobby with candles,
flowers and tributes scribbled on notebook paper. ''God bless you
Patrick,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   The family is ''upset right now and there's no explanation,''
said Kena Smith, 23, aunt of Dorismond's youngest child. For the
girls, she added, ''We're going to have to be the father now
because of some stupid cop.''

Taiwanese Vote for New President
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese could shake the delicate status quo that has
preserved peace between China and Taiwan in a vote Saturday that will give them
an untested leader facing growing pressure to negotiate with a bellicose
Beijing. The race to succeed President Lee Teng-hui was too close to call as the
three top candidates wrapped up their campaigns Friday night to the sounds of
blaring air horns, fireworks and deafening applause. But there was a very real
possibility the ruling Nationalist Party could lose the presidency for the first
time since Taiwan was separated politically from China when communist forces
captured the mainland in 1949.

Clinton Urges More Oil Production
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Optimistic that oil exporters will increase production
later this month, President Clinton nevertheless plans some ''modest'' measures
aimed at helping to ease the impact of high fuel prices. The proposals, which
Clinton plans to unveil in his weekly radio address Saturday, would not include
any freeing of oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as many
lawmakers have sought, White House officials said. Instead, they said, he would
announce ''a modest package of proposals ... to help Americans who've suffered
some hardship'' by the rising oil prices.

Buchanan: America Ready for Me
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Buchanan says American voters are ready to ''roll the
dice'' and elect him president over Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al
Gore, despite the conservative commentator's dismal showing in the polls. ''The
establishment of both parties lacks the hold on the country (they) used to
have,'' Buchanan said Friday. ''The allegiance to the two parties is smaller
than it's ever been. The willingness to take a look at a third party is greater
than it's ever been.'' During an hour-long interview with The Associated Press,
Buchanan predicted his candidacy would ''re-shape'' Ross Perot's factionalized
Reform Party into an anti-abortion, anti-trade, anti-establishment voting bloc.

Md. Police Surround Accused Killer
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A man accused of killing four people last week was
holding up to three people hostage in a house Friday night, police said.
Authorities surrounded the house and were negotiating for the hostages' release.
Joseph Palczynski had at least three firearms and was holding at least three
hostages, said Baltimore County police Cpl. Vickie Warehime. Police said the
home belongs to a relative of Tracy Whitehead, Palczynski's former girlfriend,
whom he is accused of kidnapping last week. She escaped a day later. Sonny
Collins, a cousin of Whitehead, said he believed her mother, her stepfather and
her 12-year-old brother were in the home.

across the Taiwan Straits, U.S. officials say they see steady, but not alarming,
improvements in North Korea's military, much of which is stationed within
striking distance of this South Korean capital. Defense Secretary William Cohen
visited U.S. troops at an Army post north of Seoul on Friday, and met with
Defense Minister Cho Seong Tae and other senior government officials Saturday.
At a news conference with Cho, Cohen said he welcomed China's decision in recent
days to tone down its rhetorical threats against Taiwan, which is in the midst

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors: New charges will be brought in a rewritten indictment  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Brooklyn man accused of helping an Algerian
try to smuggle explosives into the United States will face
additional charges stemming from the evidence gathered against him
so far, a prosecutor says.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kelley told U.S. District Judge
John F. Keenan on Friday that the government planned to add charges
in a rewrite of an indictment already brought against Abdel Ghani
Meskini.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley did not describe the nature of the new charges but said
they would stem from evidence already collected in the case.
</P>
<P>
   In previous terrorism cases, the prosecutor's office has
rewritten indictments several times to add defendants and charges.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini, 31, has been held without bail since his December
arrest in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Keenan warned Kelley to add the charges soon rather than on the
eve of trial. No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the one thing that drives me crazy,'' the judge said of
last-minute changes to an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini has been charged with providing and concealing support
for Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian national accused of trying to sneak
explosives into the United States just before the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 after he allegedly tried to smuggle
timing devices and a powerful demolition explosive into Washington
from Canada. The arrest came amid heightened security aimed at
making sure terrorism did not mar millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Another alleged accomplice, Mokhtar Haouari, 31, remains in
Montreal as the United States seeks to extradite him to be tried in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment against Haouari and Meskini accuses them of
conspiring since October 1997 to support members and associates of
a terrorist group. Haouari allegedly provided various forged
identification documents while Meskini went to Seattle to assist
Ressam.
</P>
<P>
   Documents filed in Montreal courts allege that Haouari said he
fled to Canada in 1993 because he was wanted by military police in
Algeria over his involvement with the fundamentalist Islamic
Salvation Front. He said he left the group in 1992 because ''it is
against my principles and religion to use any form of violence.''

<HEADLINE> Ailing Cardinal John O'Connor misses St. Patrick's Day Mass,parade  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS OLERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John O'Connor had beamed at children
from the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral for 15 years every March
17, blessing them and accepting their bouquets of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But that tradition ended on Friday. The ailing 80-year-old
Catholic leader was forced to skip the annual parade and Mass
saluting the Irish patron saint of the New York archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ''How we wish he could be here,'' said retired Auxiliary Bishop
Patrick Ahern, preaching Friday morning to 5,000 worshippers in St.
Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment hung over the parade throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Mary Martin of the Franciscan Sisters of the Atonement
shivered on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral, as a freezing
rain and light snow fell. She made a 45-mile train trip from
upstate Putnam County to attend the cardinal's Mass, and was
disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I miss the cardinal. That's why I came down here,'' she said.
''He's done everything for New York. The parade's not the same
without him.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 St. Patrick's Day parades, the cardinal has
stood on the steps of the cathedral for hours waving and personally
greeting marchers -- thousands of police officers, city workers,
commissioners, politicians and visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zwilling, the cardinal's spokesman, said O'Connor was in
his home adjoining the cathedral, and had not been in his
archdiocese offices since March 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big disappointment for him not being able to be here,''
Zwilling added.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, Gov. George Pataki said, ''We were all saddened
by the empty chair on the altar. We just pray for his health.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Whelan, 67, of West Orange, N.J., said he also missed the
cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad because he's really been such a great ambassador to
the parade for years,'' Whelan said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor has missed public Mass for the last several weeks,
including Ash Wednesday Mass and services. The 80-year-old
cardinal, who had a brain tumor removed in August, has suffered
partial hearing loss and difficulty reading because of his illness.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who attended the Mass Friday, said he
had greeted the cardinal during the parade in previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I missed him at the Mass, and I missed him in front of St.
Patrick's. I'm very hopeful that he's going to make a full,
complete recovery,'' the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Appeals for Belfast Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At a White House reception featuring Irish
verse and song, President Clinton hoped the cheer of St. Patrick's
Day would pull together Northern Ireland's quarreling leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton compared the quest for peace to the saga of the
''fortunate wind'' that blew Ulysses along on his voyage.
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady played host Friday for a
Celebration of Ireland with a reading by Irish poet Seamus Heaney
and three renditions of ''Danny Boy'' -- one by a children's bell
choir from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said if the parties would
''sit down and concentrate our minds on the few, last, desperately
hard issues,'' they could achieve peace before Clinton leaves
office next year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wouldn't it be easier ... if we were to take the advice that's
been given to us by a lot of people, and all the assistance they've
given, and finish this?'' Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Clinton urged them to avert a return to violence,
politicians on both sides of Northern Ireland's sectarian divide
remained skeptical about chances for a quick end to the stalemate
over the Irish Republican Army's weapons and Britain's decision to
shutter the coalition government established under the 1998 Good
Friday Accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news about Ireland is that even though the
institutions have been taken down over the difference between the
parties on decommissioning (disarming), no one wants to go back to
the way it was or give up the peace process,'' Clinton said. ''We
need to restore a process that will eventually lead to all the
requirements of the Good Friday Accord being observed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern started the St. Patrick's Day ceremonies at the White
House by presenting Clinton with a crystal bowl brimming with
shamrocks. He said he believes all parties remain committed to
peace, but ''it is not easy things that we're asking anybody to
resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks easy on paper,'' he said. ''But the fact is that
there are huge, deeply held fears and mistrust. Confidence has to
be restored.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also met with David Trimble, leader of the main
Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists; Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams;
John Hume, leader of the moderate Roman Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party, who shared a Nobel Peace Prize with Trimble; and
Seamus Mallon, Hume's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials cautioned against expecting breakthroughs.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Food Shortages Feared  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- With planting season two weeks away,
thousands of Mozambican flood victims could face further hunger
unless their fields dry soon, a U.N. agricultural expert said.
</P>
<P>
   Monthlong flooding has already killed 492 people and driven
360,000 from their homes. Now water-soaked soil and a shortage of
seed could stall the planting of beans and maize -- staple crops in
this nation of mainly subsistence farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to be in trouble unless they can plant. Even if
farms are not under water (but) too soggy, the seed will rot after
it's put in the ground,'' said Byron Ponce Segura, a consultant to
the Food and Agricultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
   If farmers can't plant, they'll miss the September harvest and
become dependent on food aid until April 2001, the World Food
Program said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambican officials said 123,000 families were in immediate
need of seed for planting. The onset of flooding and food shortages
in early February forced many farmers and their families to eat
seed they had kept from the previous harvest to plant in April.
</P>
<P>
   The World Food Program and other aid agencies began distributing
seeds to 60,000 families this week, along with emergency food
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The thousands of flood refugees have been crowded into 120 camps
across central and southern Mozambique. With most of the region's
main roads and railways washed out, a fleet of 53 military
helicopters and airplanes from seven nations was delivering nearly
80 percent of all emergency aid this week.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopters were also searching for remote landing sites, where
they could deliver food to thousands of flood victims in
out-of-the-way areas. The search was taxing the helicopters, which
had to fly longer to locate landing zones and small villages, South
African military spokesman Maj. Douglas Duncan said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan urged the nearly 140 aid agencies helping with disaster
relief to help pilots find and designate aid distribution sites.
</P>
<P>
   About nine South African air force helicopters have been working
since Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Rains were expected to continue through the weekend. While the
level of precipitation has been normal for the waning days of the
rainy season, government officials cautioned Friday that the sodden
ground could absorb little if any more water.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rainfall in neighboring Zimbabwe and Zambia pushed water
levels in the Buzi and Zambezi rivers to critical levels downstream
in central and southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should be at the maximum alert because it is still
raining and the situation can change at any time,'' Miguel
Magalhaes of Mozambique's National Water Directorate said Friday.

<HEADLINE> Journals of Sylvia Plath Published  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Nearly 40 years after the suicide of American poet
Sylvia Plath, her complete journals are about to be published -- an
event that her admirers hope will illuminate some of the dark
corners of a turbulent life.
</P>
<P>
   Excerpts from ''The Journals of Sylvia Plath'' will be
serialized in The Guardian newspaper beginning today. The book will
be published next month in London by Faber and Faber.
</P>
<P>
   The diaries ''contain a string of intimate disclosures that shed
new light on the complexity of Plath's sexuality, her depression
and her hatred of her mother,'' writes Katherine Viner of The
Guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ''The picture Plath paints of early married life with her
'demigod' (poet Ted Hughes), 'the big, blasting, dangerous love,'
is often passionate, sexy and loving -- more real than any attempts
to describe it by others.''
</P>
<P>
   The first installment, beginning with the 1950 diary entry of an
extremely talented 17-year-old, includes the 1956 account of her
first meeting with Hughes -- who after her suicide in 1963, was
vilified by many of Plath's fans.
</P>
<P>
   Plath was 30 when she gassed herself in her kitchen a few months
after Hughes had left her for another woman.
</P>
<P>
   He became Britain's poet laureate and, until the last year of
his life, said little in public about his marriage to Plath. Then
in early 1998, months before he died of cancer, he published
''Birthday Letters,'' a poetic account of their relationship that
revealed the obvious depth of his love for her. Critics gave it
rave reviews and the book sparked a reassessment of the famous
Plath/Hughes relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes had had control over Plath's journals and allowed only a
much-edited version to be published in 1982. The couple's children
are now permitting publication of the journals in full.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes and Plath were in their 20s when they met at Cambridge
University in England on Feb. 26, 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Plath's journal entry for that date describes her first meeting,
at a party, with ''that big, dark, hunky boy ... whose name I had
asked the minute I came into the room.''
</P>
<P>
   After drinking and talking, she said, ''I was stamping and he
was stamping on the floor, and then he kissed me bang on the mouth
and ripped my hairband off, my lovely red hairband scarf, which has
weathered the sun and much love, whose like I shall never again
find, and my favorite silver earrings; hah, I shall keep, he
barked. And when he kissed my neck, I bit him long and hard on the
cheek, and when we came out of the room, blood was running down his
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Viner says that in the incomplete journals, Hughes had edited
out Plath's comment that he was '''the biggest seducer in
Cambridge,' as well as suggestions that he was vain. Also removed
were references to his depression and some mentions of their sex
life.

<HEADLINE> Ad comparing subway commute to livestock herding will be permitted  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Armed with a First Amendment lawsuit, mass
transit advocates succeeded in getting a transportation agency to
reverse itself and allow an advertisement in subway cars that
compares the morning commute to the herding of livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a victory for both free speech and better subways,''
said Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the NYPIRG Straphangers
Campaign, after the Metropolitan Transportation Authority agreed
Friday to allow the ad to run.
</P>
<P>
   The group had joined another mass transit advocate, the Regional
Plan Association, in a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the MTA said, ''After nearly two weeks of
extensive discussion and review, the MTA has withdrawn its
objections to posting on the MTA transit system an advertisement
from the straphangers campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Schwartz, an MTA spokeswoman, said there would be no
further comment. She declined to say whether the MTA now approved
of the poster.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's not go down that road,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed after the MTA refused to approve an
advertising campaign that featured a poster of a crowded subway car
and the headline: ''With livestock it's called animal cruelty. With
people it's called a morning commute.''
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the headline is copy suggesting that subway overcrowding
could be reduced and wait times shortened by buying more subway
cars and running trains more often. It also called for a
full-length Second Avenue train line and improved signaling.
</P>
<P>
   The commute ad was one of two offered by the non-profit groups
to convince commuters to join a mass-transit advocacy coalition
urging political leaders to fund MTA improvements, such as a new
subway line.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is meant to coincide with consideration by the New
York Legislature of a five-year, $16.5 billion capital plan which
the groups have criticized as inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   A second ad shows a state-of-the-art subway station and train
with the headline: ''It's modern. It's reliable. Unfortunately,
it's not in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad also says, ''New York may be the world's greatest city.
But our mass transit system isn't keeping up with the technology
used in cities like Washington, San Francisco and Paris. We deserve
better.''
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers, the MTA initially rejected both
advertisements on Feb. 29, but later decided to allow the second
ad.
</P>
<P>
   In a rejection letter regarding the crowded subway ad, the MTA
told the groups that use of the headline ''is directly adverse to
the commercial interests of the MTA, in that it is highly critical
of the MTA's performance and its current mass transit services.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This advertisement would discourage the use of the MTA's mass
transit services as well as negatively impact the morale of MTA
workers,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   The MTA changed its position after the New York Civil Liberties
Union filed the lawsuit on behalf of the mass transit advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was censorship pure and simple,'' NYCLU Executive
Director Norman Siegel said after the MTA agreed to let the ad run.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Leaves Haiti  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Six years after U.S. troops landed
in Haiti hoping to shore up democracy and promote stability, the
international force that followed is leaving the island much as it
was found: in a state of political crisis, crushing poverty and
deep uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Long-delayed elections to replace the Parliament that President
Rene Preval dissolved a year ago have once again been postponed. A
spate of attacks on election offices have sharpened doubts about
the police's ability to fight increasing street violence. And many
Haitians say they've lost all faith in the government.
</P>
<P>
   The remnants of a U.N. force deployed in 1995 flew home this
week, leaving Haiti's security in the hands of local authorities --
which a recent U.S. State Department report describe as ''an
immature force that is still grappling with problems of corruption
and human rights abusers,'' as well as narcotics traffickers ''at
all levels of the force.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent 20,000 American troops to Haiti in 1994
to oust the country's military dictatorship after thousands of
Haitians risked their lives in rickety boats to flee the Caribbean
island and reach U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
   The operation restored President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the
first democratically elected leader since the founding of the
Haitian republic in 1804.
</P>
<P>
   The United States passed the peacekeeping baton to the United
Nations in 1995. Three years later, the U.N. mission had been
reduced mainly to a training operation for Haiti's police force,
which replaced the disbanded army. Some U.S. troops continued a
humanitarian mission, which shut down in January.
</P>
<P>
   A new U.N. mission takes over this week to help organize
elections, continue police training and coordinate international
aid.
</P>
<P>
   But the elections remain uncertain, and the police training has
so far produced a force that seems incapable of handling the
escalating violence.
</P>
<P>
   Preval, Aristide's hand-picked successor, first called for new
elections in January 1999, after he dissolved Parliament in a
dispute with lawmakers over 1997 polls that opponents say he rigged
to pack the legislature with allies.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's electoral council has rescheduled the vote for a second
time. It's now set for April 9 and May 21 -- but Preval has
challenged the council's authority to set new dates.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say Preval is a dictator, since there is no parliament
and the courts are notoriously corrupt. They charge he is delaying
elections to ensure that Parliament is not installed by June 12, as
the constitution requires. If it is not, Preval can choose to
convene Parliament when -- and if -- he pleases, and limit the issues
it can address.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obvious that ... the Haitian people's right to vote has
been violated,'' said the outgoing U.N. civilian mission director,
Argentine jurist Rodolfo Matarollo.
</P>
<P>
   Preval claims the delays are logistical, and insists the date is
secondary to assuring ''serious'' elections.
</P>
<P>
   The premier that Preval appointed by decree, Jacques-Edouard
Alexis, said there would be only 3,500 officers to protect up to
12,000 voting stations in the elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are problems and we can't get a consensus on the
problems, I guarantee you the police won't be able to ensure
order,'' he conceded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Haiti's continued instability has prompted nagging questions
about whether the international effort and expense have been
worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   The latest U.N. mission, expected to last a year, will cost $24
million, but the United Nations has only $9.7 million. The rest
must come from voluntary contributions. So far, only Canada has
promised $3.5 million. U.S. officials said the Clinton
administration is working with Congress to make a timely
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a report last month
that the U.N. missions ''have brought the people and the Haitian
government the stability that is necessary during a period of
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Haitians say they no longer have confidence in their
national institutions.
</P>
<P>
   A November survey by U.S. officials who interviewed 1,502
Haitians nationwide reported that 70 percent believed their country
was ''heading in the wrong direction.'' Forty-seven percent said
their family's financial situation was worse than before the U.S.
invasion, and 44 percent felt more insecure.
</P>
<P>
   And 70 percent had given serious thought to leaving Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time since 90 percent of Haitians voted for
Aristide in 1990, millions are expressing the desire to vote -- a
desire that does not bode well for those in power. Preval was
elected by less than 5 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
   By February, some 3 million voters had registered and more than
1 million more were trying to register. But $1.2 million worth of
registration materials have been stolen, many of the 4,000
registration offices have not opened and training has barely begun
for electoral workers.

<HEADLINE> Bank Scandal in Mexico Election  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN RICE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A Mexican congresswoman says public funds
helped bail out relatives of the two top candidates for president,
putting an old controversy over a nearly $100 billion bank rescue
into the center of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In broadcast interviews Thursday and Friday, Dolores Padierna of
the leftist Democratic Revolution Party said there was evidence
that a program to rescue Mexico's banking system covered part of
the debts of the brothers of Francisco Labastida of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and Vicente Fox of the
center-right National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Padierna also released a long list of other wealthy business
figures who she said have had massive debts covered with taxpayers'
money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the debtors helped by the program were victims of the
1995 crisis that saw variable-rate interest loans soar to above 100
percent as the peso rapidly sank, she told the Televisa network on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But ''a few we have selected are linked to power, are part of
great economic groups who have been enriched by taking credits and
then not paying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank bailout has been a political volcano, erupting
periodically in a congress that in 1997 had opposition parties
outnumber PRI deputies for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has been fed by government refusals to name most
of the companies with loans in the program, as well as by a series
of scandals revealing that some government-rescued banks had made
massive loans to companies owned by their top officers or their
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls before the July 2000 presidential election show
Labastida and Fox far ahead of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who is from
Padierna's Democratic Revolution Party.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida earlier said Fox's family had been aided by the
bailout.
</P>
<P>
   Padierna charged on Friday that one of Labastida's brothers, as
well, had been helped by the program and said several members of
his campaign team were listed as still having outstanding debts.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference in eastern Mexico, Labastida did not flatly
deny the allegation, but said, ''At this time, that and any other
topic will be used as a means to justify political attacks, many of
them sadly not well justified.''
</P>
<P>
   Padierna said her staff had assembled a list of names and debts
by cross-referencing several official reports and an outside audit.
</P>
<P>
   National Action's congressional leader, Carlos Medina
Plascencia, accused Padierna of ''very grave irresponsibility'' and
said she had gotten some of her data -- including allegations
involving him -- wrong. Padierna accused Medina of being part owner
of a family company that benefitted from the program.
</P>
<P>
   The government has argued that providing names would violate
banking secrecy laws. But Medina said he would favor releasing
names on a now-confidential list of irregular or illegal loans.
</P>
<P>
   National Action spokesman Abel Vicencio admitted that some
members of the party had seen their debts restructured under the
program, but said they were among many thousands of Mexicans who
also had been helped after being caught in the 1995 crisis.

<HEADLINE> Hearst Sells Examiner Newspaper  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WARREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It looks like San Francisco will keep its
two major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. sold the San Francisco Examiner to the owners
of a free city newspaper on Friday, clearing the way for Hearst's
purchase of the San Francisco Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The two papers, longtime rivals, have a joint operating
agreement under which they have split profits for the last 35
years. Hearst last year announced its intention to buy the
Chronicle and merge the two daily papers if a buyer could not be
found for the afternoon Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   That had raised antitrust concerns, which are expected to be
satisfied with the sale of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our deal today is the fulfillment of a dream for my family,
for myself, for my late father,'' said Ted Fang, who will be the
publisher of the new Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Fang said he would switch the Examiner back to mornings when the
two papers become fully independent in August, after a four-month
transition period, and compete head-to-head with the Chronicle. He
also said the Examiner will be published six or seven times per
week and will not be free.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hearst nor Fang would disclose the sale price, or say
whether some profit-sharing agreement was part of the deal. Hearst,
which is buying the Chronicle for $660 million, said it would make
a ''substantial financial commitment to the continued publication
of the Examiner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle reported today that the purchase price was
''nominal'' and that Hearst would pay the new owners as much as $25
million a year for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is expected to close by March 30, but it will be
''business as usual'' for the next four months, Examiner Publisher
and CEO Tim White told a crowd of reporters and editors.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was mostly silent as the announcement was made. One
employee shouted, ''I'd like to see a show of hands of anyone who
wants to work at the new paper.'' No hands were raised.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 600 reporters and editors at the Chronicle and
Examiner, as well as employees of the San Francisco Newspaper
Agency, which oversees the joint operating agreement, will continue
working for the Hearst Corp. No employees will be required to work
for the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   The sale does not include the Examiner's building or printing
presses. Fang said he will secure new offices in downtown San
Francisco, and will either print the paper on the presses used by
his San Francisco Independent or secure more capacity elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also includes the Examiner's library, computer system,
delivery trucks and newsracks, as well as www.examiner.com, the
Sunday Examiner magazine and sponsorship of ''Bay to Breakers,'' a
race that draws tens of thousands of runners each May.
</P>
<P>
   But finding staffers able to compete against Hearst could be a
problem for Fang, whose Independent newspaper has been attacking
the Hearst Corp. for months, even running cartoons lampooning
Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein and his wife, actress
Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Bronstein said it was too early to tell how many current
Examiner newsroom employees would work for the Fang-owned Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea,'' Bronstein said. ''Not a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Fang said he would pay well for top talent, but he did not
intend to offer union contracts, as the Examiner does now.
</P>
<P>
   ''We plan to commence an aggressive search locally and
nationwide to put together a new staff for the new Examiner,'' he
said. ''We're looking for people who want to make history in this
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Fang said his father, John T.C. Fang, fled Communist China and
arrived in San Francisco with $200 in his pocket in the 1950s.
Along with his brothers James and Douglas, Ted Fang will now run
the nation's largest minority-owned daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second major newspaper deal announced this week. On
Monday, the Tribune Co., publisher of the Chicago Tribune,
announced it was acquiring the Times Mirror Co. and its flagship
Los Angeles Times in a $6.46 billion deal. The move would end 118
years of control of the Times by the Chandler family.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had been seeking a buyer for the Examiner since Aug. 6,
when it announced its purchase of the Chronicle, pre-empting any
potential bidders for its morning rival as well as the production
equipment the papers shared.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, responding to antitrust concerns from local, state and
federal officials, in January sweetened the deal for potential
buyers, abandoning efforts to sell only the newspaper's name and
subscriber list.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deal will preserve both of San Francisco's two daily
newspapers, and allow the city to continue its long tradition of
diversity of editorial voices,'' said the statement from ExIn LLC,
a new company affiliated with the Fang family.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst said the investment banker it hired to sell the Examiner,
Veronis Suhler &AMP; Associates of New York, had been in contact with
more than 90 prospective buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle, with a daily circulation of more than 456,000, is
the largest newspaper in Northern California and the second largest
on the West Coast. It was founded in 1865 by Charles and Michael de
Young and has been owned and operated over the succeeding 134 years
by their heirs.
</P>
<P>
   William Randolph Hearst founded what is today The Hearst Corp.
in 1887 when he assumed control of the Examiner. It has a daily
circulation of 107,000, according to recent figures from the Audit
Bureau of Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ExIn is owned by the Fang family, publishers of the Independent
and Asian Week newspapers. The Independent Newspaper Group of San
Francisco and San Mateo counties is the largest non-daily newspaper
group in California, with a circulation of 379,000.

<HEADLINE> UAB 80, No. 20 Oregon 79, OT  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Shaquetta Rhodes' putback with three seconds
left in overtime gave Alabama-Birmingham a thrilling 80-79 upset of
No. 20 Oregon in the first round of the NCAA tournament's West
Regional on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Deanna Jackson had 27 of her career-high 32 points in the first
half for the 11th-seeded Lady Blazers (20-12), but her teammates
came up with the heroics in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Holland's two free throws with 33 seconds left gave UAB a
78-76 lead, and Oregon responded with a 3-pointer from Jamie
Craighead to put the Ducks ahead 79-78 with 16.7 seconds left. But
the Ducks broke down defensively at the other end, letting Rhodes
get position underneath for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Brianne Meharry had 19 points and Shaquala Williams 17 to lead
the sixth-seeded Ducks (23-8), who were playing in their seventh
straight NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was sensational in the first half, hitting 10 of her 14
shots from all over the floor -- hooks, short jumpers, a 3-pointer
and back door layups on passes from the Blazers' guards, including
Jackson's older sister Lisa Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   On her final basket of the half, she got the ball in the high
post near the corner, turned and hit a 17-footer with six-tenths of
a second left to give UAB a 39-38 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon tried a zone defense against Jackson in the first half,
but the Ducks went back to man-to-man in the second, and Angelina
Wolvert guarded her better. Jackson didn't get off a shot until
hitting a layup with 6:19 to go that gave the Blazers a 61-58 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was just 2-of-9 from the field and 1-of-4 from the foul
line after halftime.
</P>
<P>
   A rebound basket by Wolvert put the Ducks ahead 70-68 with 22.3
seconds left in regulation. But she missed the free throw, and
Jackson followed her own miss at the other end with 5.7 seconds
left to send it to overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The upset was all the more impressive considering UAB was seeded
eighth in the Conference USA tournament but played its way into the
NCAA tournament by advancing to the title game, in which it lost to
Tulane.

<HEADLINE> Connecticut Wins Opener By 71  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   All-American Shea Ralph had 20 points and top-ranked
Connecticut
overpowered Hampton 116-45 Friday night in the NCAA East Regional
at Storrs, Conn., reaching triple digits for the eighth time this
season.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hampton (16-15) had trouble from the start running with the
stronger, faster and deeper Huskies (31-1), who matched a
tournament record for most points in a half with 65 in the first 20
minutes. The Lady Pirates had just one player taller than 6 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to beat us when we're playing really, really well,''
UConn coach Geno Auriemma said. ''The talent we have and Hampton
has is unfair. These games have a tendency to be one-sided. At
times, it's unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other East game at Storrs, Erin Batth scored 17 points
and had nine rebounds to lead Clemson over Drake 64-50.
</P>
<P>
   Poor shooting plagued both teams early in the game, but Drake
(23-7) also had trouble handling the ball and Clemson (19-11) took
advantage. The Tigers converted 15 turnovers into 14 points in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   In other subregionals:
East:
At Baton Rouge, La.:
Stephen F. Austin 73, Xavier 72:
</P>
<P>
   Lashinda Winters hit the game-winning shot with 8.5 seconds
remaining as Stephen F. Austin overcame a 68-56 deficit in the
final 5:50.
</P>
<P>
   Winters, a 5-foot-3 sophomore guard, came off the bench to score
15 points. None were bigger than her layup that bounced around the
rim several times before dropping through to give 11th-seeded
Stephen F. Austin (28-3) the victory and a second-round matchup
with LSU.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-point attempt by Nicole Levandusky, who had five 3-pointers
in the game, bounced off the back of the rim with 1.5 seconds
remaining for Xavier (26-5).
LSU 77, Liberty 54:
</P>
<P>
   Marie Ferdinand scored 22 points and LSU (23-6) broke from a
29-28 halftime lead. The Lady Tigers were ahead 34-32 with 18:42 to
play when April Brown, Katrina Hibbert and Ferdinand scored four
points each and DeTrina White added a basket in a 14-4 run that
sank Liberty (23-8).
Mideast:
At Charlottesville, Va.:
Boston College 93, Nebraska 76:
</P>
<P>
   Alissa Murphy scored a season-high 26 points and Brianne
Stepherson had 23 for Boston College (26-8), which next plays
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles led 52-38 at halftime and pulled away after Nebraska
(18-13) twice got within 10 early in the second half. Stepherson
had seven straight in a span of 68 seconds, turning a 12-point lead
into a runaway with 12 minutes left.
Virginia 74, Pepperdine 62:
</P>
<P>
   Renee Robinson scored her first nine points during a 14-4 run
midway through the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia (24-8), making its 17th consecutive appearance in the
tournament, got help from its crowd during the game-changing burst.
The Cavaliers are host to the first round for the 13th time in 15
years, but the first time in three years. Pepperdine (21-10) was
making its first appearance in the NCAA tournament in the 25-year
history of the program.
At South Bend, Ind.:
George Washington 79, UCLA 72:
</P>
<P>
   Elisa Aguilar scored 23 points and George Washington (26-5) held
off a rally by UCLA (17-11), which trailed by as many as 19 points
in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-seeded Bruins cut it to 52-43 on LaCresha Flannigan's
two free throws with 12:40 left and 62-60 on Janae Hubbard's two
free throws with 6:37 to go but got no closer.
Notre Dame 87, San Diego 61:
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Riley and Niele Ivey scored 14 points apiece for the Irish
(26-4), wearing green on St. Patrick's Day rather than their usual
gold home uniforms. Notre Dame saw an 18-point lead slip to single
digits in the first half after some sloppy play.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego (17-13) had no starter taller than 6 feet and couldn't
contend inside with Notre Dame's front court led by the 6-5 Riley.
Midwest:
At Ames, Iowa:
Illinois 73, Utah 58:
</P>
<P>
   Allison Curtin scored 22 points, Susan Blauser had 20 and each
converted a key three-point play for Illinois (23-10), which led by
22 before Utah (23-8) closed within seven.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois played outstanding defense in jumping to a 28-7 lead
and was ahead 56-34 early in the second half.
Iowa St. 92, St. Francis 63:
</P>
<P>
   Angie Welle scored 18 points and grabbed 14 rebounds, and Iowa
State set an NCAA Midwest Regional record by making 15 3-pointers.
Stacy Frese and Megan Taylor each added 17 points, Desiree Francis
had 16 and Lindsey Wilson 13 for the third-seeded Cyclones (26-5),
who won their eighth straight game and play sixth-seeded Illinois
on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Jess Zinobile, the nation's third-leading scorer, had 27 points
in a strong performance for 14th-seeded St. Francis (23-8).

No. 16 Auburn 78, SW Missouri St. 74:
</P>
<P>
   Lori Nero had 23 points and Tasha Hamilton 21 for Auburn (22-7),
which made 26 of 27 free throws.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Missouri (23-9) rallied from a 13-point deficit in the
final minutes, using a full-court press that gave Auburn fits. The
Bears got three steals, forced a traveling violation and hit eight
of 10 free throws to pull within 74-71 with 1:37 left.
Penn St. 83, Youngstown St. 63:
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Shepherd had 18 points, and Andrea Garner added 14 points
and four blocks for the Lady Lions (27-4). Helen Darling, selected
the nation's best small player earlier in the day, had eight
assists and 13 of Penn State's 51 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Majewski had 23 points for Youngstown State (22-9) and

</P>
<P>
   Jana Lichnerova added 14 points and 11 rebounds, and St. Joe's
matchup-zone defense that stifled the (21-13).
Rutgers 91, Holy Cross 70:
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers (23-7) withstood a first-half barrage from Anna Kinne
and then blew open the game with a 26-4 second-half run in beating
Holy Cross (23-7).

U.N. Mission Leaves Haiti
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Six years after U.S. troops landed in Haiti
hoping to shore up democracy and promote stability, the international force that
followed is leaving the island much as it was found: in a state of political
crisis, crushing poverty and deep uncertainty. The remnants of a U.N. force
deployed in 1995 flew home this week, leaving Haiti's security in the hands of
local authorities -- which a recent U.S. State Department report describe as
''an immature force that is still grappling with problems of corruption and
human rights abusers,'' as well as narcotics traffickers ''at all levels of the
force.''

Mozambique Food Shortages Feared

   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- With planting season two weeks away, thousands of

a U.N. agricultural expert said. Monthlong flooding has already killed 492
people and driven 360,000 from their homes. Now water-soaked soil and a shortage
of seed could stall the planting of beans and maize -- staple crops in this
nation of mainly subsistence farmers.

Taiwanese Vote for New President

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese could shake the delicate status quo that has
preserved peace between China and Taiwan in a vote Saturday that will give them
an untested leader facing growing pressure to negotiate with a bellicose
Beijing. The race to succeed President Lee Teng-hui was too close to call as the
three top candidates wrapped up their campaigns Friday night to the sounds of
blaring air horns, fireworks and deafening applause. But there was a very real
possibility the ruling Nationalist Party could lose the presidency for the first
time since Taiwan was separated politically from China when communist forces
captured the mainland in 1949.

Clinton Urges More Oil Production

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Optimistic that oil exporters will increase production
later this month, President Clinton nevertheless plans some ''modest'' measures
aimed at helping to ease the impact of high fuel prices. The proposals, which
Clinton plans to unveil in his weekly radio address Saturday, would not include
any freeing of oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as many
lawmakers have sought, White House officials said. Instead, they said, he would
announce ''a modest package of proposals ... to help Americans who've suffered
some hardship'' by the rising oil prices.

have,'' Buchanan said Friday. ''The allegiance to the two parties is smaller
than it's ever been. The willingness to take a look at a third party is greater
than it's ever been.'' During an hour-long interview with The Associated Press,
Buchanan predicted his candidacy would ''re-shape'' Ross Perot's factionalized
Reform Party into an anti-abortion, anti-trade, anti-establishment voting bloc.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Statues Go AWOL  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- The Oscar drama has started awfully
early.
</P>
<P>
   Academy Awards officials on Friday said a shipment of Oscars
bound for next weekend's ceremony had gone AWOL -- the latest
embarrassment for the Academy, which had to scramble to send new
voting forms after 4,000 ballots got lost in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   The 55 statues vanished last week and are presumed stolen, said
Bruce Davis, executive director of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think everybody should watch the entire Oscar show to see
if we have enough on hand to get through the end of the show,''
Davis wisecracked, adding that the Academy might hand out a
''really nicely engraved I.O.U.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Academy has about 20 Oscars in storage, and
manufacturer R.S. Owens Co. of Chicago is busy making replacements.
Oscar officials expect to have those delivered early next week,
though the Academy is ''going to be a little coy about that, just
in case there is an Oscar gang out there,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The statues were reported missing March 10 from a Roadway
Express loading dock in Bell.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same Los Angeles-area community where 4,000 Oscar
ballots were misplaced at a post office earlier this month. The
ballots were eventually found, but the Academy had already printed
new ones and extended the voting deadline by two days, to next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As things turned curiouser and curiouser over the stolen
statues, Academy spokesman John Pavlik said he expects Oscar host
Billy Crystal will have a field day over the missing statues and
ballots during the March 26 show.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've told Billy Crystal not to go anywhere near Bell,
California, in the next couple of weeks,'' Davis said. ''It seems
to be a Bermuda Triangle for Oscar things.''
</P>
<P>
   Roadway Express, which shipped the statues from Chicago, had no
comment. Roadway has put up a $50,000 reward to help recover the
statues, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles and Bell police, along with FBI art-theft experts,
are investigating, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The 55 statues represented enough Oscars to give to all of the
winners on Academy Award night. But the exact number of statues
needed isn't known until the big night because some nominations go
to more than one person. For example, two people might win for
collaborating on a screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The statues were packed in 10 boxes, all encased in shrink-wrap
on a pallet. At 8{ pounds each, the gold-plated statues would have
weighed about 470 pounds, meaning whoever stole them would have
needed a forklift and a truck, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturing cost of the statues was about $18,000, though
Davis said they have far greater intrinsic value. He said it would
be difficult for anyone to fence a stolen Oscar, but ''we don't
like having 55 Oscars floating out in collector circles.''
</P>
<P>
   The statues were not engraved, since the Academy does not know
the winners until the envelopes are opened awards night. The boxes
were unmarked and Davis said he suspects whoever took them did not
know what the cartons contained.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the missing ballots and statues, the Academy has dealt
with reports that The Wall Street Journal was polling Oscar voters
to get a jump on the winners and a Web site that claimed to have a
short list of potential nominees the day before the nominations
were announced last month. The Web site's claim turned out to be
false.
</P>
<P>
   All the odd publicity may boost ratings for the Oscar telecast,
which slipped 18 percent last year. It was the second-lowest rated
Oscar telecast since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Study: Sperm Counts Not Declining  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The virility of American men hasn't changed
much in the last four decades, according to a new study that says
they produce just as many sperm as their grandfathers did.
</P>
<P>
   The study disputes other research suggesting tight underwear,
pollution and bicycle seats might threaten sperm counts.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers collected semen from 1,385 men who were seeking
fertility treatment with their partners at Los Angeles County USC
Medical Center between 1994 and 1997. Sperm concentrations were
compared with those reported in a 1951 study.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shouldn't be alarmed,'' said Dr. Rebecca Sokol, a study
co-author and professor at the University of Southern California's
Keck School of Medicine. ''I don't think our sperm counts are
declining or changing.''
</P>
<P>
   The study is the latest of several published in recent years
that alternately show today's men are more, less or just as potent
as their grandfathers. Some experts say it points to the need for
wider studies with standardized counts of the squiggling gametes.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are as many studies showing sperm counts are declining
as there are showing they're not declining,'' said Dr. Larry
Lipshultz, a urologist at Baylor College of Medicine. ''You're
adding another to the column that shows they're not declining.''
</P>
<P>
   The USC research published in the March issue of the journal
Fertility and Sterility found 18 percent of men had sperm
concentrations of less than 20 million per milliliter of semen.
That compares with 17 percent of men studied in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Similar results were found over the entire range of sperm
concentrations.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research that culled sperm count data from older
studies concluded that sperm production is declining. Just as many
studies indicate sperm counts are stable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very difficult to compare sperm counts from one
laboratory to the other,'' said Dr. Harry Fisch, a urology
professor at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. ''That's why the
emphasis now and in the future will be to standardize how we do
semen analysis so we can have a long-ranging understanding of
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Future studies also should look for fluctuations over long
periods of time in specific geographic regions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, the reality is there is no evidence of a worldwide
decline in sperm counts,'' Fisch said.
</P>
<P>
   The USC results, however, were surprising because the subjects
had been seeking treatment for infertility with their partners -- a
factor that could have biased the results toward a decline in
sperm.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Shows NATO Plane Parts  </HEADLINE>
By KATARINA KRATOVAC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The battered black wing of a NATO
F-117A stealth fighter vies for space with a brightly polished
Tomahawk missile. A high-tech trade fair? Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   This unique collection of war memorabilia is the prized exhibit
in the Yugoslav army's airspace museum. On Friday, the museum
director unveiled several new pieces to mark the March 24
anniversary of NATO's air bombardment of this Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new pieces were the very first Tomahawk missile shot
down by the Yugoslav air defense the day the campaign began, and a
highly sophisticated AGM 154, which when dropped from an aircraft
releases cluster bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,500 NATO artifacts collected or donated from across the
country take up half the ground floor of the three-story domed
building.
</P>
<P>
   Museum Director Cedomir Janjic said more pieces were being
polished and prepared for the exhibit -- in a new wing to be
dedicated to the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is truly amazing how many aircraft and drones were downed
with the relatively modest and primitive equipment'' of the
Yugoslav army, Minister for Science and Development Cedomir
Mirkovic said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   NATO launched the 78-day airstrike campaign to halt President
Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown against Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Among the museum's prize possessions are the wreckage of the
U.S. Air Force F-117 stealth fighter shot down near Belgrade three
days into the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Guarded under protective glass are the plane's fuselage -- its
left side painted with a U.S. star -- part of the main landing gear,
the ejection seat, the rear of the cockpit and an electro-optical
navigation assembly with units that find and identify targets.
Clearly marked tags and accompanying photos identified the pieces
and explained how Yugoslav forces shot it down.
</P>
<P>
   The downing of the F-117A was the first known loss of a stealth
aircraft in combat. The pilot ejected and was later rescued by U.S.
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the stealth lay the remains of an F-16 fighter like a
giant bird's wing. It was hit by an SA-3 surface-to-air missile.
Its tailpiece, chipped and charred around the edges, still
brandished a huge white painted Night Hawk.
</P>
<P>
   Mirkovic refuted Western claims that Yugoslav air defense downed
only the two planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We shall prove we have more,'' he said, without elaborating.
During the bombing, the then-chief of the Yugoslav army, Gen.
Dragoljub Ojdanic, claimed 61 NATO aircraft had been downed.
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away, a Predator drone hung suspended from the
ceiling like a large model plane. It was one of seven pilotless
NATO drones on display. Six more had yet to be recovered from
unexplored sites, Janjic said.
</P>
<P>
   In total, Mirkovic said, the Yugoslavs downed more than 230
Tomahawks.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav air force assets were seriously crippled during the
bombing campaign, including its MiG-29 fighters. NATO claimed up to
a dozen -- half of the air force.

<HEADLINE> DA: DiCaprio's Stepbrother Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) --Leonardo DiCaprio's stepbrother was released
from jail Friday night pending further investigation of allegations
that he attempted to kill his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Farrar, 28, was arrested this week for investigation of
attempted murder and making terrorist threats. He was held in lieu
of $1 million bail until his release.
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office,
said authorities had new information that had to be investigated
before any decision on filing charges can be made. She would not
say what the new information was.
</P>
<P>
   Under law, if no charges are filed within 48 hours of an arrest,
a person must be released.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is still under investigation,'' Gibbons said. ''We
should have a filing decision by next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's deputies were called to the Marina del Rey home of
Farrar's girlfriend on Wednesday. The woman, whose name was not
released, did not require medical aid and other details were
withheld.
</P>
<P>
   DiCaprio's father is Farrar's stepfather, and the actor and
Farrar grew up together.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Jaffe, a spokesman for the Farrar family, said Friday the
family had no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Farrar is a free man and is with his family,'' Jaffe said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwanese Vote for New President  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwanese could shake the delicate status
quo that has preserved peace between China and Taiwan in a vote
Saturday that will give them an untested leader facing growing
pressure to negotiate with a bellicose Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The race to succeed President Lee Teng-hui was too close to call
as the three top candidates wrapped up their campaigns Friday night
to the sounds of blaring air horns, fireworks and deafening
applause.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a very real possibility the ruling Nationalist
Party could lose the presidency for the first time since Taiwan was
separated politically from China when communist forces captured the
mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   When the polls opened, the retiring Lee was among the first of
Taiwan's 15 million eligible voters to cast his ballot. People
began lining up early for the election, which was expected to
attract a large turnout. The polls closed Saturday without
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Under overcast skies, Lee's chosen successor, Vice President
Lien Chan, told reporters at a Taipei poll that he was confident of
a win.
</P>
<P>
   ''The weather is very good. The election turnout should be
great,'' Lien said.
</P>
<P>
   After voting at a Taipei elementary school, Chen Shui-bian of
the opposition Democratic Progressive Party told reporters that he
would immediately pursue talks with Chinese leaders, who have made
it clear they dislike him.
</P>
<P>
   ''Permanent peace in the Taiwan Strait is going to be our
biggest goal,'' Chen said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Taipei suburb of Yungho, Liao Shu-chih, an electronic
spare parts dealer, said Saturday that the vote was a difficult
choice and he pondered until Friday night about whom to vote for.
He wouldn't say what his decision was.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe any of the candidates would provoke China,''
Liao said, ''but the decision to use force is China's, not ours.''
</P>
<P>
   With a hoarse, raspy voice, Chen had campaigned close to
midnight Friday, addressing a rally of about 400,000 supporters in
Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the most important time for the democratic movement
and isn't it the most beautiful time indeed?'' said Chen, whose DPP
party has ruffled Beijing by advocating independence for the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has had to back off from his party's independence stance to
stand a chance at the polls, saying he would declare independence
only if China attacks. But in remarks clearly aimed at Chen,
Beijing has loudly warned any such step would lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   Chen saw his potential opening when the Nationalists split,
kicking out party star James Soong after he mounted an independent
candidacy instead of supporting Lien.
</P>
<P>
   The three top candidates were in a statistical dead heat last
week when a government ban on releasing poll results went into
effect. But as the race wound down, Chen built momentum and picked
up key endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Chen took pains to show he, too, will try to deal with China
rather than lead Taiwan and China into a war that analysts say
neither side can really afford as their economies become more
closely intertwined.
</P>
<P>
   Bi-khim Hsiao, a Chen spokeswoman, said that Chinese
individuals, whom she would not identify, had been meeting with
party officials recently, preparing for a possible Chen victory.
Some seemed genuinely interested in the party's views, while others
simply delivered anti-independence lectures, Hsiao said.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Taiwan's second direct presidential election will
replace Lee, who during 12 years in office has often been an
irritant to Beijing but became more so last summer on his
insistence the two sides deal with one another on a
''state-to-state'' basis.
</P>
<P>
   China views Taiwan as a renegade province that must someday
reunify with the mainland, by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji sought to sway Taiwanese
voters by indicating that if they pick Chen, Taiwan could find
itself on the brink of war.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu's language was harsh, but nothing like Beijing's response to
Taiwan's 1996 election, when China fired nuclear-capable missiles
near the island's two major ports. The United States sent in
warships to cool tensions.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalists also sought to portray Chen, a former Taipei
mayor, as an unstable threat to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Using Chen's nickname, Lee warned some 80,000 supporters Friday
night: ''Abian has no experience. You can't depend on him. He's too
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The divided Nationalists fielded a lackluster candidate in Lien,
a long-serving politician and academic who had problems developing
rapport with many ordinary Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing wants Taiwan to rejoin the motherland under a so-called
''one country, two systems,'' model China used as it reclaimed
financial center Hong Kong from Britain in 1997 and the gambling
enclave of Macau from Portugal last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington has hinted it would defend Taiwan from a
Chinese attack, the United States recognizes Beijing as the
legitimate government of China and says it wants peaceful
reunification achieved through negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday in Tokyo that
both sides should end their ''war of words'' that often has
threatened to destabilize Asia.

By CHAD ROEDEMEIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- For more than 20 years, the former black militant
known as H. Rap Brown has lived here as Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, a
Muslim leader known as a pillar of his community.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of his neighborhood find it difficult to believe that
Al-Amin shot two sheriff's deputies who had come to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin is the subject of a manhunt, charged with murder in the
death of one Fulton County deputy and aggravated battery in the
wounding of the other during a gunfight Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Kinchen, 35, died Friday afternoon. Aldranon English, 28,
shot in the chest, arms and legs, was listed in stable condition.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Al-Amin was also wounded. Officers followed
a trail of blood to a vacant house around the corner, but did not
find him.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan Abdullah, on his way to a nearby mosque Friday, called the
idea of Al-Amin shooting anyone ''preposterous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's like a senator, like a politician in the community,
except he's not been elected,'' Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Muslim neighbors said the former activist worked hard to
keep drugs out of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what I knew about him, he's helped clean up the
neighborhood and helped people in general,'' said Ronald Mathis,
who lives nearby. ''I just don't believe he's the shooter.''
</P>
<P>
   Known in the 1960s as H. Rap Brown, Al-Amin was chairman of the
Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee and justice minister of
the Black Panthers. He called on blacks to arm themselves, once
saying, ''Violence is as American as cherry pie.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Al-Amin, 56, was known more for his religious
beliefs and efforts to improve the lives of Atlanta's West End
neighborhood than his violent past. He came to Atlanta in 1976
after converting to Islam while serving five years in prison for
his role in a robbery that ended in a shootout with New York
police.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did a 180-degree turn on that. He was the epitome of the
peace of Islam,'' said Wendell Muhammad, a Nation of Islam
spokesman who has spent time in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Kinchen and English did not know that Al-Amin was a former Black
Panther when they tried to serve the arrest warrant at a store he
owned, Fulton County Sheriff Jacquelyn Barrett said.
</P>
<P>
   The warrant was issued after Al-Amin failed to appear in Cobb
County court in January on charges of theft by receiving stolen
property, impersonating an officer and having no proof of
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin allegedly was stopped in a stolen car last May and
flashed a badge in an attempt to convince the officer that he also
was a policeman, court documents say.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys Launch Controlled Book Tour  </HEADLINE>
By SANDY SHORE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- An unexplained palm print. A length of white cord.
A mysterious footprint next to JonBenet Ramsey's body.
</P>
<P>
   All are among the evidence pointing to the possibility that an
intruder killed the 6-year-old girl, parents John and Patsy Ramsey
write in a new book, ''The Death of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Patsy and I know one thing for certain: this deranged
assailant of children walks among us, for the moment, undetected by
authorities,'' John Ramsey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Their book hit the shelves Friday as the Ramseys began a
carefully orchestrated book tour, granting six interviews with
local and national media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Rolf Zettersten of Thomas-Nelson Publishers, which published the
book, said the Ramseys let him decide which interviews to grant.
They were not accompanied by attorneys and they answered every
question, he said.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the family's Boulder
home on Dec. 26, 1996. A grand jury disbanded in October after
investigating the case for 13 months. No charges were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said the Ramseys are under suspicion, and the
parents have steadfastly maintained their innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book outlines events and evidence made public
previously.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys cite seven pieces of evidence they say point to an
intruder as JonBenet's killer, including the palm print on the door
to the room where her body was found; unidentified DNA under the
girl's fingernails; and an unmatched boot print found near her
body.
</P>
<P>
   They note that police did not find the source of the white cord
that was wrapped around the girl's neck or the duct tape that
covered her mouth.
</P>
<P>
   They also refer to a theory by retired Colorado Springs Police
Detective Lou Smit that a stun gun was used on the girl. Smit was a
prosecution consultant for 18 months before resigning in 1998,
contending the Ramseys were innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys also identify several people in the book they
believe could be suspects, but police say all of them have been
cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ''This book is a statement by people who have not been excluded
from the investigation,'' District Attorney Alex Hunter said Friday
through a spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Mark Beckner estimated police spent half their time
looking at suspects outside the family.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have some questions we are trying to answer. We've
outlined what needs to be done and we're staying on course,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> 'Boys Don't Cry' Opens in Neb. Town  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL ROONEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALLS CITY, Neb. (AP) -- So far, the reviews have a common theme:
The Falls City portrayed in the Oscar-nominated ''Boys Don't Cry''
doesn't look at all like the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   The critically acclaimed movie about Teena Brandon opened here
Friday. Nearly everyone in this southern Nebraska farm town knows
the story of Brandon, a woman who posed as a man, dated a woman and
then was killed by two men after they learned her true identity.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Ernst manages River Twin Cinema, which sits across the
street from the courthouse where a jury convicted Brandon's
killers.
</P>
<P>
   Ernst expected large crowds for the film's opening at the
220-seat theater that sits along one of the city's narrow, brick
streets, but the theater was only half full at Friday's showing.
Ernst anticipated larger crowds today.
</P>
<P>
   After previewing the movie Thursday with her staff, Ernst said
she did not know how the community would respond to the movie's
lesbian love scenes and a portrayal of Falls City with most
characters depicted as drunks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing like the town that's in the movie,'' Ernst said.
</P>
<P>
   After watching the film on Friday, resident Jared Kirkendal
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not Falls City,'' he said. ''It's weird they made it
more of a love story than a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Boys Don't Cry'' opened nationwide in November, but did not
reach Nebraska screens until last month, when it opened at
multiplex theaters in Omaha, the state's largest city. Area theater
managers shied away from the film until actress Hilary Swank won
the Golden Globe Award for her portrayal of Brandon.
</P>
<P>
   Swank is nominated for the best actress Academy Award to be
presented March 26. Chloe Sevigny, who played Brandon's girlfriend,
Lana Tisdel, is up for the best supporting actress award.
</P>
<P>
   It has been six years since Brandon was murdered in a farmhouse
near Humboldt, about 20 miles west of Falls City. Her friends, Lisa
Lambert, 24, and Philip DeVine, 22, also were killed because they
witnessed Brandon's death.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon, who used the alias Brandon Teena, was a 21-year-old
woman who ran around the Falls City area with a rough crowd,
including her killers, John Lotter and Marvin Nissen.
</P>
<P>
   Her death came after she told police that the men raped her when
they learned of her true identity and were upset that she had dated
their female friend, Tisdel.
</P>
<P>
   Lotter is on death row awaiting execution. Nissen is serving a
life prison sentence after agreeing to testify against Lotter.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Nissen was among the 110 people at Friday's premiere. The
18-year-old high school student is a cousin to Nissen, who also
goes by Tom.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what I understand, and from what Tom's told me, the movie
is wrong,'' she said after seeing the film. ''There's none of it
that's right. It was just weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Tisdel, who still lives in Falls City, has sued the film's
makers. She claims the movie makes references to her as ''lazy,
white trash and a skanky snake,'' and depicts her as a lesbian and
constantly under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also falsely portrays Tisdel as falling asleep at the
murder scene and ''doing nothing about it after it has occurred,''
according to Tisdel's lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Police reports indicate that Tisdel was not at the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Peirce, writer-director of ''Boys Don't Cry,'' has said
she took dramatic liberties with Brandon's case in portraying it on
the big screen.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Air Mechanics Allege Pressure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines has put a top manager on leave
while it investigates claims by Seattle mechanics that they were
''pressured, threatened and intimidated'' to cut corners on
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Alaska Airlines said it would immediately ground
any planes found to be potentially unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   The airline said it had also notified federal prosecutors and
the National Transportation Safety Board, which is probing the Jan.
31 crash of Alaska Flight 261 off the California coast in which 88
people died.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints from the 64 mechanics were contained in a letter
delivered to the airline on Thursday and quoted this week by The
Seattle Times.
</P>
<P>
   A draft of the letter said workers were directed to do things
''specifically contradicting'' federal aviation regulations, and
alleged they had been ''pressured, threatened and intimidated ...
in the daily performance of our work.''
</P>
<P>
   During a recent repair on an MD-80 -- the same type of plane as
Flight 261 -- mechanics said there told not to replace worn parts.
</P>
<P>
   The airline and Federal Aviation Administration officials have
begun interviewing the mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said this week that most major components
of Flight 261's tail section have been recovered. He also said
investigators had found no grease on a crucial portion of the
jackscrew that helped control the movement of the jet's horizontal
tail stabilizer, long a focus of the crash probe.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the plane's manufacturer said the part normally
should be lubricated, but he refused to speculate about what the
NTSB finding might mean.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported that the mechanics' letter was triggered by
concerns over a recent repair to the horizontal stabilizer and
jackscrew assembly on an MD-80 jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics allege the plane was fixed properly only after
heated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said the agency was aware there had
been recent ''debate'' at Alaska Airlines over a horizontal
stabilizer repair. He said the plane was returned to service in
proper condition.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Falla, the leader of the airline's Seattle maintenance
base, was placed on administrative leave, the airline said. He
could not be reached by telephone, but his lawyer predicted he
would be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''Robert Falla has never knowingly allowed any aircraft to go
into service that was not airworthy or (that) failed any safety
standard,'' said a statement from his lawyer, Scott Engelhard.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is already the subject of a criminal investigation
over alleged maintenance violations at its Oakland, Calif.,
maintenance base.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury in San Francisco is investigating whether
supervisors signed for repairs that weren't done or that they
weren't authorized to approve.

<HEADLINE> New Charges for Border Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prosecutors plan to rewrite an indictment to add
charges against a man accused of aiding a plan to smuggle
explosives into the the United States from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney David Kelley did not describe the nature
of the new charges against Abdel Ghani Meskini, 31, of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini pleaded innocent in January to charges of providing and
concealing support for Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian national accused
of trying to sneak explosives into the United States just before
the New Year.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley told U.S. District Judge John F. Keenan on Friday that
the new charges would stem from evidence already collected in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Meskini has been held without bail since his December arrest in
Brooklyn. No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam was arrested Dec. 14 after allegedly trying to smuggle
timing devices and a powerful demolition explosive into Washington
from Canada. The arrest came amid heightened security aimed at
making sure terrorism did not mar millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Ressam, who has pleaded innocent to nine charges including
possessing and transporting explosives with the intent to cause
damage or injury, had Meskini's phone number in his pocket when he
was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Another alleged accomplice, Mokhtar Haouari, 31, remains in
Montreal as the United States seeks to extradite him to be tried in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment against Haouari and Meskini accuses them of
conspiring since October 1997 to support members and associates of
a terrorist group. Haouari allegedly provided various forged
identification documents while Meskini went to Seattle to assist
Ressam.

<HEADLINE> Cop who shot unarmed man put on desk duty  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The undercover narcotics officer who killed an
unarmed black man during a buy-and-bust operation in midtown
Manhattan has been stripped of his gun and badge amid a grand jury
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Detective Anthony Vasquez, will remain on desk duty
pending the outcome of the probe of the shooting of Patrick
Dorismond, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond's family joined the Rev. Al Sharpton and other black
activists in calling on federal authorities to investigate the
incident, which followed last month's acquittal of four officers in
the killing of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo and the fatal
police shooting of another unarmed black man a week later. They
also accused officials of demonizing the victim by releasing his
record of petty crime.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody killed my son!'' Marie Dorismond, a Haitian
immigrant, wailed during a news conference outside her Brooklyn
apartment building. ''My son was never a criminal. ... What is this
lie?''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he had asked Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch
to meet with him on Monday; Lynch declined comment. A spokesman for
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said she would be monitoring
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton also criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for urging the
news media ''not to jump to conclusions'' about the officer's
conduct. ''He ought to tell the police to stop jumping to
conclusions,'' Sharpton said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, appearing at the St. Patrick's Day parade, and police
officials refused to discuss the shooting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was killed shortly after midnight Thursday during a
struggle with undercover officers on Eighth Avenue near West 37th
Street. Police sources said Dorismond, 26, an off-duty security
guard, grew angry when one of the officers approached and asked if
he and another man knew where he could buy marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the two men attacked the undercover officer,
prompting Vasquez and another back-up officer to move in. During
the ensuing scuffle, Vasquez's pistol somehow went off, and a
bullet hit Dorismond in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Karasyk, a lawyer for Vasquez, said the gun discharged
accidentally after Dorismond punched Vasquez, ignored shouts of
''Police!'' and grabbed the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that hadn't happened, the gun wouldn't have discharged,''
Karasyk told The New York Times. ''He made contact with the gun.
The guy is grabbing the gun and the gun goes off,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Thursday what sparked the deadly confrontation,
Police Commissioner Howard Safir responded in part by reciting
Dorismond's arrest history: as a teen-ager for robbery and assault;
in 1993 for attempted robbery and assault; and in 1996 for criminal
possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials and prosecutors said Friday that the 1993 and
1996 charges were all misdemeanors. In both cases, Dorismond was
allowed to plead guilty to disorderly conduct and perform community
service. The earlier juvenile case was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The National Coalition for Haitian Rights called on Safir to
apologize to Dorismond's family and the city's Haitian community.
''We are outraged that Mr. Safir stooped to using character
assassination as the first line of defense to explain away the
senseless killing,'' the group said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   At his mother's home on Friday, the victim was remembered as a
devoted father of two daughters, ages 5 and 1, a lover of reggae
music and someone who spoke of one day becoming a police officer.
Mourners had erected a makeshift shrine in the lobby with candles,
flowers and tributes scribbled on notebook paper. ''God bless you
Patrick,'' one read.
</P>
<P>
   The family is ''upset right now and there's no explanation,''
said Kena Smith, 23, aunt of Dorismond's youngest child. For the
girls, she added, ''We're going to have to be the father now
because of some stupid cop.''

Man pleads guilty to murdering two women
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. (AP) -- An unemployed 21-year-old man has
admitted murdering two widows in a case that spread fear among
senior citizens in this small community and stymied investigators
for months.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Umber pleaded guilty Friday in an arrangement with
Schenectady County Court Judge Michael Eidens, under which Eiden's
prison sentence will be capped at two consecutive 20-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   Matilda DiMaria Montenaro, 84, and her sister-in-law, Lois
DiMaria, 81, were found dead Dec. 16, 1998 in different rooms of
the city house they shared. A fire was set after the slayings, and
investigators discovered the women's bodies while responding to an
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   After the murders, upset community leaders and average citizens
raised a reward of $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Umber, later jailed on unrelated harassment and burglary
charges, became a suspect last August when he allegedly bragged to
another inmate about the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the murder charges, Umber was accused of arson for
allegedly starting the blaze in the women's home by blowing out a
pilot light on a gas stove and placing a lit candle on a table.
</P>
<P>
   The Schenectady Police Department and Schenectady County
District Attorney now say they will continue investigating, and
will look to see what information Umber might offer about his
co-defendant George Johnson, and any other alleged accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   Umber's sentencing is scheduled for May 12.

<HEADLINE> Another Bidder Might Seek Rover  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- The door is open for other bidders to
take over Rover's passenger car business, Britain's trade secretary
said Saturday, suggesting that the government might welcome such a
bid.
</P>
<P>
   BMW has announced that it will sell the Land Rover division to
Ford Motor Co. for $2.91 billion, while British investment group
Alchemy Partners Ltd. has agreed to take over the MG and Rover
passenger cars.
</P>
<P>
   Trade and Industry Secretary Stephen Byers, speaking before a
meeting of a government task force on Rover, said there are many
unanswered questions about Alchemy Partners' intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Alchemy has indicated that there will be layoffs at Rover's
Longbridge Assembly plant, which now employs about 8,000 people,
but has given no details.
</P>
<P>
   ''Alchemy Partners have six weeks to finalize their deal. In the
interim, there is nothing to stop someone coming along and putting
in a new offer with BMW,'' Byers said. ''BMW have told me they
would not reject alternative bids coming from other car
manufacturers.''
</P>
<P>
   Byers said one of the problems is that Alchemy has not said what
it intends to do with the Longbridge assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are prepared to commit themselves to a high volume
factory for car production then we would welcome that, but they
have left so many questions unanswered that we can't say today with
any confidence that they offer a long term future for Longbridge,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   By selling off the Rover Group piecemeal, BMW will effectively
wipe out a brand whose history mirrors the long decline of heavy
industry in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Rover is known in the United States mostly for its Discovery and
Range Rover sports utility vehicles. Another Rover brand, the MG
sports car, is no longer sold in the United States. Rover cars have
a much stronger reputation in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Frets About INS Raid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A U.S. Census official expressed dismay after
federal authorities conducted a raid and apprehended 140 suspected
undocumented immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Adolfo Echeveste, manager of the Census 2000 office for eastern
metro Phoenix, said the raid at a house Thursday in Mesa, Ariz.,
could interfere with efforts to count people who may already fear
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The timing of it was most unfortunate,'' Echeveste said in an
interview with KTAR-AM. ''We in the federal government have been
spending millions upon millions of dollars to point out that
everyone should be counted, whether they're here legally or
otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service is supposed to keep a
low profile while Census 2000 is being conducted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS said the raid was in line with policy since it
stemmed from a police tip.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no intent to plan operations in areas where the census
is being conducted. But if we get calls from police, we are
obligated to help them,'' INS spokesman Russell Ahr told The
Arizona Republic.

<HEADLINE> Rights Group Claims 300 Dead in Aceh  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- More than 300 people have disappeared
or been killed since December as a result of continuing violence in
Indonesia's strife-torn province of Aceh, a human rights group
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Commission for the Disappearance and Victims of Violence,
known as Kontras, said 230 people died as a result of
''extrajudicial killings'' and 74 others were victims of
''involuntary disappearance,'' according to an article on the
report in the daily Suara Pembaruan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found that those 74 missing people had nothing to do at all
with GAM (separatist rebels),'' said Munier, a lawyer and chairman
of Kontras. Policemen and soldiers were also included among victims
of the violence, Munier said.
</P>
<P>
   GAM, or the Free Aceh Movement, is a separatist group that has
long been fighting Indonesian rule over the oil-rich province on
the northern tip of Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody struggle for independence in Aceh, about 1,100 miles
northwest of Jakarta, has claimed more than 5,000 lives in the past
decade.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Seize More Media Outlets  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In an ongoing crackdown against
independent media, President Slobodan Milosevic's government seized
transmission equipment owned by a major regional television
station, sharply limiting its broadcast range.
</P>
<P>
   Four men from the Telecommunications Ministry late Friday
removed the main transmitter of Radio Television Kraljevo, operated
by the opposition-run municipal government of Kraljevo, a town 70
miles south of Belgrade, said the station's editor, Violeta
Simovic.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh move in the past week to close or restrict
operations of broadcasters who support opponents of Milosevic's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Simovic told The Associated Press by telephone that the
equipment was taken away from the communications tower on Mt. Goc,
near Kraljevo, shutting down a station that broadcast to a wide
area of central and southern Serbia populated by more than 1
million people.
</P>
<P>
   The government-run Tanjug news agency said Telecommunications
Ministry inspectors ''removed the transmitter of Radio-Television
Kraljevo ... because it did not have license to broadcast'' from
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Television Kraljevo still has one small transmitter,
located in downtown Kraljevo, which can reach only a quarter of the
audience, Simovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Kraljevo's local government, dominated by an alliance of
democratic opposition parties, was in urgent session Saturday to
discuss the action, and a protest rally was expected later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The previous shutdowns have enraged opposition parties,
anti-Milosevic activists and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2,000 people held a protest rally late Friday in Pirot,
southeastern Serbia, where the local, also opposition-run
broadcaster was shut down Thursday. The station's journalists set
up a makeshift, open-air studio and read news through loudspeakers
on the town's main square.
</P>
<P>
   Also late Friday, Gorica Gajevic, secretary-general of
Milosevic's ruling Socialists, on state-run radio accused
opposition parties and media under their control of trying to
''distort reality.''
</P>
<P>
   When opposition parties won municipal elections in Serbia's main
cities in 1996, they took control of many local outlets. New local
elections are due this year and Milosevic apparently wants to make
sure his opponents have no way of spreading their message.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Kraljevo station's previous transmitter on the
Mt. Goc tower was destroyed by NATO in last year's bombing of the
country. NATO targeted the tower to silence Milosevic's powerful
state network, which also uses the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' top human rights official, Jiri Dienstbier,
who is on a 10-day visit to Yugoslavia, condemned the media
crackdown.

<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Vandals sprayed anti-Semitic slogans and marked
gravestones with swastikas and SS symbols at a Jewish cemetery in a

   HAMBURG, Germany (AP) -- The head of German media giant
Bertelsmann says the company is looking for takeover candidates
with the money it received for selling its share in AOL Europe, a

<P>
   Thomas Middlehoff was quoted by Welt am Sonntag as saying that
he expected to get as much as $9 billion from selling the share
back to Dulles, Va.,-based AOL.
</P>

   ''Because from that we can also bet on other capital, we have
the possibility to go shopping with around 75 billion marks ($37.5

<HEADLINE> Philippine Troops Retake Town Hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUBOD, Philippines (AP) -- About 500 Muslim guerrillas abandoned
a town hall and a road they had seized in a province where recent
fighting between soldiers and rebels has killed more than 30
people, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Government troops regained control of the town hall in Kauswagan
in southern Lanao del Norte province Friday night in a gun battle
that killed at least five rebels, said Army Brig. Gen. Roy Cimatu.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels of the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front
retreated into hinterland villages and some fled under cover of
darkness aboard motor boats seized from fishermen, military
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cimatu said portions of a main road blockaded by the rebels with
large stones and coconut tree trunks have been cleared and opened
to motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are now in full control of the town,'' Cimatu told a radio
station.
</P>
<P>
   The military and the rebels blamed each other for starting the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said about 200 guerrillas tried to overrun an
army outpost at daybreak Thursday in Kauswagan's Inudaran village,
setting off clashes that initially killed 15 Muslim rebels and two
soldiers. The rebels attacked several other military outposts in
nearby towns.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, about 50 rebels occupied the town hall in
Kauswagan, hoisting a rebel flag. About 100 other rebels took
positions in a main road fronting the town hall.
</P>
<P>
   The military deployed more than 2,000 army and marine soldiers,
backed by 10 aircraft, to quell the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Mohagher Iqbal, a rebel spokesman, said the fighting started
when army soldiers on Wednesday approached one of their camps in
Inudaran, apparently to arrest two MILF rebels suspected in a
bombing that killed 37 people in southern Ozamis City.
</P>
<P>
   Peace talks with the rebels were scuttled because of fighting
last month, when a major military offensive captured an MILF
stronghold. Talks resumed March 1 after both sides agreed to
respect a cease-fire, and government and rebel leaders have
expressed their willingness to continue peace talks despite the
clashes in Lanao del Norte, 490 miles south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
   The MILF is the largest rebel group battling the government for
an independent Islamic nation in the southern island of Mindanao.
The insurrection has stalled the development of the resource-rich
island, now one of the country's poorest regions.

<HEADLINE> Christian Democrats Can't Get Credit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Germany's three largest banks are refusing to give
more credit to the scandal-plagued Christian Democrats until they
reform party laws to prevent future corruption, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Party spokeswoman Eva Christiansen confirmed the report in
Tagesspiegel, which said Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank and
Commerzbank all were participating in the party's negotiations over
new financing rules.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a magazine he has
continued to receive more donations in his fundraising effort to
cover potential fines for the illegal money he has admitted
receiving from unnamed donors.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's admission of accepting more than $1 million touched off
the conservatives' scandal, which has since grown to reveal an
entire system of corrupt financing by the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl had earlier announced he had collected $3.2 million from
prominent businessmen and entertainment industry figures. He told
Focus newsmagazine in a report Saturday that he had now received
about $200,000 more, mostly from average Germans.
</P>
<P>
   The party itself is also trying to undo the damage from the
scandal, with spokeswoman Christiansen saying the talks with the
banks are ''totally normal and constructive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats already have $12.5 million in credit
from the three banks, Tagesspiegel reported. But its ability make
good on loans is in question, with the party already facing a $20.7
million fine for a falsified financial report and possibly more
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   A high-ranking commission last week released its proposals for
reforming the Christian Democrats' financial practices, suggesting
that outside, independent financial managers be put in charge of
the party's books. Those recommendations are to be considered ahead
of a party convention set for April.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Reconciliation 'Impossible'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The top U.N. official in Kosovo says reconciliation
between Serbs and Albanians in the divided province is ''absolutely
impossible'' today despite measures of progress, a newspaper
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the French Communist newspaper L'Humanite,
Bernard Kouchner said that the reopening of schools and the
formation of a banking system in Kosovo were little-recognized
signs of improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's true that today reconciliation is absolutely
impossible,'' the newspaper's weekend edition quoted him as saying.
''Who is crazy enough to think that in eight months we could have
done what they haven't been able to do in Ireland for 30 years?''
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner called the two communities' hatred of each other
''extremely strong'' and said there were no relations between them.
</P>
<P>
   A multiethnic society ''is impossible in Kosovo. We need to
establish what I have called peaceful coexistence,'' which would
require guaranteeing each group's security, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1999, efforts to reach a peace deal between Kosovo's
Albanians and the Yugoslav government failed and NATO launched a
78-day bombing campaign. Since the end of the airstrikes, NATO-led
peacekeepers have been deployed to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Kouchner called Kosovo a ''political
problem,'' not a problem of reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's wrong to think the bombing campaign ended the war,'' the
newspaper quoted him as saying. ''The confrontation between men
goes on. Their hatreds are stronger.''

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Vietnam Becoming Involved  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELMENDORF AIR FORCE BASE, Alaska (AP) -- Defense Secretary
William Cohen said Saturday he believes his historic visit to
Vietnam will hasten the communist nation's involvement in world
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We send signals to the world that when the United States makes
an attempt like that at engagement, that encourages others to do
likewise,'' Cohen told reporters flying with him from Seoul, South
Korea, to Washington on the final leg of a 10-day, four-country
Asia trip. His plane stopped at Elmendorf to refuel.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen spent three days this past week in the Vietnamese capital
of Hanoi and in Ho Chi Minh City, which was known as Saigon when it
was the capital of South Vietnam. The country was reunited under
communist rule in 1975. Cohen was the first American secretary of
defense to visit since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's leaders have struggled in balancing their desire to
reform and open the economy with the risk of losing political
control. A troubling sign, from Washington's point of view, is
Vietnam's refusal to sign a bilateral trade agreement with the
United States that already has been negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he would report to President Clinton on the prospects
for further improvement in ties to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they're quite encouraging,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton restored diplomatic relations with Vietnam in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen declined to say whether he would recommend Clinton visit
the United States' former enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Seoul on Saturday, Cohen met with President Kim
Dae-jung for an hour at the Blue House, the presidential palace. He
said Kim expressed an interest in Cohen's visit to Vietnam and
''thought it was a very good omen'' not only for Vietnam but
perhaps also on the Korean peninsula, where a divisive war between
North and South a generation ago remains an obstacle to
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was saying that ... he thinks that there's an opportunity
to move forward in North Korea with a variety of countries who are
trying to engage the North Koreans, and the more of that the
better,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said he and Kim agreed that the more North Korea becomes
involved in world affairs, the less chance the country will resort
to military force to reunite the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's reclusive leaders seem to have come to the
conclusion, Cohen said, that ''if they open up a little bit, more
light comes in'' to brighten the prospects for a country in dire
economic straits.

<HEADLINE> Gore Believes Tenn. Move Helped Run  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- When Al Gore moved his campaign
headquarters from Washington to Tennessee last fall -- ''from K
Street to the aisles of Kmart,'' as he put it back then -- a lot of
people made fun of him.
</P>
<P>
   ''When some reporters asked me at the time, 'What do you say
when someone says it's a gimmick,' I said, 'I don't really care if
they say that.' Of course I did, but not much,'' Gore says now.
</P>
<P>
   The reality, he says, is that getting back to his Tennessee
roots grounded and focused a campaign that was faltering even as
voters' support for challenger Bill Bradley grew.
</P>
<P>
   Gore credits the move, coupled with the resurrection of town
hall-type meetings he held as a Tennessee congressman, for making
him the all-but-sure Democratic nominee for president.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, his presidential campaign, with its top-heavy
staff, was said to be slowed by infighting and indecision. He shed
some highly paid staffers and consultants in favor of a volunteer
''Gore Corps'' and saved money on office space.
</P>
<P>
   The move, urged by his wife, Tipper, his daughter Karenna and
other close advisers, also gave Gore a chance to distance himself
from President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he changed his campaign style.
</P>
<P>
   He challenged Bradley to a series of debates. Rather than making
speeches and shaking a few hands across rope lines, Gore began
holding meetings and stayed until he'd talked to the last person in
the room.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Gore campaigned, and learned, in 1976 after he earned
the Democratic nomination -- then tantamount to election -- in
Tennessee's rural 4th Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he had to figure out what he was going to do before
being sworn in. He began holding open meetings in his district's 25
county seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stayed to talk with people as long as anybody wanted to talk
to me. And when I got to the 25th, I turned around and started
again and went to the second largest community, and then I went
around again and went to the third largest'' town in each county,
Gore said. ''I ended up meeting literally thousands of people.''
</P>
<P>
   That campaign style won him three more congressional terms and
two terms in the Senate. He hopes to continue it on a larger scale
for the biggest prize: the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's staff laughs now when recalling Washington pundits who
said the move last fall had been a desperation public relations
ploy that wouldn't last long or accomplish much.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later, Gore has swept the Super Tuesday primaries,
Bradley has dropped out of the race and the vice president is
riding high.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really got his act together, and the move to Nashville was
symbolic of that,'' said John Geer, a political science professor
at Vanderbilt University. ''People overinterpreted it as
desperation, but now he's sitting pretty.''

<HEADLINE> Putin Pushes for 1st-Round Election  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- With his standing in the polls dipping, acting
President Vladimir Putin urged voters Saturday to elect him with a
clear majority to avoid a second round, but denied that he's
worried about winning.
</P>
<P>
   On a campaign trip to the southern city of Voronezh, Putin was
cautious about the outcome of the March 26 election, saying he
would prefer a clear decision to avoid a runoff. But he said his
call was based solely on a desire to save the country the expense
of a second-round vote.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show support for Putin down by 2 to 3 percentage
points compared to the 60 percent he had received in recent weeks.
Putin's nearest rival, Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov,
trails with about 20 percent, while most of the other candidates
barely show up in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''I count on success, but it's not of major importance in which
round to win. It's the result that matters,'' Putin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Putin said the first round of voting will cost
about $5.3 million. If a second round is necessary two weeks later,
it will cost an additional $3.5 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nearly as much as all the pensions paid in the Moscow
region,'' Putin said in an interview with the Mayak radio station
aired Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said if he wins, there will be no room in his
administration for the business moguls who amassed so much
influence under Boris Yeltsin that they became known as Russia's
''oligarchs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a class of oligarchs will cease to exist,'' he said. ''We
will work with all layers of society.''
</P>
<P>
   The centrist Unity political party, which strongly backs Putin,
issued a call Saturday to young people to vote for Putin, urging
them not to be apathetic or assume the election outcome is a
foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ''has a historic chance to pull Russia out of crisis and
lead the country on the path of dynamic and stable development,''
the movement said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, whose tough stance on the war in Chechnya has buoyed his
popularity, said he will not repeat the mistakes of the last
Chechen war, when Russian forces were defeated by rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 withdrawal from Chechnya was a mistake, he said,
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. ''We have already left
once,'' he said. ''I do not want to call it a crime or give my
assessment of the fact, but it was a big mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin said most of the rebel forces in Chechnya have been
eliminated, and some Russian troops could soon be withdrawn. But he
said rebels could still unite into groups and commit terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means that we will leave the amount of armed forces
necessary to deal with these issues,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Roth: Change Social Security Rule  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rule that limits how much money older
Americans can earn without losing Social Security benefits is
keeping the nation's most experienced workers from filling the
labor shortage, the Senate Finance Committee chairman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans living longer and the tightest labor market in 30
years, Social Security beneficiaries should not be penalized for
staying on the job, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said in the
Republicans' weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   Repealing the limit ''will not only help to raise the standard
of living for many of our seniors but help keep the living
standards high for all Americans,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will vote on legislation to eliminate the earnings
limit next week, and President Clinton has said he would sign the
bill if passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security earnings limit requires the government to
subtract $1 in benefits from every $3 beneficiaries up to age 70
earn over a prescribed limit, currently $17,000 a year. The rule
was established 65 years ago to encourage older workers to retire
during the hard times and high unemployment of the Great
Depression, Roth noted.
</P>
<P>
   More than 800,000 older people lose part or all of their
benefits because of the limitation, the Social Security
Administration estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a result, many seniors choose to work less or stop working
altogether,'' Roth said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the earnings limit is complex and difficult for the
government to administer, costs more than $100 million per year and
causes more than 70 percent of Social Security payment errors.
</P>
<P>
   ''These payment errors are a large source of frustration for
seniors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baby boomers will begin to retire in five years, and the nation
will need a sharp increase in the number of older Americans working
just to maintain the nation's labor force, Roth said.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Village Remembers Massacre  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MURPHY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RACAK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- The school playground is alive with
shouts and laughter. Boys kick a fraying soccer ball. Girls giggle
in groups or dart about playing tag.
</P>
<P>
   The sounds carry up a muddy path. Through a green metal cemetery
gate. Over the neat rows of graves, each topped by an identical
wooden plank painted the Albanian colors of red and black.
</P>
<P>
   The dates on the markers also are the same: Jan. 15, 1999, the
sunny morning when Serb forces turned their fury on the ethnic
Albanians of Racak and took 45 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The carnage -- point-black executions, bodies beheaded and
mutilated -- was a pivotal episode in NATO's showdown with
Yugoslavia. Racak (RAH-chak) gave the United States and other
backers of military action a powerful rallying point for the 78-day
bombing campaign that began last March 24 and ended with Kosovo
under international protection.
</P>
<P>
   In the cemetery, Racak's mayor paused to listen to the joyous
hum from the nearby school yard. Then he went back to straightening
the half-dome memorials of plastic flowers and ribbons that
permanently cover each plot. He took extra care on his uncle's
grave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say if this will ever be a normal village again,''
said Agim Kamberi. ''If so, it will take a long time. Maybe for the
children of those children at the school. At least they won't know
with their own eyes the horrible thing that happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   Racak's struggle with its demons is being repeated everywhere
across Kosovo. The facades of routine life generally have returned.
Stores and restaurants are open. Work crews patch up burned houses
and other damage from the ethnic conflict.
</P>
<P>
   But the emptiness left by killings can't be so neatly corrected.
In Racak alone, 63 children lost a parent. Twenty-five women lost a
husband.
</P>
<P>
   And the continuing flashpoints -- the ethnic Albanian insurgency
in southern Serbia, clashes in the divided Kosovo town of Kosovska
Mitrovica -- feed worries that real peace is still far away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just hope that the dead of Racak did not leave this world in
vain. I try to believe that someday we will have a free and
peaceful Kosovo,'' said Kamberi. ''The story of Kosovo's struggle
was written with their blood.''
</P>
<P>
   A poem by a 13-year-old girl, Behare Bajrami, asks: What are you
doing, Serbs? What are you doing in Racak?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is still not clear.
</P>
<P>
   A week before the attack, an ambush in the nearby village of
Slivovo killed three Serb policemen. Tanks and troops were sent to
the area.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing to distinguish Racak from the other
villages in the gentle foothills about 18 miles southwest of
Pristina, the provincial capital. Racak itself had not been
considered a particularly important staging ground for the Kosovo
Liberation Army. It was under KLA protection and often sheltered
rebels, villagers say. But this was true of many surrounding
hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   A portion of Racak was burned by Serbs in July 1998 and many
families had fled. On Jan. 14, 1999, international monitors
reported hearing heavy gunfire and shelling in the Racak area. The
Serbs claimed it was a skirmish with KLA militiamen, but it could
not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,140 people were left in Racak when Serb police
and army units streamed in at dawn on Jan. 15. Some of the officers
were from the nearby town of Stimlje and well known in Racak,
villagers say.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in Racak believe the village was simply a convenient
target for Serb revenge. It sits alone in a bowl-shaped valley and
can be easily cut off by military units.
</P>
<P>
   Monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe were blocked by Serb commanders until the operation in Racak
was nearly over. The OSCE teams had no weapons. Their ammunition
was their influence in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Before the NATO air strikes, the OSCE tried hard to remain
dispassionate and even handed. But in Racak, the head of the OSCE
mission, William Walker, couldn't hold back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not have the words to describe my personal revulsion ...
at the site of what can only be described as an unspeakable
atrocity,'' Walker said shortly after viewing the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of 23 men, all shot at close range, lay piled in a
dry gully. In the village, victims' heads were smashed; brains and
organs removed. Some people were shot in the back, suggesting they
were gunned down while trying to run away. All those killed -- 42
men and boys and three women -- were in civilian clothes. The
youngest was 13; the oldest 75.
</P>
<P>
   The Racak killings were cited by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in
its May 1999 indictment of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
and four members of his inner circle.
</P>
<P>
   The more immediate impact was felt in NATO capitals. The scales
tipped sharply in favor of the United States, Britain and others
arguing for military action against Yugoslavia. NATO partners
seeking more negotiations, such as Greece and Germany, suddenly
appeared overwhelmed. The ''Racak effect,'' as it is sometimes
called now, was building steam.
</P>
<P>
   ''No doubt Racak was a turning point for NATO,'' said Terry
Taylor, a regional expert at the London-based International
Institute for Strategic Studies. ''It proved an extremely powerful
tool for those who wanted to spur on military action.''
</P>
<P>
   The death toll in Racak could have been even higher, survivors
say. A group of about 40 men were told to march toward the massacre
site, but managed to slip away and hide in a deep ravine, said Ilaz
Ymeri, 33, whose brother was among those killed.
</P>
<P>
   ''After that, I joined the KLA,'' he said while walking over
rocks marked by blue paint to show where bodies were found. ''I had
many chances to kill civilians, even children and women. But I
didn't. To me, this makes all the difference. This is why I can
sleep at night.''
</P>
<P>
   But nightmares linger. Many of the children fear sleeping alone,
said the school's director, Skender Bajrami. The students often
mention an elementary-level teacher whose eyes were gouged out.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, you see, no one was untouched. Even families who did not
lose someone are connected to the pain,'' Bajrami said. ''Neighbors
died. Friends died. Even the children see every day that one of
their teachers is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   One family has no more husbands, only widows. Sherife Syla, 62,
said she witnessed her husband's decapitation. Two sons were also
killed, leaving their wives and a total of five small children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've explained everything to my son,'' said Zymrie Syla,
stroking the shoulders of 3-year-old Dardan. ''He understands it
all. He knows who killed his father and he knows why. Can you
imagine that? A three-year-old should have to face such things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dardan added softly: ''My daddy is in the hill.'' He pointed
across the village to the cemetery.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Speed Up Kosovo Training  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS REDMONT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Saturday challenged European governments to stay the course in the
face of a deteriorating situation in Kosovo and urged speeded-up
training of police forces to replace the international military
contingent.
</P>
<P>
   Old models of peacekeeping do not work, and well-trained
civilian police are needed to handle crowd control, disarming of
agitators and searches for hidden weapons, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essential that national civil police move in. It is
untenable to ask the military to continue to serve this civilian
function,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Making a brief stop along the way to join President Clinton's
trip to India, Albright delivered her remarks to an audience that
included Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, ministers from
Germany, Egypt, Poland, Denmark and Portugal, international
business leaders and diplomats. Copies of her speech were made
available to reporters afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to recent bickering among the alliance, Albright said
interim arrangements for Kosovo's autonomy are needed to ''prevent
a sense of drift in Kosovo's political life.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright appealed for Europe to increase funding for
peacekeeping and numbers of policemen promised at the end of the
NATO bombing campaign, which ended the 18-month Serb crackdown.
Only 3,000 international police out of the 4,700 requested have
been deployed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers have clashed with ethnic Albanians and Serbs in the
northern Kosovo city of Kosovoska Mitrovica. U.S. troops earlier
this week launched a series of raids to seize weapons from ethnic
Albanian guerrillas in the U.S.-patrolled eastern part of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While France and Italy pledged to add 1,100 soldiers to their
forces to stem the unrest, the U.S. Defense Department has been
unwilling to increase the level of U.S. troops, now at 5,300,
already in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-led Kosovo Force, or KFOR, has so far fielded 37,000 of
a projected 50,000 soldier force.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Calls for More Taiwan Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China's government announced Saturday that it
would wait to see how Taiwan's new president handles relations
between the island and the mainland, despite its earlier warnings
that a Chen Shui-bian victory could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by state news media, Beijing repeated its
assertion that Chen's election did not change Taiwan's status as
''an inseparable part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We should listen to what the new leader in Taiwan says and
watch what he does. We will observe where he will lead cross-Strait
relations,'' said the statement, attributed to the Taiwan Office of
the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State
Council's Taiwan Affairs Office.
</P>
<P>
   The ''one-China policy,'' under which China holds that Taiwan is
a breakaway province, is the precondition for peaceful unification,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   '''Taiwan independence' in whatever form will never be
allowed,'' it said, concluding with a call for the people of Taiwan
to help ''realize the complete reunification of the motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was read toward the end of a late-evening
television news program, followed by a brief report saying
Taiwanese news media reported Chen had won in Taiwan's election for
''local leaders.'' Chinese news media generally do not refer to
Taiwan's elected leader as a president, or when they do, place the
word president in quotations.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's election challenges the status-quo in relations between
the sides, said Zhou Zhihuai of the Institute of Taiwan Studies
under the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're now at a crossroads in cross-Strait relations,'' he said
in a telephone interview in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was the candidate Beijing disliked most because his
opposition party has called for formal independence for Taiwan,
which has governed itself since Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled
to the island after the Communist takeover of the mainland in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Zhu Rongji and state-run media had warned Taiwan voters
a Chen victory could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Beijing said it might use military force if Taiwan
delayed reunification talks indefinitely. The Chinese government
previously had said it would use force if Taiwan declared
independence or foreign governments meddled.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday's statement contained no repetition of these
threats.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the election, many Chinese have said they did
not know much about it. China's state-run news media gave the
campaign in Taiwan almost no coverage. Most major national and
Beijing papers had no stories about it on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Ramsey Book Selling Slowly in Colo.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- The book by the parents of JonBenet Ramsey
is selling slowly in the couple's former hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The Boulder Book Store had sold only eight copies of ''The Death
of Innocence'' by closing Friday -- hours after the book's release.
Other bookstores in town described sales as less than brisk.
</P>
<P>
   The book, however, was listed at No. 13 on the Amazon.com best
seller list Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   John and Patsy Ramsey, who now live in Atlanta, say they wrote
the book to publicize errors made by police in their investigation
into the Dec. 26, 1996, death of 6-year-old JonBenet.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier book about JonBenet's murder, Lawrence Schiller's
''Perfect Murder, Perfect Town,'' sold briskly in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it (the Ramseys' book) will have those sales,''
said store manager Chris Ohman.
</P>
<P>
   Police have said the Ramseys are under suspicion in the slaying.
The couple have steadfastly maintained their innocence.

<HEADLINE> Jason Behr Blasts Off in 'Roswell'  </HEADLINE>
By CHELSEA J. CARTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jason Behr was making the guest rounds on
various teen-angst shows on the WB -- from ''Buffy The Vampire
Slayer'' to ''Dawson's Creek'' -- when it all changed.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   He landed the lead in this season's teen alien-ation series
''Roswell,'' a ''My So Called Life''-meets-the-''X-Files'' drama
about fictional survivors of an alleged 1947 spacecraft crash.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does sound funny when you first try to explain it: three
alien teen-agers going to high school,'' he says. ''In the wrong
hands it could have been a very bad Saturday morning special.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't. In fact, the show's success has landed the
26-year-old Behr among the WB's stable of young actors taking
Hollywood by storm.
</P>
<P>
   With a best acting nomination in this year's Santa Monica Film
Festival for the yet-to-be-released independent ''Rites of
Passage,'' also starring Dean Stockwell, Behr reveals he can stand
up alongside the best of young Hollywood. The film won best of show
at the festival.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike many of his colleagues, he's avoided the pitfalls of
such exposure -- tabloids, paparazzi and public disputes. (Read:
Jessica Biel's attempt to get out of her ''7th Heaven'' contract
and the tabloid fare of the cast of ''Charmed.'')
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, it isn't Behr's turn yet. More likely, says ''Roswell''
executive producer Jonathan Frakes, ''he's got a good head on his
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something wiser than his years there when you talk to
him,'' Frakes said. ''This business is a real privelege and real
honor, and it's not something to be taken lightly. He gets that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in a cubicle-sized dressing room recently on the lot of
Paramount, Behr is modest about his success despite the attention
he has received of late from critics, including being named among
TV Guide's ''10 To Watch.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For people to tell you nice things or compliment you is
rewarding, but if you allow yourself to buy into the notion you are
now a star then you stop being an actor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born and reared in the Minneapolis suburb of Richfield, Behr
credits his stability to his upbringing by a single mother raising
five kids.
</P>
<P>
   His mother encouraged his acting from the time he could memorize
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started out as a hobby, something fun to do,'' Behr said.
''My mother was always there, but never threw me into anything. Her
attitude was always, 'Whatever you want to do, Jason.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 19, Behr decided to make a go of it, hopping on an airplane
with $200 in his pocket and a promised spot on a friend's couch.
</P>
<P>
   ''Major culture shock,'' he said. ''People have a very different
way of thinking out here. Not to say that it's better or worse.
It's just different.''
</P>
<P>
   Cut off from his tight-knit family and old friends, the first
couple of years were tough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wished for a long time I could do this from Minneapolis,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But slowly, his youthful appearance, dark good looks and talent
helped land him guest spots on a variety of shows, and a role in
the 1998 if-you-blinked-you-missed-it ABC drama ''Push.''
</P>
<P>
   During that time, his family began a ''mass exodus'' to
California, seduced by the warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't tell you what it means to have them here -- the
support,'' he said. ''I'm in a very happy place in my life right
now, and I want to share it with people who mean a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   These days he's more at home with friends and family than he is
making public appearances, such as presenting at a recent music
awards show with the Irish girl band ''Bewitched.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Surreal,'' he says of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Shiri Appleby, who plays Behr's love interest on the
show, says the Midwestern charm ''is not an act.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's really him. He's really a nice guy,'' she said. ''He
takes what he does seriously, but he doesn't take himself too
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   When ''Roswell'' was picked up for a full season, she and Behr
were sent to New York to meet possible future advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was his first trip there and he lays on the floor of the
limo, looking through the (roof) at all the buildings,'' Appleby
said. ''He wouldn't get up from the floor. He was so funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Behr is serious about his job.
</P>
<P>
   His focus right now, he says, is the television show. While many
actors are scrambling for projects to do on their hiatus, he's
taking his time, considering several independent and studio movie
offers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't have to take the first thing to be successful. There
are a lot of people who want you to keep doing the same thing, like
that saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,''' Behr said. ''I
want to be involved in telling a good story. ... If I fail because
of that, I failed my way. If I succeed, it's going to be that much
more rewarding.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Wants Taiwan, China To Meet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China and Taiwan should renew peaceful
dialogue now that the island's voters have brought an
independence-minded party to power, President Clinton said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States strongly supports such dialogue and is
committed to promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the
region,'' the president said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton congratulated the winner, Chen Shui-bian, of the
Democratic Progressive Party. He said the election, which ended a
half-century's domination of Taiwan politics by founding President
Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party, ''clearly demonstrates the
strength and vitality of Taiwan's democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''During the election, all the candidates made clear their hope
for restoration of constructive dialogue with the People's Republic
of China,'' the president said. ''I believe the election provides a
fresh opportunity for both sides to reach out and resolve their
differences peacefully through dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite threats from China as late as last week of dire
consequences if Chen were elected, Beijing's early reaction
Saturday was muted. State-run news media said in an official
statement that China's government and the Communist Party will wait
to see what Chen says and does. The statement said his election
''will not change the status of Taiwan as a part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the United States will continue to conduct close
unofficial ties with Taiwan's people through the American Institute
in Taiwan ''in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act and our
one-China policy.''

<HEADLINE> Nudists' lawyer tells judge ban is unfair; no ruling yet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MAYS LANDING, N.J. (AP) -- The lawyer for a Cape May County
couple challenging a ban on nude sunbathing told a judge the law is
unconstitutional and too vague to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Vogt, 43, who took his clothes off at Higbee Beach in a
July 17 protest of the law, was fined $1,000 by a municipal court
judge last year. His wife, Arlene, 37, was charged a month later
when she took her bikini top off at the beach, which for years
permitted nude sunbathing. She was fined $500.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's lawyer told Superior Court Judge Albert Garofolo on
Friday the ban cannot be equally enforced. He said it is wrong to
ban women from going topless but not men.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know what nudity and indecent exposure is defined as
in the ordinance because it is not stated,'' said Frank Corrado.
''Mrs. Vogt was topless but not completely unclothed. If she had
appeared in pasties, would that have been acceptable, according to
the ordinance?''
</P>
<P>
   Higbee Beach, located near the southern tip of New Jersey on the
Delaware Bay, is a 650-acre beach and dune preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Lower Township officials banned nudity last year in response to
increasing reports of sexual activity in the dunes and bushes next
to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites listed Higbee Beach as a good meeting place for gay
men, attracting men from all over the East Coast, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Some parts of the beach are federally owned, the rest within a
state-owned wildlife management area.
</P>
<P>
   The Vogts' attorney says Lower Township police exceeded their
authority in arresting Bill Vogt because he was on federal
government property at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Scherzer, the township's attorney, told Garofolo that it
didn't matter who owned the land because the federal government has
never claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current thinking of society is what the nudity statute
reflects. There is an expectation in our society that women will
keep their tops on, and that expectation does not violate the 14th
Amendment,'' Scherzer said.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees equal
protection to all.
</P>
<P>
   Garofolo did not rule on the appeal. He did not say when he
would issue a decision.

<HEADLINE> Church Fire Kills 120 in Uganda  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- At least 120 followers of a doomsday cult
burned to death in a church fire in a remote part of southwestern
Uganda, authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said it
appeared that the sect leader set the blaze Friday once his
followers were lured inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Preliminary reports indicate that the leader of this sect
lured the people inside the church and set it on fire,'' the
officer said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the sect leader died in the fire, which
happened in a small trading center called Kanungu, about 217 miles
from Uganda's capital, Kampala, the officer said.
</P>
<P>
   The sect was known to have about 240 members and was called the
Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God, the
officer said. The sect believed the world will end in the year
2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group reportedly had been active in the region for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   A police spokesman told the BBC that the cult's leader told
believers to sell off their possessions and prepare to go to
heaven.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, the government disbanded two similar Ugandan
cults.
</P>
<P>
   In September, police raided a compound of the 1,000-member
Doctrine of Brotherhood cult and found 24 decomposed bodies in
shallow graves outside the compound in Bokoto, 28 Miles north of
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   The cult leader reportedly offered followers space in heaven
upon death in return for cash payment. Men were supposed to
surrender their wives and the wives declare themselves unmarried
before joining the sect.
</P>
<P>
   In November, police raided a camp at Ntusi in the Sembabule
district, home of a self-styled teen-age prophet who was said to
eat nothing but honey.

<HEADLINE> Slain Guerrilla's Kin Wants Justice  </HEADLINE>
By JARED KOTLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Makeup doesn't hide the bags under
Yanette Bautista's sad, tired eyes, the legacy of 13 years of death
threats and constant anger that her sister's killers walk free.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy to tell the story. The hurt is still deep
inside,'' she says when asked about one of Colombia's most famous
human rights cases -- the 1987 abduction and killing of her sister,
Nydia Bautista.
</P>
<P>
   Armed men in street clothes stuffed Nydia into a pickup truck
and took her to a farm, where she was raped, tortured and then shot
in the head. Her body wasn't found until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A year before her sister disappeared, Yanette had learned that
Nydia, who had aspired in high school to be a nun, had instead
become a guerrilla. She was working clandestinely for M-19, a rebel
group that lured many young idealists to its romantic but
ultimately futile cause.
</P>
<P>
   The secret surfaced at a small family gathering because Nydia
was on the run, fleeing a military crackdown on political
activists. She needed to go further underground, and left her
10-year-old son in the family's care.
</P>
<P>
   According to an army officer who deserted in 1990, the military
caught up with Nydia. His testimony about her death at the hands of
a notorious intelligence brigade became the backbone of a case that
led first to her body in an unmarked grave, and later to the firing
of Gen. Alvaro Velandia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the United Nations condemned Colombia for
Nydia's death and urged that compensation be paid to the family.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cases of the roughly 3,000 people who have been
''disappeared'' by suspected government agents during Colombia's
civil conflict don't receive any attention at all. The bodies are
never discovered and nobody is reprimanded, much less sent to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Yanette Bautista has become a leading activist for families of
people who have suffered similar fates across Latin America. But
she has done it outside Colombia since 1997, and now lives in
Europe -- fearful that someone might make good on the many death
threats sent her.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced a criminal trial of Velandia is impossible in
Colombia, she hopes he will be judged in another country, much as a
Spanish judge tried to do with former Chilean dictator Augusto
Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're working on it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Drinking, prescription drugs led to overdose  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A night of drinking and snorting a mix of
prescription drugs is believed to have caused the death of a
21-year-old Trinity College student, and the illnesses of three
other students, including one from New Jersey, a poison control
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture of drugs may have included antidepressants, migraine
and sleeping pills, said Dr. Mary McCormick, administrative
director of the Connecticut Poison Control Center. The students may
also have taken heroin, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were awaiting the results of toxicology reports, Sgt.
Norberto Huertas said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information we have is leading us to believe that it could
be possibly opiates or heroin,'' Huertas said.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Doroff, a senior from Harrison, N.Y., died shortly after
noon Friday at Hartford Hospital. He was a political science and
economics major.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kaupp, 22, of New Jersey, was in critical condition
Saturday at Hartford Hospital, a hospital spokesman said. His
hometown was not available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other students were admitted to the hospital for observation
and later arrested on charges of possession of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Bachman, 21, of South Natick, Mass., and Joshua B.
Eaves, 22, of Downingtown, Pa., were scheduled to be arraigned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, all seniors, may have been partying to celebrate
the end of mid-term exams, said Huertas.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from one of the victims, the four men
were snorting a combination of drugs including the antidepressants
Xanax and Valium, the migraine medication Butalbital, and sleeping
pills, said Dr. Mary McCormick, administrative director of the
Connecticut Poison Control Center at the University of Connecticut
Health Center. All of those drug depress the central nervous
system, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity officials released a brief statement Friday expressing
their concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our principal concern at the moment is with the individuals
and family members most directly affected and with all members of
the Trinity community for whom the death of a student represents a
great loss,'' said Linda Campanella, the college's senior vice
president of operations and planning.
</P>
<P>
   A message left for the college spokesman Saturday by The
Associated Press seeking further comment was not returned.

<HEADLINE> Killer gets life in prison -- again -- for stabbing ex-girlfriend  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A man has been sentenced to life in
prison a second time for stabbing his ex-girlfriend to death.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph A. Raso Jr., 54, of Brick, killed Joanne Turek, 44, two
weeks after she ended their troubled 10-year relationship in 1996.
His first conviction was reversed last year by an appellate court
that said jurors may have been swayed by ''unsubstantiated and
unreliable'' psychiatric testimony.
</P>
<P>
   After a second trial, he was convicted again Feb. 17. At his
sentencing Friday, Turek's relatives urged Superior Court Judge
James Citta to show no mercy for Raso.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we want to talk to Joanne, we have to talk to a stone. We
want him to talk to stone walls the rest of his life,'' said her
sister, Susan Waldamski.
</P>
<P>
   Raso stabbed Turek 83 times with a carving knife as she lay on a
water bed in her Dover Township home Sept. 8, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the second trial, public defender James Pinchak argued that
Raso suffered from ''diminished capacity,'' and was unable to form
the criminal intent necessary to be held responsible for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors didn't buy it, nor did Citta.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was done in such a manner, with such a long knife, that
there had to be purpose behind each blow or else the water bed
would have been leaking water all over the house,'' Citta said.
</P>
<P>
   The water bed was undamaged. ''How did that happen?'' Citta
asked, calling Raso's behavior ''a particularly controlled rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Raso made no comments before Citta pronounced the sentence. He
had apologized to Turek's family at his 1997 sentencing, and his
attorney re-entered that in the record.
</P>
<P>
   Turek's family, meanwhile, vowed to help keep Raso behind bars
for the entire term.
</P>
<P>
   ''However many appeals Mr. Pinchak wants to file, the family is
always going to be here. We'll never give up. We will be here till
we die,'' said Turek's mother, Marie Rozzo.
</P>
<P>
   She said her grandchildren have promised to continue the
campaign once she dies.

<HEADLINE> Money Might Bind China and Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- So much talk of war or peace between China
and Taiwan may obscure a crucial reality: Their economies are
becoming more closely intertwined in a process that seems unlikely
to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   The frequently bitter rivals may seem to disagree on almost
everything, but one common concern -- money -- has forged their
closest ties and it may help preserve the peace across the Taiwan
Strait no matter how harsh the rhetoric gets.
</P>
<P>
   Before Taiwanese voted for a new president on Saturday, Beijing
had been warning that if they chose pro-independence party
candidate Chen Shui-bian, the consequence could be war.
</P>
<P>
   Taipei stock prices tanked last week on fears of a resulting
economic calamity, and the government is estimated to have spent
more than U.S. dlrs 3 billion propping them up.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen claimed victory Saturday night with a call for
reconciliation that might lift everybody's fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Chen immediately say he wants friendlier ties with
China, he suggested a possible new opening -- direct shipping and
air links -- that could benefit businesses and boost goodwill on
both sides of the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   People and goods traveling between Taiwan and mainland China now
must pass through another point -- often Hong Kong -- because of a
Taiwanese ban on direct travel that wastes time and money.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between China and Taiwan have been tense since they
separated amid civil war in 1949, with Mao Tse-tung's Communists
taking the mainland and Gen. Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists
retreating to a power base on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing demands that Taiwan reunify with the mainland at some
point -- by force if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan has refused China's terms. And by electing Chen, whose
party advocates a formal split with China, the Taiwanese can be
seen as moving toward independence -- which Beijing said would
provoke a war.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the often-ugly words, Taiwan and China are drawing ever
closer economically. Since Taiwan let its investors put money into
China a decade ago, they are believed to have pumped in at least
U.S. dlrs 30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   China needs the cash -- and Taiwan's technological and
entrepreneurial know-how.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese who favor independence might see this as a good time
to gamble that Beijing's threats are a bluff because China is
trying to enter the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based body
that sets global commerce rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, China cut a necessary trade deal with Washington
after years of hard talks. But any violent attacks on Taiwan could
inflame international opinion and harm China's chances.
</P>
<P>
   After Chen won election, Beijing backed off its earlier
saber-rattling and hinted it would take a wait-and-see attitude
toward what he does.
</P>
<P>
   But Beijing does not like its authority questioned, and in terms
of reclaiming real estate, China has been on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   China got Hong Kong back from Britain in 1997, and late last
year, Portugal handed over the tiny gambling enclave of Macau --
ending what China viewed as centuries of humiliation with Europeans
governing its territory.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese President Jiang Zemin has made it clear Taiwan must be
next.
</P>
<P>
   There is another practical consideration Beijing would weigh
before picking a fight with Taiwan -- whether it has the military
might to seize the island.
</P>
<P>
   China has a huge army and nuclear weapons, and its missiles are
considered the biggest threat to Taiwan. But it may lack the
necessary air and sea power to mount an effective invasion of
well-defended Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also says it would take any attack seriously --
which many people take to mean Washington would come to the rescue
if Taiwan is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, China demonstrated its disgust for Taiwan's elections
by test-firing missiles in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans brought in warships, and Beijing's show of force
is widely seen to have backfired, gaining little for China except
condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of Saturday's election, China limited its bullying to
verbal threats.
</P>
<P>
   But Premier Zhu Rongji's finger-wagging tirade aimed at Chen may
also have gone wrong, galvanizing support for the man Beijing
despised.

<HEADLINE> Sammy the Bull accused of giving up his new life to return to theold  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE ARRILLAGA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Salvatore ''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano is back
behind bars, and this time his family has gone down with him.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged along with his ex-wife, Debra, and children, Karen
and Gerard, with operating a drug ring that distributed the illegal
stimulant Ecstasy in Phoenix with the help of a posse of suburban
street punks.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an opportunity to develop his own little crime family
in a place that had no organized crime,'' says Phoenix police
spokesman Jeff Halstead.
</P>
<P>
   For some mob experts, however, the idea that Gravano would
return to a life of crime is bewildering. That he would oversee a
family-run drug gang is simply strange, they insist.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a killer and a gangster, but he was against drugs and
he always denigrated John Gotti and other gangsters who brought
their own children into the life of crime that he and Gotti
chose,'' says Jerry Capeci, author of three books on New York's
Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ''He seemed to be someone who was smart enough, sharp enough,
savvy enough to make it without getting back into the life. And I
still haven't been convinced that it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, the guy FBI agents and prosecutors had
fawned over, dubbing him ''the most significant witness in the
history of organized crime'' for testimony that led to 37 mob
convictions. Even the federal judge who sentenced Gravano thought
he detected a ''very significant change'' in him.
</P>
<P>
   Author Peter Maas, who interviewed Gravano dozens of times for
the bestseller ''Underboss: Sammy the Bull Gravano's Story of Life
in the Mafia,'' also believed Gravano had the tenacity and talent
to make it legitimately.
</P>
<P>
   He says that when he and Gravano last spoke at length, about a
year and a half ago, the former Mafioso chatted proudly of the life
he was creating in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he'd gotten a job as a laborer in a construction
outfit. He said, 'I want to learn how they do construction out
here.' That sounded like pure Gravano to me,'' Maas says. ''My
understanding was that he was doing OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was, for a time.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano, 55, served just five years in prison after admitting
his participation in 19 murders and testifying against Gotti, the
New York City-based boss of the Gambino crime family now in jail
for life. Gravano was released in 1995 and, under the alias Jimmy
Moran, relocated to Arizona by the Witness Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1997, the same year his life story hit bookstores,
Gravano dropped out of the program and settled into a modest
apartment in Tempe, Ariz., a college town in the Phoenix metroplex.
He found work in construction, a trade he'd learned during his New
York Mafia days. Eventually he started his own firm, Marathon
Development, and launched Creative Pools, a pool construction
business.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's wife had divorced him when he entered the Witness
Protection Program. ''I was never part of that part of your life,''
she said at the time, ''and I'm not going to be part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet by 1996, Debra and daughter Karen had moved into a
4,400-square-foot house just nine miles from Gravano's apartment.
Their son, Gerard, also bought a house in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Debra, 46, opened an Italian restaurant. Gerard, 24, who shares
his father's stocky frame and cropped brown hair, began working for
Gravano, building and maintaining pools. Karen, 27, went to work as
the pool company's office manager and her fiance, David Seabrook,
also took a job there while living with her and their baby at her
mom's house.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the elder Gravano, only Gerard has a known criminal
record -- a 1999 conviction for trying to mail marijuana to a friend
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the Gravano family was starting anew.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are hard-working people,'' says Gravano's lawyer, Larry
Hammond. ''This was a guy who was in search of -- and had largely
found -- a life in which he could do his own work and do it well.
Was he craving some kind of new underworld empire? I just think
that's utter fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Police call it fact, with one interesting twist.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano wasn't responsible for bringing his family into the drug
trade, they say. Rather, they allege that Gerard lured his dad back
into the life and brought his mother and sister along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   According to authorities, Gerard had befriended 23-year-old
Michael Papa, a fellow New Yorker who began distributing Ecstasy at
dance parties in the Phoenix area in late 1998 or early 1999. Papa
allegedly bought the pills for $6-$8 apiece and sold them for as
much as $30. But his supply was limited, authorities say, because
of low capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gerard conveys the financial lucrativeness of this whole
scenario to Sammy,'' says Jim Molesa, spokesman for the Drug
Enforcement Administration in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano joined the scheme last fall, Molesa says, becoming the
brains and money behind the operation. Karen's boyfriend helped
Gerard and Papa with distribution, along with dozens of their
friends, while Debra and Karen were enlisted for bookkeeping,
Molesa says. And he alleges Debra's restaurant was used to launder
drug proceeds, while the women's home was used for storage.
</P>
<P>
   Under Gravano's direction, the ring brought in about $500,000 a
week, with Gravano receiving at least half, Molesa says. For his
assistance, he says, Papa received 15 percent of Gravano's
construction business, which became little more than a front for
the drug operation.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they found 13 pills believed to be Ecstasy in
Debra's house along with a suspected drug ledger indicating money
amounts and the word ''pills.'' Also seized were $93,000 in cash
and an arsenal of weapons, including three loaded handguns, a
shotgun, a rifle, a revolver in the master bedroom dresser and a
handgun in the family room.
</P>
<P>
   More pills were taken from Gerard's home, authorities said. In
Gravano's apartment, police found marijuana, a telephone voice
changer, three loaded handguns and $1,940. A bulletproof vest was
pulled from the trunk of his Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   The family members have pleaded innocent to all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Gravano's lawyer maintains his client ''had a strong bias
against drugs and the use of drugs.'' Furthermore, he says, Gravano
''had been the manager of perfectly appropriate businesses -- the
kind of businesses that most people would be proud to say were
theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got news for you,'' Molesa counters. ''A crook is a
crook. And if they've got the opportunity to make a buck, they're
going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Debra and Karen Gravano are free while awaiting trial. Gerard
Gravano remains jailed in lieu of $100,000 bond in a county jail.
Five miles away, on the maximum security floor of another jail,
Sammy Gravano sits alone in a 10-by-8 cell, unable to post his $5
million cash bond.

<HEADLINE> Man Sues To Rescind School Donation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- An Augsburg College alumnus with
controversial ideas about race is tired of waiting for the school
to name a building wing after him, so he's suing to get back his
gift of $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The private school accepted the money in 1987 from Elroy Stock,
a member of the class of 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But Augsburg officials later learned that Stock, now 77, had
mailed out thousands of letters to interracial couples over a
20-year period condemning interracial marriage, adoptions and
out-of-wedlock births.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Augsburg President Charles Anderson said at the
time, Stock had agreed that the wing wouldn't be named after him
while the college would keep the money. Anderson, who is white and
has a black daughter-in-law, said he had received three of Stock's
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Stock said Thursday he never made such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''No institution keeps the money and doesn't keep the
agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Augsburg public relations direction Barbara Nagle said the
school plans to vigorously defend itself.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's New President Profiled  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- President-elect Chen Shui-bian has made a
remarkable political career out of rankling the powers that be:
first Taiwan's martial law government and now the island's
political establishment -- as well as Chinese leaders who say his
views could provoke a war.
</P>
<P>
   Chen is to succeed retiring President Lee Teng-hui in May,
ending the Nationalist Party's 51-year rule on the island -- much of
it under repressive martial law.
</P>
<P>
   His dramatic win Saturday highlights a political career that
began with Chen, the son of a poor sugar cane worker, defending
opposition activists.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was born Feb. 18, 1951, and earned a law degree from elite
Taiwan National University. His politically formative years in the
martial law era that ended in 1987 were a turbulent time -- he was
imprisoned for eight months in 1986-87 for accusing a Nationalist
politician of plagiarism.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's wife, Wu Shu-jen, was run over three times by a truck in
what many believe was a politically motivated murder attempt in
1985. Paralyzed from the waist down, she often appears with Chen at
rallies and is a close adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Chen rose to political stardom in the Democratic Progressive
Party, which chipped away at Nationalist political dominance and
worries China by its pro-independence stance that Beijing says
could lead to war.
</P>
<P>
   His fortunes soared in 1994 when he was elected mayor of the
capital, Taipei, making him the most powerful DPP politician on the
island. As mayor, Chen became known as a corruption buster who had
no tolerance for inefficiency, but he also developed a style of
governance that critics called too authoritarian.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's supporters were devastated four years later when Taipei
voters threw him out of office in favor of a well-financed and
charismatic Nationalist Party candidate, Ma Ying-jeou.
</P>
<P>
   It was far too soon to count Chen out.
</P>
<P>
   He turned his defeat into an opportunity, taking time to plot
his uphill battle for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Chen adopted a more moderate political style, giving him an
image as a consensus builder that won him several important
endorsements from intellectuals, who questioned whether Nationalist
candidate Lien Chan could clean up Taiwan's money politics and
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Chen also had lucky timing: His win was made possible in no
small measure by a split among the Nationalists when one of their
big names, James Soong, ran as an independent instead of supporting
Vice President Lien Chan's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   To win the trust of voters made nervous by his pro-independence
stance, Chen had to back down, promising during the campaign he
would not raise tensions with China or make radical changes in
domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province to be
recovered by force if necessary, suspected his promise was merely a
campaign ploy. China stepped up its threats of attack in an
apparent effort to intimidate Taiwanese into deserting him.
</P>
<P>
   That may have prompted some Taiwanese to back Chen.
</P>
<P>
   After he won, Chen immediately sought peace, calling his triumph
''the beginning of reconciliation.'' China and Taiwan split amid
the Chinese civil war in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   He offered to visit China and seek dialogue on expanded ties and
a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important thing is to have enough good will and
sincerity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chen also assured Taiwanese he will not sacrifice their
interests or compromise national security.
</P>
<P>
   Chen still faces obstacles in the Legislature, where the
Nationalists have a 55 percent majority to the DPP's 31 percent.
The lawmakers have two more years to serve before new legislative
elections.

<HEADLINE> Japan Arrests Four Fugitives  </HEADLINE>
By SHIZUO KAMBAYASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NARITA, Japan (AP) -- Japan on Saturday arrested four fugitives
expelled from the Middle East, and vowed to keep up pressure on an
elusive comrade of the terrorist Japanese Red Army who stayed
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the four, who had been deported from Lebanon after
serving prison terms there, were taken into custody at Tokyo's main
international airport less than an hour after they arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has long wanted to try the fugitives for staging bloody
attacks around the world, including a shooting at Israel's Ben
Gurion airport in 1972 in which 24 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Army members are considered heroes by many in Lebanon
and the Arab world for championing the Palestinian cause and
opposing Israel, which occupies a border zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is significant they are now in the hands of our country's
legal system,'' Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted by Kyodo
News agency as saying in a statement. ''It's a good example to show
there is no place in the world where terrorists can enjoy a
peaceful life.''
</P>
<P>
   After refusing to extradite them, Lebanon deported the four
Friday on a flight to Jordan, diplomats in Amman said. Masao
Adachi, 59, Haruo Wako, 50, Kazuo Tohira, 46, and the only woman,
Mariko Yamamoto, 58, were handed over to Japanese diplomats for
escort back to Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But Kozo Okamoto, who participated in the attack in Israel,
remained at large. The Lebanese government granted him asylum,
saying he still suffered ''from physical and psychological injuries
sustained while in Israeli prisons.''
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old Okamoto, the most notorious Red Army member, was
freed by Israel in a 1985 prisoner swap with Palestinian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese government committee considering the asylum
requests said he was the only one of the five who actually
participated in what it called ''resistance operations'' against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Kosuke Hori, Japan's National Public Safety Commission chief,
called Lebanon's decision on Okamoto ''extremely regrettable'' and
said Tokyo would continue to seek his deportation from the country.
Hori said the other four would be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Okamoto and the others finished three-year prison terms last
week for illegally entering Lebanon, and remained in custody
pending asylum decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon had cited the lack of an extradition treaty with Japan
for refusing the extraditions. It also said the Japanese government
does not have proof to back up its accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In what was seen as an attempt to avoid being sent home, Adachi
recently married a Lebanese woman after converting to Greek
Orthodox Christianity while Okamoto and two of the remaining four
converted to Islam.

<HEADLINE> US, India Look To Improve Relations  </HEADLINE>
By HEMA SHUKLA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- India and the United States will sign
three agreements during President Clinton's visit that are intended
to improve relations between the two countries, the Foreign
Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's five-day visit to India, which begins March 20, is
aimed at boosting bilateral trade and improving a relationship that
was clouded by years of mutual suspicion during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Raminder Singh Jassal, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said
Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee were
expected to sign an agreement on March 21 that spells out a
''vision of the two countries.'' He gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from both countries will also sign a joint statement
on energy and the environment after President Clinton addresses a
seminar on environmental issues in Agra, 120 miles southeast of New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   The statement will focus on the central role that energy plays
in economic development and the risks associated with the use of
nonrenewable energy sources. The statement will also promote
bilateral cooperation on the use of energy that is less harmful to
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement will also be signed to establish a forum to
increase cooperation in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton leaves for South Asia on Saturday and stops initially in
Bangladesh. He will conclude the trip with a brief stop in
Pakistan, where he will be the first president to visit since 1969.
He is the first president to visit India in 22 years.

<HEADLINE> Bush Campaign Heavy on Symbolism  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When George W. Bush clinched the Republican
presidential nomination, he was introduced at his victory rally by
the Democratic mayor of El Paso, Texas, a Hispanic. The
unmistakable message: the Texas governor boasts an inclusive brand
of politics.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore changed his schedule to celebrate
wrapping up the nomination in Florida -- a state run by Gov. Jeb
Bush, his opponent's brother, and a battleground the Democrat hopes
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have long used symbols to drive home political
themes, from the split rails that portrayed Abraham Lincoln's
hardscrabble youth to the suitcase that Jimmy Carter lugged from
town to town as he made his flinty run for the White House in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Sen. John McCain's campaign bus, ''The Straight Talk
Express,'' was a rolling symbol of his maverick candidacy that's
now history.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, more than others this election season, has reinforced
his campaign themes with symbolism that rivals the Reagan White
House, where his father served before becoming president.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1980s, Reagan adviser Michael Deaver earned a
reputation as a political whiz for presenting the president in
visual backdrops that supported his message.
</P>
<P>
   One small touch: flip-flopping the side of the East Room used
for White House news conferences, so Reagan had an imperial look by
standing against the backdrop of a long red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush has not only learned from Deaver, he's learned from the
people he worked with in his father's campaign in '88,'' said
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy
Center at the University of Pennsylvania. ''That was a campaign
that used symbols to displace substance, almost.''
</P>
<P>
   When then-Vice President George Bush was running against
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis in 1988, he shook his
Democratic rival by traveling to Boston and picking up the
endorsement of the Boston police patrolmen. The image of Bush
standing before a backdrop of blue uniforms sent Dukakis scrambling
for his own police endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   When the vice president wanted to criticize Dukakis'
environmental record, he took a cruise of Boston Harbor -- cameras
in tow -- to complain about the quality of the water.
</P>
<P>
   And when Dukakis appeared in a tank to bolster his military
image, the sight of the governor in an oversized helmet was
transformed by the Bush campaign into a symbol not of strength, but
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ''You not only want to use symbolism to identify yourself in a
positive way, you want to use it in a way that hurts your
opponents,'' Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's what George W. Bush did at a Long Island breast cancer
research center, where he bashed his Republican primary rival John
McCain for voting to cut funding for such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Before criticizing McCain, Bush, a pink breast cancer awareness
ribbon on his lapel, held a cancer research forum, standing with a
breast-cancer survivor on one side and a female doctor on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks before, when Bush wanted to assert his
conservative roots, he spoke at a Christian school, Bob Jones
University, in South Carolina. The person who introduced Bush
highlighted his anti-abortion record, and Bush used the word
''conservative'' six times in one minute.
</P>
<P>
   While the cancer center stop was part of Bush's effective
strategy to beat McCain in the ''Super Tuesday'' primaries, his
visit to Bob Jones University showed how symbols can put a campaign
at risk.
</P>
<P>
   After his speech, Bush faced questions about whether he
supported the school's ban on interracial dating -- which was later
lifted -- and anti-Catholic statements made by its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy dogged him for nearly a month, subsiding after
Bush used another symbol -- a letter to the head of New York's Roman
Catholic Church -- to apologize for not speaking out against the
policies.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Bush reinforced his apology by visiting the Simon
Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, a monument to tolerance born of
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Jamieson noted that Bush also faced questions about his cancer
position, when reporters asked the governor the day after his visit
to Long Island why he was no longer wearing his pink ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   She said: ''The danger in trying to ally with symbols that
people can turn and say, 'That's empty symbolism and not a genuine
expression of a position.'''

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Nomads Lose Animals, Pride  </HEADLINE>
By J.L. HAZELTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ULAN BATOR, Mongolia (AP) -- With more than 1 million camels,
goats, horses and other livestock dead from the worst weather in
decades, Mongolia's nomads are in shock from the loss of what gives
their lives meaning -- their herds, the country's Red Cross director
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, it was a drought and rodents infesting pastures.
Heavy snow followed this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Now grass is so hard to come by in a large swath of Mongolia
that about 1.7 million head of livestock have starved, said
Rabdangyn Samdan-Dobji, the secretary-general of the Mongolian Red
Cross. The beasts' shrunken, desiccating bodies litter the desolate
brown Gobi Desert, its hills streaked white with snow.
</P>
<P>
   The nomads are seeking pastures showing any hint of fodder for
what's left of their herds, moving farther and farther from their
usual range and creating new problems in areas hundreds of miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some places we have too many animals, so in a short time
they very easily destroy the pasture,'' Samdan-Dobji said.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster, which the Red Cross calls the worst here in
decades, has hit about 400,000 nomads. That is 40 percent of the
herding population in this landlocked Central Asian nation of 2.7
million sandwiched between Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   Mongolian nomads are believed to herd some 33.5 million animals.
While hard numbers on the deaths are difficult to come by in a
country with few communications networks and small groups of people
scattered across vast empty spaces, ''probably many families have
already lost all their animals,'' Samdan-Dobji said.
</P>
<P>
   Some families have separated, with the weak, elderly and
children staying put in the family ger -- a round felt tent -- and
the adults taking the herds in search of grass.
</P>
<P>
   About 300,000 animals are dying a week, and with each goes some
of its owner's pride and sense of self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Cows, also called yaks, sheep, goats, camels and horses are the
Big Five for the nomads, providing food, shelter, fuel,
transportation, and material to sell, from milk products to
cashmere. Losing them means more than just going hungry.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's pride in having their own animals, from generation to
generation,'' he said. ''The horses are very fast. The sheep are
very fat and provide a lot of milk. The goats produce the cashmere.
</P>
<P>
   ''But people are losing all their animals and the psychological
damage is very much there,'' Samdan-Dobji said. ''You can tell by
their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been suicides blamed on the loss of herds, but
information on numbers is difficult to gather.
</P>
<P>
   As for human deaths blamed on the lack of food, only three have
been reported so far, but again, news trickles in slowly from the
desert to the south and the high plains to the north of the
capital, Red Cross staffer Amgaa Oyungerel said. The elderly and
children are weakening and hospital admissions are up, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aid agencies are calling for international help and doing what
they can to deliver emergency relief -- including shoes. Since
Mongolia's proud horsemen are losing their mounts to starvation,
they've had to go on foot lately.
</P>
<P>
   Things are expected to get worse when what little meat the
herders were able to dry and freeze in the fall runs out this month
or next. After that, there are fears that the human toll will rise
rapidly, said Shunichi Kagami of the International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in Mongolia to help organize
a campaign seeking international assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Aid groups are hoping to avert a larger tragedy down the road.
Then, they hope, the government will help the nomads restock their
flocks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Samdan-Dobji expects that it will take at least three
years for Mongolia -- already struggling to establish democracy and
a free-market system after decades in the Soviet orbit -- to
recover.

   DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Trying to avoid a clash with gay rights

   Gay and lesbian groups, upset because ''Dr. Laura'' called
homosexuality a ''biological error'' and ''deviant,'' were planning

   ''We're thrilled that she's not bringing her anti-gay rhetoric

   About 800 tickets at $76 apiece had been sold. Proceeds were to

<HEADLINE> Six Hamas Militants Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By IBRAHIM BARZAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Palestinian police have seized
explosives and arrested five members of a militant group suspected
of plotting bombing attacks in Israel, Palestinian security
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The men, members of the militant Islamic group Hamas, were
arrested during a raid at the Shati refugee camp in the Gaza Strip
on Friday night, the officials said on condition of anonymity.
Police also found 66 pounds of explosives that the militants
intended to use to bomb a bus station in an Israeli city, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the men had links to Hamas extremists who
were discovered in the Israeli Arab city of Taibeh two weeks ago
before they could carry out attacks in Israel. Four Palestinians
were killed and one surrendered during a daylong confrontation with
Israeli forces on March 2.
</P>
<P>
   Hamas spokesman Ismail Abu Shanab confirmed the arrests. He said
that although he had no contact with Hamas' military wing, he
believed that those arrested were connected to the Taibeh cell,
which he said had 13 members.
</P>
<P>
   Two activists suspected of belonging to the cell were arrested
Thursday in the northern West Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   A Hamas official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said top
Hamas officials met Saturday with their spiritual leader, Sheik
Ahmed Yassin, to discuss the arrests. He would not comment on the
meeting's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth Hamas activist from Gaza's Khan Younis refugee camp was
arrested Thursday on apparently unrelated charges, the Palestinian
officials said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Revolutionary Guards Blast U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's hard-line Revolutionary Guards on
Saturday accused Washington of meddling in domestic affairs by
lifting an import ban on Iranian luxury goods -- a criticism that
underscores the divisions in Iran's ruling hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's announcement Friday
demonstrate the ''intensified efforts of the White House to create
a crisis in Iran,'' said a statement by the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps, quoted by Tehran radio. The statement did not say how
the Guards, who have hundreds of thousands of men in arms and their
own air force and weapons industry, intended to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. announcement has become the latest grounds for division
between anti-American hard-liners and reformers, led by President
Mohammad Khatami, who favor better ties with the United States. In
elections last month, hard-liners lost control of the powerful
parliament for the first time since the 1979 revolution that
brought an Islamic government to power.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Clinton administration lifted a ban on U.S.
imports of Iranian carpets, caviar and some other luxury goods and
invited Iran to enter a ''new relationship'' with the United States
to stabilize the Gulf region and reverse more than two decades of
icy distance. Iran's first reaction was positive, with Foreign
Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi welcoming the U.S. move.
</P>
<P>
   But the secretary of Iran's top security body, the Supreme
National Security Council, called it ''new interference in Iran's
domestic affairs,'' the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners control the judiciary, armed forces, broadcast
network and the Intelligence Ministry. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the
unelected hard-line supreme leader, also is the nation's highest
authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Guards, in a statement carried by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency, said Iran deserves U.S. compensation for past
wrongs. It noted that Albright acknowledged U.S. involvement in a
1953 coup plot, and said Iranians have suffered ''enormous
financial losses'' stemming from conspiracies involving the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks Friday, Albright said the Eisenhower
administration believed its involvement in the overthrow of Prime
Minister Mohammad Mossadeq was justified for strategic regions.
But, she said, ''the coup was clearly a setback for Iran's
political development and it is easy to see now why many Iranians
continue to resent this intervention by America in their internal
affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The coup reinstalled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi as a
pro-American bulwark against communist expansion into Middle East.
He was overthrown in the 1979 revolution and died in exile the
following year.

<HEADLINE> Judge chides neighbors who objected to ringing of church bells  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) -- Neighbors and town officials who
complained about the ringing of church bells in their rural Morris
County town need to ''lighten up,'' a judge said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Reginald Stanton called the situation that
triggered the court hearing ''a trivial incident'' and refused to
allow the planning board in Washington Township to clamp new
restrictions on the ringing of bells at St. Luke's Roman Catholic
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is just nonsensical to think that we're tying up the court
system because somebody rang a bell for 20 minutes. It's
nonsense,'' Stanton said in rendering his decision Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The specific complaint referred to an incident on Dec. 18 in
which St. Luke's played a 20-minute medley of Christmas carols
after 10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   But the brouhaha over the bells began in July, when church
officials wanted to install an electronic carillon. Several
neighbors who live near the church in the township's quiet Long
Valley section objected and hearings dragged on for months.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials agreed to minimize the sound directed at homes
by turning off one of the four speakers, reducing the volume and
installing sound-dampening materials in the steeple.
</P>
<P>
   When complaints from residents continued, the planning board
sought to have restrictions placed on the sounding of the bells.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has to be some consideration given to the local
residents,'' said planning board attorney Stephan Hansbury.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Rev. Michael Drury, the church's pastor, filed
court papers seeking to restrain the board.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton sided with Drury, saying sensible people would ignore
the isolated after-hour chimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Quite frankly, one has to wonder where people are coming from
when they feel they have the right never to hear a church bell
sounded at any time in their presence,'' Stanton said. ''They
really should just lighten up and enjoy the church bells when they
are played.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stanton said this didn't mean church officials could play
the bells whenever they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In its legal filling, the church also asked the judge to
invalidate four conditions imposed by the planning board, stating
the bells were a constitutionally protected form of religious
expression.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton did not rule on that issue, but said he had no doubt the
planning board could impose ''reasonable restrictions.'' He called
the December incident ''a breach of etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Drury said he was content with Stanton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Ippoliti, a neighbor who complained about the
December bell-ringing incident, was not.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Stanton) doesn't have to live here, so it's easy for him
to make those decisions,'' Ippoliti told The Star-Ledger of Newark
for Saturday's editions.

<HEADLINE> Church Fire Kills 235 in Uganda  </HEADLINE>
By PETER BUSOMOKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- At least 235 followers of a doomsday cult
burned to death in a church fire in a remote part of southwestern
Uganda, authorities said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether sect leader Joseph Kibweteere died in the
fire in the small trading center of Kanungu, 217 miles from
Uganda's capital, Kampala, and near the Congolese border. He had
predicted the world would end Dec. 31 but changed it to Dec. 31,
2000, after nothing happened, said the independent newspaper The
Monitor in its Sunday edition.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer, who spoke on conditions of anonymity, said
preliminary reports indicated Kibweteere lured his followers inside
the church and then set it ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman Asuman Mugenyi said an unspecified number of
police officers may have been killed in the fire, which he said
took place Thursday. Other police said the church burned on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses told the Monitor they smelled gasoline and there was
an explosion that set the church on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders said members of the sect, the Movement for the
Restoration of Ten Commandments of God, slaughtered their cattle
and feasted for a week, drinking a large supply of soft drinks and
singing religious songs, according to the Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   As required by law, the sect was registered by the government in
1997. The Monitor quoted Kanungu residents as saying Kibweteere
started preaching in 1994 and was a defector from the Roman
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it (the fire) calls on the state to review the issue
of cults and see what measures to take to protect the ordinary
people from cult leaders,'' Amama Mbabazi, minister of state for
foreign affairs, told the government-owned Sunday Vision newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, police evicted about 1,000 members of a similar sect
from a camp northwest of Kampala, accusing the members of crimes
that included defilement of minors, rape, abduction and theft.

<HEADLINE> Media Seen As Key to Mozambique Aid  </HEADLINE>
By CRAIG NELSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- A picture is worth a thousand words --
and in the case of Mozambique's devastating floods, it was worth a
lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   With much of the country wrecked by the worst flooding on
record, at least 1,400 aid workers, 1,000 soldiers and 53 aircraft
from seven foreign armies descended on the southeast African nation
this month.
</P>
<P>
   But aid officials say the massive operation, which has saved
lives and appears to have prevented a predicted cholera epidemic,
is not a sign of new interest in Africa. They believe it was
spurred on largely by intense media coverage of the floods -- and
they say equaling this outpouring of aid in a future African
disaster will depend mainly on whether cameras are there to record
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The media coverage has been exceptional and has contributed to
the tremendous response,'' said Michael Elmquist, a U.N. official
in Maputo. He contrasted it with scant coverage and slow donor
response to flooding 18 months ago in Bangladesh that affected 20
million people.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Matonse, an aide to Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had asked for help from donors before the second surge (of
water) and received little response,'' he said. ''When they saw the
pictures, they realized the situation was more serious than they
thought and they responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite confident assertions by international aid agencies, the
death toll from the floods has not soared into the thousands and a
cholera epidemic, thought to be a foregone conclusion, has not
flared. Though hundreds of thousands still need food, the largest
international relief operation to Africa in six years has helped
curb the devastation.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rainfall across southern Africa triggered Mozambique's
first flooding on Feb. 9, submerging the streets of the capital,
Maputo, and forcing thousands from their homes. The second
installment came little more than two weeks later, on the weekend
of Feb. 25, when a cyclone-driven surge of water rushed down the
Limpopo and Save rivers toward the fertile south and central
plains.
</P>
<P>
   Building to seven-foot-high waves, the water tore through river
banks and rolled across river basins, wiping out crops, submerging
towns and villages and ripping up roads and railway lines. At least
38 of the 492 confirmed dead from the flooding were drowned by this
wave of water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government and international aid organizations were
overwhelmed by the magnitude of the second surge when it hit,''
said Abby Spring, spokeswoman for the World Food Program, a U.N.
agency.
</P>
<P>
   For all the shock caused by the second rush, it was videotape of
South African Defense force helicopters rescuing flood victims from
trees and rooftops that pricked the conscience of the outside
world, government and aid officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Barrow, a correspondent for the British Broadcasting Corp.,
believes his news organization's decision to move an antenna dish
to Maputo Feb. 21 was critical.
</P>
<P>
   ''A dish changes a story from something that's difficult to get
on the air to something that's almost too easy,'' Barrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, images of chopper rescues were leading news broadcasts
around the world, and the aid began to flow in. Malawi's president
chided his African counterparts for their tardy, frugal response to
the disaster, but by Saturday, even debt-ridden Kenya, war-ravaged
Burundi and the tiny kingdom of Lesotho had chipped in.
</P>
<P>
   Even as hundreds of aid flights crisscrossed Mozambique this
week, the leaders of southern African nations were preparing for
the next emergency. They asked Western donors for funds to
establish a system to predict and manage natural disasters in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   And the evolving role of Western militaries in the post-Cold War
world will produce even deeper cooperation with international aid
agencies in delivering aid to bedraggled victims of catastrophe in
the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   What is less certain, aid agency officials say, are the
judgments of news executives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unless executives broadcast television images, there won't be
public pressure to send help,'' said Ian McLeod of UNICEF.

<HEADLINE> US Cos. Want India Sanctions Lifted  </HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- U.S. companies hit by trade sanctions
imposed on India are hoping President Clinton's visit to the
country will lead to the sanctions being lifted soon.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is bringing a 150-member trade delegation with him on
his five-day visit to India, the first in 22 years by a U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the time will come soon when sanctions ... will be
rolled back,'' Richard Celeste, American ambassador to India, said
Saturday, the day before Clinton's jet was to touch down in New
Delhi. He said the talks between Clinton and Indian Prime Minister
Atal Bihari Vajpayee next week could lead to a high-level dialogue
on trade, similar to ones the nations have had on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   The United States slapped economic and military sanctions on
India following the nuclear tests India conducted two years ago.
India's move prompted Pakistan to carry out similar tests soon
after.
</P>
<P>
   Although Washington has lifted many of the military and economic
sanctions, it still bans the sale of equipment or technology to 55
companies and government departments in India.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is India's main trading partner, but Indian
companies turned more toward Europe and Asia after the sanctions.
U.S. companies doing business in India have joined trade bodies and
lawmakers in lobbying to have them lifted, said Sanjay Bhatnagar,
president of the American Chamber of Commerce in India. The chamber
represents 300 U.S. companies.

   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Some 25,000 prisoners have been pardoned and
the sentences of 27,000 others commuted in Iran over the past
month, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.

   Bakhtiari said 40 percent of the prisoners have undergone
vocational training to be able to cope with everyday life after
freedom, IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
   The amnesties were granted during various national and religious

<HEADLINE> Clinton Preaches Patience for Oil  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans hoping for quick relief from high
fuel prices should be patient, President Clinton said Saturday as
he cautioned against ''shortsighted and risky steps'' to address
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no overnight solution,'' the president said in his
weekly radio address as he announced a series of modest proposals.
</P>
<P>
   None directly addresses the current oil shortages or eases
gasoline prices approaching $2 a gallon -- with the prospect of
higher pump prices during the peak summer driving season. For now,
Clinton refused to tap the government's emergency oil stockpile,
despite appeals from lawmakers from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were relying on ''quiet diplomacy'' to
persuade oil exporting countries to increase production and erase a
2-million-barrel-a-day global supply shortfall when they meet March
27 in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was embarking on
another round of diplomatic missions Sunday, meeting with oil
ministers from Nigeria, Indonesia, Algeria and the United Arab
Emirates as well as other officials involved in the oil markets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton lamented that expensive oil and gasoline ''are causing
hardship for many Americans.'' But he added that ''we also need to
take a longer view'' and he said he was optimistic more oil soon
will be made available.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, he said, should approve proposals to:
</P>
<P>
   --Create an emergency 2-million barrel heating oil reserve in the
Northeast where supply disruptions caused prices to soar this
winter.
</P>
<P>
   --Offer tax incentives to promote energy conservation,
alternative fuels and more energy efficient automobiles and homes.
</P>
<P>
   --Provide modest tax breaks to support increased domestic
production. His approach is far short of what Republicans and the
oil industry have sought.
</P>
<P>
   The administration will not decide until after the OPEC meeting
whether to draw some of the nearly 570 million barrels of oil in
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The reserve, created in 1975 after
the Arab oil embargo, is intended to provide a stopgap in case of
disruptions in oil imports. It has been used only once, during the
Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In response to Clinton's package, GOP Rep. J.C. Watts of
Oklahoma welcomed the goal of improved technology. But, he said,
tax credits for research and development ''do nothing for families
who would like to pack up the station wagon and drive to
Yellowstone this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., tempered his praise of a new
heating oil stockpile in the Northeast with concern that the
president's was failing to avert a potential gasoline crisis this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Schumer said, must make clear to the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ''that we stand ready
to immediately release'' oil from the reserve unless OPEC members
agree to swift and substantial production increases.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot let OPEC set the rules any longer,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Senior White House officials advised caution.
</P>
<P>
   ''What will probably be most effective at this point is
effective, quiet diplomacy,'' said Gene Sperling, the president's
chief economic adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The White House chief of staff, John Podesta, said ''we have not
rejected'' use of the emergency reserve but that ''at this point we
don't think it would be a helpful step.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior administration officials privately have expressed concern
that tapping the reserve would interfere with the markets, sending
an unwanted signal to the OPEC ministers and hampering efforts at
significant production increases.
</P>
<P>
   Podesta alluded to those concerns Saturday when he said, ''Our
goal ought to be ... that we get as much of a production increase
as is reasonable'' from OPEC and other oil exporting nations when
they meet later this month.
</P>
<P>
   That is Richardson's goal as he begins another round of
discussions with oil ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The OPEC countries -- joined by non-OPEC producers such as Mexico
and Norway -- curtailed oil production by some 4.3 million barrels a
day in early 1998 to boost prices that had dropped below $10 a
barrel. Since then prices have more than tripled and oil
inventories have fallen to precarious levels.
</P>
<P>
   The high prices and supply shortages caused heating oil prices
to soar last winter as well as gasoline prices to jump dramatically
in recent weeks. Last week, average gasoline prices nationwide
reached $1.57 a gallon, an increase of 11 cents in two weeks. In
some regions prices have jumped even more rapidly, approaching
nearly $2 a gallon.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Key to Balkan Agenda  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX BANDY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Senior European officials and the
premiers of the countries bordering Yugoslavia agreed Saturday that
Montenegro should stay within the Yugoslav federation but with
closer contacts with other nations in the region.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders announced that position at the end of a two-day
meeting that brought together officials from Albania, Bulgaria,
Croatia, Hungary, Macedonia and Romania as well as the president of
the Muslim-Croat federation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The meeting was
a prelude to this month's conference of the Balkan Stabilization
Pact, a Western plan to bring economic development to southeastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Attending part of the sessions were NATO's secretary general,
Lord Robertson, and the European Union's foreign policy chief,
Javier Solana. They both urged Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to end his economic blockade of Montenegro, the smaller
of the two republics which form Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But no one suggested that Montenegro should go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no need for Montenegro to leave the federation now,''
Solana told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The participants expressed concern about fresh violence in
Kosovo and in southern Serbia, including the Presevo Valley, where
ethnic Albanians have taken up arms against Serb rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''The international community must do its utmost to prevent a
new armed conflict,'' Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
</P>
<P>
   While recognizing Montenegro's place within the Yugoslav
federation, Orban and Stability Pact coordinator Bodo Hombach
stressed the need to include Montenegro in the pact's programs.
</P>
<P>
   Hombach said some pact programs will be finalized this month and
implemented within a year. They include building a border crossing
between Kosovo and Macedonia and a Danube bridge linking Romania
and Bulgaria, as well as rebuilding a Danube bridge destroyed in
last year's NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> North Korean Envoy Visits China  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- North Korea's foreign minister met his Chinese
counterpart Saturday at the start of a rare lengthy trip abroad for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Paek Nam Sun of North Korea and Tang Jiaxuan of China exchanged
greetings in front of news cameras before starting a closed-door
meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guest House.
</P>
<P>
   Tang said China had an ''unswerving'' determination to develop
its traditional friendship with North Korea, the state-run Xinhua
News Agency reported. The developing and healthy relationship
between the two countries helps promote peace and stability on the
Korean Peninsula and in the region, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides also pledged to enhance contacts and cooperation
and contribute to maintaining peace and stability, Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
   Paek's trip was expected to last more than 20 days and include
stops in Vietnam, Laos, Malaysia and Indonesia, according to South
Korea's national Yonhap news agency.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare for North Korea's reclusive foreign minister to make
a long trip abroad, but the country has recently been trying to
improve relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Paek was believed to be visiting China to plan for an exchange
of visits by top leaders of the two countries. China is North
Korea's only remaining major communist ally, but their relations
have cooled since China established diplomatic relations with
Pyongyang's rival, South Korea, in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Kills Dozens in Madagascar  </HEADLINE>
By KATYA ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANTANANARIVO, Madagascar (AP) -- A cholera outbreak in
flood-stricken Madagascar has infected more than 1,700 people and
killed at least 100 of them in the past week, officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding has worsened a yearlong epidemic that has claimed
1,425 lives, said Armand Ralaidovy, the Health Ministry's
cholera-fighting coordinator. More than 25,000 people have
contracted the waterborne bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
   Most cases are occurring in the southwest of the African island
nation, where heavy rains have inundated many areas and traditional
burial rites are spreading the disease, Ralaidovy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are keeping dead bodies in carts near their homes for
two or three months before burying them. They are touching them.
This is a cultural problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of cholera victims could be even higher: Many cases
were hidden from authorities because families do not want bodies
treated and promptly buried, Ralaidovy said. That would conflict
with their traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, municipal workers in the capital are wrapping dead
cholera victims in plastic and soaking the corpses with
disinfectant before promptly burying them in a special section of a
public cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   While flooding has not been as severe in Madagascar as in
Mozambique to the west, it has killed at least 130 people on the
island and damaged much of the country's agricultural land. The
World Food Program estimates that more than 43,000 people have lost
their homes or crops.
</P>
<P>
   The epidemic now affects six provinces in Madagascar. Local
health workers said medical supplies were running low in the
region, and getting new supplies to flooded areas was difficult
because of a lack of helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic Relief Services, the Malagasy Red Cross and the French
section of Doctors Without Borders were distributing health kits
and water purification supplies where possible in attempt to curb
the cholera epidemic's spread. The World Food Program said Saturday
it would use a rented helicopter to help distribute food and
supplies in coming days.

<HEADLINE> Slain boy's father becomes intimately involved in politics of gunsafety  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUANESBURG, N.Y. (AP) -- Richard Wooding lost his 10-year-old son
to a single blast from an unlocked pistol in the hands of a
neighborhood teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   So Wooding was pleased to hear New York Gov. George Pataki throw
his support last week behind mandatory trigger locks and a pledge
by Smith &AMP; Wesson to make guns ''child resistant'' in a year.
</P>
<P>
   But he is cautious, too, fearing that recent moves to improve
gun safety might suddenly be scuttled. After all, he trusted the
system to do right by his family after his son's death, and walked
away in despair. Why expect satisfying results from the government
now?
</P>
<P>
   ''These are nice proposals, but I keep thinking, 'Let's see if
they are carried on through and turned into law,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement Wednesday that surprised even his Republican
colleagues in Albany, Pataki called for mandatory trigger locks and
ballistics ''fingerprinting'' -- a process to match a spent bullet
with the gun that fired it. In Washington the same day, the House
of Representatives voted to urge negotiators in Congress to nudge
stalled gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Friday, Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's largest gun
manufacturer, promised safety locks on handguns within a month and
''child resistant'' firearms in a year.
</P>
<P>
   The political will seems to be crystallizing for safer gun
measures as Wooding hoped.
</P>
<P>
   It's taken Columbine. Six-year-old Kayla Rolland's death in a
Michigan classroom. Federal statistics showing 12 children are
killed by guns in America every day. ''The sheer weight of it is
starting to push people,'' Wooding said.
</P>
<P>
   His son, Roarke, the eldest of four children, was shot in the
head Sept. 16, 1998, by Scott O'Malley, then a high school
sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley said he and Roarke had found a gun near their school
bus stop a few days before. It was a .40-caliber Glock
semiautomatic owned by Lt. David C. Wayman, a state environmental
officer who lives within a mile of the boys' homes in rural
Schenectady County.
</P>
<P>
   Wooding and his wife, Roberta, placed their hopes on county
authorities to demonstrate that O'Malley shot their son
intentionally, not by accident as the teen claimed. And they felt,
and continue to feel, disheartened that O'Malley never said he was
sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, O'Malley pleaded guilty to criminally negligent
homicide and was sentenced to community service and one year on
probation. The gun owner, who police said had several other weapons
around his house, was not prosecuted for misplacing the gun that
ended up on the roadside.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment of the gun owner differs markedly from the Feb. 29
shooting in Michigan in which authorities say a first-grader
brought a gun to school to scare Kayla, with whom he had apparently
quarreled, but ended up killing her with one shot. Prosecutors have
charged that boy's 19-year-old uncle with possessing stolen
firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Wooding, a General Electric engineer, said he used to just ''sit
by and watch everything happen.'' Now, he's not only pursuing civil
charges against O'Malley's family and Wayman, but using his
family's tragedy to press for gun-lock legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Roarke, he said, would still be playing hockey and racing
motocross bikes if Wayman's gun contained a lock that can be added
by manufacturers for as little as $3. ''No two ways about it,'' he
said softly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always say I'd rather have been burned alive,'' he said.
''To save somebody from going through this would be tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's gun measures have drawn support in the
Democrat-dominated state Assembly and opposition in the
Republican-held Senate. To bring his voice to bear, Wooding said he
will join in a rally by New Yorkers Against Gun Violence outside
the state Capitol on March 28.

<HEADLINE> Russia Aims To Seal Off S. Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP) -- As jets bombarded suspected rebel
positions in Chechnya's southern mountains, acting President
Vladimir Putin said Saturday that troops will form a barrier to
stop the insurgents from infiltrating the Russian-controlled north.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated Russian claims that the rebels have been
defeated, Putin's call showed that Russian forces are still far
from ending the insurgency in the southern republic.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel groups in the mountains have slipped past federal
positions several times recently to attack troops further north,
inflicting heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will cut off Chechnya's mountainous part where the
militants are feeling comfortable,'' Putin told the Mayak radio
station Saturday. ''We will carry out military and special
operations there, and will be finishing off (the rebels).''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military press center said Saturday that Russian
forces bombed and shelled rebels near 11 towns and villages over
the past 24 hours -- including Urus-Martan, north of the mountains,
Serzhen-Yurt, Agishty, Dzhugurty and Komsomolskoye.
</P>
<P>
   The military claimed to have retaken Komsomolskoye earlier this
week after days of intense fighting. But troops sweeping the city
Saturday met stubborn resistance from Chechen snipers, the military
said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops also combed through the mountain village of
Sharo-Argun. Rebels fled the village overnight, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Putin claimed Saturday that the main rebel forces have been
destroyed, but that many ''animals ... still run around and are
capable of gathering into packs, snapping at us, and attacking.''
</P>
<P>
   Russian airborne troops commander Col. Gen. Georgy Shpak said
clashes in the northern plains ''will continue for a long time,''
Shpak said, according to an Interfax report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Groups of 15 to 20 rebels infiltrate villages in the plains
from Chechnya's mountainous areas,'' he said. ''They easily blend
in with the peaceful residents, making it difficult to identify
them. They are civilians by day, and armed bandits by night.''
</P>
<P>
   Shpak's comments came a day after rebels attacked two targets
deep in Russian-controlled territory. They shelled a bridge across
the Terek River and hit a Russian checkpoint in the village of
Naurskaya.
</P>
<P>
   Russian ground troops entered Chechnya in late September,
preceded by weeks of air raids. The offensive began after rebels
invaded the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan last summer.

<HEADLINE> Czech Human Rights Leader Lis Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Ladislav Lis, a human rights
leader and former dissident who spent several years in communist
jails, died Saturday, the CTK news agency reported. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Lis was a signatory of Charter 77, a human rights movement. He
also co-founded the Committee for the Defense of the Injustly
Prosecuted. The group -- outlawed at the time by the communist
regime -- was set up to oppose prosecution of anti-communist
dissidents, including current Czech President Vaclav Havel.
</P>
<P>
   Lis spent several years in jail in the 1970s and '80s. After the
fall of the communist regime in 1989, Lis was elected a deputy in
the then-Czechoslovak parliament. He served as the head of its
military and security committee for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he was named the chairman of the government's Human
Rights Board.
</P>
<P>
   Details about Lis' death were not immediately available. He is
survived by his wife, Alena Lisova, who was also a dissident.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Urge Restraint in Asia  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton embarked Saturday on a
long-delayed journey to South Asia ready to caution India and
Pakistan to curb their nuclear-weapons competition.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton canceled an expected formal departure statement. ''Gotta
Go,'' he shouted at well wishers as he walked from the White House
to Marine I, the presidential helicopter, his arm draped around the
shoulders of his daughter, Chelsea, and his mother-in-law, Dorothy
Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, passed up the trip
because of her campaign for the U.S. Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the trip with reporters Friday, Clinton said he
will make clear to the governments of India and Pakistan ''our view
that a nuclear future is a dangerous future for them and for the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of things we can do together, a lot of mutual
interests,'' Clinton said. ''Obviously what I hope to do first is
to rekindle the relationship between the United States and India.''
</P>
<P>
   The six-day trip marks the first presidential trip to India in
22 years and the first to Pakistan since 1969. Clinton also will be
the first American president ever to visit Bangladesh, one of the
world's poorest nations, the former eastern half of Pakistan, which
gained independence in the 1971 India-Pakistan war.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India have given few if any indications they will
heed Clinton's plea to step back from a nuclear-armed future and
embrace nonproliferation. Both countries tested nuclear weapons in
1998. While both have said they plan no further tests, neither has
moved to sign the international nuclear test-ban treaty.
</P>
<P>
   The president's efforts to persuade the bickering subcontinental
neighbors are handicapped by the Senate's vote last fall to reject
U.S. participation in the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to do what I can to reduce tensions on the Indian
subcontinent, to reduce the likelihood of weapons proliferation and
the likelihood of conflict,'' the president said Friday. ''And I
want to do what I can to support the restoration of democratic rule
in Pakistan and to continue our cooperation with them against
terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also hopes to rekindle relations with India, the world's
largest democracy, now that tensions generated by the Cold War with
the former Soviet Union, India's friend, have cooled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to deepen ties between our governments, our private
sectors, our scientists, our citizens,'' said Sandy Berger,
Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, Clinton is expected to urge that deposed Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif be spared execution if he is convicted on
charges of hijacking, kidnapping and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also will deliver a live television address to press for
a return to democratic rule in Pakistan after last year's military
coup in which Sharif was deposed. And he is expected to raise U.S.
complaints about terrorism and tensions between Pakistan and India
over the bitterly disputed Himalayan territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been trying to schedule a visit to South Asia for
the last several years, but the nuclear tests and changes in
governments forced delays.
</P>
<P>
   The president also has penciled in some sightseeing during his
five days in India. Accompanied by his daughter, Chelsea, he is to
visit the Taj Mahal at Agra and the Amber Fort near Jaipur.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Cleric Agrees To Meet Rabbi  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- While adamantly rejecting Pope John
Paul II's invitation to participate in a public interfaith
dialogue, Jerusalem's chief Muslim cleric said he would be willing
to meet with Israel's chief rabbi behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the media,'' Mufti Ikrema Sabri told a group of
foreign journalists at his home in this West Bank city, when asked
whether he would talk with Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim leaders have long been wary of even the suggestion of
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last two months, Sabri said, the Higher Islamic
Council, Jerusalem's top Islamic body, turned down the invitation
to the interfaith gathering. In 1967, the council issued a decision
discouraging meetings between Muslim and Jewish religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Taysfir al-Tamini, a lower-ranking Palestinian Muslim
leader from Ramallah, will participate instead in the interfaith
meeting, The dialogue will take place Thursday at Notre Dame, a
Catholic guesthouse in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   A public meeting, Sabri has said, would create the false
impression that the political dispute over Jerusalem has been
settled. Sabri has asked Palestinians not to give up their claims
to the disputed city.
</P>
<P>
   The mufti, an appointee of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
said he would receive the pope Sunday at the al-Aqsa Mosque,
Islam's third holiest shrine, in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Sabri said that it is impossible to separate religious and
political concerns, and he will talk to the pope about the status
of Jerusalem. But he criticized the Israelis for ''using the pope's
visit as a political matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The mufti said that an earlier meeting with Lau was canceled
when the media learned of it. He did not give details, and Lau, who
is chief rabbi for Jews of European origin, was unavailable for
comment on the Jewish Sabbath.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Protest Media Crackdown  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of Serbs opposed to
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic rallied Saturday to protest
the latest move against independent media -- one that left a major
regional broadcaster without its main transmitter.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10,000 people marched through the streets of the southern
town of Kraljevo, chanting slogans against Milosevic and his ruling
Socialist Party and demanding that the station be allowed to resume
normal broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, four men from the Telecommunications Ministry
removed the main transmitter of Radio Television Kraljevo, operated
by the opposition-run municipal government in Kraljevo, 70 miles
south of Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The nighttime raid enraged the local population. In Belgrade,
the leading opposition Democratic Party called for an ''urgent and
efficient action'' to defend stations operated by
opposition-controlled municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment was taken away from the communications tower on
Mt. Goc, near Kraljevo, from which the station covered a wide area
of central and southern Serbia populated by more than 1 million
people. The station still has one smaller transmitter, located in
downtown Kraljevo, which can reach only a quarter of that audience.
</P>
<P>
   An official statement from the Telecommunications Ministry said
its inspectors ''removed the transmitter of Radio-Television
Kraljevo ... because it did not have license to broadcast'' from
the facility.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government in Belgrade has closed or restricted
operations of seven regional stations in the past week. Serbia's
information minister, Aleksandar Vucic, blasted nongovernment media
Saturday for being ''pro-American'' and ''receiving donations from
Western countries with the sole aim to destroy Serbia as an
independent and free state.''
</P>
<P>
   Vucic, a member of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party
allied with Milosevic's Socialists, reiterated that all media
without the required licenses would be shut down. But he declined
to spell out what steps broadcasters must take to obtain licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, about 1,000 people protested for a third
consecutive day in the southeastern town of Pirot, where a similar,
opposition-run local station was shut down Thursday. The station's
journalists have set up a makeshift, open-air studio and read news
through loudspeakers on the town's main square.
</P>
<P>
   When opposition parties won municipal elections in Serbia's main
cities in 1996, they took control of many local outlets. New local
elections are due this year, and Milosevic apparently wants to make
sure his opponents have no way of spreading their message.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the Kraljevo station's previous transmitter on the
Mt. Goc tower was destroyed by NATO in last year's bombing of the
country. NATO targeted the tower to silence Milosevic's powerful
state network, which also uses the facility.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Chen Shui-bian won Taiwan's presidential election
today, defeating the candidate of the party that has ruled this island for more
than half a century. Beijing deeply distrusts Chen because his Democratic
Progressive Party favors taking Taiwan from de-facto to formal independence. But
the president-elect, who has softened his stance on independence to appeal to
nervous voters, immediately pledged to seek dialogue with Beijing. China's first
response to Chen's win was that it would wait to see how he would handle

Clinton: No Quick Fix for Fuel Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today cautioned against ''shortsighted
and risky steps'' to relieve high fuel prices and said Americans hoping for
quick relief from the problem should be patient. ''There's no overnight
solution,'' the president said in his weekly radio address as he announced a
series of modest proposals. None directly addresses the current oil shortages or
eases gasoline prices approaching $2 a gallon -- with the prospect of higher
pump prices during the peak summer driving season. For now, Clinton refuses to
tap the government's emergency oil stockpile, despite appeals from lawmakers
from both parties.

235 Die in Uganda Church Fire

   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- At least 235 followers of a doomsday cult burned to
death in a church fire in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, authorities said
today. It is unclear whether sect leader Joseph Kibweteere died in the fire in
the small trading center of Kanungu, 217 miles from Uganda's capital, Kampala.
He had predicted the world would end Dec. 31, 1999 but changed it to Dec. 31,
2000, after nothing happened, said the independent newspaper The Monitor.
Preliminary reports indicate Kibweteere lured his followers inside the church
and then set it ablaze.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Black Panther Eludes Police  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Sympathetic admirers may be hiding Jamil Abdullah
Al-Amin, the 1960s Black Panther activist wanted for allegedly
killing one sheriff's deputy and wounding another, authorities said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 56-year-old former black militant known as H. Rap Brown has
eluded authorities since Thursday night. The FBI has joined the
national manhunt, issuing a federal fugitive warrant for his
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. David Chadd, chief spokesman for the Fulton County
Sheriff's Department, said Saturday that it was ''a distinct
possibility'' that Al-Amin was being harbored by friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will leave no stone unturned until we find this man,''
Chadd said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin is charged with murder and aggravated battery. Police
say Al-Amin opened fire Thursday night on two Fulton County
deputies as they tried to arrest him for failing to appear in court
on theft charges.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Ricky Kinchen, 35, died the next day. Aldranon English,
28, who was shot in the chest, arms and legs, was hospitalized in
good condition Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin is a respected Islamic spiritual leader in Atlanta's
West End. Neighbors say he organized summer games for youth and
helped drug users kick their addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Nadir Ali, a spokesman for the Community Mosque of Atlanta,
cautioned people not to jump to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask you to avoid passing judgment until all the facts are
in, and not use the media to accuse, try and convict Imam Jamil
Abdullah Al-Amin,'' Ali said.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies had tried to arrest Al-Amin at his store Thursday.
The warrant had been issued after he failed to appear in court in
January for charges of theft by receiving stolen property,
impersonating an officer and having no proof of insurance.
</P>
<P>
   As the deputies approached a car at the store, the driver got
out and started firing a .223-caliber assault rifle. Atlanta Police
Chief Beverly Harvard said English later identified the shooter as
Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe Al-Amin also was wounded because of a trail
of blood from where the shooting occurred to a nearby vacant house.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin moved to Atlanta in 1976 after converting to Islam while
serving five years in prison for his role in a robbery that ended
in a shootout with New York police. He found the 100-member
Community Mosque of Atlanta, an orthodox group that belongs to the
mainline Sunni branch of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   As justice minister of the Black Panthers in the 1960s, H. Rap
Brown once exhorted blacks to arm themselves, saying, ''Violence is
as American as cherry pie.''

<HEADLINE> Drinking, prescription drugs led to overdoes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A night of drinking and snorting a mix of
prescription drugs is believed to have caused the death of a
22-year-old Trinity College student, and the illnesses of three
other students, a poison control official said.
</P>
<P>
   The mixture of drugs may have included antidepressants, migraine
and sleeping pills, said Dr. Mary McCormick, administrative
director of the Connecticut Poison Control Center. The students may
also have taken heroin, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Police were awaiting the results of toxicology reports, Sgt.
Norberto Huertas said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The information we have is leading us to believe that it could
be possibly opiates or heroin,'' Huertas said.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Doroff, a senior from Harrison, N.Y., died shortly after
noon Friday at Hartford Hospital. He was a political science and
economics major.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Kaupp, 22, of New Jersey, was in critical condition
Saturday at Hartford Hospital, a hospital spokesman said. His
hometown was not available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two other students were admitted to the hospital for observation
and later arrested on charges of possession of narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   William B. Bachman, 21, of South Natick, Mass., and Joshua B.
Eaves, 22, of Downingtown, Pa., were scheduled to be arraigned
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The four men, all seniors, may have been partying to celebrate
the end of mid-term exams, said Huertas.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from one of the victims, the four men
were snorting a combination of drugs including the antidepressants
Xanax and Valium, the migraine medication Butalbital, and sleeping
pills, McCormick said. All of those drug depress the central
nervous system, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity President Evan Dobelle on Saturday expressed sympathy
for the students' families and said such incidents can, and do,
happen on any campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''At Trinity, we have committed time, talent and resources to
the cause of educating our students about the risks -- and the
consequences -- of drug and alcohol use,'' he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sadly today we must confront the reality of one of our worst
nightmares. And as we struggle to cope with a loss that has broken
our hearts ... we also will struggle to make sense of it and learn
from it.''

Taiwan Elects Opposition President

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwain President-elect Chen Shui-bian is to succeed
retiring President Lee Teng-hui in May, ending the Nationalist Party's 51-year
rule on the island -- much of it under repressive martial law. Beijing deeply
distrusts Chen because his Democratic Progressive Party favors taking Taiwan
from de-facto to formal independence. But the president-elect, who has softened
his stance on independence to appeal to nervous voters, immediately pledged to

Clinton: No Quick Fix for Fuel Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today in his weekly radio address
that Americans hoping for quick relief from high fuel prices should be patient.
Clinton cautioned against ''shortsighted and risky steps'' to address the
problem. ''There's no overnight solution,'' the president said as he announced a
series of modest proposals. None directly addresses the current oil shortages or
eases gasoline prices approaching $2 a gallon -- with the prospect of higher
pump prices during the peak summer driving season. For now, Clinton refuses to
tap the government's emergency oil stockpile, despite appeals from lawmakers
from both parties.

nonproliferation. The six-day trip marks the first presidential trip to India in
22 years and the first to Pakistan since 1969. Clinton also will be the first

235 Die in Uganda Church Fire
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- At least 235 followers of a doomsday cult burned to
death in a church fire in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, authorities said
today. It is unclear whether sect leader Joseph Kibweteere died in the fire in
the small trading center of Kanungu, 217 miles from Uganda's capital, Kampala.
He had predicted the world would end Dec. 31, 1999 but changed it to Dec. 31,
2000, after nothing happened, said the independent newspaper The Monitor.
Preliminary reports indicate Kibweteere lured his followers inside the church
and then set it ablaze.

Muslim cleric said he would be willing to meet with Israel's chief rabbi behind
closed doors. ''Without the media,'' Mufti Ikrema Sabri said, when asked whether
he would talk with Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau. Muslim leaders have long been

states' sales taxes should apply to e-commerce. Extending the freeze beyond
October 2001, when it is set to expire, seems to have support from a majority of
the 19-member Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce heading into its final

Congress repeal the century-old 3 percent telephone excise tax and permanently

<HEADLINE> Jesuit: He's Not Anti-Semitic  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- A prominent Jesuit insisted Saturday that
his remarks that ''the Jews have killed Christ'' were taken out of
context and he expressed dismay that he was made to sound
anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations have been outraged at the comments by the
Rev. Peter Gumpel, who was appointed by the Vatican to lead the
cause for beatification of Pius XII, the wartime pontiff accused by
many Jews of not speaking out against the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, which defends Pius XII as a man who pursued peace
discreetly, is considering him for beatification, the last formal
step before the process toward sainthood can begin.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, who on Monday begins a week's pilgrimage to
the Holy Land, including Israel, has made improving relations with
Jews a priority of his papacy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the ground for better ties was laid in 1965 under Paul
VI, with a Vatican statement that said the Jews cannot be
collectively blamed for the crucifixion of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview broadcast on Thursday on CBC television and also
aired Friday on ''CBS Evening News,'' Gumpel said it is ''an
undeniable historical fact'' that Jews killed Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have discussed this with a Jewish colleague, a university
professor, and he said, 'Well, my dear professor,' he said, 'what
do you want? Our forefathers found out that Christ was a false
prophet, so we killed him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Ronen, president of the Canadian Jewish Congress,
denounced what he called ''anti-Semitic calumny.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I am amazed. I'm shocked and outraged,'' Holocaust expert Elie
Wiesel said in a Canadian Press story Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gumpel, a German based in Rome, told The Associated Press on
Saturday that he was particularly pained by the idea that some
might think him an anti-Semite because the Nazis killed several
members of his family who had spoken out against them.
</P>
<P>
   Gumpel said he spent two hours with the Canadian crew and ''they
take one sentence, leaving out the context,'' he said. ''I don't
think this is honest journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Gumpel said the thrust of his remarks on the subject to the
journalists went like this: ''The Jews pressed Pilate to crucify
him (Jesus). This has never been denied by Jewish scholars.
However, this doesn't mean that the Jews of then or of this time
were responsible'' for Jesus' death, Gumpel said, contending that
his context was deliberately ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel very strongly that quote was not taken out of context
and we stand by our story,'' said spokeswoman Sandy Genelius, who
added that CBS News officials had read the full transcript.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Engineers Vote on Settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing engineers and technical workers will cast
secret ballots Sunday on the proposed settlement of their strike
against the aerospace giant, which has lasted more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders hailed the tentative three-year agreement as a
victory and recommended acceptance of the proposal, which offers
raises, bonuses and extended health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''The resolve and commitment of the people won this contract,''
said Charles Bofferding, executive director of the Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, who helped
engineer the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But many on the picket lines remained skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''This strike was all about respect and a partnership with
management,'' said flight test engineer Jonathan McNutt, 43.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see it in this contract offer,'' he said. ''It's the
same old stuff. That's sad.'' McNutt said he probably will vote to
reject the proposal, which is the fourth offer made by the company.
</P>
<P>
   The contract grants wage increases of at least 9 percent and
cash bonuses totaling $2,500 over 12 months. Health coverage would
be extended to domestic partners. The company has dropped its
demand for worker contributions toward health-insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   If the offer is accepted, SPEEA members will return to work at 9
a.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said
the tentative agreement would at least assuage fears on Wall Street
and said he viewed the agreement as a milepost in the company's
relationship with SPEEA.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we can look back at this as a turning point, a time
when it was clearly recognized how important it will be to listen
carefully and understand each other,'' he said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout that began Feb. 9 took more than 17,000 engineers
and technical workers off the job, by the union's count, mostly in
the Puget Sound area. Recent Boeing estimates put the number of
strikers at 15,000. SPEEA represents 22,352 workers, of whom
roughly two-thirds are dues-paying union members.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing deliveries have slipped by more than 15 airplanes and
work on some government contracts also has suffered.

<HEADLINE> Anti-NATO Protest in Greece  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   THESSALONIKI, Greece (AP) -- About 300 people chanting ''Clinton
Killer'' rallied Saturday against NATO plans to land 2,000 troops
in this northern port city on their way to Kosovo for a military
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The protests, backed by Greece's small but defiant Communist
Party, were expected to swell Sunday, when 1,100 U.S. troops and
about 900 from Argentina, The Netherlands, Poland and Romania were
scheduled to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers are to travel overland to neighboring Macedonia and
into Kosovo to take part in the exercise, nicknamed Dynamic
Response 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''This invasion by American ... marines is a provocation for the
Greek people,'' Communist Party leader Aleka Papariga said.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists led rowdy rallies across Greece last year, during
NATO's 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia. They also held protests during
President Clinton's visit to Athens in November.
</P>
<P>
   Although Greece is a NATO member, many Greeks condemned the
bombing, appearing suspicious of the motives of the U.S.-led
intervention and sympathizing with the fellow Orthodox Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   More anti-NATO protests were planned in Athens and other cities
for next week to mark the anniversary of the start of the bombing.
The demonstrations could place renewed pressure on Greece's
Socialist government ahead of general elections April 9.

<HEADLINE> Challenger Warns Senegal President  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- On the eve of Senegal's contentious
election, the challenger accused President Abdou Diouf of preparing
to fix the vote and repeated warnings of a spontaneous revolution
by angry voters.
</P>
<P>
   Fiery opposition politician Abdoulaye Wade said he would not be
responsible if public insurrection resulted from a Diouf win in
Sunday's runoff vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''History shows that it is rare for a revolution to be
organized,'' Wade told journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Wade added that he was a ''liberal'' politician and was not
planning to lead a revolt.
</P>
<P>
   However, he predicted that Diouf would use fraud in a bid to
win, and accused the incumbent of recently replacing election
officials in some ballot stations in the capital, where Wade won
most of his support in the first round on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal's Interior Ministry, which is supervising the voting,
said Saturday that everything was in place for a free and fair
ballot, private radio station Sud FM reported.
</P>
<P>
   Army units were patrolling the southern Casamance province,
where separatist rebels launched scattered attacks during the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning ended Friday with Diouf -- who has a reputation of
being aloof -- giving a flurry of animated press conferences. Wade
held several rallies in major cities during the final days of the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, the most contentious since Senegal's independence
in 1960, is seen by some observers as a test for democracy in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ruling parties in Africa, which often control campaign funds and
even electoral authorities, rarely lose at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal is one of the few countries in Africa to hold regular
elections, although the ruling Socialist Party has easily won
previous polls. This is Senegal's first election to go to a second
round, and Sunday's runoff is likely to be a close race.
</P>
<P>
   The United States called on both candidates Friday to abide by
the will of the Senegalese people.
</P>
<P>
   ''All parties must avoid confrontations so that the electoral
process proceeds peacefully for the good of the country,'' State
Department spokesman James P. Rubin said in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf, whose Socialist Party has ruled Senegal since
independence from France in 1960, won 41 percent support in the
first round on Feb. 27, compared to 31 percent for Wade.
</P>
<P>
   For the runoff, however, Wade has the backing of five of the
seven other contenders in the previous round. Djibo Ka, who came in
fourth with 7 percent, has thrown his support behind Diouf -- though
many of his followers said they would not follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Diouf's backers point to Senegal's reputation as one of Africa's
most stable nations, with a vibrant trading economy despite few
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Diouf of fostering a corrupt elite and ignoring
the country's poor since he became president in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 2.7 million people were registered for the first round of
voting, but it was unclear how many actually cast ballots. The vote
was marred by sporadic violence and other irregularities, but
judged relatively smooth and fair by international observers.

<HEADLINE> Survey Eyes Swiss Anti-Semitism  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Ruth Dreifuss, who served last year
as Switzerland's first-ever Jewish or woman president, warned in a
newspaper interview Saturday against a ''creeping acceptance'' of
anti-Semitism in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifuss, a Social Democrat who held the rotating presidency
last year, said a survey that found anti-Semitic tendencies in a
major nationalist party was cause for concern, according to the
daily Tages-Anzeiger.
</P>
<P>
   The American-sponsored survey, released Wednesday, indicated
that many Swiss reject anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   But it also showed that one-third of the Swiss People's Party's
voters think anti-Semitically. If the survey is correct, Dreifuss
said, the party leadership faces a great responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Christoph Blocher, the outspoken billionaire industrialist who
is the party's best-known leader, must make it clear he does not
support such tendencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The party is the furthest to the right of the four parties,
including Dreifuss' Social Democrats, in the governing coalition.
The Swiss People's Party has opposed closer ties to the European
Union and called for curbs on immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ''The creeping acceptance of anti-Semitism is very dangerous,''
Dreifuss said. ''Racism must never become acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The survey, sponsored by the American Jewish Committee, found
that 16 percent of the Swiss population holds anti-Semitic views.
</P>
<P>
   The survey indicated that an increase in prejudice against Jews
came about in the 1990s, when the international community began
scrutinizing neutral Switzerland's treatment of Holocaust assets
and Jewish refugees during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's sponsors said latent anti-Semitism could be much
more widespread.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Art Emerges From Isolation  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Like the country itself, Iranian art is
emerging from years of isolation thanks to President Mohammad
Khatami's reforms, one of Iran's top painters said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iranian art has been isolated internationally since Iran's
1979 revolution. But under President Khatami's reformist and
expanded cultural policies, it is now coming out of isolation,''
said Parviz Kalantari, a member of Iran's Society of Painters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Iranian cinema was able to conquer the world because it was
able to promote itself internationally. But we painters feel that
we are being led out of a dark room,'' he said. ''We're just taking
the first steps to renew ties with the outside world, hoping that
our work, too, will find its deserved place in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a former culture minister, is credited with having
revived Iranian cinema, which had all but died after the
revolution. Now, Iranian films gain praise around the world,
routinely winning prizes at international festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Kalantari and three other Iranian artists are being sent to
Spain by Iran's state-owned Museum of Contemporary Arts for a
weeklong exhibition that opens Tuesday in Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   The museum owns a rich collection of Western art bought by the
shah before he was overthrown. Works kept in an underground vault
are now being publicly displayed as the museum boosts ties with the
outside world, Kalantari said. The museum recently loaned Spain a
Picasso, he said.

Clinton Wants Taiwan, China To Meet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China and Taiwan have a new opportunity for peaceful
dialogue in the aftermath of elections that brought an independence-minded party
to power on the island, President Clinton said today. He offered congratulations
to the winner, Chen Shui-bian, of the Democratic Progressive Party. Clinton said
the election, which ended a half-century's domination of Taiwan politics by
founding President Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party, ''clearly demonstrates
the strength and vitality of Taiwan's democracy.'' China has repeatedly
threatened to wage war to block formal independence by Taiwan, but its first
response to Chen's win was that it would wait to see how he would handle
relations.

Report: Criminal Probe in Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- What began as an inquiry into maintenance practices at an
Alaska Airlines facility has become a criminal investigation into the deadly
crash of Flight 261, The Seattle Times reported today. Citing unidentified
sources, the newspaper said the FBI and Department of Transportation
investigators have been questioning Alaska Airlines employees. No criminal
wrongdoing has been established in connection with the Jan. 31 crash off the
coast of California that killed 88 people, the Times said.

Clinton: No Quick Fix for Fuel Prices
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today in his weekly radio address
that Americans hoping for quick relief from high fuel prices should be patient.
Clinton cautioned against ''shortsighted and risky steps'' to address the
problem. ''There's no overnight solution,'' the president said as he announced a
series of modest proposals. None directly addresses the current oil shortages or
eases gasoline prices approaching $2 a gallon -- with the prospect of higher
pump prices during the peak summer driving season. For now, Clinton refuses to
tap the government's emergency oil stockpile.

<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's minority Serb community balked at
joining a U.N.-led interim government, insisting that Western leaders first take
strong measures to stop attacks against their dwindling community by the
Albanian majority. Leaders of the remaining Serb enclaves in Kosovo met with
Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator, at the Serb monastery in
Gracanica, just outside Pristina, the provincial capital, Yugoslavia's
independent Beta news agency reported. Kouchner urged the Serbs to join the
U.N.-established government, currently dominated by Kosovo's ethnic Albanians,
as a way to protect their interests.

Md. Murder Suspect in Standoff
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A heavily armed man suspected of killing four people
remained holed up with at least three hostages in an apartment today, as
relatives and friends pleaded for him to come out. The emotional appeals were
aired live on local television stations in hopes that Joseph Palczynski would be
watching. Police said the apartment just east of Baltimore is that of a relative
of Tracy Whitehead, the former girlfriend Palczynski is accused of briefly
kidnapping. Palczynski is believed to be holding hostage Whitehead's mother,
Lynn, her brother and another person.

Fire Kills 235 Ugandan Cult Members
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- At least 235 followers of a doomsday cult burned to
death in a church fire in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, authorities said
today. It is unclear whether sect leader Joseph Kibweteere died in the fire in
the small trading center of Kanungu, 217 miles from Uganda's capital, Kampala.
He had predicted the world would end Dec. 31, 1999 but changed it to Dec. 31,
2000, after nothing happened, said the independent newspaper The Monitor.
Preliminary reports indicate Kibweteere lured his followers inside the church
and then set it ablaze.

''any gun makers that adopt a new code of responsible conduct.'' Smith &AMP; Wesson

<HEADLINE> Cuba Seeks Trade Balance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Cuba must cut back on unnecessary imports and
boost exports, the communist government's economic planners said in
comments published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Without providing specifics on Cuba's trade deficit, economics
minister Jose Luis Rodriguez and trade minister Ricardo Cabrisas
reported that Cuba's trade with other countries last year was $5.1
billion, down 3 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The ministers made their assessment, quoted in the Communist
Party daily Granma, following an annual look at Cuba's trade
situation. A breakdown of products and trade currencies was not
provided.
</P>
<P>
   Total exports were down 4 percent in 1999 from the previous
year, in large part because of a 37 percent drop in sugar prices.
Nevertheless, Cuba has seen an overall increase in exports over the
decade, following the collapse of the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Imports fell 3 percent from 1998, mostly because of increasing
prices on combustible and other goods. The ministers underscored
the need to produce in Cuba many of the things it is importing to
balance the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba does business with 146 countries, the most important trade
partners being Spain and Canada, followed by Venezuela, China and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Europe accounts for 45 percent of Cuba's trade, while Latin
America accounts for 38 percent.

<HEADLINE> Smith &AMP; Wesson Earns Preference  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban
Development and the mayors of Atlanta, Detroit and Miami on
Saturday directed their law enforcement agencies to give preference
to Smith &AMP; Wesson when buying guns and called on municipal leaders
nationwide to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The directive gives preference to ''any gun makers that adopt a
new code of responsible conduct,'' but -- for the time being at
least -- that directs all of the gun and ammunition business
generated by the country's 3,200 public housing authorities and the
police and sheriff's departments of three of the nation's biggest
cities to use Smith &AMP; Wesson products.
</P>
<P>
   The company signed an unprecedented agreement with the Clinton
administration on Friday to include safety locks with all of its
handguns to make them more childproof.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the agreement calls for federal, state and city
lawsuits against the gun maker to be dropped and says no new suits
will be filed seeking to hold them responsible for shootings
committed with their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any company that signs this agreement deserves our support and
our business for acting responsibly,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo
said. ''It would be near lunacy to patronize a company more likely
to be providing criminals guns when you are in the business of
hiring police officers to fight the criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson spokesman Ken Jorgensen said he was pleasantly
surprised by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have to say it's good news for Smith &AMP; Wesson. It
certainly wasn't part of anything that was discussed as part of the
agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo, Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer
and Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penales urged local governments
around the country to issue a similar directive to their law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how much business the directive
would generate for Smith &AMP; Wesson, but Cuomo said that
approximately one-third of gun purchases in this country are made
by federal, state and local law enforcement each year. HUD's annual
budget for security at public housing complexes is close to $1
billion per year, HUD spokesman David Egner said.
</P>
<P>
   The company does not release annual sales figures, whether they
be to private buyers or government agencies, Jorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no ''quid pro quo'' giving Smith &AMP; Wesson the
government's business in exchange for the company's cooperation,
HUD officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If another manufacturer adopts the code tomorrow, that
manufacturer will get the same preference,'' Egner said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo acknowledged that the move could bring large market
pressures to bear Smith &AMP; Wesson's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could say that it is an incentive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association spokesman Bill Powers declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The president and CEO of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, Robert Delfay, did not return a telephone message left
at his office Saturday seeking comment. On Friday, after the
initial announcement, Delfay criticized the pact, saying, ''I am
deeply disturbed by the fact that Smith &AMP; Wesson has allowed the
Clinton-Gore Administration to manipulate the company in this
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The directive does not order the agencies to immediately replace
all of their guns with Smith &AMP; Wesson products, but rather from
this point forward, to purchase them from gun makers that adopt the
new code.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Archer said Detroit's competitive bidding
process dictates that Smith &AMP; Wesson cannot be mentioned by name,
but it can be administered in a way that only Smith &AMP; Wesson, or
any other gun maker that agrees to the Clinton administration's
terms, can actually bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a hard thing to do,'' said spokesman Gregory Bowens.
''By doing so, we would try to make them the gun maker of choice
for Detroit's law enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said he could not estimate how much money the city spends
on handguns for its police department, but said, ''We have several
classes of new police officers every year, and each one of those
officers needs a handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson will install external locks
within 60 days, with internal locks to be installed within two
years. The company also agreed to a ''code of conduct'' for selling
and distributing handguns that prohibits the marketing of weapons
in a way that appeals to juveniles or criminals, and Smith &AMP; Wesson
will devote 2 percent of firearms revenues every year to developing
''smart'' technology that limits a gun's use to its rightful owner.
</P>
<P>
   The directive issued Saturday also encourages municipal
authorities to apply the same requirement to private subcontractors
that provide security.

<HEADLINE> Plane in Panama Still Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- Authorities spent a second
unsuccessful day Saturday searching for a small plane carrying 10
people they believed might have been hijacked during a flight to an
area near the Colombian border.
</P>
<P>
   Land, air and sea rescuers said they would resume the search for
the twin-engine plane Sunday. The plane took off Friday from Panama
City, headed for Puerto Obaldia, near the Panama-Colombia border
and about 180 miles from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   At least two police helicopters were to spend the night in the
Caribbean area where air traffic controllers lost radar contact
with the plane, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Panama also asked Colombia for help in determining if the plane
flew over the border.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities hadn't ruled out a hijacking, since there were no
reports of noise, smoke or radio transmissions to indicate the
plane had crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers were two crew members and eight passengers,
including four children. Two of the passengers were Colombian.
</P>
<P>
   Civil aeronautics director Jaime Fabrega said the plane was
about 80 miles from Puerto Obaldia when it disappeared from radar
screens. It had been flying at a low altitude.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas from Colombia's largest rebel group -- the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- have been in the area near
Puerto Obaldia. In November, Colombian guerrillas disguised as
tourists stole two private helicopters nearby.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Balk at U.N.-Led Government  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's minority Serb community
balked Saturday at joining a U.N.-led interim government, insisting
that Western leaders first take strong measures to stop attacks
against their dwindling community by the Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the remaining Serb enclaves in Kosovo met with
Bernard Kouchner, the chief U.N. administrator, at the Serb
monastery in Gracanica, just outside Pristina, the provincial
capital, Yugoslavia's independent Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner urged the Serbs to join the U.N.-established
government, currently dominated by Kosovo's ethnic Albanians, as a
way to protect their interests.
</P>
<P>
   However, Momcilo Trajkovic, a key Kosovo Serb leader, said that
the community demands progress on stopping violence against Serbs
in Kosovo before signing on to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks are by ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for
President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against Kosovo,
which sparked NATO's bombing campaign against Yugoslavia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs also want Kouchner to issue a public invitation asking
them to return to Kosovo. A final decision on joining the
government was postponed for 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner, meanwhile, told the French Communist newspaper
L'Humanite, that reconciliation between Serbs and ethnic Albanians
in the divided province was ''absolutely impossible'' at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's weekend edition quoted Kouchner as saying that
the two communities' hatred of each other was ''extremely strong''
and said there were no relations between them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who is crazy enough to think that in eight months we could
have done what they haven't been able to do in Ireland for 30
years?''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 Serbs have fled Kosovo since last year's NATO
military intervention ended the Serbian government's rule in the
southern province. It is now governed by U.N. officials and
patrolled by NATO peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the German newspaper Welt am Sonntag, the
commander of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission, German Gen. Klaus
Reinhardt, said it could take five to 10 more years for the
international force to stabilize the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that gloomy assessment, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright challenged European governments Saturday to stay united in
face of the deteriorating situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Albright, making a brief stop in Venice, Italy, before heading
to join President Clinton in India, also urged speeded-up training
of police forces to augment the international military mission.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is essential that national civil police move in. It is
untenable to ask the military to continue to serve this civilian
function,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, seven Czech soldiers from the NATO-led peacekeeping
mission were briefly detained by Serb police Saturday just across
Kosovo's administrative boundary, an alliance spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-led Kosovo Force, known as KFOR, said the soldiers were
to be released by Saturday night. The reasons for the detention
were unclear.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Oil Producers Push for Deal  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY HARRUP, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Mexican oil producers have agreed with key
OPEC members that more crude should be put on the market to bring
down prices, Mexico's energy minister said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after a ceremony to mark the 62nd
anniversary of the expropriation of the Mexican oil industry,
Minister Luis Tellez said the main producers agreed with Mexico
that there should be an increase in output next month.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico's producers refused to discuss the amount they were
considering for the increase, Tellez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no established range. With the ministers I spoke to,
we agreed not to give out any numbers until there is agreement
among us,'' Tellez said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is not a member of OPEC, but has played a leading role
since 1998 in efforts to curb world output after prices fell to
historic lows. Mexico was also the first to call for greater output
at the end of this month, when the agreements expire.
</P>
<P>
   Key OPEC members have agreed on the need for more crude in the
market to bring down prices and boost falling stocks, though the
cartel isn't expected to reach an agreement before a March 27
meeting in Vienna. Mexico is to attend as an observer.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo told oil workers at the
anniversary commemoration Saturday that Mexico would continue its
cooperation with other oil-producing countries to establish
sustainable prices.
</P>
<P>
   But he also warned against ''irresponsible optimism'' over
current prices, which have been above $31 a barrel for benchmark
crudes.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Jabs Former Reform Members  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHRISTIANA, Del. (AP) -- With jabs at former Reform Party figures
Jesse Ventura and Donald Trump, presidential candidate Pat Buchanan
told about 40 supporters on Saturday he feels good about his
standing with Delaware's 280 or so Reform Party voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're making sure we've got a strong cadre,'' he said. ''I
think we've got a good core group here.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's appearance coincided with the election of a new state
party chairman, William A. Shields. The outgoing chairman left
after Ventura, the Minnesota governor, left the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Shields said there are about 280 registered Reform Party voters
in Delaware, but that he hoped to see a surge in registration with
Buchanan campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   There are four Reform Party delegates in Delaware and Buchanan's
national political director, Tim Haley said, they're all behind
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing recent turmoil in the party, Buchanan said: ''Jesse
Ventura left the party saying 'I'm leaving because this is a
dysfunctional party.' Well, he left, and now it's functioning just
fine. And the great Donald Trump is departing -- we lost a great
statesman there.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to the Reform Party's national convention Aug. 15
in Long Beach, Calif., Buchanan said: ''The Reform Party's becoming
more cohesive, more unified, more directed. By the time we get out
to Long Beach, it's going to be a united, small, energized party,
ready to go into this general election.''

<HEADLINE> Three Arrested in Desert Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Calif. (AP) -- Three people were arrested after
they allegedly led authorities on a 70-mile chase through two
states then shot down a police helicopter during a daylong standoff
in a bleak Death Valley gully.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported during Friday's desert siege, part of
an 18-hour confrontation that began when the trio allegedly fled
Nevada authorities in a car filled with guns and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested were Lloyd Burrus, 44, and Cheryl Maarteuse, 50, both
of Downey, Idaho, and Jeffrey Burrus, 20, of Emeryville, Calif.,
according to a statement from the Inyo County Sheriff's Department.
It was not immediately known whether the two men were related.
</P>
<P>
   The three could face charges of attempted murder of a peace
officer and shooting at aircraft in flight, the sheriff's
department said. They remained jailed Saturday in this small
eastern Sierra town.
</P>
<P>
   The chase began Friday after the Nevada Highway Patrol stopped a
car about 60 miles north of Las Vegas. The officer saw a shotgun in
the vehicle before it sped away.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects eventually stopped in Death Valley National Park,
where they used rocks to barricade themselves in a gully.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just hunkered down for the rest of the day, periodically
firing off rounds,'' park spokesman Tim Stone said.
</P>
<P>
   A California Highway Patrol helicopter was shot and damaged
badly enough that it had to land. The crew was not injured.

who was an assistant to Phog Allen, coached Wilt Chamberlain and
helped bring current coach Roy Williams to Kansas, died Saturday.
He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   Harp was an assistant under Allen from 1949 to 1956, then had a
121-82 record in eight seasons as coach.

   Allen recruited Harp from Rosedale High School in Kansas City,
Kan., beginning what would become a 60-year relationship with the
basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   As a player, Harp was a three-year letterman from 1938 to 1940.
He was a starting guard on the 1940 Kansas team that lost to
Indiana in the NCAA finals.
</P>
<P>
   In his first season as head coach, Harp took the Jayhawks with
Chamberlain to the NCAA finals in 1957. No. 2 Kansas lost to
undefeated and No. 1 North Carolina in triple overtime, 54-53.

Report: Criminal Probe in Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- An Alaska Airlines facility has become a criminal
investigation into the deadly crash of Flight 261, The Seattle Times reported
today. The newspaper said the FBI and Department of Transportation investigators
have been questioning Alaska Airlines employees. No criminal wrongdoing has been
established in the Jan. 31 crash off the coast of California that killed 88
people, the Times said. The criminal investigation grew out of a 15-month-old
inquiry into practices at Alaska's maintenance facility at Oakland, Calif. A
grand jury in San Francisco is investigating whether supervisors signed for
repairs that weren't done or that they weren't authorized to approve.

Opposition Wins Taiwan Election

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Chen Shui-bian, vilified by China as radical who would
thrust Taiwan toward independence and war, won Taiwan's presidential election
Saturday, trouncing the candidate of the party that has ruled this island for
more than half a century. Beijing deeply distrusts Chen because his Democratic
Progressive Party favors taking Taiwan from de-facto to formal independence and
making the 51-year-old split with China permanent. But the president-elect, who
has softened his stance on independence to appeal to nervous voters, immediately
pledged to seek dialogue with Beijing.

   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- At least 235 followers of a doomsday cult burned to
death in a church fire in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, authorities said
Saturday. It is unclear whether sect leader Joseph Kibweteere died in the fire
in the small trading center of Kanungu, 217 miles from Uganda's capital,
Kampala. He had predicted the world would end Dec. 31, 1999 but changed it to
Dec. 31, 2000, after nothing happened, said the independent newspaper The

Challenger Warns Senegal President

   DAKAR, Senegal (AP) -- On the eve of Senegal's contentious election, the
challenger accused President Abdou Diouf of preparing to fix the vote and
repeated warnings of a spontaneous revolution by angry voters. Fiery opposition
politician Abdoulaye Wade said he would not be responsible if public
insurrection resulted from a Diouf win in Sunday's runoff vote. ''History shows
that it is rare for a revolution to be organized,'' Wade told journalists. Wade
added that he was a ''liberal'' politician and was not planning to lead a
revolt. However, he predicted that Diouf would use fraud in a bid to win, and
accused the incumbent of recently replacing election officials in some ballot

<HEADLINE> Smith &AMP; Wesson Gets Preference  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban
Development and the mayors of Atlanta, Detroit and Miami moved
Saturday to see that their law enforcement agencies give preference
to Smith &AMP; Wesson when buying guns and called on others to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The preference would apply to ''any gun makers that adopt a new
code of responsible conduct,'' but -- for the time being at least --
that means Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   The company signed an unprecedented agreement with the Clinton
administration on Friday to, among other things, include safety
locks with all of its handguns to make them more childproof.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the agreement calls for federal, state and city
lawsuits against the gun maker to be dropped and says no new suits
will be filed seeking to hold them responsible for shootings
committed with their guns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any company that signs this agreement deserves our support and
our business for acting responsibly,'' HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo
said. ''It would be near lunacy to patronize a company more likely
to be providing criminals guns when you are in the business of
hiring police officers to fight the criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo acknowledged that the nation's 3,200 public housing
authorities are directly responsible for security and gun purchases
and that his proposed regulation, which will have to undergo a
lenghty period of public comment and congressional oversight, could
be implemented only by threatening to withhold federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would encourage local housing authorities to apply
the same requirement to private subcontractors that provide
security under government contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo noted that mayors and other local officials have more
direct authority over gun purchases of the law enforcement agencies
under their direction than he does over housing project guards.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer and
Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex Penales joined Cuomo in urging local
governments around the country to take similar steps and said they
would act directly in their own jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson spokesman Ken Jorgensen said he was pleasantly
surprised by the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have to say it's good news for Smith &AMP; Wesson. It
certainly wasn't part of anything that was discussed as part of the
agreement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how much business the initiative
would generate for Smith &AMP; Wesson, but Cuomo said that
approximately one-third of gun purchases in this country are made
by federal, state and local law enforcement each year -- from a
variety of manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson does not release annual sales figures, whether to
private buyers or government agencies, Jorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no ''quid pro quo'' giving Smith &AMP; Wesson the
government's business in exchange for the company's cooperation,
HUD officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If another manufacturer adopts the code tomorrow, that
manufacturer will get the same preference,'' said HUD spokesman
David Egner.
</P>
<P>
   But Cuomo said the move could bring large market pressures to
bear Smith &AMP; Wesson's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could say that it is an incentive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association spokesman Bill Powers declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The president and CEO of the National Shooting Sports
Foundation, Robert Delfay, did not return a telephone message left
at his office Saturday seeking comment. On Friday, after the
initial announcement, Delfay criticized the pact, saying, ''I am
deeply disturbed by the fact that Smith &AMP; Wesson has allowed the
Clinton-Gore Administration to manipulate the company in this
manner.''
</P>
<P>
   The initiatives would not require agencies to immediately
replace all of their guns with Smith &AMP; Wesson products, but rather
from this point forward to purchase them from gun makers that adopt
the new code.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Archer said Detroit's competitive bidding
process dictates that Smith &AMP; Wesson cannot be mentioned by name,
but it can be administered in a way that only Smith &AMP; Wesson, or
any other gun maker that agrees to the Clinton administration's
terms, can actually bid.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not a hard thing to do,'' said spokesman Gregory Bowens.
''By doing so, we would try to make them the gun maker of choice
for Detroit's law enforcement agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowen said he could not estimate how much money the city spends
on handguns for its police department, but said, ''We have several
classes of new police officers every year, and each one of those
officers needs a handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Smith &AMP; Wesson will install external locks
within 60 days, with internal locks to be installed within two
years. The company also agreed to a ''code of conduct'' for selling
and distributing handguns that prohibits the marketing of weapons
in a way that appeals to juveniles or criminals, and Smith &AMP; Wesson
will devote 2 percent of firearms revenues every year to developing
''smart'' technology that limits a gun's use to its rightful owner.

Taiwan Elects Feminist as V.P.

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Annette Lu, who as vice president of Taiwan will be
the highest-ranking female government official in its history, is a pioneer
feminist whose career has closely tracked the island's transition from martial
law to full democracy. The Harvard-educated Lu, 55, was an opposition lawmaker
and county governor before former Taipei mayor Chen Shui-bian chose her as his
running mate -- hoping to give his already popular candidacy an extra boost from
women voters. Under Taiwan's constitution, Lu will be a heartbeat away from the

<HEADLINE> Report: Criminal Probe in Jet Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- What began months ago as an inquiry into
maintenance practices at an Alaska Airlines facility has become a
criminal investigation into the deadly crash of Flight 261, The
Seattle Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unidentified sources, the newspaper said the FBI and
Department of Transportation investigators have been questioning
Alaska Airlines employees as part of an inquiry that has been under
way for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal wrongdoing has been established in connection with
the Jan. 31 crash off the coast of California that killed 88
people, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation grew out of a 15-month-old inquiry
into practices at Alaska's maintenance facility at Oakland, Calif.,
the Times said. In that inquiry, a grand jury in San Francisco is
investigating whether supervisors signed for repairs that weren't
done or that they weren't authorized to approve.
</P>
<P>
   The Times said the FBI, which usually plays an advisory role to
the NTSB, is conducting a separate, parallel investigation -- a
course of action reserved for cases where there is evidence or
suspicion of crime.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper cited three sources in two federal agencies as
confirming the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswomen Roberta Burroughs in Seattle and Debbie Weierman
in Washington, D.C., on Saturday would not confirm or deny the
existence of any such investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines said it was not aware of a separate
investigation by the FBI into the crash of Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI has been involved in the investigation of Flight 261
since the beginning,'' Alaska Airlines spokesman Jack Evans said
Saturday. ''Currently, we are unaware of any change in their role
since the beginning. If there is a change in that role, we'll
cooperate with them as we have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation grew out of a 15-month-old inquiry
into practices at Alaska's maintenance facility at Oakland, Calif.,
the Times said. In that inquiry, a grand jury in San Francisco is
investigating whether supervisors signed for repairs that weren't
done or that they weren't authorized to approve.
</P>
<P>
   But the plane that crashed ''was not involved in the original
request from the U.S. Attorney's Office for records related to
aircraft,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the airline said it put a top manager on leave while it
investigates claims by 64 Seattle mechanics that they were
''pressured, threatened and intimidated'' to cut corners on
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines said it had notified federal prosecutors and the
National Transportation Safety Board of the claims. It also said it
would immediately ground any planes found to be potentially unsafe.
No such action had been deemed necessary as of Saturday, Evans
said.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics' complaints were contained in a letter delivered
to the airline on Thursday. The airline and the Federal Aviation
Administration have begun interviewing the mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We increased our oversight as soon as we found out about the
letter,'' FAA spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB Chairman Jim Hall said Friday that most major components of
Flight 261's tail section have been recovered. He also said
investigators had found no grease on a crucial portion of the
jackscrew that helped control the movement of the jet's horizontal
tail stabilizer, long a focus of the crash probe.
</P>
<P>
   The Times reported that the mechanics' letter was triggered by
concerns over a recent repair to the horizontal stabilizer and
jackscrew assembly on an MD-80 jetliner. An airline spokesman could
not confirm that report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said the agency was aware there had
been recent ''debate'' at Alaska Airlines over a horizontal
stabilizer repair. He said the plane was returned to service in
proper condition.

   LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Grace Daley scored 30 points and No. 22
Tulane overcame a 13-point second-half deficit for a 65-60 victory
over Vermont on Saturday in a first-round women's NCAA tournament
Mideast Regional game.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Green Wave (27-4) trailed 48-35 with 12:23 to
play after 11th-seeded Vermont (25-6) opened the final 20 minutes
with a 21-3 run.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont, though, managed only 12 points the rest of the way as
Tulane's pressure defense forced the Catamounts into turnovers and
poor shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Green Wave tied it 59-59 with 1:40 remaining on Daley's
3-pointer from the left corner. After Vermont's Christie Lauzon hit
one of two free throws for a 60-59 lead, Daley drove the lane for a
basket and drew a foul. Her ensuing free throw gave Tulane a 62-60
advantage with 58.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Daley and Taryn Turnbull then connected on three of four free
throws in the final 26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Catamounts trailed 32-27 at intermission, but scored on
seven of its first nine possessions in the second half on the way
to a 13-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Goree added 15 points for Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Karalyn Church led Vermont with 26 points.

   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A fire in a transmission line knocked
out electric power across much of New Mexico for more than an hour
Saturday, snarling traffic in Albuquerque, shutting down radio and
television stations and forcing the state high school basketball
tournament to halt play.
</P>
<P>
   From Las Cruces to Gallup to Albuquerque to Santa Fe to Taos,
power went out shortly before 5 p.m. It came back on line, in
phases, after about 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The outage began with several sharp surges and then darkness.
Power came back on in about 15 minutes, then went out again 15
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Public Service Company of New Mexico spokeswoman Julie Grey was
in the Albuquerque Museum when the power went out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a fire on one of our major transmission lines from the
San Juan Generating Station (near Farmington) to Albuquerque,''
Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire caused the Four Corners Generating Station to ''trip
off line,'' Grey said. That power plant, adjacent to the San Juan
plant, is operated by Arizona Public Service, Grey said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the fire was not immediately determined. It
occurred about 4:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Grey said power would be restored from south to north -- the
southern restoration being assisted by El Paso Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   In all, she estimated that more than half of PNM's 360,000
customers statewide had been affected. Precise numbers weren't
immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallup Fire Department opened its emergency response center
and the central dispatcher in Raton in the northeast corner of the
state reported that power was out in the communities of Cimarron,
Springer and Ute Park, although Raton itself was unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights went out, causing major snarls throughout
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Radio, television stations and newspaper newsrooms in
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Los Alamos and Socorro were affected
by the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   One exception was radio station KTAO in Taos.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're on the air at the moment because we're solar-powered,''
said Sara Allen, chief engineer at KTAO.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press bureau in Albuquerque was in the dark, off
and on, for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   People with battery-powered television sets were able to watch
the NCAA basketball tournament. The state high school tournament,
however, had to be halted when the lights went out in the Pan
American Center in Las Cruces in southern New Mexico. The game was
completed after about an hour's delay.
</P>
<P>
   The towns of Farmington in the northwest corner of the state and
Hobbs in the extreme southeast were not affected. Grey said
Farmington, near the blacked-out power plants, has its own utility.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso, Texas, also had a citywide outage for about 30 minutes
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Ko, owner of the Ko Palace restaurant in Albuquerque,
said he might have to close if the blackout continued. His staff
was putting candles on the dining tables.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not worried. We're cooking with gas,'' Ko said.

<HEADLINE> Purdue 66, Oklahoma 62  </HEADLINE>
By DENNIS GEORGATOS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Once again, Purdue needed some late-game
heroics. Once again, Jaraan Cornell supplied them, sending the
Boilermakers to the final 16 for the third straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, converting key foul shots and long-range baskets,
scored 13 of his 15 points in the final 9:30 as Purdue beat
Oklahoma 66-62 on Saturday in the second round of the West
Regional.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were stale on offense and I just wanted to step up
personally and for my team,'' Cornell said. ''After I hit the first
3, I felt my rhythm and the rest fell down.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue has seen Cornell do it before. In the Boilermakers' 62-61
first-round victory, he hit three 3s in the final nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like putting in golf,'' Purdue coach Gene Keady said.
''You get that first one and then they all start falling. He did
the same thing against Dayton the other day.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Greg McQuay led the sixth-seeded Boilermakers (23-9) with 16
points in a game marked by bruising physical play and relentless
man-to-man defense that saw both teams contesting nearly every
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was an up and down game the entire way, and we were able
to pull it out,'' Keady said. ''This is such a sweet feeling right
now. We really worked hard for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan Johnson led Oklahoma (27-7) with 20 points. Eduardo Najera
added 15 points and Hollis Price had 10 for the Sooners, who just
missed a second straight trip to the regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sooners especially were hurt by poor perimeter shooting.
They were just 2-for-19 from beyond the arc after converting 10 of
21 3-pointers in their first-round rout of Winthrop.
</P>
<P>
   ''Purdue did a great job of containing our perimeter guys,''
Johnson said. ''they weren't giving us any easy looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Najera, whose stellar career ended when he fouled out in
the final minute, ''I still can't believe we lost tonight. We had
the game the whole time. We just didn't play smart enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue will face 10th-seeded Gonzaga on Thursday in the regional
semifinals in Albuquerque, N.M. The Bulldogs beat second-seeded St.
John's 82-76.
</P>
<P>
   ''This team is like a roller coaster,'' McQuay said. ''We do
good; then we lay down for a while. We matched up really well with
them. It was just a matter of who made the least mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma coach Kelvin Sampson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a fine, fine, fine line between winning and losing this
time of year,'' Sampson said. ''We were a play away from going back
to the Sweet 16.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell, who hit three 3s in the last nine minutes of Purdue's
62-61 first-round victory over Dayton, made clutch shots from
beyond the arc and at the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   With Purdue trailing 49-44 after consecutive layups by Najera
and Victor Avila, Cornell rebounded a miss and put it back for a
layup and then drained successive 3-pointers to give Purdue a 52-49
lead with 7:49 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma fought back to go in front 58-56 on Nolan Johnson's
tip-in with 1:49 remaining but Greg McQuay dunked off an alley-oop
pass.
</P>
<P>
   With 43.7 seconds left, Cornell was fouled on a 3-point try and
made all three free throws for a 63-60 lead with 43.7 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Price made both ends of a 1-and-1, but Rodney Smith then made
three of four free throws down the stretch to secure the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue lost its last chance when a pass from Price was deflected
into the arms of Smith in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cardinal, Purdue's leading scorer who was just 3-for-13 on
the night from the field, missed his first six shots before
beginning the second half with a three-point play, giving the
Boilermakers a 31-30 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Najera shook free for a driving layup and Newton connected
from 3-point range, ending Oklahoma's 0-9 drought from beyond the
arc.
</P>
<P>
   Despite missing all eight 3-point tries in the first half,
Oklahoma took a 30-28 lead, outscoring the Boilermakers 12-5 over
the final 3:11.
</P>
<P>
   After Smith hit Purdue's lone 3-pointer of the half, putting the
Boilermakers up 23-18, Najera hit a long baseline jumper and
Newton, shoved underneath the basket by Jaraan Cornell, made both
free throws to trigger the Sooners' burst.
</P>
<P>
   Najera finished the flurry with a breakaway dunk and a short
pullup jumper before Purdue closed in again, getting a pair of free
throws from Carson Cunningham and layin from Maynard Lewis off an
outlet pass from Cunningham.

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan President-elect Chen Shui-bian is to succeed
retiring President Lee Teng-hui in May, ending the Nationalist Party's 51-year
rule on the island -- much of it under repressive martial law. Beijing deeply
distrusts Chen because his Democratic Progressive Party favors taking Taiwan
from de-facto to formal independence. But the president-elect, who has softened
his stance on independence to appeal to nervous voters, immediately pledged to
seek dialogue with Beijing.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Department of Housing and Urban Development and the

enforcement agencies give preference to Smith &AMP; Wesson when buying guns and
called on others to follow suit. The directive gives preference to ''any gun
makers that adopt a new code of responsible conduct.'' Smith &AMP; Wesson signed an
unprecedented agreement with the Clinton administration yesterday to include
safety locks with all of its handguns. In return, the agreement calls for
federal, state and city lawsuits against the gun maker to be dropped and says no
new suits will be filed seeking to hold them responsible for shootings committed
with their guns.

Fire Kills 235 Ugandan Cult Members

   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) -- At least 235 followers of a doomsday cult burned to
death in a church fire in a remote part of southwestern Uganda, authorities said
Saturday. It is unclear whether sect leader Joseph Kibweteere died in the fire
in the small trading center of Kanungu, 217 miles from Uganda's capital,
Kampala. He had predicted the world would end Dec. 31, 1999 but changed it to
Dec. 31, 2000, after nothing happened, said the independent newspaper The

church and then set it ablaze.

country's Red Cross director said Saturday. Last summer, it was a drought and
rodents infesting pastures. Heavy snow followed this winter. Now grass is so

<HEADLINE> Iowa State 79, Auburn 60  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- All-American Marcus Fizer was angry. Not
about his dismal first-half performance, but about a brief
conversation with a fan on his way to the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, who made only one basket in the first half, led a
second-half surge Saturday that carried second-seeded Iowa State to
a 79-60 victory over seventh-seeded Auburn in the Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   A woman recognized Fizer from a magazine article and photo and
approached him.
</P>
<P>
   According to Fizer, she asked, ''So, you're what all the whoop
and hollering is about?
</P>
<P>
   ''And I said, 'No, it's about our team,''' Fizer recounted,
furrowing his brow even at the recollection.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers certainly saw Fizer as the Cyclones' main attraction
and they hounded him relentlessly until his supporting cast of
Jamaal Tinsley, Stevie Johnson and Michael Nurse made them pay for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Continue to play us this way because Mike and Jamaal and
Stevie and our team will continue to light it up,'' said Fizer, who
was held without a field goal for the first 17 minutes but finished
with 22 points after Auburn was forced to abandon its relentless
zone and double-teams.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson scored 21 points, Nurse had 14 and Tinsley added 12 to
help the Cyclones (31-5) reach the final 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones, who won the school's first regular-season
conference title in 55 years and set a school record for victories
after being picked to finish dead-last in the Big 12, used a 19-4
run midway through the second half to secure the trip to next
week's regional semifinals in Auburn Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great to prove to the people that we're better than
what they expected,'' Kantrail Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State will face sixth-seeded UCLA on Thursday. The Bruins
routed third-seeded Maryland 105-70.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who squeaked past Creighton 72-69 in the first
round, were up 41-38 five minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   At 43-43, Tinsley took over, sinking back-to-back, twirling 3s
from the corner that sparked the big run, and the Cyclones never
trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I gave it a 'What the heck ... good shot!''' Cyclones coach
Larry Eustachy said. ''Obviously, the two 3-pointers were the
turning point. He hit the toughest shot in basketball two times in
a row. For a guy that spins the ball like 'As the World Turns,'
that's amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (24-10) couldn't counter,
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought defensively we had kept the game at a tempo we
wanted to play at,'' Auburn coach Cliff Ellis said. ''Then, a guy
who's an 18-percent 3-point shooter steps up and hits two. The
momentum changed right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tigers guard Daymeon Fishback called Tinsley's 3s ''tremendous
back-breakers for us.''
</P>
<P>
   With Fizer still struggling to get into rhythm, Tinsley said he
knew it was up to him: ''Someone else has to take his role if he's
not scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer scored half of his 22 points after Tinsley's back-to-back
3s.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all because my teammates stepped up and made them play
honest,'' Fizer said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones were still clinging to a single-digit lead when
Fizer, who also pulled down 12 rebounds, scored three straight
baskets to put Iowa State ahead 63-49.
</P>
<P>
   With Fizer, the player of the year in the Big 12, struggling in
the first half, Auburn took a 33-32 lead. The Tigers stifled the
junior forward with a smothering zone that put two men on him in
the low post and also limited Tinsley's penetrations.
</P>
<P>
   In man defense, Fizer was alternately hounded by 7-foot center
Mamadou N'diaye and sophomore forward Mack McGadney, who replaced
Chris Porter after the star forward was ruled ineligible last month
for accepting money from an agent's middleman.
</P>
<P>
   Fizer went to the bench with his second foul 48 seconds before
halftime and Eustachy had to holler at him to chill out when he
jumped up in the waning seconds to argue an official's call.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis said the zone fell apart when the Tigers quit scoring --
they shot 27 percent after a 51-percent first half.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're not making shots, you can't zone,'' he said. ''In
the first half, when we were making shots, the game plan was
perfect.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani laughs at president's oil plan; says Hillary Clinton'scandidacy inauthentic  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani laughed Saturday at
President Clinton's latest plan to deal with high oil prices and
blasted Senate rival Hillary Rodham Clinton as an inauthentic
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Marching on in his fourth St. Patrick's Day parade in two weeks,
the New York City mayor was warmly welcomed by the thousands of
people who lined the parade route through downtown Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   ''Send her back to Arkansas,'' David Skarupa of North Syracuse
told the mayor as they shook hands along the way. There were shouts
of ''give her hell, Rudy!'' and ''Rudy, Rudy, Rudy!'' as he marched
with Syracuse's Republican mayor, Roy Bernardi.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was greeted by supportive signs all along the parade
route while there were none evident supporting Clinton. She had
cited a scheduling conflict for missing the event. The two had both
marched, separately, in the St. Patrick's Day parade in New York
City on Friday. She was met at that parade by a mixture of boos and
cheers, mostly boos.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought she was going to be here,'' Giuliani told reporters
at the end of the Syracuse parade. ''It might have been an
interesting thing if we had (both) marched in the parade, to see
the difference in the reaction of the crowd. It would have been
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer, who did march in the Syracuse
parade, said ''Central New York is an area that tends to be
Republican.'' But Schumer called the Senate contest ''a
nip-and-tuck race.'' Recent polls have shown Giuliani with a slight
lead over Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to speak to a labor group's dinner
Saturday night in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor took both Clintons to task during his outing Saturday,
again raising the carpetbagger issue in her case.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real authentic candidacy for the Senate, not
something scripted by someone who moved in a couple of days ago,''
Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who had never before lived in New York, moved into
a $1.7 million house in suburban Westchester County just north of
New York City in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican mayor also mocked President Clinton's call
Saturday for congressional approval of legislation to establish an
oil reserve for the Northeast to deal with any future crisis such
as the current one that has driven up home heating oil and gasoline
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess he's made some slight awakening from his napping ...
The president, unfortunately it seems to me, woke up for about two
minutes from his nap and went back to napping again,'' Giuliani
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We Americans, and New Yorkers in particular are suffering the
price of a president who does not pay enough attention to foreign
policy,'' the mayor added.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, as he has in the past, called on President Clinton to
dip into the nation's strategic oil reserves as a means of driving
down current oil prices. The president has refused to do that. And,
Giuliani again called on the president to ''face down OPEC.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrat Schumer was unhappy the president had again
refused to tap into the strategic oil reserves. The moves announced
Saturday, said Schumer, ''don't solve the problem we're going to
face this summer'' as gasoline consumption increases.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer said he hopes the administration is correct in its
belief that the OPEC countries may soon agree to pump up
production, the senator said ''they better well have a back-up
plan'' in case that doesn't happen.
</P>

   Earlier this month, Giuliani marched in St. Patrick's Day
parades in Queens and on Staten Island. After leaving Syracuse,
Giuliani was headed for Watertown and an Irish festival. He was to
march in another St. Patrick's Day parade in Buffalo on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know St. Patrick's Day parades really well,'' the mayor
said. ''I love them.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani brushed aside a question about whether he was using the
parades to appeal to New York's Roman Catholic voters who make up
about 45 percent of the state's electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't try to categorize voters. Every vote counts the same.
To me there's never been a Protestant vote, a Catholic vote, a
Jewish vote, an African-American vote, an Italian vote, an Irish
vote,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, Giuliani held news conferences at gas stations
in Watertown and in the Utica area to keep up his criticism of the
Clinton administration and high oil prices. He ended his
campaigning Saturday with a dinner hosted by a volunteer fire
company just south of Utica and told those on hand that, ''We've
had enough of this Clinton thing, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   After the applause died, Giuliani said, ''We don't need to bring
it to New York. Let it stay wherever it came from -- Arkansas,
Illinois, some place like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, candidate Clinton spoke to a labor group's dinner
Saturday night in New York City, touching on the importance of
issues including health care and education. She portrayed herself
as a strong supporter of labor, a commitment she said she would
maintain if elected into office.

<HEADLINE> Duke 71, Campbell 42  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Coming off a 12-day layoff, Duke figured to
struggle on offense. Not so on defense, where the Blue Devils could
take advantage of fresh legs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt that having played almost two weeks ago that we would
be a little rusty coming out,'' Duke coach Gail Goestenkors said
after second-seeded Duke cruised past Campbell 71-42 on Saturday in
the first round of the women's NCAA tournament East Regional. ''I
think our intensity defensively was very good. But offensively we
were a little out of sync.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-ranked Blue Devils, runnerup to Purdue in last year's
tournament, will play Western Kentucky, a 68-65 winner over
Marquette, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Missy West scored 15 points as Duke (27-5) won its six straight
first-round game -- the best run in school history -- by the largest
margin for the Blue Devils in the NCAAs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a lot of confidence coming into the game,'' West said.
''But I think I forced and rushed a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils, who beat North Carolina March 6 in the Atlantic
Coast Conference tournament championship, struggled with 20
turnovers and missed some easy shots.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's Georgia Schweitzer, the ACC player of the year, was held
to 11 points. She has been playing since Feb. 14 with a divot
fracture on an ankle bone. Lauren Rice added 10 points for Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the freshmen, it was just a little bit of nerves. But for
the rest of us, we needed to play a game. Hopefully we got this out
of our system,'' Goestenkors said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell (22-9) won the Trans America Athletic Conference
championship to earn its first trip to the NCAA tournament. Stacey
Hinkle led Campbell with 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Many Lady Camel fans decked out in bright orange and black made
the 40-minute drive from Buies Creek, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was overwhelmed with the people who came from Buies Creek.
We are very proud of our crowd,'' Campbell coach Wanda Watkins
said. ''I'm sorry we didn't give them more to cheer about.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell tied it 2-2 after Lisa Rugg's basket, but the Blue
Devils moved ahead 12-5 with 14:52 left in the first half and
Campbell just couldn't keep up.
</P>
<P>
   Duke still looked a little off balance early in the second half
after a sloppy first half. On two fast breaks, Duke players lost
the ball out of bounds near the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Duke finally executed consecutive fast breaks perfectly. During
one, Rochelle Parent drove downcourt and laid the ball softly into
the basket. After a Campbell turnover on the ensuing possession,
Rice and Sheana Mosch traded passes down the lane before Rice
handed off to Mosch for an easy layup and a 45-18 lead with 15:19
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils' lead reached 56-26 after Mosch's fast-break
layup with 9:41 left.
</P>
<P>
   Duke's starters were pulled with about five minutes left to
play, but Schweitzer returned with three minutes left. She hit a 3
with 38.8 seconds left for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we took her out right before the end I knew she wasn't in
a good way, and I wanted her to feel good about herself and her
game going into Monday night's game,'' Goetenkors said. ''She hit a
3, and I think she felt better about things.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not Schweitzer's best outing. In one sequence, she missed
a shot, fouled Syreeta Gambrell hard on an attempted jumper at the
other end and then traveled on Duke's next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Duke had nine turnovers and 10 personal fouls en route to a
36-14 lead at halftime. The bright spot was West, who scored 12
points on 5-of-11 shooting.

<HEADLINE> Panthers 4, Islanders 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Pavel Bure's fourth hat trick of the
season included his 50th goal as the Florida Panthers beat the New
York Islanders 4-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bure scored the game-winner with 70 seconds left in regulation
when he broke around defenseman Jamie Rivers and moved in alone on
goalie Kevin Weekes. He beat Weekes between the pads with a wrist
shot to give the Panthers their first win in three games, and
fourth in their last 14.
</P>
<P>
   Bure added an empty-net goal with 19.5 seconds left, giving him
his 15th career hat trick. It also marked his fourth 50-goal
season, and the second time he scored his 50th with an
empty-netter.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Mellanby also scored for the Panthers, who moved within
four points of Southeast Division-leading Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sillinger had three assists and Mike Vernon made 26 saves
for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Mariusz Czerkawski and Brad Isbister had power-play goals for
New York. Weekes stopped 35 shots for the Islanders, including 18
in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   New York capitalized during a two-man advantage at 17:04 of the
first when Czerkawski sent a high one-timer from the right hash
mark past Vernon for a 1-0 lead. The goal was Czerkawski's
team-leading 26th, matching a career high. He also had 26 for
Edmonton in the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   Florida tied it at 3:11 of the second on a power play when
Mellanby pushed Sillinger's cross-ice feed into the open right
side.
</P>
<P>
   Bure scored with 1.4 seconds left in the period to give the
Panthers a 2-1 lead. His one-timer from the slot off a drop pass
from Ray Whitney beat Weekes between the pads.
</P>
<P>
   Isbister tied it on a power-play slot shot at 4:39 of the third.
It was Isbister's fourth goal in five games.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders defenseman Ian Herbers, acquired from Tampa Bay on
March 9, left the game late in the second with a high left ankle
sprain. He will be re-evaluated Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Slaying Suspect in Standoff  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN MANNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUNDALK, Md. (AP) -- A heavily armed man suspected of killing
four people remained holed up with at least three hostages in an
apartment Saturday, as relatives and friends pleaded for him to
come out.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional appeals were aired live on local television
stations in hopes that Joseph Palczynski would be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ''Joseph, for God's sake, please give yourself up,'' his
grandmother, Marie Nardone, pleaded. ''Don't hurt no more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said the apartment just east of Baltimore is that of the
mother of Tracy Whitehead, the former girlfriend Palczynski is
accused of briefly kidnapping. Palczynski was holding hostage
Whitehead's mother, Lynn, her stepbrother and the mother's
boyfriend, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Whitehead's sister-in-law, Donna Collins, called the
apartment where the three were being held on Friday night after
hearing from another relative that Palczynski was there. Collins
said she was told by Palczynski that he would ''blow them all
away,'' The Washington Post reported in Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''All I want is Tracy,'' Palczynski reportedly said to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Law officers converged on the building at about 9:30 p.m.
Friday, and were negotiating with Palczynski by telephone.
Authorities blocked off the area and evacuated residents from the
block.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a philosophy of surround and talk,'' said Baltimore
County Police spokesman Bill Toohey said Saturday. ''We're prepared
to wait a good long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Television stations reported that Palczynski told negotiators he
wanted to talk to Whitehead and wanted food delivered to the
apartment. Toohey would not comment on the reports, or answer
questions about whether officers had been stationed at the home
during the more than week-long manhunt. Police also would not
disclose Whitehead's whereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old electrician had broken into another home earlier
Friday, tied up the occupants and stole two long guns and a
handgun, Toohey said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor John Shifflett, who lives across the street, said Lynn
Whitehead had just returned to her home after staying with
relatives during the search for Palczynski.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they should have come back. They should have
stayed away longer,'' Shifflett said.
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski has been on the run since March 7, when police say he
kidnapped his girlfriend, killed the couple she was staying with
and a neighbor. A fourth person was killed the next day by a stray
bullet as Palczynski allegedly carjacked another vehicle, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitehead escaped unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   As police continued negotiating with Palczynski, friends made
repeated pleas on live television for him to release the hostages.
Local TV stations also rebroadcast earlier pleas from his mother
and Whitehead.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a no-win situation, hon,'' said Ramona Contrino Faust,
who identified herself as a friend and former neighbor of
Palczynski for more than 25 years. ''We've talked about this
before. I think I know what you're going to do. I don't want you to
do that, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to elaborate, she said Palczynski had said that if he were
faced with returning to jail, he would kill himself or make police
shoot him.
</P>
<P>
   Another televised appeal came from Palczynski's friend and
former attorney, David Henninger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm here for you, Joe. I need you to come out,'' Henninger
said. ''I need you to release the hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Palczynski has been in a similar situation before. In 1992, he
kept police in Idaho at bay for 16 hours following a domestic
violence complaint by a girlfriend. He was finally forced out with
tear gas.

   HAGATNA, Guam (AP) -- The 12 Guam delegates to the Democratic
National Convention support the presidential bid of Vice President
Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The delegates, who were selected Saturday at the party's
territorial convention, each have one-half vote.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the delegates who may have supported Bill Bradley
switched to Gore after the former New Jersey senator bowed out of

   Although Guam residents are U.S. citizens, they are ineligible

   MOUNT SIGNAL, Calif. (AP) -- A stolen pickup truck carrying 22
allegedly smuggled immigrants crashed on Highway 98 near the
Mexican border, killing three and injuring 18, authorities said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was not injured.
</P>
<P>
   The pickup was eastbound on Highway 98 approaching Mount Signal
shortly before 8 a.m. Friday when the driver lost control and it
overturned, according to a California Highway Patrol report.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the three men who were killed in the crash were not
released.
</P>
<P>
   The driver sustained a cut wrist and was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The driver and passengers were believed to be illegal
immigrants, said Henry Rolon, a Border Patrol spokesman in El
Centro. He didn't release other details.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Signal is a tiny hamlet in Imperial County, about 114
miles southeast of San Diego and a few miles north of the Mexico

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Hnat Domenichelli had a goal and two assists as
the Atlanta Thrashers ended a 10-game losing streak with a 4-1
victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Guolla, Donald Audette and Yannick Tremblay also scored
for the Thrashers, who won for just the second time in 28 games.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Korolev scored for the Maple Leafs, who lost their second
straight home game to a team out of the playoff picture. Toronto
lost 5-2 to the Chicago Blackhawks on Wednesday before beating the
Detroit Red Wings 4-3 in overtime Thursday in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Domenichelli opened the scoring 40 seconds into the game with
his eighth goal of the season when he fired what appeared to be a
harmless shot at the net. Defensemen Tomas Kaberle and Dmitri
Yushkevich converged on him just inside the Leafs blue line, but
the shot eluded Curtis Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers went ahead 2-0 on a power play early in the
second, when Tremblay one-timed a shot past Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Korolev scored Toronto's lone goal 9:25 into the second, beating
Damian Rhodes to the short side with a slap shot from the point.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a minute later, Guolla put the Thrashers ahead 3-1
after he floated a centering pass from the left of Joseph and it
ricocheted off Yushkevich and into the net.
</P>
<P>
   Audette made it 4-1 with 3:11 left when he squirted a shot past
Joseph during a goal-mouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Despite four power plays in the first period, the Leafs managed
just seven shots on net. Toronto finished 1-for-8 on the power
play, while Atlanta was 2-for-10.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto is playing without defenseman Bryan Berard, who was
examined Friday by a retinal surgeon in New York. Berard, hit in
the face by Marian Hossa's stick during a game in Ottawa on March
11, will undergo exploratory surgery Tuesday.

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Antoine Walker scored 10 of his 29 points during a
third-quarter surge, and Boston gained ground in the Eastern
Conference playoff race with a 104-99 victory over the Mavericks on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Williams added 18 points off the bench and Paul Pierce
scored 15 for the Celtics, who moved within a game of Milwaukee and
Orlando, tied for the eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Boston won its third straight and its seventh in the last eight.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Finley's 28 points, rookie Greg Buckner's career-high 25
points and Dirk Nowitzki's 21 points and 11 rebounds paced the
Mavericks, who had their three-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics led by as many as 11 in the fourth quarter before
the Mavericks made a late charge, using a 12-3 run capped by
Buckner's 3-pointer with 9.8 seconds left to reduce the deficit to
101-99.
</P>
<P>
   But Pierce converted two free throws with 8.3 seconds left for a
103-99 advantage, then Buckner missed a layup with four seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Boston opened the third quarter with a 14-4 run capped by
Walker's layup for a 63-51 lead. Walker's 3-pointer with 4:03 left
in the quarter expanded the Celtics' advantage to 76-62.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were in front 80-72 entering the fourth quarter, but
the Mavericks cut the deficit to 82-79 on Finley's 3-pointer with
10:21 left.
</P>
<P>
   Boston then went on an 8-2 run capped by consecutive baskets
from Walker for a 90-81 edge with 7:36 remaining.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mavericks owner-to-be Mark Cuban said he has no interest in
signing guard Isaiah Rider, who was waived by Atlanta on Friday.
Cuban recently released controversial forward Dennis Rodman
following a 12-game tryout, and Cuban said, ''I learned that
lesson.''. ... Cuban is shopping for a team plane and has made a
bid of $43 million on a 757 currently owned by the republic of
Argentina. ... Buckner got his first start as Dallas opened with
four guards and Nowitzki. The Mavs used their 26th different
starting lineup this season.

<HEADLINE> Report: Light Eyed in Swissair Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investigators probing the 1998 crash of a
Swissair plane off Nova Scotia say a pilot's map light in the
cockpit ceiling of the MD-11 could have been a source of ignition,
The New York Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian investigators were sorting through the debris of
Swissair Flight 111 to try to find the map light from that plane,
Jim Harris, spokesman for the Canadian Transportation Safety Board,
told the Times.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the crash that killed 229 people has yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which makes the MD-11 model planes, is urging airlines
using that type of aircraft to check the lights often until they
can be replaced, and to install fire-resistant tape to protect
insulation. The Federal Aviation Administration is considering
whether to make such checks mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   FAA spokeswoman Rebecca Trexler said the agency is examining the
map light issue. ''We are drafting an air worthiness directive. It
will probably be similar to Boeing's service bulletin.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she declined to say when that directive would be issued
or what it would say.
</P>
<P>
   There are no MD-11 planes registered in Canada, but the
investigators found the possible problem while looking at such
planes undergoing maintenance outside the country. This model were
made by McDonnell Douglas, which has been taken over by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said investigators haven't yet ruled out anything in
determining what caused Swissair 111 to plunge into the ocean.

<HEADLINE> Saturday's Spring Training Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   After an absence of more than a year, Kerry Wood
returned to the
mound Saturday, testing his surgically repaired elbow by throwing
15 pitches in the Chicago Cubs' 8-7 loss to the White Sox in a
split-squad game Saturday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1998 NL Rookie of the Year threw 10 strikes in the game at
Mesa, Ariz. He pitched one inning, allowing a single to Mike
Caruso, his first batter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like I was just out there playing catch,'' said Wood,
who had reconstructive elbow surgery after tearing a ligament in
his first spring start last year. ''I was just happy to be out
there. I forgot how much fun it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a sellout crowd of 12,426, Sammy Sosa hit a two-run
homer, his eighth of spring.
</P>
<P>
   The day's other big game was in Caracas, Venezuela, where John
Rocker was booed and hit hard in the Atlanta Braves' 13-5 win over
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   In his second outing this spring, the controversial reliever
entered in the sixth inning, after Kerry Ligtenberg was hit in the
face by a ball off the bat of Quinton McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 28,352 booed, and Rocker allowed five of six
batters to reach, throwing just 10 of 26 pitches for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, suspended for the first two weeks of the season by
commissioner Bud Selig for disparaging foreigners, homosexuals and
minorities in a magazine interview, walked Dave Martinez and Jose
Canseco, then gave up an RBI single to Steve Cox for Tampa Bay's
first run.
</P>
<P>
   John Flaherty hit into a run-scoring double play, Herbert Perry
doubled in a run, Bubba Trammell walked and Scott Sobkowiak
relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to another trip, Ismael Valdes, penciled in as the
starter for the Cubs' opener in Japan against the New York Mets,
has a dead arm and might be done for the rest of the spring. The
Mets made a move, trading reliever Jesse Orosco to St. Louis for
infielder-outfielder Joe McEwing.
</P>
<P>
   Orosco got the final out of the Mets' 1986 World Series victory
over Boston. New York acquired him from Cleveland in December.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little disappointed, I'd love to stay here, it's a great
ballclub and a great bunch of guys,'' Orosco said at Port St.
Lucie, Fla. ''But it was kind of a numbers game here, I guess the
last four or five days you could just flat sense something was
creeping up.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Revolution 1, Fusion 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The Miami Fusion and New England
Revolution tied 1-1 Saturday night in Major League Soccer's first
overtime game under this season's new rules.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to soccer purists, the league abandoned the
shootout used to break deadlocks and adopted the international
standard, where games can end in ties.
</P>
<P>
   The only departure is 10 minutes of sudden-death overtime if
games are even after regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion and Revolution each earned one point in the Eastern
Division standings.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Lassiter, the league's all-time leading scorer and Miami's
celebrated offseason acquisition from D.C. United, sat out the
opener with a toe injury.
</P>
<P>
   New England's Imad Baba sent the match into overtime with his
tying goal with 10 minutes remaining. Baba received a free kick
from Ted Chronopoulos off the left wing and flicked a 12-yard,
left-footed shot past Fusion goalkeeper Jeff Cassar.
</P>
<P>
   The Fusion had taken a 1-0 lead in the 61st minute, on Diego
Serna's header from 10 yards out. Serna missed Miami's final 13
matches last season after tearing right knee ligaments.
</P>
<P>
   Serna's goal was set up by Andy Williams' free kick from the
right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's best chance in the scoreless first half came on
Williams' close shot that Causey deflected in the 26th minute.
</P>
<P>
   New England threatened in the 42nd, when Wolde Harris dribbled
inside the box and fired, but Cassar made the save.
</P>
<P>
   Miami has never won a season opener in its three-year history.

<HEADLINE> Legislators: mayor and police commissioner 'demonized' victim  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The mayor and police commissioner ''demonized''
an unarmed black man shot by a detective's gun when they revealed
his sealed juvenile record, a group of Democratic legislators
charged Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The buck stops with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir, for victimizing an individual who
happens to be black and unarmed,'' said Rep. Gregory Meeks,
D-Queens, chairman of the statewide Council of Black Elected
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Patrick Dorismond was shot during a scuffle with
police on a Manhattan street, Meeks was joined on the steps of City
Hall by Reps. Jerrold Nadler and Charles Rangel, Manhattan Borough
President C. Virginia Fields, state Sen. Larry Seabrook and other
New York legislators.
</P>
<P>
   They called for a probe by the federal Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, up to 500 people gathered for a march that started at
the location of the shooting, went up to Times Square and finished
in Herald Square, police said. Eight people were arrested on
disorderly persons charges.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond was killed shortly after midnight Thursday during a
struggle with undercover officers on Eighth Avenue near West 37th
Street. Police sources said Dorismond, 26, an off-duty security
guard, grew angry when one of the officers approached and asked if
he and another man knew where to buy marijuana as part of a drug
buy-and-bust operation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the two men attacked the undercover officer,
prompting Detective Anthony Vasquez and another back-up officer to
move in. During the ensuing scuffle, a detective's pistol somehow
went off, and a bullet hit Dorismond in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, in Syracuse for a St. Patrick's Day parade on
Saturday, was asked about the charges that he and Safir had
victimized Dorismond.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police can't get an even break here,'' the mayor said.
''People are more than willing to attack police officers ... but if
the report of the person involved in the incident is brought out
then all of a sudden that's unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the police officer's record is as relevant as that of
the person involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Safir said that Dorismond had been arrested
as a teen-ager for robbery and assault; in 1993 for attempted
robbery and assault; and in 1996 for criminal possession of a
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The 1993 and 1996 charges were all misdemeanors, according to
court officials and prosecutors. In both cases, Dorismond was
allowed to plead guilty to disorderly conduct and perform community
service. The earlier juvenile case was dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Safir ''are demonizing and victimizing an innocent
victim via racial profiling,'' said Meeks.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's shooting, Vasquez was stripped of his gun and
badge amid a grand jury investigation. He will remain on desk duty
pending the outcome of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough, said several of the speakers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third fatal shooting by plainclothes officers in
the city in the past 13 months, noted Manhattan Borough President
C. Virginia Fields. ''These cases dramatically underscore the need
to change the practices and tactics that lead to tragedies like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond leaves his Haitian-born mother and two daughters, ages
5 and 1.
</P>
<P>
   His death at the hands of police is part of a larger, disturbing
picture involving the city's police, said City Council member
Annette Robinson, another speaker at Saturday's gathering.
</P>
<P>
   She chairs the council's Select Committee on Police Performance
and Community Relations, which was formed to develop a dialogue
between communities and police officers after the acquittal of the
four officers who shot Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   The latest shooting, said Robinson, ''confirms the harsh
realities of city life; if your skin is brown and if you speak with
an accent, you will be considered a criminal suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The dead man's family and the Rev. Al Sharpton also have called
for a federal probe of Dorismond's death, which follows last
month's acquittal and the fatal police shooting of another unarmed
black man a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he has asked Brooklyn U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch
to meet with him on Monday; Lynch declined comment. A spokesman for
U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said she would be monitoring the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case has drawn the attention of the New York Civil Liberties
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''Racism is ingrained in the police culture,'' its executive
director, Norman Siegel, told the rally outside City Hall. He urged
New Yorkers to wear black ribbons on Monday as part of a movement
for what he called ''systemic change'' in police practices.

<HEADLINE> Gonzaga 82, St. John's 76  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Those tournament darlings from Gonzaga sure
aren't one-year wonders.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs advanced to the NCAA regional semifinals for the
second straight year, stunning second-seeded St. John's 82-76 on
Saturday night behind 26 points from Matt Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, which made an amazing run to the West Regional final a
year ago as the No. 10 seed, shouldn't be considered a sleeper
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still fighting for respect,'' Santangelo said. ''Any
label you put on us means we're still playing and we're still
winning. That's what counts right now.''
</P>
<P>
   First-year coach Mark Few hugged his players, who gathered at
midcourt after the final buzzer, and they waved to their fans who
traveled all the way from Spokane, Wash., for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am so happy for these kids right now,'' Few said. ''They
have worked their entire basketball careers, and this is a great
thing for them right now. These guys came through when the lights
were on bright.''
</P>
<P>
   But after having toppled No. 2 seed Stanford a year ago, the
Bulldogs didn't stage a wild celebration that many lower-seeded
teams do after a major upset.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we are old and retired we will look back and get amazed
at what we've done,'' said Richie Frahm, who scored all 10 of his
points in the second half after getting 31 in the opener against
Louisville. ''It took until last summer to realize what we did last
year. We don't plan on going home anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs (26-8) will play sixth-seeded Purdue, which beat
No. 3 Oklahoma 66-62 earlier Saturday in a wide-open West Regional.
The top three seeds all fell Saturday, with Wisconsin beating No. 1
Arizona 66-59 in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's (25-8), with its highest seeding since being a No. 1
in the West in 1986, finished a turmoil-ridden season with a
disappointing loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were so souped up about getting to the Final Four that this
really hurts,'' Chudney Gray said. ''They made all the shots they
needed to. Whenever they needed one, Santangelo hit it. We didn't
get the stops we usually get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm overcame a pair of suspensions to leading scorer
Erick Barkley and an investigation just this week into Barkley and
teammate Lavor Postell.
</P>
<P>
   But St. John's couldn't overcome Gonzaga's efficient offense and
effective zone defense that kept the Red Storm at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo made 6-of-10 3-pointers, including three in the final
eight minutes as the Bulldogs pulled away from a 54-54 tie to take
control.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of success against their zone so they started to
go man-to-man on us,'' Santangelo said. ''That opened up a lot of
things on the perimeter for us. I started to get off some screens
and get open looks. The other guys did a good job of getting me the
ball and I took it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo added five assists and played all 40 minutes,
controlling the ball against a swarming St. John's press. After
committing 24 turnovers in a first-round win over Louisville,
Gonzaga had just 10 against the Red Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Matt did a fabulous job tonight,'' Few said. ''He had his
thumb right on the tempo of the game. If he wanted to push it, then
we pushed it. If he wanted to run the halfcourt offense, we did
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Axel Dench added 12 of his 17 points in the first half to keep
Gonzaga close. Casey Calvary added 13.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley led St. John's with 21 points and Anthony Glover added
18. Bootsy Thornton, who had topped 20 points in seven of his last
nine games, was held to 12 on 3-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they've got a really good chance of going to (the
Final Four),'' St. John's coach Mike Jarvis said. ''There is a time
and a place for everything and maybe this is theirs. It wasn't
meant for us. Maybe it's meant for Gonzaga.''
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil hadn't affected Barkley or St. John's, which had won
12 of 13 games since the first suspension on Feb. 3 before falling
to Gonzaga.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley hit a 3-pointer to tie it at 54 with 10:19 left. But he
missed two free throws that could have given St. John's the lead
two minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga went on a 9-2 run to take the lead for good, with
Santangelo's 3-pointer as the shot clock wound down making it
59-54.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm got off to a quick start in the first half and
looked like they would make it back to the round of 16 for the
second straight year.
</P>
<P>
   They held Gonzaga's two leading scorers -- Frahm and Calvary -- to
just one point and led 34-25 on a driving layup off the glass by
Barkley with 4:52 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs then went on a 8-2 run to end the half, highlighted
by Mark Spink's flying dunk over Gray.

<HEADLINE> Heat 92, Cavaliers 90, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jamal Mashburn scored 29 points, including
Miami's last 10 in overtime, to spark the Heat to a 92-90 victory
over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn broke a 90-90 tie with a 22-foot jumper with three
seconds to play. He scored 14 of the Heat's final 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Brevin Knight's driving layup with 22.9 seconds left tied the
score at 90. Knight missed an 8-foot runner as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavaliers had forced overtime on Bob Sura's driving layup
with 4.8 seconds left in regulation that tied the score at 80.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Kemp led Cleveland with 22 points despite shooting just
5-for-16 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Miami center Alonzo Mourning fouled out with 4:05 to play in
regulation and had just four points and five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The third quarter typified the ragged game. The clubs combined
for 21 personal fouls, nine turnovers and shot 21 percent (7-of-34)
from the field.
</P>
<P>
   After a slam dunk by Kemp tied the score at 51, the clubs
combined to make just one shot from the field, a driving layup by
Tim Hardaway, in the final 9:12 of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On three consecutive Cleveland possessions, Lamond Murray had
two shots blocked and threw the ball out of bounds in a 1:06 span.
Moments later, Cavs rookie guard Andre Miller had three turnovers
within 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Miami missed eight of 12 free throws in the quarter, while
Cleveland made 10 of 14 from the line to manage a 61-59 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn's 13-point first quarter helped Miami to a 32-26 lead
as the Heat shot 60 percent (12-for-20) from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland picked up its defensive effort in the second quarter
and limited Miami to 30 percent (6-for-20) shooting and trailed at
halftime, 47-44.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Heat forward P.J. Brown suffered a sprained left ankle in
the third minute of the game and did not return. ... It was just
the second time in Mourning's last 87 games that he did not score
in double figures. The other time was also against Cleveland, when
he had nine on Feb. 25. ... Cleveland's Andrew DeClercq had 10
first-half points. He had not scored in double figures in his
previous 29 games.

Opposition Wins Taiwan Election
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Chen Shui-bian, vilified by China as radical who would
thrust Taiwan toward independence and war, won Taiwan's presidential election
Saturday, trouncing the candidate of the party that has ruled this island for
more than half a century. Beijing deeply distrusts Chen because his Democratic
Progressive Party favors taking Taiwan from de-facto to formal independence and
making the 51-year-old split with China permanent. But the president-elect, who
has softened his stance on independence to appeal to nervous voters, immediately
pledged to seek dialogue with Beijing.

Report: Light Eyed in Swissair Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investigators probing the 1998 crash of a Swissair plane off
Nova Scotia say a pilot's map light in the cockpit ceiling of the MD-11 could
have been a source of ignition, The New York Times reported today. Canadian
investigators were sorting through the debris of Swissair Flight 111 to try to
find the map light from that plane, Jim Harris, spokesman for the Canadian
Transportation Safety Board, told the Times. The cause of the crash that killed
229 people has yet to be determined. Boeing, which makes the MD-11 model planes,
is urging airlines using that type of aircraft to check the lights often until
they can be replaced, and to install fire-resistant tape to protect insulation.

Report: Criminal Probe in Jet Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- What began months ago as an inquiry into maintenance
practices at an Alaska Airlines facility has become a criminal investigation
into the deadly crash of Flight 261, The Seattle Times reported today. No
criminal wrongdoing has been established in connection with the Jan. 31 crash
off the coast of California that killed 88 people, the Times said. The criminal
investigation grew out of a 15-month-old inquiry into practices at Alaska's
maintenance facility at Oakland, Calif., the Times said. In that inquiry, a
grand jury in San Francisco is investigating whether supervisors signed for
repairs that weren't done or that they weren't authorized to approve.

Santa Fe to Taos, power went out shortly before 5 p.m. It came back on line, in
phases, after about 6 p.m. By 8 p.m., the southern part of the state was fully
restored and Albuquerque was more than 85 percent restored, utility officials

country's Red Cross director said Saturday. Last summer, it was a drought and
rodents infesting pastures. Heavy snow followed this winter. Now grass is so

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Jeff Hackett made 33 saves, including 14 in the
second period, in the Montreal Canadiens' 3-2 victory over the
Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Brunet, Jesse Belanger and Brian Savage scored for
Montreal, which passed Pittsburgh and the New York Rangers for
seventh place in the Eastern Conference. The Penguins and Rangers
trail the Canadiens by one point. Montreal has 10 games left,
Pittsburgh 11 and the Rangers nine.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Roberts and Sean Hill scored for Carolina, which lost its
second straight, and dropped to 10th in the conference. Rod
Brind'Amour had two assists.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts scored for Carolina 7:10 into the game when he banged in
a loose puck from the crease to give the Hurricanes a 1-0 lead. But
Brunet tied it just 23 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Belanger made it 2-1 at 12:27, just one second after a Carolina
penalty Savage made it 3-1 on a wrist shot at 9:41 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hill got the Hurricanes within a goal by scoring with 36 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had goals disallowed.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Souray beat goalie Arturs Irbe off a rebound midway
through the second, but referee Paul Stewart had whistled the play
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with Montreal leading 2-1 in the third, Hackett snared a
wrist shot while sprawled on the ice and was credited with a save
although replays showed his glove was behind the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Shayne Corson, struck in the left eye by a clearing
attempt in Thursday's game against Philadelphia, could rejoin the
Canadiens on their upcoming road trip, team opthamologist Dr. John
Little said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was lucky. Two millimeters lower, and it would have hit him
in the same place that (Bryan Berard) got hit,'' said Little,
referring to the Toronto defenseman who suffered a serious eye
injury after being hit in the right eye by a stick.

<HEADLINE> Tennessee 90, Furman 38  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tennessee coach Pat Summitt had a hard
time finding something to fault Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had great intensity at both ends,'' she said after Semeka
Randall scored 17 points and the top-seeded Lady Volunteers used
record-setting defense to beat Furman 90-38 in a NCAA Mideast
regional first-round game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our defensive intensity was very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols held Furman to 20.3 percent shooting (13-of-64) --
the lowest field goal percentage in the 19-year history of the NCAA
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, ranked second at the end of the regular season, broke
out early and never let the Southern Conference champions catch up,
holding the Lady Paladins to the fewest points in coach Sherry
Carter's 18 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   With eight minutes left in the first half, the Lady Vols (29-3)
were up 34-4 and Furman (20-11) had managed to make only one field
goal in 20 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   A Randall layup gave Tennessee a 50-14 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee kept the pressure up in the second half, holding
Furman to a single field goal for nearly 12 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sat at two points for 12 to 13 minutes, and at that point I
felt like we were going to have a hard time getting back in the
game,'' Carter said. ''Even though we were taking shots, they just
weren't falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's largest lead, 87-23, came on a layin by Kyra Elzy
with 4:23 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Randall was one of four Lady Vols in double figures. Catchings
had 14 points and 14 rebounds, Gwen Jackson had 14 points and Kara
Lawson added 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's postseason, so we need to take our defense to another
level,'' Randall said. ''It's postseason so it's a new chapter for
us as a basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Torrie Scott led the Lady Paladins with 10 points on 3-of-14
shooting. Jackie Smith, the team's leading scorer -- averaging 18
points -- was held to five points.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee scored 29 points off 21 Furman turnovers and shot 53
percent (32-of-60) for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Turnovers will kill you and it did for us in the first half,''
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols advance to play Arizona in the second round on
Monday.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Prime Minister Selected  </HEADLINE>
By BINAJ GURUBACHARYA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) -- The man who led Nepal to democracy a
decade ago was chosen Saturday to be the nation's next prime
minister -- the fourth time he has headed the Himalayan nation's
chaotic government.
</P>
<P>
   Girija Prasad Koirala was picked by his Nepali Congress party in
parliament to lead the new government, beating Sher Bahadur Deuba --
also a former prime minister -- by a vote of 69 to 43. The Nepali
Congress has 113 members in the lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the new prime minister my priorities will be to maintain
law and order, eradicate corruption and good governance,'' Koirala
told reporters after the result was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Koirala succeeded Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, who became prime
minister after the Nepali Congress won a majority in the 205-seat
lower house in elections last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bhattarai, 76, resigned Thursday following a rebellion by
members of his governing party who blamed him for deteriorating law
and order, poor administration and continued attacks by Maoist
insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Koirala became the country's first elected prime minister in
1991, after leading thousands of activists in protests the previous
year against the three-decade autocratic rule of King Birendra, who
bent to demands for a constitutional monarchy. But instability has
dogged Nepal's politics, with eight different governments during
the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Koirala was expected to be sworn in on Monday by the king, who
earlier asked Bhattarai to remain as a caretaker prime minister
until his successor was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time that a party election has been held to
select the prime minister. In the past, the Nepali Congress has
chosen its leader by consensus.

<HEADLINE> Georgia 74, Montana 46  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Georgia got a double benefit from its
stifling defense against Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Coco Miller scored 16 points and Shala Crawford added 15 in the
first round of the women's NCAA tournament West Regional as
top-seed Georgia shut down Montana 74-46 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last 10 minutes of the first half were a nightmare for
us,'' Montana coach Robin Selvig said. ''They played great
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which faces the winner of the Stanford-Michigan game on
Monday, was up 40-16 on 48 percent shooting by halftime. By
comparison, Montana (22-8) mustered only 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (30-3), which has held four of its last five opponents
to 49 points or less, finally produced some fast-break baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what our offense has been needing,'' Georgia coach Andy
Landers said. ''We have been holding people to 50 or 60 points, but
our offense has not really capitalized.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana went eight minutes between points in the second half, as
Georgia stretched its lead from 47-25 to 65-25.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bulldogs got off to a slow start, making just one of
their first eight shots. Then Miller got going, hitting two
3-pointers en route to 10 first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were tied 9-9 after the first nine minutes, but
Georgia turned up the defensive pressure and outscored the
16th-seeded Lady Griz 31-7 over the last 10 minutes of the half.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford drew a charge, stole the ball once and scored six
points during the surge.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Keller scored 15 points for Montana, including three
3-pointers, and Lauren Cooper added 10.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was most proud of our team during the beginning of the game
when we were struggling on offense and still showing a lot of
patience to make smart plays on offense,'' Landers said.

<HEADLINE> Purdue 70, Dartmouth 66  </HEADLINE>
By HANK LOWENKRON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Last-minute starter Mackenzie
Curless hit a short jumper in the final minute as defending NCAA
champion Purdue held off Dartmouth 70-66 Saturday night to reach
the second round of the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th-ranked Boilermakers (23-7) had to rally in the closing
minutes after wasting a 20-point first-half lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dartmouth (20-8) took its only lead of the game at 65-64 on a
jumper by Stephanie Kinnear with 4:40 remaining. Big Ten player of
the year Katie Douglas, who had a rare off-night, hit two free
throws with 4:12 left to give Purdue a 66-65 edge.
</P>
<P>
   The Ivy League champions had three more chances to regain the
lead. Jackie Lippe missed a jumper, and Samantha Berdinka's long
shot bounced off the front of the rim. After Purdue missed three
straight shots, Kinnear was fouled with 2:18 remaining. She missed
the first free throw and hit the second to tie the game.
</P>
<P>
   Curless, starting because Michelle Duhart was attending her
grandfather's funeral, took a pass just inside the free throw line
and her jumper put Purdue ahead to stay. Dartmouth's final chance
to tie the game saw Berdinka's layup roll off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas grabbed the rebound, was fouled, and made both shots
from the line with 21 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   An airball by Courtney Banghart, who led Dartmouth with 20
points, sealed the victory for Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers next play 18th-ranked Oklahoma on Monday night
here in Mackey Arena, where Purdue is 10-3 in tournament play.
</P>
<P>
   Camille Cooper led Purdue with 21 points and eight rebounds,
helping the Boilermakers record a 49-31 rebounding advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, the Big Ten's scoring leader with a 21.3 average, had
12 points on 2-of-11 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue built a 20-point lead twice in the first half, the last
time at 39-19 following two free throws by Douglas with 3:49 left.

<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Hamchetou Maiga scored 24 points and
Lucienne Berthieu added 19 off the bench as fourth-seeded Old
Dominion beat Green Bay-Wisconsin 94-85 Saturday in the NCAA
Midwest Regional's first round.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 67, No. 14 Old Dominion (28-4) went on a
13-3 run behind nine points by Berthieu to take an 80-70 lead with
4:25 to go.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th-seeded Phoenix (21-9) got no closer than seven points
after that. The Lady Monarchs had a 37-18 rebounding edge.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin-Green Bay fell behind 8-0 but rallied for a 16-15 lead
with 13 minutes left in the first half. The Lady Monarchs went on a
14-4 run near the end of the half lead 43-36 at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Old Dominion's lead ballooned to 57-46 with 15:39 left in the
second half, but the Phoenix fought back to tie it 67-67 with 9:37
to go.
</P>
<P>
   Berthieu, a two-time Colonial Athletic Association most valuable
player, played just 16 minutes in her first game since spraining
her right shoulder Feb. 18 against William and Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Diaz scored 17 points for the Lady Monarchs. Alli Spence
added 14 and had 10 assists. Maiga had seven rebounds.

<HEADLINE> UCLA 105, Maryland 70  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The UCLA Bruins probably haven't looked this
dominant since guys named Alcindor and Walton were wearing blue and
gold.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' late-season roll reached its peak as UCLA put on a
stunning offensive display in a 105-70 victory over Maryland on
Saturday night in the Midwest Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Watson had 17 points and a school-record 16 assists as the
sixth-seeded Bruins connected on six fearsome alley-oops, a
school-record 14 3-pointers and absolutely everything in between.
Spectacular plays began to pile up as UCLA embarrassed the
third-seeded Terrapins' ACC-best defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the tipoff we just came out so focused,'' said Watson,
who didn't make a turnover. ''I could see it in the team's eyes. We
were ready from the jump.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to everything was Watson, who was heavily criticized
earlier this season for his point guard play. He answered all of
his detractors with a dominant performance that awed the Metrodome
crowd and his teammates alike.
</P>
<P>
   His assists also set a Midwest Regional record and tied the NCAA
tournament record for assists in a first- or second-round game. As
if that wasn't enough, he was 5-of-6 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I was in the zone,'' Watson said. ''I had the
easiest part. I just had to get them the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, which barely made the tournament field after a 19-11
regular season, won its eighth straight game and advanced to face
Iowa State next week. The Bruins have made the round of 16 in three
of Steve Lavin's first four years as coach.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all the potential we've got up and down the lineup, we
definitely knew we could get this far,'' Ray Young said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins closed the first half with a 22-7 run and made a 16-2
run to start the second half, going up 76-41 just seven minutes
after halftime. UCLA shot 74 percent before the final minutes and
also played impressive defense, limiting Juan Dixon, who made seven
turnovers, to 16 points on 6-of-18 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ''During our preparation for Maryland, I felt pretty confident
about where our team was at,'' Lavin said. ''Our team has continued
to improve, (and) tonight was another breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland coach Gary Williams took three timeouts before the
first TV timeout of the second half in an attempt to slow down
Watson and the Bruins. But UCLA's unstoppable run was led by
Watson, who had consecutive 3-pointers and a dunk on an alley-oop
from Jason Kapono.
</P>
<P>
   Watson also had four steals. Jerome Moiso and JaRon Rush had 14
points apiece for UCLA, while Dan Gadzuric added 13 and Kapono 11.
Moiso, Gadzuric and Watson were a combined 18-of-21 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie Baxter had 22 points and 10 rebounds for the Terrapins,
who spent most of the second half with their heads hung on the
bench in shock. Maryland failed to reach the round of 16 for just
the third time in the last seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's 14 3-pointers broke the school record of 12 set three
weeks ago in the Bruins' upset of top-ranked Stanford. Watson's 16
assists -- 12 of which came before halftime -- beat the UCLA record
of 15 set by Darrick Martin in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''He did just about everything you can do as a point guard,''
Williams said of Watson. ''He has picked up his game and has become
a very complete player. I think he gets lost sometimes in the
praise for the different members of their team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins hit six of their first eight shots and jumped to a
14-2 lead. In a sequence that was a harbinger of things to come,
Watson blocked a breakaway layup attempt by Maryland's Jason Blake,
got the ball back and threw a halfcourt alley-oop pass to Moiso,
who dunked it.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can really put them down,'' Watson said of his teammates'
appetites for the alley-oop passes. ''When you do that, it can
really break a team mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Maryland came right back with its own 11-2 run and briefly kept
the game close with five 3-pointers in the first half. But Watson
hooked up with Rush for two more ferocious alley-oops that started
UCLA's big run to close the half.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland looked helpless as the exuberant, confident Bruins put
on a display reminiscent of Jerry Tarkanian's loaded UNLV squads of
the early 1990s. On each of the Bruins' trips down the floor, the
fans buzzed with anticipation over what acrobatic feat UCLA would
pull off next.
</P>
<P>
   Moiso had nine rebounds and blocked three shots as every Bruin
in uniform scored. Even Brandon Brooks, who walked onto the
basketball team from the school's water polo team, got a late
basket as his teammates cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ''That shows what we've got when all of us are playing,'' Rush
said. ''It's unbelievable. You saw that tonight.''

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Samaki Walker came off the bench to score a
season-high 18 points and grab 10 rebounds to help the San Antonio
Spurs to a 102-82 victory over the Denver Nuggets on Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson and Tim Duncan each chipped in 13 points, with
Robinson grabbing 12 rebounds and Duncan 10. Playing in his third
game since returning earlier in the week from a kidney transplant,
Sean Elliott had a season-high five points in 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gatling led Denver with 23 points off the bench, while
Antonio McDyess added 16.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 55-48 lead early in the third quarter, San
Antonio went on a 16-2 run to go ahead 71-50 on Jerome Kersey's
jump shot with 1:42 to play in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Denver closed the quarter on a 9-2 run and trailed 73-59 going
to the fourth, but the Nuggets could get no closer the rest of the
way as Walker led San Antonio with eight points in the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by Elliott's 3-point field goal, San Antonio went on a
14-0 first-quarter run and led 24-14 after one.
</P>
<P>
   Gatling kept the Nuggets in the game in the first half with 14
points. Duncan had nine first half points as San Antonio led 47-39
at halftime.
</P>
<P>
Notes The Spurs have defeated Denver seven straight times in San
Antonio and now own a 47-11 lead over the Nuggets in games played
at home . . . The Spurs won the season series 3-1. . . . San
Antonio is now 25-8 at the Alamodome this season . . . Saturday's
double-double was the 144th of Duncan's career, the most in the NBA
over the last two-plus years . . . Tariq Abdul-Wahad did not play
for Denver because of a sprained left wrist.

<HEADLINE> Toronto's Berard To Have Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Bryan Berard will
have surgery on his injured right eye Tuesday, and might get a
better idea of his chances of regaining sight in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Berard consulted with retinal surgeon Dr. Stanley Chang in New
York on Friday and will meet with him again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a combination of exploratory surgery, as well as a
chance to clean the blood out and repair whatever damage they
can,'' Tom Laidlaw, Berard's agent, said Saturday. ''Once they get
in the eye, they'll better be able to tell the extent of the
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard was injured March 11 in Ottawa when Senators forward
Marian Hossa flailed at a bouncing puck with his stick, missed and
struck Berard in the right eye. The blow cut the eyeball, detached
the retina and broke the orbital bone.
</P>
<P>
   After being flown by air ambulance to Toronto, Berard consulted
with eye specialist Dr. Rob Devenyi last Tuesday. But because of
the amount of blood in the eye, it was impossible to offer a
definitive prognosis.
</P>
<P>
   Berard, 23, returned to his family's home at Woonsocket, R.I.,
to rest and seek further medical advice.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's kind of anxious more than anything,'' Laidlaw said. ''He
was in quite a bit of pain, but doctors said that was to be
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's subsided somewhat and now he's feeling anxiety. He
wants to find out what's going on with his eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Laidlaw said Berard opted for Chang, chair of Columbia
University's department of ophthalmology, to perform the surgery
because the doctor comes ''highly recommended. He's thought of as
one of the foremost experts in the world -- certainly in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Berard also wanted ''to remain close to home and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than clearing blood from the eye cavity, it is believed
Chang will attempt to reattach the retina.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where the photo receptors are,'' Devenyi explained last
week. ''Those photo receptors are connected with the optic nerve to
the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the retina, made of nerve tissue, can be reattached,
there is no guarantee it will regain its function.
</P>
<P>
   ''That regeneration takes months and it can take as long as a
year to get as good as it's going to get,'' Devenyi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what I understand, sometimes the damage is not that bad,
yet a patient will regain no sight,'' Laidlaw said. ''Sometimes
it's real bad, but the patient regains some sight.''

<HEADLINE> Brief Power Outage in New Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A grass fire that burned a power line
knocked out electricity to nearly 550,000 New Mexico customers for
up to two hours Saturday,snarling traffic in Albuquerque, shutting
down radio and television stations and forcing the state high
school basketball tournament to halt play.
</P>
<P>
   Candy Hurst, an adoption supervisor with the state Department of
Children, Youth and Families, was in her downtown Albuquerque
office building during the blackout.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to use my video camera light to get down seven flights
of stairs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in the Four Corners area burned a transmission line,
which caused two power plants to shut down, utility officials said.
People lost power from anywhere from 40 minutes to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   From Las Cruces to Gallup to Albuquerque to Santa Fe to Taos,
power went out shortly before 5 p.m. It came back on, in phases
from south to north, after about 6 p.m. By 8 p.m., the southern
part of the state was fully restored and Albuquerque was more than
85 percent restored, utility officials said. More than half of
Santa Fe had its power restored.
</P>
<P>
   Power to hospitals was 100 percent restored, Public Service
Company of New Mexico spokeswoman Julie Grey said. Backup
generators kicked in at the area jails and juvenile detention
centers, which were temporary locked down, officials in Albuquerque
said.
</P>
<P>
   The outage began with several sharp surges and then darkness.
Power came back on in about 15 minutes, then went out again 15
minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a fire on one of our major transmission lines from the
San Juan Generating Station (near Farmington) to Albuquerque,''
Grey said. ''It was caused by a grass fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire caused the Four Corners Generating Station to ''trip
off line,'' Grey said. The cause of the 4:45 p.m. blaze was not
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Grey said power would be restored from south to north -- the
southern restoration being assisted by El Paso Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   All of Public Service Company of New Mexico's 360,000 customers
statewide were affected by the blackout, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The same fire caused another utility, Plains Electric, to lose
power from its plant that serves several northern New Mexico
communities. About 187,500 of Plains' 250,000 customers were
blacked out, said spokeswoman Amy Miller, bringing the total
affected to about 547,500.
</P>
<P>
   The outage left traffic lights out, causing major snarls
throughout Albuquerque. There was also a brief period of
pandemonium at two Albuquerque malls.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody just started screaming,'' said Rebecca Lies, an
employee at Stacy's Hallmark at the Coronado Center. ''So I got the
flashlight and I said, 'Just follow the light.''' She led 10 to 15
people outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   Damian Sutton, assistant manager of Software Etc. at the Winrock
mall, said all the stores had to close and roll down their security
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to kick everybody out of the store,'' he said,
including about 30 customers at an estimated cost in lost business
of $2,000 to $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   A bartender at the Radisson Hotel and Suites in Santa Fe was
stuck in an elevator for about half an hour, desk clerk Morgan
Sweet said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He just pressed the alarm button,'' which opened the doors,
Sweet said, ''and he got out through the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Many radio, television stations and newspaper newsrooms in
Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Taos, Los Alamos and Socorro were affected
by the blackout. The Associated Press bureau in Albuquerque was in
the dark, off and on, for nearly two hours.
</P>
<P>
   People with battery-powered television sets were able to watch
the NCAA basketball tournament. The state high school tournament,
however, had to be halted when the lights went out in the Pan
American Center in Las Cruces in southern New Mexico. The game was
completed after about a 40-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Packer, who just moved to Albuquerque from Aurora, Ore.,
was among the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was worried for the fans because I thought people might
panic,'' Packer said, suggesting tournament officials could have
informed people about the situation, but ''they never did.''
</P>
<P>
   El Paso, Texas, also had a citywide outage for about 30 minutes
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Ko, owner of the Ko Palace restaurant in Albuquerque,
said he stayed open -- a la candlelight -- throughout the blackout,
and picked up extra customers from all the other restaurants that
closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're cooking with gas,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ga. Repeats Swimming Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Georgia set a U.S. record in the 400-meter
freestyle relay Saturday night and clinched its second straight
team title in the women's NCAA Swimming and Diving Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia scored 490{ points to withstand a challenge from
Arizona, second with 472.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford, which had finished in the top two for 11 consecutive
years, was third with 397 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia quartet of Courtney Shealy, Stefanie Williams,
Jennifer Mihalik and Maritza Correia swam the 400 relay in 3
minutes, 37.67 seconds, chopping 0.30 off the record set earlier
Saturday by the U.S. national team at the Short Course World
Championships in Athens, Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jack Bauerle said this championship was tougher to
win than last year's, which came at the Bulldogs' home pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a point in January where we were skeleton of what we
saw tonight,'' said Bauerle, whose team had a series of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Shealy and teammate Kristy Kowal each won a third individual
event.
</P>
<P>
   Shealy led off the relay in 53.70, even faster than the 53.99
she swam in winning Saturday's 100-meter freestyle. She became the
third American -- after Jenny Thompson and Angel Martino -- to break
the 54-second barrier in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Kowal won the 200 breaststroke with her fourth American record
of this meet and seventh NCAA title of her career.
</P>
<P>
   She twice broke her own American record, clocking 2:22.39 in
morning preliminaries and 2:22.05 in the final. Through 150 meters,
Kowal was on pace to break the world record of 2:20.22 set by
Japan's Masami Tanaka in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona freshman Amanda Beard, a double silver medalist in the
breaststroke at the 1996 Olympics, was second in 2:22.84.
</P>
<P>
   Another Arizona freshman, Beth Botsford, broke her own American
record with a time of 2:06.70 in the 200 backstroke. Botsford, the
Olympic champion in the 100 backstroke, threatened the world record
of 2:06.09, set by Cihong He of China in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada's Limin Liu, an Olympic silver medalist for China in the
100 butterfly, won the 200 fly in 2:06.04. Stanford's Misty Hyman,
a 1998 World Championships bronze medalist in the event, was second
in 2:06.55.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, swimmers at the NCAA championships were
eligible for world records, which must be set at metric distances.
The 25-meter course is a departure from the traditional 25-yard
length for collegiate pools.
</P>
<P>
   That change, plus the quality of competition, contributed to a
wave of records in the three-day meet: three world and 12 American.
</P>
<P>
   In seven individual events common to the NCAAs and Short Course
Worlds, the NCAA winner was fast enough for a world medal. In two
NCAA events Saturday -- the 200 breaststroke and 200 butterfly -- the
top two were faster than the world champion.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish it hadn't been this same weekend,'' Kowal said. ''I
would have loved to go to Greece.''

<HEADLINE> Tyler, Texas 57, SW Illinois 39  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALINA, Kan. (AP) -- Jessica Guild scored 16 points and twin
sister Nicole had five assists and four steals as Tyler (Texas)
beat Southwestern Illinois 57-39 Saturday night to win its first
National Junior College championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler (34-2) played a stifling defense that forced 23 turnovers
and held Southwestern Illinois to 15 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler took control from the opening tipoff behind Aimee
Michelson, who scored the Apache Ladies' first 10 points en route
to a 12-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Illinois (32-4) surprised Central Arizona in the
quarterfinals and Grayson County, Texas, in the semifinals to get
into the title game.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutchwomen did it with defense, particularly a 1-3-1 zone
defense, but Tyler's quick start Saturday forced Southwestern
Illinois to come out of its zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got basketball-smart players,'' Tyler coach Lee Ann Riley
said. ''They're able to adjust. We were able to combat their zone,
and when they went to a man-to-man, I felt a whole lot more
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The second half belonged to Tyler's defense as Southwestern
Illinois shot just 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Michelson scored 12 points before fouling out and Jessica and
Nicole Guildshared the most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   Leah Frierson led Southwestern Illinois with seven points.
Peaches Anderson, the Dutchwomen's spark plug, showed the fatigue
of playing all but one minute of the tournament, finishing with
just two points.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler controlled the first half after taking its early lead.
Southwestern Illinois got as close as four points at 23-19, but
Tyler quickly answered with an 8-0 run to match its biggest lead of
the half at 12. The Apache Ladies led 33-24 at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Report: Gore Posts Average Grades  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore posted only average
grades as a student at a prestigious Washington prep school, in
most of his courses at Harvard and during brief graduate studies at
Vanderbilt, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said in Sunday's editions that it obtained Gore's
transcripts independently and noted that some of the information
had been cited previously by a Newsweek writer in a biography of
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The Post published a photograph of some of Gore's transcripts,
along with some of those of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, whose grades
at Yale were first been reported on last November by The New Yorker
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Citing academic records of both men, the Post said Gore entered
Harvard with an 1355 SAT score while Bush arrived at Yale for
undergraduate work with a 1206 SAT total.
</P>
<P>
   Once in college, both men posted similarly mixed academic
records, the Post said, pointing out that in his sophomore year at
Harvard, ''Gore's grades were lower than any semester recorded on
Bush's transcript from Yale.''
</P>
<P>
   It said Gore received one D, one c-minus, two C's, two C-pluses
and one B-minus, placing him in the lower fifth of the class for a
second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   His high school record at St. Albans school in Washington also
was sprinkled heavily with C's and B's, with an occasional A.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have here a boy who shows a lot of potential,'' John C.
Davis, a retired teacher and assistant headmaster at St. Albans,
told the Post after reviewing Gore's achievement test scores and
grades. ''He was as a rule a hard worker, but he wasn't really
interested in certain things and when he wasn't so interested he
tried faithfully to do what he was supposed to, though not
necessarily very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who wrote Gore's recommendation to Harvard, said he was
not concerned about his transcript full of C's and B's and his
middle rank in the class at St. Albans.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Al's case, he was what Harvard most wanted at that time,''
Davis told the Post. ''What they wanted was competent academic
performance plus future potential. Plus they were very impressed by
the fact that he was a political son. Colleges like Harvard,
Princeton and Yale are just as excited to get important sons as top
academic scholars. They want our boys as much as our boys want
them. And Al was captain of the football team. Any nice big boy was
welcome if he played football.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a lackluster start, Gore earned a B, a B-plus and an
A-minus in three government courses and acted his senior government
thesis for a strong finish than made him a cum laude graduate.
</P>
<P>
   His senior government thesis topic: the impact of television on
the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Iowa State Wrestlers Win Title  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Iowa's Eric Juergens won the only head-to-head
matchup against Iowa State, helping the Hawkeyes hold off their
in-state rivals and win a sixth straight NCAA wrestling
championship Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, which has won 20 of the last 26 titles, finished with 116
points. Iowa State's Cael Sanderson stretched his college record to
79-0 with another lopsided victory and was selected most
outstanding wrestler for the second straight year. But the
Cyclones, who led by 9.5 points after the semifinals, won only one
of four finals and had 109.5 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never got the hay in the barn,'' Iowa State coach Bobby
Douglas said. ''Our guys, some of them wrestled over their heads,
and Iowa just had a great tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota was a distant third with 80 points, followed by
Oklahoma with 69.5 and Oklahoma State with 66.5. Illinois (59.5)
was sixth, followed by Lehigh (46.5), Nebraska (45.5) and Penn and
Wisconsin (44) tied for 10th.
</P>
<P>
   A strong finish in the consolation bracket, with three No. 1
seeds who were upset in the quarterfinals rallying to finish third,
gave Iowa a 7.5-point cushion heading into the finals. Juergens
opened the gap to 11.5 points when he beat the Cyclones' Cody
Anderson 3-1 in overtime for the 133-pound championship, the second
bout of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ''The team comes because you wrestle your hardest,'' Juergens
said. ''I don't know that I wrestled my best, but I wrestled
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Juergens said the performances of 125-pound Jody Strittmatter,
141-pound Doug Schwab and 157-pound T.J. Williams earlier Saturday
inspired him during the tightly contested struggle. Strittmatter
and Schwab both won major decisions, giving Iowa two extra team
points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They put it in our hands,'' Juergens said. ''I was wrestling
for them as much as I was for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Strittmatter beat T.J. Hill of Cal-State Fullerton 11-2 and
Schwab had an 8-1 lead when his opponent, Mark Angle of Clarion,
had to default due to a knee injury at 2:06. Schwab wasn't bashful
about wrenching the leg in question after Angle had to take an
injury timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like a shark, I smelled blood and just went after it,'' Schwab
said.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa won handily even though its only other finalist,
heavyweight Wes Hand, lost 3-2 when top-seeded Brock Lesnar escaped
with nine seconds to go in a tiebreaker following overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way we did it, to me, it was pretty special,'' coach Jim
Zalesky said. ''I was proud of the way the team responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanderson, a 184-pound sophomore, beat Vertus Jones of West
Virginia 19-6 to continue a run of mismatches. Sanderson was
leading his first match 19-6 before pinning his opponent, and had
similar lopsided scores of 20-5 and 16-5 before the finals.
</P>
<P>
   For the season, he had 14 technical falls and 11 pins.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like close matches,'' Sanderson said. ''There's too
much stress. I try to make it as easy as I can by working as hard
as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cyclones, who last won the title in 1987, missed two
chances to make it close when top-seeded Joe Heskett lost in
overtime to No. 2 Don Pritzlaff of Wisconsin at 165 pounds and
fourth seed Zach Thompson fell 2-1 in overtime to Brad Vering of
Nebraska at 197.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't have any of the breaks we needed,'' Sanderson said.
''And unfortunately, Iowa stepped it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top seed, 149-pound Tony Davis, became Northern Iowa's
first champion since 1963 when he scored a near fall with 23
seconds left in overtime to beat Adam Tirapelle of Illinois 5-1. At
174, Byron Tucker of Oklahoma beat Josh Koscheck of Edinboro State
3-0,
</P>
<P>
   At 125 pounds, No. 2 seed Jeremy Hunter of Penn State beat Steve
Garland of Virginia 7-3. Garland was the eighth seed and upset the
top seed, Jody Strittmatter of Iowa, in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The upset of the evening came at 141 pounds, where eighth-seeded
Carl Perry of Illinois beat No. 2 Michael Lightner of Oklahoma 5-3.
Perry beat defending champion Doug Schwab of Iowa in the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   At 157 pounds, No. 2 seed Brett Matter of Penn beat Larry Quisel
of Boise State, who knocked off Iowa's Williams in the quarters.
Matter's father, Andy, was a champion for Penn State at 167 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament set a record attendance of 96,994 for the six
sessions, including 16,795 for the finals. The previous record was
90,064 at Northern Iowa in 1997.
