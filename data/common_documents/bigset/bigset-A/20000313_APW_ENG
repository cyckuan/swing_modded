Clinton, NRA Spar Over Gun Laws

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charges of dishonesty and fear-mongering over tougher gun
laws flew Sunday in back-to-back TV appearances by President Clinton and a top
official of the National Rifle Association with Clinton accusing the group of
''knee-jerk'' opposition to any gun safety measure. NRA executive vice-president
Wayne LaPierre, in turn, accused the president of exploiting gun deaths for
political purposes. One point at issue was a new advertising campaign in which
NRA President Charlton Heston all but accuses the president of lying in his

   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- Salvador's leftist former rebels claimed
victory in election for mayor of the capital and said they expected gains in

Pope Seeks Pardon for Catholics

   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- In an unprecedented moment in the history of the church,
Pope John Paul II asked God's forgiveness Sunday for the sins of Roman Catholics
through the ages, including wrongs inflicted on Jews, women and minorities. The
apology was a personal landmark for a frail, ailing pope who vowed to cleanse
and reinvigorate Catholicism for its third millennium. The church burned
heretics at the stake during the Inquisition. Armies of the faithful slaughtered
Muslims during the Crusades. And during the Holocaust, some Catholics stood
silent in the face of Nazi genocide.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- High fuel prices caused Energy secretary Bill Richardson

in Congress to suspend the federal gasoline excise tax imposed in 1993 until

US Ships $181B in High-Tech Exports

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States exported a record $181 billion worth of
computer components and other high-tech electronic parts last year, but much of
it came back as assembled products, resulting in a record $40 billion trade
deficit for the industry, an industry study said Sunday. The biggest markets for
high-tech exports continue to be Canada, Mexico, Japan and the United Kingdom,

<HEADLINE> Assembly Democrats to back two-month waiver of state gas tax  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- People endeavoring to get to the beautiful,
though far-flung, vacation destinations in New York deserve a break
this summer from high gasoline prices, Democrats in the state
Assembly say.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly will propose this week eliminating the state's 4
percent sales tax on gasoline for about two months at the height of
tourism season this summer. That would cost the state some $60
million, but Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said it might also
keep tourists coming to eastern Long Island, the Adirondack and
Catskill mountains, the Finger Lakes, the Thousand Islands, the
Great Lakes, Lake Champlain, Niagara Falls and other summer
showcases in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of people vacationing in those areas must
drive there instead of taking commercial transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think it's important to our upstate tourism industry and to
working men and women who are using cars to get to and from work,''
Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly Democratic proposal will call for the state portion
of the gas tax to be waived starting with the Fourth of July
weekend and to go back into force at the conclusion of the Labor
Day holiday. The proposal will give counties and municipalities
which also impose a local gas tax -- their add-ons are generally
between 3 percent and 4 percent -- the option of also waiving their
levies.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is similar to the state's elimination of its
portion of sales taxes on clothing purchases worth $110 or less.
That went into effect on March 1. A handful of localities -- most
significantly New York City -- also decided to give up their portion
of sales taxes on those purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly gas tax proposal will be included in the budget
resolution for the 2000-01 state fiscal year which the
Democrat-dominated Assembly plans to pass Wednesday, aides to
Silver said. Republicans who control the state Senate plan to pass
their own resolution this week, creating the possibility of
conference committees being convened to work out the remaining
details on a spending plan for the fiscal year which begins April
1.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly proposal would keep state taxes on diesel fuel,
used by trucks, other commercial vehicles and a small percentage of
passenger cars, in place.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers have been hit hard with a double whammy of sorts on
energy prices. OPEC's decision to curtail oil production caused
crude oil prices to climb, and a harsh stretch of weather in
January and early February caused the price of home heating oil to
soar in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Gasoline prices have followed suit, with unleaded regular now
routinely costing $1.50 or more a gallon. Some predict that prices
will continue to escalate into the summer tourist months, Silver
said.
</P>
<P>
   Silver also said he would release today a letter asking state
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer to investigate possible gasoline
price-gouging in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prices of crude oil went up significantly, but the prices
at the pump have gone up more significantly,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Spitzer, Darren Dopp, said Sunday the attorney
general has found recent instances where home heating oil suppliers
had failed to honor the contracted price of oil with their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dopp said that where global market forces are at work
such as OPEC production quotas and a national cold snap, ''it may
be that factors driving prices up are not technically illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will review it (Silver's request) carefully,'' Dopp said.
''We do have an ongoing review of the dramatic rise in energy
prices and whenever we find instances of companies breaking the law
we are acting aggressively. But we have to counsel that the
(price-gouging) law itself ... is not clear in the state in regards
to gasoline. It is clear in regards to milk.''

Gore Rolls Up Delegate Totals
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   A smaller-than-expected turnout of about 11,000 people at the first
Democratic weekend caucuses in Minnesota gave Vice President Al Gore a near
sweep as anticipated in a binding presidential poll. Gore also was expected to
pick up all 20 delegates at stake after a resounding victory Sunday at caucuses
in Nevada where there were even fewer voters. With 14 of 17 counties reporting
in Nevada, Gore had 92 percent of the vote to 8 percent for Bill Bradley and
others. Although no official delegate assignments were made by the party, state
chairman Rory Reid noted that Bradley would have had to get at least 15 percent
of the votes cast in either of Nevada's two congressional districts to win any
delegates.

<HEADLINE> Salvador Rebels Claim Election Win  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- The country's leftist former
rebels won renewed control of the capital in elections Sunday and
held a razor-thin lead over the rightist governing party in the
congressional vote.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent Hector Silva of the Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front proclaimed victory in San Salvador -- the most
important of 262 mayoral races in the nationwide elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am here to confirm the victory,'' Silva, a 53-year-old
Boston-born gynecologist, said during a news conference. His
victory three years ago was the biggest electoral boost the Front
has yet achieved in the country.
</P>
<P>
   With 67 percent of the vote counted in the capital, Silva had 56
percent of the vote to 39 percent for Luis Cardenal of the
Nationalist Republican Alliance, or ARENA, that governs the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The Front, known as the FMLN, also was barely leading the
Alliance in voting for 84 congressional seats. With 22.7 percent of
the vote counted, it had 39 percent to 38 percent for the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   A center-left party, the Democratic Center Union, was running
third with 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently worried by pre-election poll results, President
Francisco Flores earlier Sunday urged Salvadorans to vote against
''those who opposed the establishment of our democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Flores' comments outraged the FMLN, which became a political
party following the January 1992 peace accord that ended a 12-year
civil war in which 76,000 people died.
</P>
<P>
   ''What President Flores is doing is prohibited; he is not acting
as president. He is nothing more than a (party) campaign
activist,'' said Schafick Handal, a former guerrilla commander who
is seeking re-election to congress.
</P>
<P>
   But as the polls closed at 5 p.m., he expressed confidence that
the FMLN and its center-left allies would make significant gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be a new balance of power in El Salvador,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Silva's victory three years ago in the capital was the biggest
electoral boost the Front had yet achieved in the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the leftist party calls for halting the government's
privatization program, it has also called for cutting taxes and
tightening anti-corruption laws.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral officials said fewer than 50 percent of the 3 million
eligible voters turned out to cast ballots for congressmen, mayors
and 20 representatives to the Central American Parliament. Eight
parties were participating.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Just Wants To Be Left Alone  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Li Pao-luan hoists her two toddlers into a
rusty truck and grabs her microphone. Her husband twirls the
mallets he uses to beat a huge drum as the couple prepares to do
something that was once illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Festooned with banners that read ''Taiwan Independence,'' the
vehicle with a cracked windshield begins cruising Taipei's narrow
streets. Through a scratchy speaker, Li yells, ''From this time on
we must be independent!''
</P>
<P>
   The couple is among a growing number of Taiwanese who think this
tobacco leaf-shaped island 80 miles off China's east coast should
be an independent nation and not reunify with the mainland. It is a
sentiment that causes China's communist regime in Beijing to warn
of war.
</P>
<P>
   But while many Taiwanese agree with the idea, people haven't
rushed to join the Lis' tiny Association for Taiwan Independence,
nor has there been a clamor to make independence a central issue in
Sunday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three major candidates is promising independence,
and months ago the fringe Independence Party dropped out of the
race because it couldn't collect enough petition signatures to get
its candidate on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Although many people don't want to reunify with China, they are
reluctant to support a politician who aggressively campaigns for
independence. The reason is simple: China's repeated threats to
attack Taiwan if it tries to break away permanently.
</P>
<P>
   By declaring independence, Taiwan would risk losing the de facto
sovereignty it has enjoyed since the island broke away from the
mainland during the civil war 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''People will not dare say the word 'independence,' but I still
have hope in the future,'' says Su Beng, an 84-year-old activist
who once fled to Japan when the independence movement was outlawed
during Taiwan's martial law era.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taiwan and China were never really one country. Historically,
both societies developed separately,'' Su says.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 100 years, a government in China has ruled Taiwan
for only four years. The island was a Japanese colony for about 50
years until the end of World War II. Since 1945, it has been
governed by the Nationalist Party, which fled the mainland after
the communists won the civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's official policy is that it will seek gradual
reunification with China once the mainland is democratic and more
economically advanced.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Beijing issued a new warning that it would use force
if Taiwan indefinitely dragged its feet on reunification talks.
</P>
<P>
   It's these marry-me-or-die threats that are driving more
Taiwanese to favor independence, says Taiwan's Mainland Affairs
Council, which handles China policy.
</P>
<P>
   A survey commissioned by the council said an all-time high of 45
percent of the island's people consider themselves Taiwanese, not
Chinese. Only 14 percent of those polled said they were Chinese,
and 40 percent said they were both Chinese and Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
   The Taipei-based Burke Marketing Research firm interviewed 1,067
people Feb. 23-26 -- after China issued its new threat. The poll had
a margin of error of 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about ties with China, the biggest segment -- 35 percent --
favored maintaining the status quo and considering unification at
an unspecified later date. About 19 percent wanted to keep the
status quo forever, and another 19 favored eventual unification.
</P>
<P>
   About 12 percent favored gradual independence and about 6
percent wanted immediate independence. Only 2 percent favored
immediate reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Koo Kuang-ming, brother of Taipei's chief negotiator with China,
is skeptical that talks with China would lead to reunification.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, there's no way to negotiate,'' says the 74-year-old
tycoon who can trace his ancestry back hundreds of years to a
village in central Taiwan. ''Twenty-three million people here have
made it clear that they will not accept China's proposals.''
</P>
<P>
   The longer the two sides stay apart, the harder it might be to
reunify. It's becoming fashionable for young Taiwanese to explore
and develop their own culture, one with fewer ties to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstore owner Wu Cheng-san is trying to feed the growing
appetite for things Taiwanese. His store near the elite National
Taiwan University sells previously banned pro-independence
literature, sculptures from Taiwan's indigenous minorities and
tapes to learn Taiwan's local dialect.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our hearts, we know we are an independent country,'' Wu
says.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Ascent Worries Activists  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Soon after Vladimir Putin was named acting
president, some human rights activists huddled together in a smoky
Moscow office to consider what the ex-KGB agent's striking ascent
would mean for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Their verdict: ''Nothing good,'' according to Sasha Daniel, who
works for the human rights group Memorial and whose parents were
famous Soviet-era dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   With Putin almost certain to win March 26 presidential
elections, human rights activists fear he will roll back liberties
they fought for in the communist era. Putin has already cranked up
pressure on outspoken journalists, strengthened the secret
services, and waged a war in Chechnya that rights groups staunchly
oppose.
</P>
<P>
   But few activists predict a full-fledged revival of Soviet-style
political persecutions, strict censorship and closed borders. So
far, all they've seen are a few worrying signs. Even Putin, they
hope, understands that Russia has tasted too much freedom in the
past decade to allow that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dissidents are among the few to cast doubt on Putin's
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Russians appear unconcerned by the two things that most
worry human rights defenders in Russia and the West: Putin's 15
years with the Soviet-era KGB -- which killed, imprisoned and
persecuted millions -- and his role in waging Moscow's war in
Chechnya, which has killed thousands, mostly civilians.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Putin's strict stance on Chechnya has been a key source
of his popularity for many Russians, who are fed up with the
kidnapping and other crime that has festered in and around the
breakaway republic in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's rigid demeanor and law-and-order refrain also appeal to
Russians frustrated by years of corrupt, capricious leadership
under Boris Yeltsin. And Putin's secret police past is not a mark
of shame in Russia, which has not confronted its totalitarian past
the way many Eastern European nations have.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin hasn't denounced his past or that of the KGB. He even
speaks of it proudly, embraces it,'' said Yuri Samodurov, director
of the Sakharov Foundation, which honors Soviet physicist and
dissident Andrei Sakharov. ''We are very much on guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he noted that some dissidents who resisted Soviet rule now
support Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ''They, like all of us, need to believe in something. Dissidents
have had little to believe in Russia recently,'' Samodurov said.
''Everything will depend on which freedoms people are willing to
surrender, and which freedoms they are willing to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   Samodurov was among several people who wrote a recent appeal to
Western governments to ostracize Putin for his rights record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under the present government, our country can expect, in the
foreseeable future, shattering upheavals that could impact
surrounding countries as well. And we appeal to the governments and
public of the West to re-examine their attitude toward the Kremlin
leadership, to cease conniving in its barbaric actions, its
dismantlement of democracy and suppression of human rights,'' the
statement read.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has dismissed suggestions that he would seek unlimited
powers or create a ''super-KGB,'' and he has pledged to respect
individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am deeply convinced there will be no development, no future
at all in the country if we suppress civil rights and freedom of
the press,'' Putin said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Yet signs of creeping state control have been increasing in
recent years, since before Putin rose to the Kremlin throne.
</P>
<P>
   After the Soviet Union's demise, Russia's secret police
underwent a wave of cutbacks and reforms. But many of those have
since been reversed. Yeltsin's last three prime ministers all had
intelligence backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has increased state surveillance of Internet activity,
starting when he was head of the Federal Security Service, or FSB,
the KGB's main successor, before being named prime minister last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian military has rigorously restricted journalists'
access to the Chechnya war. And police recently tried to send a
Moscow reporter who has written about corruption to a mental
hospital. In the Soviet era, dissidents were routinely confined to
asylums.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Nikitin, who was pursued by the FSB for four years
after he exposed unsafe storage of nuclear waste by the Russian
navy, said Putin is bad news for environmental activists and
crusaders for court reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''My friends and colleagues and I discuss all the time the
future for us and for Russia, regarding human rights, with the
appearance of this new president,'' Nikitin said. ''We have little
optimism.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin was acquitted of treason charges in December. The case
enraged environmental and human rights groups worldwide. Putin
headed the FSB during much of the investigation, but commented on
it publicly only once -- to say Nikitin was guilty.

<HEADLINE> Pope Seeks Pardon for Catholics  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- It was what Pope John Paul II didn't say
during a solemn Day of Pardon Mass that has elicited the most
impassioned responses. While many welcome the pope's appeal for
God's forgiveness, some had hoped for more explicit apologies.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's chief rabbi, Meir Lau, said he was ''deeply
frustrated'' by the pope's failure to mention the Holocaust in the
eagerly awaited ''mea culpa'' Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A Catholic mission that ministers to the Roma, or Gypsies, in
Rome, asked: ''Why is the Holocaust of the Gypsies not mentioned?''
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's special Mass, the pope asked God's forgiveness for
the sins of Catholics through the ages, including wrongs inflicted
on Jews, women, and minorities. But he spoke mostly in general
terms, not mentioning the Holocaust, the Inquisition or Crusades by
name and listing few specific groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John Pawlikowski, professor of social ethics at
Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, said the pope ''pushed the
envelope far as he could, given the opposition to the apology''
among Catholics who feared tarnishing the church's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pawlikowski, who participated in a 1998 closed-door
Vatican meeting to advise the pope on the pardon and Judaism, said
he would have preferred more direct language.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would have liked the pope to express regret for the
centuries of anti-Judaic teaching that has been conveyed through
preaching, catechesis and religious art,'' Pawlikowski said. And he
would have liked the pope to state that some people who committed
sins against Jews ''were leaders of the highest level.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the criticism, the apology was a personal landmark for
the frail, 79-year-old pope, who vowed to cleanse and reinvigorate
Catholicism for its third millennium.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul and the five cardinals and two bishops who also
delivered the confession of sins with him were dressed in heavy
purple robes, the color of penitence. The pope leaned on his silver
staff, his voice clear but his hands trembling, a symptom of
Parkinson's.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the confessions, he embraced a large crucifix on
the altar for the special Mass, imploring God's forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Edward Cassidy recalled the ''sufferings of the people
of Israel'' and asked divine pardon for ''the sins committed by not
a few (Catholics) against the people of the Covenant.''
</P>
<P>
   After a moment of silent prayer, the pope responded: ''We are
deeply saddened by the behavior of those who in the course of
history have caused these children of yours to suffer, and asking
your forgiveness we wish to commit ourselves to genuine
brotherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to women's issues, Sister Donna Quinn, director of
Chicago Catholic Women, said she is less concerned about the
language used to discuss discrimination than the actions that
follow.
</P>
<P>
   If the pope ''is sincerely asking for forgiveness, he would have
to change the policies of the Catholic Church that discriminate
against women, such as ordination,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Garcia, director of Equality Illinois, a gay civil rights
group, said he ''was deeply touched'' that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
of Los Angeles discussed gays and lesbians in his public apology
last week, but was not surprised that the pope did not.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that Rome is willing to make amends for the
horrible way it treats gay and lesbian Catholics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yosef ''Tommy'' Lapid, a Holocaust survivor and head of Israel's
secular Shinui party, was among those who wanted the pope to
apologize directly to the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is high time for the pope to ask for forgiveness from the
Jewish people,'' he said, ''not only for the silence of (Pope) Pius
XII during Auschwitz and the Holocaust, but for all the sins that
the church committed toward the Jews in 2,000 years of a very sad
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls had warned that the
pope's intention was never to ask for forgiveness from people. The
pope, he said, asks for forgiveness from God.
</P>
<P>
   Lau and other Israelis expressed hope that the pope will talk
about the Holocaust when he visits Yad Vashem, the Holocaust
memorial in Israel, during his March 20-26 pilgrimage to the Holy
Land.
</P>
<P>
   But Pawlikowski noted that the pope could ''cause more problems
if he offers a spirited defense of Pius XII.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish leaders have said that Pius failed to speak out
against the Nazis during the Holocaust, while the Vatican has
consistently defended him. The issue remains a source of tension on
the eve of the papal visit.

<HEADLINE> Chagall, Soutine and, yes, Modigliani at Jewish Museum  </HEADLINE>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- They came from Eastern Europe, some from
traditional Jewish villages and Orthodox families, others from
well-to-do circumstances in big cities like Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless of their backgrounds, the artists featured in a
new exhibit at The Jewish Museum all ended up in cosmopolitan Paris
between 1907 and 1939, an era when Post-Impressionism, Fauvism and
Cubism served up a heady brew of influences. Drawn like other
bohemians to the art word's capital, these Jewish artists achieved
success and renown for their work before Nazism scattered them
again.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paris in New York'' features 38 works by 12 artists including
Marc Chagall, Max Weber, Chaim Soutine and Amedeo Modigliani. Yes,
Modigliani was Jewish! But with assimilation and his Italian name
and upbringing (he's the only one of the 12 who wasn't born in
Eastern Europe), it's not well-known. And unlike Chagall, who grew
up in a Russian shtetl and incorporates Jewish symbols and images
into his work, Modigliani's instantly recognizable portrait style
with its oval faces, swan necks and irisless eyes offers no clues
to his religious identity.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the 38 paintings and sculptures featured here are
borrowed from private collectors in New York; hence the exhibit's
title ''Paris in New York.'' The goal of the show was to highlight
rarely seen works. While that deprives viewers of the chance to
revisit better-known masterpieces, it also brings to light unknown
treasures. An audio-tour even features quotes from the private
collectors, and hearing their intimate reactions to the art is like
comparing notes with a friend on how you personally relate to a
certain piece.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Olden, the collector who loaned Jules Pascin's ''The
Turkish Family,'' says that the painting of nine cheerful
individuals, from a little girl to a jaunty man in a top hat,
gathered beneath a blissful cherub, reminded him of how his own
clan arrived in New York from Hitler's Germany: ''We were like
Pascin's Turkish family, like the refugees who escaped from Turkey
in the late 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Two bronze nudes, each about 2 feet tall, by Elie Nadelman, were
loaned by Bernard Goldberg, who is quoted as seeing the two in a
sexual courtship: ''The woman -- very coy, very, very guarded. And
the male, although he is kind of androgynous, is saying, you know,
'Come on, let's get on with it.' ... When the museum asked if they
could borrow one, I said: 'You can't borrow one without the other
because I think they relate to each other.'''
</P>
<P>
   There are two Chagalls in the exhibit: ''Rabbi,'' a moody
painting in blacks and grays of a man standing with his eyes shut,
lost in thought and stroking a long beard, a crowd of tumble-down
houses in the background; and ''Carpenters and Fishes,'' a brightly
colored picture of two men working a handsaw, with a whimsical blue
fish floating in the corner of a yellow sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Modiglianis include several portraits, among them the 1916
masterpiece ''Portrait of Anna (Hanka) Zborowska,'' an almost
classical depiction of a serene, elegant woman with the artist's
trademark hollowed-out eyes, like a statue's gaze gone
one-dimensional.
</P>
<P>
   Chaim Soutine's work is the most unsettling with its grim
depiction of even the most benign subjects. ''Little Girl with a
Doll'' shows a waif with haunting black pools for eyes, her lips
turned down, clutching a lump of a doll with eyes but no face. Both
girl and doll bring to mind Edvard Munch's famous Expressionist
work ''The Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   Soutine's ''The Communicant,'' which interestingly portrays a
Catholic subject, shows a girl dressed in a wedding-like gown, but
her expression conveys sorrow and dread. The bloody ''Hanging
Turkey'' bears a gruesome resemblance to a human corpse. And in
''House at Oiseme,'' even his landscape is infused with foreboding
-- black trees, a ghostly mansion, wispy clouds hanging like
question marks.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit also features two enchanting sculptures by Jacques
Lipchitz: ''Acrobat on Horseback,'' a joyful study of motion,
curves and lines; and ''Detachable Figure: Seated Musician,'' a
cello player that is both a realistic wooden statue and a Cubist
construct of geometric shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Moise Kisling's ''Large Reclining Nude, Kiki,'' is a sexy 1925
portrait of a well-known artist-model and cabaret singer whose
curvy white body nearly floats above the floral chaise she reclines
on. Mane-Katz's Post-Impressionist ''Landscape'' uses short,
heavily layered streaks of paint to portray a jumble of simple
peak-roofed homes.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit runs through June 25 at the Jewish Museum, located
on Fifth Avenue at 93rd Street. You may want to go a few blocks
down the avenue to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which is hosting
''Painters in Paris: 1895-1950.'' The Met show includes Chagall and
Modigliani among 100 other artists and makes a good companion to
the more modest show at the Jewish Museum.

<HEADLINE> Spain's Premier Wins Election  </HEADLINE>
By KERNAN TURNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Spanish voters handed their prime minister
-- one of the European Union's few conservative leaders -- a major
victory in general elections, allowing him to continue the
free-market policies he credits for Spain's vibrant economy.
</P>
<P>
   Surpassing the expectations of pre-election polls, Jose Maria
Aznar on Sunday secured 183 seats in the 350-member Parliament for
his conservative Popular Party. That is up from 156 in the last
legislature and more than the 170 polls had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've won the elections!'' Aznar shouted from a balcony at
party headquarters in Madrid as enthusiastic party supporters
cheered and chanted and waved red and yellow Spanish flags in the
street below.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Ana Botella, at his side, Aznar promised a
government ''open to dialogue'' with other political parties and
''all of Spanish society.''
</P>
<P>
   With 100 percent of the votes counted, Aznar's party won 44.54
percent of the vote, the Interior Ministry reported. Socialists won
34 percent and dropped to 125 seats from 141. Their allies in the
communist-dominated United Left coalition slumped to eight seats
from 21.
</P>
<P>
   The moderate Basque Nationalist Party got 1.7 percent of the
votes and seven seats, up from five. The rest were shared among
small regional parties. Of Spain's 34 million eligible voters, 70
percent cast ballots, down from 77 percent in the last election in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, a 47-year-old former tax inspector, sought re-election to
another four-year term based on the strength of an economy that
grew 3.7 percent last year. He has reduced the jobless rate from 23
percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Aznar unseated Socialist Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez, who had governed for nearly 14 years -- but whose
administration was tarnished by corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said the solid victory meant Aznar will have a
clear mandate to continue his free-market policies. A parliamentary
majority gives Aznar a freer hand in passing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   His main opponent, Socialist Party leader Joaquin Almunia, a
former cabinet minister, had campaigned mainly on promises to
better distribute Spain's wealth, claiming Spain's economic bonanza
has benefited mainly the wealthy -- particularly businesspeople
close to Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to galvanize leftist forces, Almunia's party struck an
alliance with United Left, which for years had accused the
Socialists of being centrist sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   In accepting defeat at party headquarters, Almunia announced his
resignation as party head, a post he had held for three years.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a majority in Parliament during his first four years in
office, Aznar relied on support from Jordi Pujol, Catalan
nationalist leader of the Convergence and Union Party. Aznar's
victory ended Pujol's role as kingmaker, a position he had enjoyed
for the last three Spanish governments.
</P>
<P>
   But Pujol's party became the third-largest party in the
legislature Sunday. By winning 15 seats, a loss of one, it overtook
United Left, which won only eight seats, dropping from 21 in the
last legislature.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's victory rally, Aznar soberly urged Spaniards to
remember the victims of terrorism who ''are not able to be with us
tonight'' because they had given their lives ''for liberty and
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has taken a tough stand against the Basque
separatist group ETA, which staged three car bombings that took
three lives in the weeks leading up to the election.
</P>
<P>
   ETA ended a 14-month truce in December after Aznar's government
refused to discuss sovereignty for the northern Basque region. The
group has killed nearly 800 people since it began its independence
crusade in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Both major parties reject ETA's separatists goals and the Basque
conflict was not a major campaign issue.

<HEADLINE> Montana Dems See Hope for Revival  </HEADLINE>
By BOB ANEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- Montana Democrats, who have watched their
standing in Big Sky politics dwindle dramatically over the past
dozen years, see hope for revival in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stars are lining up right,'' said Bob Ream, Montana
Democratic Party chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The party has fallen on hard times. In 1988, it lost the
governor's seat to the Republican camp, where it remains. That same
year, Republican Conrad Burns snatched away a U.S. Senate seat. In
1994, the GOP took full control of the Legislature. Two years
later, Democrats lost the state's lone U.S. House seat.
</P>
<P>
   But as 2000 unfolds, Democrats seem well-positioned to reclaim
some of that lost ground. Term limits will deny many GOP
officeholders the chance to run again, and the Republican
congressman is quitting. Analysts give Democrats a good chance to
take both the U.S. House seat and the governor's mansion.
</P>
<P>
   But winning back Burns' Senate seat is iffy, and wresting
control of either house of the Legislature from the GOP will be
difficult at best.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a potential for the Democrats to do better, but it's
not a dead-cinch, certain thing,'' said Craig Wilson, head of the
political science department at Montana State University-Billings.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, whose control of the Legislature and governor's
office for the last six years is the longest GOP reign over both
branches since 1948, consider Democrats overly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see it,'' said Matt Denny, state GOP chairman. ''We
have had a stable state government without special sessions,
without budget problems or tax increases. It ain't broke.''
</P>
<P>
   While the GOP has an advantage in a conservative state like
Montana, Democrats have legitimate reasons for feeling upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Gov. Marc Racicot, a moderate, hugely popular with
Montanans throughout his two terms, will be on the sidelines this
time because of term limits. He has largely ignored Montana
politics this year to focus on helping his friend George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Racicot not running again at the head of the ticket, it
leaves a huge hole for Republicans,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also got a break in the U.S. House race when two-term
Republican Rick Hill bowed out, citing lingering complications from
eye surgery. A strong Democratic candidate already in the race,
state school Superintendent Nancy Keenan, suddenly found herself
running for an open seat rather than challenging an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rehberg, a former lieutenant governor and U.S. Senate
candidate, took Hill's spot on the ballot. He and Keenan, both
former legislators with statewide campaign and fund-raising
experience, are well-matched as opponents, and their political
views are about as far apart as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Calvert, chairman of the political science department at
MSU-Bozeman, expects the race to attract a lot of out-of-state
attention. With Democrats needing only six seats to take over the
House and the bargain-basement price of campaigns in the Montana,
the national parties will pour in buckets of money, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montana is in the bull's eye,'' Calvert said.
</P>
<P>
   A strong slate of well-known Democrats running for governor is
another reason for party optimism. Secretary of State Mike Cooney,
Attorney General Joe Mazurek and Auditor Mark O'Keefe -- all
term-limited -- are seeking the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP favorite is Lt. Gov. Judy Martz, who was a political
unknown when tapped by Racicot as his running mate four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three Democratic candidates has legislative
experience, a track record of running successful statewide
campaigns and names familiar to voters. Martz is a neophyte with a
low-profile job and relatively little statewide identity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think she has a reputation of being an effective
manager, because the lieutenant governor is never in the news,''
said Jim Lopach, political science professor at the University of
Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Her challenger is Rob Natelson, a combative conservative
tax-fighter with strong appeal to the GOP right-wing. ''If he
wins,'' Calvert argues, ''the Democrats could nominate Lassie, and
Lassie would win.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats have good shots at the U.S. House and governor's
seats, their prospects in the U.S. Senate race are more dicey.
</P>
<P>
   Whitefish farmer Brian Schweitzer is the most likely of two
Democrats to win the party nomination and take on two-term
incumbent Burns. Schweitzer, a newcomer to statewide politics, has
established himself as an aggressive campaigner with a knack for
successful publicity stunts.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns has a down-home style that has appealed to voters in
the past. He also has the money for what he expects will be a
state-record $5 million campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts expect he will survive his reneging on a
promise to run only twice and the criticism he has received for
supporting asbestos-compensation bills pending in Congress.

<HEADLINE> Matisse Works Displayed in Denver  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- For once, a construction job is bringing people to
downtown Denver instead of keeping them away.
</P>
<P>
   A renovation project at the Baltimore Museum of Art has brought
a major collection of Henri Matisse works to the Denver Art Museum.
The exhibit opened Sunday and runs through June 25.
</P>
<P>
   ''They thought storing them during the work would be a waste so
they made them available for a traveling exhibition,'' said Blake
Milteer, curatorial assistant.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third major traveling exhibition at the Denver museum
in the past year. The previous two exhibitions highlighted the work
of Impressionists and Neo-Impressionist Henri Toulouse-Lautrec.
</P>
<P>
   The latest includes 36 paintings, 16 sculptures and 15 drawings.
The colors are as bright as the Mediterranean sun that dazzled
Matisse after he gave up a promising law career.
</P>
<P>
   Later he followed in the footsteps of Paul Gaugain to Tahiti.
</P>
<P>
   A reviewer tagged Matisse's works with the title of ''fauve,''
or ''wild beast,'' a blazing departure from the softer colors of
the Impressionists.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Matisse paintings and sculptures are of female
nudes, his main subject during a 60-year career that lasted until
the day he died in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   His choice of subject contrasts dramatically with that of his
longtime friend and rival, Pablo Picasso. Matisse (1869-1954)
became known as a painter of ''love and life'' while Picasso was
called the painter of ''love and death.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist's works are in stark contrast to his own staid
appearance. His wife insisted that he always be photographed in a
suit, said Milteer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He found it very important to appear as a gentleman. A lot of
his paintings were pretty far out for the time,'' Milteer said,
adding that some reproductions of his ''Blue Nude'' were burned in
protest in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want America to know I am a family man,'' he told
interviewers.
</P>
<P>
   The two most famous works in the collection are ''The Large
Reclining Nude,'' formerly known as ''The Pink Nude,'' and ''The
Blue Nude.''
</P>
<P>
   The works were collected by the Cone sisters of Baltimore, heirs
to a textile fortune. Claribel and Etta Cone often traveled to
Europe and became friends with the artist as well as other
celebrities.

United Left, which won only eight seats, dropping from 21 in the
last legislature.
</P>
<P>
   At Sunday's victory rally, Aznar soberly urged Spaniards to
remember the victims of terrorism who ''are not able to be with us
tonight'' because they had given their lives ''for liberty and
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister has taken a tough stand against the Basque
separatist group ETA, which staged three car bombings that took
three lives in the weeks leading up to the election.
</P>
<P>
   ETA ended a 14-month truce in December after Aznar's government
refused to discuss sovereignty for the northern Basque region. The
group has killed nearly 800 people since it began its independence
crusade in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Both major parties reject ETA's separatists goals and the Basque
conflict was not a major campaign issue.

Fed Law Officers Grow 11 Percent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of federal law enforcement officers grew by 11
percent from 1996 to 1998, the Justice Department said Sunday. About half the
growth of approximately 8,000 men and women was in the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Within that agency, the number of Border Patrol officers
alone rose from 5,441 in 1996 to 7,714 in 1998, an increase of 42 percent.
Overall, federal agencies employed about 83,000 full-time law enforcement
officers with arrest powers and firearms authorization, according to the Justice
Department Bureau of Justice Statistics.

Gore Rolls Up Delegate Totals
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   A smaller-than-expected turnout of about 11,000 people at the first
Democratic weekend caucuses in Minnesota gave Vice President Al Gore a near
sweep as anticipated in a binding presidential poll. Gore also was expected to
pick up all 20 delegates at stake after a resounding victory Sunday at caucuses
in Nevada where there were even fewer voters. With 14 of 17 counties reporting
in Nevada, Gore had 92 percent of the vote to 8 percent for Bill Bradley and
others. Although no official delegate assignments were made by the party, state
chairman Rory Reid noted that Bradley would have had to get at least 15 percent
of the votes cast in either of Nevada's two congressional districts to win any
delegates.

Clinton, NRA Spar Over Gun Laws

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charges of dishonesty and fear-mongering over tougher gun
laws flew Sunday in back-to-back TV appearances by President Clinton and a top
official of the National Rifle Association with Clinton accusing the group of
''knee-jerk'' opposition to any gun safety measure. NRA executive vice-president
Wayne LaPierre, in turn, accused the president of exploiting gun deaths for
political purposes. One point at issue was a new advertising campaign in which
NRA President Charlton Heston all but accuses the president of lying in his
characterizations of the group as an impediment to sensible laws and public
safety.

Pope John Paul II asked God's forgiveness Sunday for the sins of Roman Catholics
through the ages, including wrongs inflicted on Jews, women and minorities. The
apology was a personal landmark for a frail, ailing pope who vowed to cleanse
and reinvigorate Catholicism for its third millennium. The church burned
heretics at the stake during the Inquisition. Armies of the faithful slaughtered

Richardson Opposes Lifting Gas Tax

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- High fuel prices caused Energy secretary Bill Richardson

President Clinton would consider all options to bring relief to customers. A
growing number of lawmakers have begun gauging whether there is enough support
in Congress to suspend the federal gasoline excise tax imposed in 1993 until
prices at the pump recede. Richardson, appearing on Sunday television talk
shows, noted that Republicans were divided on the matter and said he didn't
think suspending the tax would help because the problem is scarcity of oil.

<HEADLINE> President Works on Legislation Goals  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying he has ''a lot of energy and a few
ideas'' left, President Clinton is combining a frenetic
fund-raising schedule this spring with out-of-town appearances that
the White House hopes will push Congress to act on several thorny
pieces of his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton plans road trips to promote several major
legislative initiatives: prescription drugs for Medicare patients,
gun control, a raise in the minimum wage, a trade deal with China
and better consumer control over health care.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Cleveland, the president planned to promote his plan to
cover prescription drug bills as part of the federal Medicare
program that serves most older Americans. House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
planned to be there, along with a group of elderly Midwesterners
who struggle to pay for their medication.
</P>
<P>
   It is Clinton's first major foray outside Washington to address
the prescription drug issue this year, and the opening of what
White House strategists call a calculated effort to put a little
hometown pressure on Congress. Similar theme events are tentatively
scheduled throughout the spring, said one aide who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want members of Congress to hear it from their
constituents, from outside Washington,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called the China trade deal the most important thing
before Congress this year. His chief lobbyist on the China deal,
Commerce Secretary William Daley, acknowledged last week that the
administration now lacks the votes to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook may be slightly brighter for the drug plan, which is
competing with a narrower GOP version; for the president's plan to
give patients the right to sue their health plans if they are
denied care, and for gun control. Clinton wants to ban importation
of large-capacity ammunition clips, impose background checks on
buyers at gun shows and require more safety devices for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum wage legislation is in limbo after the House voted to
raise it last week but added tax cuts for business that the White
House calls unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say there is some Republican support for his
goals and bipartisan self-interest in passing some legislation
before the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take the unconventional line that things can actually occur
in election years,'' said Chris Jennings, the White House's health
care policy specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The White House acknowledges its best hope for passing
contentious legislation in the Republican-led Congress comes before
summer, when the political parties select their presidential
nominees and legislators begin their own fall campaigns in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The even larger deadline, of course, is the end of the
administration itself next January.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people talk about me now, I feel like I'm a witness at my
own funeral,'' Clinton said in a speech to visiting city officials
Sunday. ''You know, I've got nearly a year left in office, and a
lot of energy, and I've got a few ideas about what to do with the
remaining time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that energy will be spent raising political money across
the country, which offers an expeditious way to schedule the
out-of-town ''message events.'' The prescription drug speech,
arranged just a few days ago, follows a fund-raising lunch for
House Democrats in Cleveland that has been on Clinton's schedule
for weeks.

<HEADLINE> Plane Lands on its Belly in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- A small plane with a landing gear
malfunction made a successful emergency landing at Burbank Airport
on Sunday, a week after another jet skidded off a runway here.
</P>
<P>
   None of the four people aboard the Piper Comanche were injured,
said Louis Diaz, Federal Aviation Administration operations officer
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   There was no fire or fuel leak reported.
</P>
<P>
   The single-engine plane made the unscheduled landing on its
belly at 5:18 p.m. after having problems with both its landing gear
and its communications system.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear where the plane departed from or
where it was heading when it was diverted to
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The landing comes a week after a Southwest Airlines jet skidded
off a runway at Burbank Airport into a nearby street. The plane
narrowly missed disaster -- skidding 40 feet away from a Chevron
station's gas pumps. Fifteen people reported injuries in that
accident.
</P>
<P>
   In December, another Piper Comanche made a successful belly
landing at Burbank Airport after it reported problems with its
landing gear. There were no injuries.

<HEADLINE> Spain Leader Has Fought for Respect  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Jose Maria Aznar rose from a tax inspector
to unseat one of Europe's longest-standing leaders and to preside
over one of its most vibrant economies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics say he has image problems.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar on Sunday won the right to keep his post as prime
minister, but only after enduring four years of constant
suggestions that he lacked the political and intellectual depth to
run a country.
</P>
<P>
   Now 47, the conservative leader took office in 1996 after
defeating Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, a Socialist who had ruled
Spain for nearly 14 years and boasted powerful friends all over
Europe -- including then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. Outside
Spain, virtually no one had heard of Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   And while Gonzalez was a silver-tongued orator clearly at ease
working a crowd, Aznar came across as distant, his delivery stiff
and wooden. To this day, he's the first to admit he is anything but
folksy and glib.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper cartoonists regularly feast on Aznar, depicting him as
being of abbreviated stature -- literally and figuratively -- in his
dealings with other leaders and in domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly telling vignette ran Oct. 21, 1998, in the
newspaper El Mundo, which is generally supportive of Aznar. Weeks
earlier, the Basque separatist group ETA had declared a cease-fire.
Then, on Oct. 16, former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was
arrested in London on a warrant from a Spanish judge seeking the
general's extradition on human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   In the cartoon, Aznar appears as a small figure next to a
towering Fidel Castro. ''Go figure,'' Castro says. ''Someone as
insignificant as you may go down in history as the man who ended
ETA terrorism and sent Pinochet to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ETA ended a 14-month truce in December after Aznar's
government refused to discuss sovereignty for the northern Basque
region. The group has killed nearly 800 people since it began its
independence crusade in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pinochet returned to Chile earlier this month after
16 months detention in London. He was released after a panel of
judges said he was too ill to stand trial for abuses during his
1973-90 rule.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish newspapers have also recounted how in April of last
year, during a visit to Washington that was to include dinner with
President Clinton, Aznar insisted on eating at the White House --
with its potential for photo opportunities -- rather than at a
restaurant as suggested by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   And when Aznar traveled to Moscow last May for talks with
President Boris Yeltsin, only to see them canceled at the last
minute by the Russians, Spain's opposition Socialist Party seized
on the cancelation as proof that no one abroad takes Aznar
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you imagine a worse job on Earth than being Aznar's public
relations adviser?'' said political scientist Ramon Cotarelo.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar shrugs off this kind of criticism, saying that what
matters is his record, not his sound bites. ''I am a quiet man who
grows through adversity,'' he said during the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Makes Historic Visit to Hanoi  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Conscious of the symbolism, William Cohen
arrived in the Vietnamese capital today as the first U.S. defense
secretary to visit since the Vietnam War ended 25 years ago in
defeat for America.
</P>
<P>
   ''I intend to focus on the future, not on the past,'' Cohen told
reporters accompanying him as his Air Force jet approached the
Hanoi airport, where he was greeted by a few Vietnamese officers
and U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   At a formal welcoming ceremony in a courtyard outside a
government guest house, Cohen and Defense Minister Pham Van Tra
walked down a red carpet reviewing a color guard as a military band
played the American and Vietnamese national anthems.
</P>
<P>
   The two defense chiefs then led their delegations into the guest
house and sat across from each other at a conference table.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Peterson told reporters the talks had been ''very
cordial, very comfortable,'' and he described the occasion as a
historic step toward achieving truly normal relations between
former war enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ''You couldn't have imagined this happening four or five years
ago -- maybe not even two years ago,'' Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's schedule today included a trip into the countryside
outside Hanoi to get a firsthand look at the work of a joint
U.S.-Vietnamese team that is searching for remains of an American
pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the main focus of his two-day visit will be
emphasizing the importance of joint U.S.-Vietnamese efforts to
find, recover and repatriate the remains of American servicemen
missing from the war.
</P>
<P>
   He said before his arrival that Washington wants to push the
pace of reconciliation on a broader front.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're hoping to improve our overall bilateral relations, and
the military-to-military part will be a component of that. But it
has to proceed in the context of an improvement in our overall
relationship,'' the defense secretary said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen was greeted at the airport by Maj. Gen. Vu Tan, who told
him, ''This has been a long time coming. We have been looking
forward to it for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the sites Cohen passed as his motorcade sped through the
city's dusty, bustling streets was the prison where American POWs
were held during the war. Nicknamed the ''Hanoi Hilton,'' it now is
a war museum.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters about the coincidence of his visit coming
amid Vietnam's national celebration of the 25th anniversary of its
defeat of U.S.-backed South Vietnam, Cohen said he preferred to
emphasize a different milestone -- the coming five-year anniversary
of the resumption of political ties.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton restored diplomatic relations with communist
Vietnam in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''The reason I'm here is to look to the future,'' Cohen told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He also intends to suggest ways of building a broader
military-to-military relationship, possibly starting with joint
work on removing old land mines and studying military medical
problems. Cohen is scheduled to address the National Defense
Academy on Tuesday and meet with Communist Party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The only military unit Cohen will visit -- the air force's 921st
Fighter Regiment -- holds the distinction of shooting down more
American aircraft during the war than any other unit, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 58,000 Americans were killed in the war. The last
American troops were withdrawn in 1973, and two years later the
communist forces took Saigon -- now known as Ho Chi Minh City -- and
reunited the country under communist rule.
</P>
<P>
   At the forefront of U.S.-Vietnamese military relations is the
lingering issue of missing American GIs.
</P>
<P>
   About 2,000 U.S. servicemen are listed as unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia, including about 1,500 on Vietnamese soil. Some 440
were lost in Laos, 74 in Cambodia and eight in Chinese territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
   The excavation site on Cohen's tour schedule today is about 20
miles southwest of Hanoi where forensics specialists believe a Navy
F-4B jet was shot down by air defense forces on May 19, 1967,
killing the pilot, Cmdr. Richard N. Rich, of Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's radar intercept officer, Lt. Cmdr. William Stark,
was captured, imprisoned and released in March 1973.
</P>
<P>
   No trace of Rich has been found, although two men who said they
saw the incident near the village of Dong Phu told investigators
they saw partial human remains scattered around the crash site at
the time. During an excavation effort last October in which U.S.
forensics experts found wreckage deemed to be consistent with an
F-4 plane, they also found possible human remains.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has praised Vietnam for its cooperation in
attempting to recover remains, although some POW-MIA advocacy
groups contend that Hanoi could do much more if pressured.

<HEADLINE> Animal-Rights Group's Ad Draws Fire  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Anti-drunken driving activists aren't amused
by a new ad campaign urging college students to replace their milk
mustaches with beer foam.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals this
week plans to unveil its ''Got Beer?'' campaign on college campuses
nationwide, in time for all those green-beer St. Patrick's Day
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   PETA argues that drinking beer is healthier than milk and that
the dairy industry is cruel to cows and calves.
</P>
<P>
   Mothers Against Drunk Driving sent a letter Friday asking PETA
to pull the campaign for fear it will encourage underage drinking.
Many college students are under the legal drinking age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very concerned and appalled with it for the simple fact
that underage drinking is the number one drug problem among
American youths,'' said Teresa Hardt, a spokeswoman for the Irving,
Texas-based group, whose mission includes the prevention of
underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign also comes at a time when increased attention is
being focused on binge drinking on campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ''If PETA's misguided purpose is to denounce the dairy industry,
they certainly aren't advancing their ball by advocating alcohol
consumption by college students,'' said David Botkins, spokesman
for state Attorney General Mark L. Earley.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman said PETA will proceed with the campaign and that it
does not promote underage or drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''College students are savvy,'' said Bruce Friedrich, PETA's
vegetarian campaign coordinator. ''Nobody's going to put beer on
their Cheerios or get drunk and drive as a result of our
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   PETA is using beer in its anti-milk campaign as a fun,
titillating way to get attention, but the campaign makes it clear
that juice, water, soda and soy milk are preferable to beer,
Friedrich said.
</P>
<P>
   PETA contends that milk does not do a body good because it is
full of fat and cholesterol, while beer contains neither. PETA's
main concern, however, is about what it says is the cruel treatment
of milk cows and their calves on factory farms.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you drink milk, you are supporting a product that is
horrible for human health, catastrophic for the environment and a
living nightmare for the animals involved,'' Friedrich said.
</P>
<P>
   PETA is urging the more than 2,000 college students who are part
of its college activist network to attempt to place articles and
letters about the issue in their campus newspapers starting this
week.
</P>
<P>
   PETA also is giving away beer bottle-shaped bottle openers that
say, ''Drink responsibly. Don't drink milk.'' and ''Save a cow's
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Ruland, a spokeswoman for the dairy industry's ''Got
Milk?'' and milk mustache campaigns, called PETA's parody
''ridiculous on so many levels. It's kind of amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   Cows produce more and better milk if they are treated well, so
it would not make economic sense for dairy farmers to mistreat the
animals, said Ruland, spokeswoman for the International Dairy Foods
Association in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Ruland also noted that milk contains 30 percent of the calcium,
16 percent of the protein and 25 percent of the vitamin D
recommended daily.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a very powerful nutrient package,'' she said. ''To
suggest based on bad science that you avoid it is just
irresponsible.''

<HEADLINE> Flu Shot May Cut Heart-Attack Risk  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Getting an annual influenza shot may do
more than represent a shot in the arm to preventing the flu. It
might also reduce heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A study released Sunday suggests that heart patients may
significantly reduce their risk of a second heart attack if they
get vaccinated against influenza.
</P>
<P>
   The finding is still considered preliminary and needs to be
confirmed by further studies. Still, doctors say it raises the
possibility of a powerful and underused way of keeping the heart
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The study, directed by Dr. Morteza Naghavi of the University of
Texas, supports the theory that a variety of infections can inflame
the buildups that clog the arteries, making them more likely to
break open and trigger heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Naghavi based his study on 233 patients who were treated between
October 1997 and March 1998. He presented the results at a meeting
of the American College of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   At the same meeting, two other studies were released showing
that heart attacks tend to be more severe during the cold months,
and cardiac arrest is most common in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Naghavi's study compared people who suffered second heart
attacks with those who did not. Those who had flu shots reduced
their risk of new heart attacks by 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If flu shots truly do protect heart patients, he said,
''educating this population and physicians could help increase the
rate of vaccination, which is still under 65 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, that studies like his cannot prove that
flu shots are the reason for the reduction in new heart attacks.
That would require following larger numbers of heart patients
before they get sick to see if the shots affect their risk.
</P>
<P>
   Many studies have shown that heart problems are most common
during the cold months, when flu and colds are also circulating.
Dr. Geoffrey Tofler of Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney,
Australia, said Naghavi's study suggests ''there may be a way of
reducing this increased risk by vaccination.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by Dr. Robert A. Kloner of Good Samaritan Hospital in
Los Angeles reviewed data from two large studies involving more
than 1,200 patients to see if the severity of heart attacks varies
from season to season.
</P>
<P>
   His team looked at victims' blood levels of creatine kinase MB,
an enzyme released by dying heart cells. The higher the level of
this enzyme, the more severe the heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kloner found that heart attacks average between 15 percent and
22 percent smaller in the summer, even in parts of the country
where winters are mild.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the best of our knowledge,'' Kloner said, ''this is the
first study to show that the size of a heart attack -- the amount of
cell death that occurs -- varies by season and is smallest in the
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another study by Dr. Michael R. Gold of the University of
Maryland looked for seasonal differences in the operation of
implanted defibrillators, which give lifesaving shocks when people
go into cardiac arrest. In 347 patients, he found that the
defibrillators went off 40 percent more often in the winter than in
other months.
</P>
<P>
   More respiratory viruses circulating in the winter could be one
reason. Other possibilities include less sunlight, more holiday
stress and the effects of cold weather, which can make the arteries
narrower and the blood more likely to clot.

<HEADLINE> Laser Holes in Heart Ease Chest Pain  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL Q. HANEY, AP Medical Editor
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Two new studies show that lasers threaded
into the heart's main pumping chamber may offer relief for people
with such bad heart disease that they often can barely walk.
</P>
<P>
   The question is why.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are absolutely sure that we don't know what the mechanism
of action is,'' Dr. Emerson Perin of the Texas Heart Institute said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Perin and others presented their latest findings at a conference
of the American College of Cardiology. The laser is among several
new kinds of technology intended to help the sickest heart
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Among other examples discussed at the meeting are gene therapy
and radioactive probes to make angioplasty work better.
</P>
<P>
   The only laser approach now in routine use requires an incision
in the chest to expose the heart. The new method should make the
treatment much less demanding by delivering the laser without an
operation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, doctors thread the laser into an artery in the leg and
up through the circulatory system to the left ventricle, the main
pumping chamber. Inside the heart, the laser burns a dozen or more
tiny holes into the muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Perin reported experimental use of a laser developed by Eclipse
Surgical Technologies of Sunnyvale, Calif. The study involved 325
patients who were randomly assigned to get the laser or dummy
treatments. One of those receiving the laser died, and six others
had significant side effects.
</P>
<P>
   One year later, 55 percent of the patients getting the laser had
substantially less chest pain, compared to 31 percent in the
comparison group. The laser patients could also walk about 1{
minutes longer on a treadmill, while the comparison group had a
16-second decline in treadmill time.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ran Kornowski of Washington Hospital Center in Washington,
D.C. reported encouraging results of a competing laser device,
produced by Biosense-Webster of Diamond Bar, Calif. Doctors tested
it on 77 patients, and although there was no comparison group,
patients reported significant easing of pain.
</P>
<P>
   People suffer chest pain because clogged arteries fail to
deliver enough blood to their heart muscle. Doctors once speculated
that the laser works by creating new blood vessels. But now they
know that the holes quickly heal, leaving only scar.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the holes may spur the body to sprout new blood
vessels. However, a study by Dr. Robert Hendel of
Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center in New York City found
no sign that blood flow to patients' heart muscle improves
substantially after the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Others speculate that the treatment may kill nerves in the
heart, reducing patients' sensation of pain without actually
improving circulation.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Heat Campaign Charges  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   METAIRIE, La. (AP) -- Six states hold presidential primaries
Tuesday, but judging by the rhetoric, the general election campaign
is already running at full throttle.
</P>
<P>
   Republican George W. Bush questioned Democrat Al Gore's honesty
on Sunday, while the vice president wondered aloud about the Texas
governor's readiness to run the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the vice president is someone who will say anything to
get elected,'' Bush said in Florida after The New York Times quoted
Gore as saying he would make an overhaul of the campaign finance
system a centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gore faced questions about the propriety of some of his
fund-raising in the 1996 election, and a friend was just convicted
of illegalities stemming from a fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more he talks about campaign funding reform, the better
off it will be for my campaign,'' Bush said. He later used the
''say anything'' line three more times during his news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore was visiting a Miami-area hospital to keep the
pressure on Bush, this time on health care. Aides said he would
repeat charges he made in an interview with The Associated Press on
Sunday: That the governor cares nothing for expanding access to
health insurance because it is not a priority for his campaign
financiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're listening primarily to large, soft-money
contributors who are wealthy and generally healthy and have all the
health insurance you could want, you don't have any way of
understanding what the real problem is'' with the uninsured, Gore
told the AP.
</P>
<P>
   Later today, Gore flies to Nashville to be in position to vote
for himself in Tennessee's Democratic primary Tuesday. There, he
was meeting with more than 40 mayors to make the point, aides said,
that he has grass-roots backing in contrast to Bush's top-down
support from the GOP establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In the AP interview, Gore said Bush's five-year, $483 billion
tax-cut plan would put Social Security, Medicare and health care in
general at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the words of John McCain, he doesn't put one penny into
Social Security, one penny into Medicare or one penny into
expanding access to health care,'' the vice president said, quoting
the Arizona senator whom Bush knocked out of the GOP presidential
race last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also questioned Bush's readiness to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied: ''The vice president obviously believes that all
knowledge and wisdom emanates out of Washington. I don't think
that. I think all wisdom and knowledge emanates from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange came as the presumptive nominees crossed into each
other's home territory in search of votes. Tennessee and five other
Southern states -- Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and
Texas -- hold primaries Tuesday, awarding 341 Republican and 566
Democratic convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's only challenger for the Democratic nomination, Bill
Bradley, dropped out after being swept in last week's Super Tuesday
primaries. Over the weekend, the vice president won uncontested
votes in Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota and Nevada, picking up 182
delegates. That brought his delegate total to 1,679, with 2,170
needed to nominate.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Gore went to church in Houston and later to a health
care forum near Dallas, before following Bush to Florida. Bush
traveled to Knoxville in Gore's home state of Tennessee before
spending the night in suburban New Orleans. Today he was
campaigning in Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   While in Tennessee, Bush picked up the endorsement of Sen. Fred
Thompson, who had supported McCain. Thompson, who headed an
investigation into the 1996 fund-raising problems, tweaked Gore for
his interest in campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wow, I sure could have used his help a couple of years ago,
when we and the rest of the nation were watching them parade before
us an array of illegalities, improprieties, taking the Fifth
Amendment, absentee witnesses, all the time the Justice Department
was trying to keep a lid on it and keep the facts from the American
people,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't mind good foxhole conversions, but there has to be
accountability first.''

<HEADLINE> Flies Said Answer to Waste Problem  </HEADLINE>
By ELLIOTT MINOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIFTON, Ga. (AP) -- A University of Georgia scientist thinks he
has found the solution, in the form of harmless flies, to the
growing problem of how to dispose of excess manure at hog and
poultry farms.
</P>
<P>
   Entomologist Craig Sheppard says black soldier flies can consume
tons of manure and then -- talk about a simplified food chain -- be
turned into food for pigs, chickens or cows.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like getting something for nothing,'' he says. ''We're
going to make the manure go away, and we're going to make money
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers store hog waste in holding lagoons that can
rupture, polluting rivers and streams. In recent years, tougher
environmental laws have closely regulated how farmers dispose of
waste.
</P>
<P>
   A large chicken house holds about 100,000 egg-laying hens, which
produce 15 tons of manure daily. Some of the waste is used to
fertilize farmland, but there's a limit to how much can be spread
around.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard has been studying the black soldier fly for 20 years.
It lays its eggs in manure and, in a few days, maggots -- the larval
stage of flies -- emerge and begin eating the stuff. They're about
an inch long and one-fourth inch in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It reduces the manure bulk by a half or more ... and the
manure that's left has a lot less nitrogen in it,'' Sheppard said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have known for years that maggots reduce animal
waste. Sheppard focused on the black soldier fly because it is
harmless to humans, reduces housefly populations and contains
proteins and other nutrients that could be valuable in making
animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   Insects go through three stages: larvae, pupae and adult. As the
black soldier fly is being transformed from a larvae to a pupae --
the prepupae stage -- it crawls out of the manure and sheds its skin
and the lining of its gut. It then buries itself and emerges as an
adult fly.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard has demonstrated that farmers could get the prepupae to
''harvest'' themselves, showing that the insects will crawl up a
ramp and fall into a container. There they could be fed live to
hogs or turned into oil and protein meal similar to fish meal,
which is used to make feed for catfish, livestock and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   A large collection system in five months can produce 58 tons of
prepupae, which can be converted into a valuable feed additive that
is 42 percent protein and 35 percent fat, the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard has learned how to produce soldier flies in captivity,
but there are still some issues to be worked out. The insects mate
in sunlight and might not respond to the artificial light in a
chicken house, he said, so ''we'd have to find the right light
qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard said industry representatives have expressed interest
in his work, but no one is yet willing to invest in the changes
needed to accommodate the soldier flies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty radical idea,'' he said. ''The animal production
people are doing a good job of managing their manure, but this
system would help them do an even better job.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Sheppard's strongest supporters is Paul Oliver, president
and chief executive officer of Engineering, Separation and
Recycling in Waxahachie, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver believes soldier flies are an ideal solution to reducing
the 1.4 billion tons of manure produced in the United States each
year by intense animal production and the 23 million tons of food
waste.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no way I can contain the enthusiasm of having met up
with Craig,'' Oliver said. ''This thing is like a little piranha.''
</P>
<P>
   He first saw soldier fly maggots while visiting a relative in
Louisiana a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw these huge, monstrous maggots,'' Oliver said. ''I tossed
in a raw Irish potato and two hours later it was gone. It's
exciting to know we don't have to put all this stuff in
landfills.''

<HEADLINE> Federal Drug Sentences Declining  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal drug convictions rose to record levels
during the 1990s, but the average sentence for drug offenders
declined, mostly for first-time criminals or those who cooperated
with authorities, a private study says.
</P>
<P>
   Congress, judges and prosecutors all took opportunities to
soften tough sentences for those defendants, Syracuse University's
Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, or Trac, said in
reporting the somewhat surprising findings Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The same decade saw tougher drug laws passed throughout the
nation, federal drug-control spending rise by nearly two-thirds to
$16 billion a year in 1998 and federal drug convictions climb to an
annual record of 21,571 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Low-level, rookie criminals who caused no injuries and offenders
who saved the government the cost of a trial and helped agents
catch fellow criminals in return for guilty pleas to lesser charges
captured the lion's share of leniency from tough sentencing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a number of reasons for the decline,'' said Justice
Department spokesman John Russell. ''Enactment of the 'safety
valve' provision for first-time, non-violent drug offenders; the
trend among drug defendants towards more guilty pleas and fewer
trials, and the increase in the number of drug defendants providing
substantial assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We were getting complaints that too many first-time,
non-violent offenders were getting long sentences, so Congress gave
judges discretion to go below the mandatory minimums,'' Russell
added.
</P>
<P>
   The declines showed up in data collected by the federal court
system, the Justice Department and the U.S. Sentencing Commission,
each of which uses a slightly different definition for drug crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The most extensive set of figures, from the court system, show
the decline began in 1992, the final year of the Bush
administration. A peak of 95.7 months occurred in 1991; from there,
the average sentence dropped to 74.6 months in 1999, the Trac study
found.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department data showed that the average sentence
declined from 86 months in 1992 to 67 months in 1998, and the
median slipped from 48 months in 1992 to 46 in 1998. Half of all
sentences are longer and half are shorter than the median.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing Commission data showed the average dropped from 88.2
months in 1992 to 78 months in 1998, and the median from 60 months
in 1991 to 56 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Trac and federal officials cited a variety of reasons for the
shortening of sentences: a decline in serious drug use, more
effective police work that produced more guilty pleas and fewer
trials, and a feeling that tough mandatory minimum sentences had
not left enough flexibility for all defendants.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress' changes in the law, combined with the key roles of
federal prosecutors and federal judges, suggest a pretty wide
consensus that previous sentences were too high for some
defendants,'' said Trac co-director David Burnham.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of federal drug offenders sentenced to less
prison time than called for by sentencing guidelines rose from 33.7
percent in 1993 to 42.9 percent in 1998, Sentencing Commission
figures showed.
</P>
<P>
   Judges and prosecutors both had a hand in this trend.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of all federal drug convicts given lesser
sentences rose from 6.2 percent in 1993 to 12.8 percent in 1998.
The judges were required to explain their belief that the
sentencing guidelines did not adequately cover the case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors can seek reduced sentences for criminals who
substantially help investigators. They sought this leniency for
27.5 percent of the defendants in 1993 and 30.1 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the 'safety valve' law, which took effect in 1995,
allowed judges to go further by giving less than the mandatory
minimum sentences to first-time, non-violent offenders who didn't
organize the crime but told investigators all they knew.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weiner, spokesman for White House drug policy director Barry
McCaffrey, cited progress against serious drug use. Cocaine use,
which fueled a surge in violent crime in the 1980s, dropped by 70
percent in the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   By 1998, Trac found, marijuana accounted for more federal drug
convictions than any other substance, one-third of the total. The
rest were divided among powder cocaine, 28 percent of the total;
crack cocaine, 17 percent; methamphetamine, 11 percent; heroin, 8
percent; and other drugs, 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Musical Re-enacts Lincoln's Death  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a historic national tragedy wrapped in a
new musical -- re-enacted on the site where it actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   The musical ''Reunion'' portrays a small theatrical group
performing a Civil War drama 25 years to the day after John Wilkes
Booth shot President Lincoln. The show, which played a series of
previews last week, opens Tuesday at Ford's Theatre, where the
assassination occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The theater was gutted soon after Lincoln's death and rebuilt in
1968, reproduced with the help of images by Matthew Brady, the
Civil War photographer. The outside of the box where Lincoln sat in
a rocking chair is permanently decorated as it was on the night of
April 14, 1865, with flags, bunting and a small picture of George
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the final scenes of the new production, a spotlight
falls on a small stage built on the larger stage.
</P>
<P>
   Actor James Judy takes the part of Harry Hawk, who was on stage
at Ford's in the farce ''Our American Cousin'' when the fatal shot
was fired. Hawk was portraying Asa Trenchard -- an American who has
come to England to claim an inheritance, and then has given it
away. A snooty, fortune-hunting Mrs. Mountchessington tells him
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, I guess I know enough to turn you inside out, old gal,''
Trenchard tells her as she struts off in her hoop skirt. ''You
sockdologizing old mantrap!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1865, the laughter and clapping drowned out the single shot
that Booth fired from his short-barreled derringer into the back of
the president's neck. The assassin vaulted nearly 12 feet to the
stage, catching his spur in a flag. He broke a foot in his fall and
hobbled to the rear of the theater, where a horse was waiting.
</P>
<P>
   In 2000, actor Ric Ryder doesn't jump, but struggles to his feet
and hobbles off in the semi-darkness. Lincoln is not seen -- the box
is empty.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reunion'' is billed as ''a musical epic in miniature.'' Jack
Kyrieleison, 49, an actor from suburban Kensington, Md., wrote the
script. Most of it consists of actual words from Lincoln, Gen.
George B. McClellan -- his opponent in the 1864 election -- poet Walt
Whitman and others of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Flaherty, music director of the Goodspeed Opera House
in East Haddam, Conn., arranged a series of songs from the Civil
War era.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ''Reunion, A Musical Epic in Miniature,'' is scheduled to run
through June 18, including a performance on April 14, the 135th
anniversary of the assassination.

<HEADLINE> Senate Subway Continues To Operate  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- They were a sensation in 1909, a pair of
leather-seated, open-air cars affectionately dubbed ''Peg'' and
''Tommy'' that sped senators to the Capitol through a 760-foot
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are operated by five horsepower storage batteries and can
make about 12 miles an hour, unless the senators object to this
speed,'' a newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody who has seen them has ever seen their like before,''
another paper enthused. ''They are a cross between an automobile
and a dogcart,'' the Washington Evening Star said.
</P>
<P>
   The new cars, light tan in color and made by the Studebaker Co.
at a cost of $2,400 each, were the stars of what was probably the
world's shortest subway system, running to the Capitol from the
Senate's first office building.
</P>
<P>
   Museum pieces today, they have long since been replaced by more
modern equipment. But their purpose remains, transporting lawmakers
from their offices to votes on the Senate floor in the shortest
possible time.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think of it as the ultimate senatorial perquisite,
some as just a ''horizontal elevator'' that helps senators do their
jobs and also transport tourists by the thousands across the
congressional campus.
</P>
<P>
   Built long and low with seating for five people on each side,
Peg and Tommy ferried senators, lobbyists and tourists through the
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Since there was no room to turn around, the cars reversed
direction on return trips through the 22-foot-wide tunnel. That was
broad enough to allow a seven-foot pedestrian walkway with the
remaining lane reserved for Peg and Tommy. They ran on a slightly
concave concrete track. It was wide enough for the two cars to pass
''without much danger of collision.''
</P>
<P>
   With the automobile itself just beginning to come into its own,
some people found the whole thing a bit startling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never does one hear (anything) to herald their approach,
except a peculiar buzzing and a faint tinkling that starts far away
and comes nearer and nearer around the corner of the serpentine
tunnel,'' the Evening Star said. ''When that sound is heard for the
first time the suspense is terrible until the freakish thing buzzes
and tinkles into view out of the bowels of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The service began in March, just days after the Capitol
inaugural of President Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Climbing on board for one of the first rides were Sens. William
Borah of Idaho, Elihu Root of New York, Henry Cabot Lodge of
Massachusetts, Robert LaFollette of Wisconsin and Taft's vice
president, James S. Sherman.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman observed while the ride was adequate the scenery was
boring.
</P>
<P>
   ''... Nowhere in that seemingly endless tunnel is there anything
to break the monotony of the dead white walls and ceiling and the
floor of light gray, except where the slim black iron railing
separates the footpath from the railroad right of way,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   The tunnel remains in use. The monotony that distressed Vice
President Sherman is broken by a bright display of state and
territorial flags hanging along its length.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the Senate tunnel for a subway system to get senators
to the votes on time was an afterthought. It was designed to
channel electric power, steam and hot water from a new power plant
and to provide a more efficient way to deal with deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   Updated periodically, the congressional subways have operated
continuously for 91 years. The House side of the Capitol is linked
to the Rayburn House Office Building by open-air subway cars. They
provide a breezy ride on cars similar to those that serve the
Russell Senate Office Building through the tunnel first used in
1909.
</P>
<P>
   The newest improvement in the senators' subway is a high-tech
leap from the age of Peg and Tommy. Built at a cost of $18 million
and opened about five years ago, it is a fully driverless and
automated system with enclosed cars, sliding doors and recorded
voices to announce arrivals and departures.
</P>
<P>
   The cars travel between the Capitol and the newer Dirksen and
Hart Senate office buildings. The system was installed by the
company that developed the transport system at Disney World in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   After a new rail system was installed in 1912, Peg and Tommy
were sent to storage. According to the U.S. Senate Library, which

<HEADLINE> Census Forms To Be Mailed This Week  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is mailing out 98 million
census forms to city and suburban addresses beginning today as it
promotes cooperation with the national headcount in the nation's
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau director Kenneth Prewitt said ''Teach Census
Week'' is aimed at rectifying a problem evident in 1990: Some
Americans forgot to count their children in the census.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hope is that this program ... will ensure that in 2000,
every child is counted,'' Prewitt said in a statement. ''This
program is an ideal way to teach people -- through children's school
lessons -- about the importance of including everyone living in
their household on the census forms.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1.5 million teacher kits have been shipped to
participating schools. Children also are receiving take-home
exercises to complete with adults in their households.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said the mailings begun today should have questionnaires
in most of the country's 115 million households by the end of the
week. About 83 million homes will get short forms, which contain
seven questions, and a randomly sampled list of 15 million homes
will get long forms, which have 52 questions.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the forms were delivered by hand, mostly to rural
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures are used, among other purposes, to reapportion
congressional districts and allocate federal aid to states and
localities.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt warned the public to beware of deceptive mailings. The
official census form comes in an envelope with a Commerce
Department return address and the Census 2000 logo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've designed a distinctive-looking package,'' he said, ''so
everyone will know that this, and only this, is the official census
form with a bar code for their household.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, people have the option of using the number
on the bar code to log on to the Census Bureau's Web site,
www.census.gov, and answer their questionnaire over the Internet.
They also can fill out the paper form and mail it back.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, census takers will start to survey households in
isolated rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, NRA Spar Over Gun Laws  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Rifle Association, running ads
about gun-control ''lies,'' and President Clinton, attacking the
group's ''ruthlessly brutal'' methods, are putting their mutual
animosity on public display.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton criticized the group Sunday for its ''knee-jerk reaction
to any gun safety measure.'' In rebuttal, NRA Executive Vice
President Wayne LaPierre said the president exploits gun deaths for
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've come to believe that he needs a certain level of violence
in this country,'' LaPierre said. ''He's willing to accept a
certain level of killing to further his political agenda and his
vice president, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a new advertising campaign in which NRA President
Charlton Heston all but accuses Clinton of lying in his
characterizations of the group as an impediment to sensible laws
and public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 13 ads that have started to run on network
affiliates and cable TV networks end with Heston saying, as if
speaking directly to Clinton: ''When what you say is wrong, that's
a mistake. When you know it's wrong, that's a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the sparring was over Clinton's two-track effort
to use his final year to win some of the gun controls that have
eluded him so far and inject the subject into the presidential
campaign pitting Vice President Al Gore against Republican Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, appearing Sunday on ABC's ''This Week,'' said people
can't take seriously the ''wounded rhetoric'' of the NRA, ''given
how ruthlessly brutal they were'' to members of Congress who helped
pass the Brady waiting-period bill and the ban on assault-type
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''These crocodile tears, I don't think it will wash with the
voters, even with Moses reading the script,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, an actor, played Moses in the movie ''The Ten
Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre, also on ''This Week,'' attributed Clinton's renewed
focus on guns to his interest in getting Gore elected. ''The
pollsters and consultants are telling them, scare suburban women,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other steps, the president wants people who make purchases
at gun shows to be subject to background checks that could take as
long as 72 hours. Many congressional Republicans and the NRA want
any such checks to be instant, or at least no longer than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think that the knee-jerk reaction to any gun safety
measure is wrong,'' Clinton said of the NRA. ''If you do one little
thing that requires any accommodation ... they think it's the end
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, they basically win through intimidation,'' Clinton
said. ''People are scared of them.'' But while the organization may
have over 3 million members, ''there's more people than that in
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Clinton, who taped the ABC interview Friday, LaPierre
wasted no time going after the ''level of dishonesty this man is
capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that the administration has been singularly lax in
enforcing gun laws already on the books. ''You can't care about
stopping crimes with guns and give the country a complete lack of
enforcement,'' the NRA official said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress would have given Clinton most of what he wants last
year -- including gun show checks and mandatory child-safety locks
on guns -- but the president ''killed it all'' by insisting on a
72-hour wait at the shows, LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   In one ad, Heston quotes Clinton as saying other countries have
lower rates of gun deaths because they don't have an NRA. ''You
want a country with no NRA, a country with no Second Amendment,''
says a transcript of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   Another ad said the statement that 13 children die every day
from gun accidents is a Clinton lie. Heston put the number of such
accidental deaths at 130 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's claim -- which he has since revised to 12 children
-- concerns the average number of young deaths overall from guns,
not just accidents.
</P>
<P>
   He bases it on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
which says 4,223 juveniles were killed by guns in 1997. That's an
average of 11.6 per day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, an occasional duck hunter, says he has owned a
''handgun or two'' and other firearms over the years but never kept
them in his family's homes, including the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he is not advocating universal gun registration, the
president said: ''I can't even pass the bill closing the gun show
loophole through this Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Won't Stray From Positions  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reform Party presidential candidate Pat
Buchanan isn't backing down from divisive positions that are at
odds with most of the party's members, including his opposition to
abortion rights and his call for a cultural war.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan doesn't volunteer those positions at Reform meetings as
he pursues its presidential nomination, and the party platform is
silent on such matters.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority would be best described as secular,'' said former
party chairman Russell Verney, who is a top aide to founder Ross
Perot. ''They don't want the government to take a position on those
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But asked Sunday to comment, Buchanan said he will use the
exposure to campaign against the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will commit myself to use the bully pulpit to fight the
culture of death,'' he said on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' ''If I'm
nominated by the Reform Party, which I intend to be, the Reform
Party candidate will be the most pro-life candidate in the
presidential race.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservative commentator's stance on domestic issues have
been branded extremist even by some former colleagues in the
Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Verney said Buchanan's positions wouldn't disqualify him
from winning the Reform Party's presidential nomination, as long as
he agrees with the platform's opposition to free-trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every candidate has positions outside the party's platform,''
Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Buchanan needs the nomination to keep from
being overshadowed by Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President
Al Gore, the presumptive Republican and Democratic nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan started the race as one of a dozen Republican hopefuls
and has survived by leaving the GOP for the Reform Party and
forging an alliance with political opposites in the party.
</P>
<P>
   At campaign events, Buchanan does not volunteer his
anti-abortion views or the fact that an individual's position on
the issue would be a prime factor in choosing a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday about potential nominees to the Supreme Court, he
said: ''I would only appoint justices who I knew or deeply believed
would overturn Roe vs. Wade,'' the high court's 1973 decision that
legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a cultural war going on for the soul of America,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   On whom, if anyone, he would refuse to meet with, Buchanan said
quietly, ''I would not meet with the (Ku Klux) Klan.''
</P>
<P>
   For Buchanan, the Reform Party nomination would bring a huge
reward.
</P>
<P>
   It would give him a pulpit from which to focus on the common
ground between him and the party: opposition to free trade
agreements and normal trade status for China, which the Clinton
administration supports, while minimizing his more divisive
positions.
</P>
<P>
   Winning the nomination also brings $12.6 million in federal
subsidies for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the Reform Party tops its ticket with a candidate
who will draw media coverage and who powerfully articulates its
central underpinning, trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan predicted Sunday that his candidacy would attract the
support of 15 percent of voters and qualify him to participate in
the fall presidential debates. Such poll numbers would defy surveys
that show that domestic issues, not foreign affairs, drive the
nation's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan plans to fly around the country this week to
fund-raisers and to give a speech Thursday at Harvard University.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush Pursuing Independents  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, settling in for a
two-hour chat with 200 people in a university gym, scanned the room
for independents and said, ''I'm anxious to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   He still is. That's where the action is in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're at a fork in the road, and I'm here to try to convince
you to vote for me,'' Gore, the presumptive Democratic presidential
nominee, told the group at Wayne State University in Detroit -- John
McCain territory not too long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush lost the state's Republican
presidential primary in part because he couldn't get the support of
independents, who went instead for McCain, his now-vanquished
rival. Bush also is changing his message in hopes of pulling
independents his way in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a group, independents and ticket splitters are the ones who
will decide the outcome'' this fall, said David Rohde, a
presidential election expert at Michigan State University. The
candidates ''are going to focus on those people right from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has been a barometer of national presidential strength
in the last four elections, picking the winner each time. The final
outcome was within one percentage point of reflecting the national
popular vote in three of the four, and only three points in
President Clinton's favor in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-fifth of Michigan's 6.7 million registered voters
are independents or swing voters who vote for the candidate rather
than the party, said Craig Ruff of Public Sector Consultants, a
Lansing think tank.
</P>
<P>
   They tend to support abortion rights, cite health care, taxes
and education as their top concerns and value saving Social
Security over reducing taxes, according to polls done by EPIC/MRA
of Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Six out of 10 are women, and -- regardless of gender -- likely to
be either over age 64 or between 41 and 49. Nearly 90 percent are
white.
</P>
<P>
   They overwhelmingly supported McCain in the state's Feb. 22 GOP
primary, accounting for four of every 10 votes for the Arizona
senator. About 13 percent backed third-party candidate Ross Perot
in both 1992 and 1996, and more than half would like to see McCain
run as the nominee of Perot's Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton supports Bush but criticized him after McCain's
Michigan victory. He said the Texas governor ''allowed the
hard-right element to speak for him in lots of ways, and it was an
absolute turnoff measured in votes among independents, who we have
to rely on to win, whether it be for governor or for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that McCain, and former Democratic contender Bill Bradley,
have quit the race, some independent voters may stay home, said Ed
Sarpolus of EPIC/MRA.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do vote in the general election, he said, ''It's
going to come down to the character and trust issue. That's why
McCain got all his votes.'' He expects independents to base their
votes on who they think can keep prosperity going rather than on
specific issues or party.
</P>
<P>
   Incoming state Republican Chairman Rusty Hills said Bush still
has plenty of time to convince independent and swing voters that
he's the best candidate to guard their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bush has done it'' as governor in Texas, Hills said. ''We just
have to do it nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   While it's too early to tell how independents will vote in
Michigan's presidential race, Ruff said their role remains crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see neither Gore nor Bush whipping anyone into a frenzy, and
we'll return to a somewhat normal turnout among partisan voters,''
he predicted. ''That puts independents back into the role of
broker.''

<HEADLINE> 'Mission to Mars' Soars to No. 1  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The sci-fi thriller ''Mission to Mars''
blasted to the top of the box office with a $23.1 million debut
after appealing to moviegoers starry-eyed for special effects.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences ''starved for something that looked like an event
picture'' pushed it into first place despite scathing reviews, said
Paul Dergarabedian of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks
box office receipts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mission to Mars'' stars Tim Robbins, Don Cheadle and Gary
Sinise as members of a team sent to rescue the first manned mission
to the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public voted with their pocketbooks and we were obviously
clearly the runaway hit here,'' said Chuck Viane, president of
distribution for Buena Vista Pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mission'' dislodged ''The Whole Nine Yards'' from the No. 1
spot after three weeks. The hitman comedy tumbled to fourth place
with $5.4 million, according to Sunday estimates. Final figures
were expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Polanski's supernatural thriller ''The Ninth Gate''
debuted in second place with $6.7 million, followed by ''My Dog
Skip,'' which continued to do well on good word-of-mouth and earned
$6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty'' and ''The Cider House Rules'' continued to
do well, following their Academy Award nominations. They were in
fifth and sixth place, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Beauty,'' which grossed $3.7 million over the weekend
and won top honors for acting at the Screen Actors Guild awards
Sunday, is expected to reach the $100 million landmark next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''Drowning Mona'' fell from fourth to seventh place, grossing
$3.5 million, while Madonna's ''The Next Best Thing'' tumbled from
second to eighth place with $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10, ''Pitch Black'' and ''Snow Day'' tied
for ninth place with $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully placed to avoid competition, ''Mission'' debuted amid
holdover comedies and adult dramas. It had more than a third of the
total gross for the weekend's top 12 pictures, Dergarabedian said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It may be the film that jump-starts the box office again,''
Dergarabedian said. ''We've been going in fits and starts... every
time we have a big opener, then the following weekend we're down
again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mission'' also was the best movie opening for director Brian
De Palma since ''Mission: Impossible,'' which took in $45.4 million
in a May 1996 debut weekend.
</P>
<P>
   However, ''Mission to Mars'' could face competition from an
upcoming series of high-profile debuts, starting with Julia
Roberts' ''Erin Brokovich'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is not a week between now and late April that there is
not a clearly defined No. 1 film, at least on paper,'' Viane said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the top 12 films this weekend grossed $67 million,
compared to $68.6 million for the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North
American theaters, according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc.
</P>
<P>
   1. ''Mission to Mars,'' $23.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   2. ''The Ninth Gate,'' $6.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   3. ''My Dog Skip,'' $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   4. ''The Whole Nine Yards,'' $5.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   5. ''American Beauty,'' $3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   6. ''The Cider House Rules,'' $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   7. ''Drowning Mona,'' $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   8. ''The Next Best Thing,'' $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   9. (tie) ''Pitch Black,'' $3.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Does Bush Understand Enough?  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The impression that Vice President Al Gore hopes
to leave with voters between now and November is unmistakable:
Republican George W. Bush, who holds one of the constitutionally
weakest governorships in the nation, is not ready, not experienced,
not capable of being president.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Associated Press and in an escalating
series of public comments, Gore also casts his Republican rival as
beholden to special-interest campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ''This raises the question, does Governor Bush have the
understanding of America's problems to be president,'' Gore told
the AP on Sunday as he campaigned on Bush's home turf.
</P>
<P>
   In a 40-minute interview, Gore also slammed Bush for not
proposing to put ''one penny into expanding access to health
care,'' but he conceded he is not prepared to offer his own plan
for universal health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Gore was amplifying his critique of Bush on health care
in an appearance at a Miami-area hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Under renewed scrutiny for 1996 campaign finance tactics that he
now acknowledges were ''mistakes,'' Gore said in the interview that
he is ''of course'' convinced he did nothing illegal by attending a
fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple in California and using White
House telephones to solicit contributions.
</P>
<P>
   He brushed off a suggestion by Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican
presidential candidate, that the Senate reopen its investigation.
''Let Al Gore and the president come up (to testify) and we can
resolve this quickly,'' Dole said on CBS' ''Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said: ''They want to launch personal attacks in order to
deflect from their opposition to campaign finance reform,'' an
issue he newly plans to put at the core of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush criticized Gore's pledge to elevate the campaign financing
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the vice president is someone who will say anything to
get elected. The more he talks about campaign funding reform, the
better off it will be for my campaign,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore delivered his broadside as he rode in his limousine between
church services and lunch at a Mexican restaurant. He kept a
distracted eye on the window and eagerly waved to anyone who
noticed him.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning Bush's experience and capacity to serve as president
after 1{ terms as governor, Gore emphasized that, in Texas, the
governor is actually the fifth least powerful statewide official.
</P>
<P>
   ''Six years in a position that is more symbolic than powerful
has some value,'' Gore said sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   ''And (Bush) has exercised what power the office does have to
make Texas the worst state in the nation in pollution,'' block
hate-crimes legislation and overturn a ban on concealed weapons,
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was among the first in a series that Gore, the
presumptive Democratic nominee now that Bill Bradley has left the
race, has offered major news organizations to try to paint Bush as
an inexperienced captive of the right wing early enough that the
label might stick through November.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend polls showed that Gore, in the past two weeks when he
abandoned the nomination fight with Bradley and began taking on
Bush, has eliminated the governor's lead nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Gore returned repeatedly Sunday to versions of the same refrain:
''Does Governor Bush have the kind of decision-making tests under
his belt to be president? ... the experience? ... the sense of
perspective?'' Exit polls from the early primaries showed that some
voters are concerned about whether Bush has the intellectual heft
they believe is required of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, campaigning in Florida, shot back: ''The vice president
obviously believes that all knowledge and wisdom emanates out of
Washington. ... I think all wisdom and knowledge emanates from the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he wasn't really trying to say Bush is ''too dumb'' to
be president, Gore convulsed in laughter while taking a drink of
Diet Coke. He grabbed a towel to hold against his mouth then,
finally swallowing, insisted the tape recorder be stopped for an
off-the-record observation.
</P>
<P>
   From his recent public comments, however, it is not hard to see
the impression Gore hopes to leave with voters. Where once he
railed against the ''Reagan-Bush years'' of Bush's father, the
former president, Gore recently has switched to labeling them the
''Bush-Quayle'' years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore insisted the new phrasing was not a way of pasting Bush
with the stereotype that doomed Vice President Dan Quayle. ''I want
to refer to the most recent experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore cast Bush, who has raised a record $73 million, as a puppet
of his contributors. ''His entire agenda has been prepared by these
same groups that are donating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker countered that Bush makes
decisions ''based upon what's best for the country. They have
doubts about the current administration doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush has proposed nearly $2 trillion in tax cuts over
10 years because his financiers want a tax break, but has not put
''one penny into expanding access to health care'' or shoring up
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   During the early primaries, as Bradley gained ground with his
plan for universal health insurance, Gore promised that his own
limited proposal was just a first step. He conceded Sunday he does
not have a next step.
</P>
<P>
   ''Inherent in the step-by-step approach is an acknowledgment
that we don't have a map that takes us from where we are, in one
fell swoop, to universal health insurance,'' he said.

Cohen Makes Historic Visit to Vietnam
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) -- Conscious of the symbolism, William Cohen arrived in
the Vietnamese capital today as the first U.S. defense secretary to visit since
the Vietnam War ended 25 years ago in defeat for America. ''I intend to focus on
the future, not on the past,'' Cohen told reporters accompanying him as his Air
Force jet approached the Hanoi airport, where he was greeted by a few Vietnamese
officers and U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson. Cohen's schedule Monday included a
trip into the countryside outside Hanoi to get a firsthand look at the work of a
joint U.S.-Vietnamese team that is searching for remains of an American pilot.

Flu Shot May Cut Heart-Attack Risk
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Getting an annual influenza shot may do more than
represent a shot in the arm to preventing the flu. It might also reduce heart
attacks. A study released Sunday suggests that heart patients may significantly
reduce their risk of a second heart attack if they get vaccinated against
influenza. The finding is still considered preliminary and needs to be confirmed
by further studies. Still, doctors say it raises the possibility of a powerful
and underused way of keeping the heart healthy.

Fed Law Officers Grow 11 Percent
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of federal law enforcement officers grew by 11
percent from 1996 to 1998, the Justice Department said Sunday. About half the
growth of approximately 8,000 men and women was in the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. Within that agency, the number of Border Patrol officers
alone rose from 5,441 in 1996 to 7,714 in 1998, an increase of 42 percent.
Overall, federal agencies employed about 83,000 full-time law enforcement
officers with arrest powers and firearms authorization, according to the Justice
Department Bureau of Justice Statistics.

Gore Rolls Up Delegate Totals
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   A smaller-than-expected turnout of about 11,000 people at the first
Democratic weekend caucuses in Minnesota gave Vice President Al Gore a near
sweep as anticipated in a binding presidential poll. Gore also was expected to
pick up all 20 delegates at stake after a resounding victory Sunday at caucuses
in Nevada where there were even fewer voters. With 14 of 17 counties reporting
in Nevada, Gore had 92 percent of the vote to 8 percent for Bill Bradley and
others. Although no official delegate assignments were made by the party, state
chairman Rory Reid noted that Bradley would have had to get at least 15 percent
of the votes cast in either of Nevada's two congressional districts to win any
delegates.

Clinton, NRA Spar Over Gun Laws
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charges of dishonesty and fear-mongering over tougher gun
laws flew Sunday in back-to-back TV appearances by President Clinton and a top
official of the National Rifle Association with Clinton accusing the group of
''knee-jerk'' opposition to any gun safety measure. NRA executive vice-president
Wayne LaPierre, in turn, accused the president of exploiting gun deaths for
political purposes. One point at issue was a new advertising campaign in which
NRA President Charlton Heston all but accuses the president of lying in his
characterizations of the group as an impediment to sensible laws and public
safety.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Nabs Major Drug Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By ARTURO SALINAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- Charging through screaming spectators,
plainclothes commandos tackled Jesus Labra during his son's
football game, arresting a leading member of the Arellano Felix
drug organization.
</P>
<P>
   Labra's capture Saturday was believed among one of Mexico's most
important narcotics arrests in recent years. The U.S. Drug
Enforcement Agency considers the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix gang
to be one of the largest and most violent in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The brother who allegedly heads the group's enforcement arm,
Ramon, is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, with a $2 million
reward offered for information leading to his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have long been critical of Mexico's failure to
arrest leaders of the group, alleged to hand out immense bribes and
carry out ruthless murders.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 men in civilian clothes raided the school grounds
where Labra's son was playing in a football game Saturday.
Witnesses said spectators screamed, wept and flung themselves to
the ground as the soldiers tackled Labra on the football field.
</P>
<P>
   In its first official statement on the arrest, the office of
Mexico's attorney general suggested Sunday that the elaborate
operation leading to Labra's capture was merely a routine check of
the spectators for illegal weapons. Jesus Labra was carrying a
.38-caliber pistol and chose to flee, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   It said that soldiers were ''making rounds to apply the federal
firearms and explosives law'' when they ''became aware that among
the public was an individual who obviously carried a firearm at his
waist.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's statement said Labra also faces possible drug charges
and is suspected of being ''one of the principle leaders and
operators of the criminal organization headed by the Arellano Felix
brothers.''
</P>
<P>
   Labra's attorney, Gustavo Galvez, told reporters Saturday that
his client is not a gangster, but merely a very successful local
businessman, one with interests in hotels, nightclubs and
pharmacies around Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Galvez accused officials of arresting Labra without a warrant
and of keeping him incommunicado afterward. He claimed U.S. DEA
agents participated in the arrest in violation of Mexico's
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican prosecutors say the Arellano Felix gang's victims
include the late Roman Catholic Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo,
shot to death at the Guadalajara airport in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   They say the group had targeted a rival drug gang leader,
Joaquin Guzman Loera, but killed the cardinal instead after
confusing the vehicles the two men were traveling in.
</P>
<P>
   Labra, believed to be around 50, was a prominent owner of hotels
and restaurants in Tijuana a decade ago before rumors linking him
to the Arellano Felix brothers began to surface and he dropped out
of public view.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Mexico City daily Reforma said some investigators
believed Labra had become the key figure in the organization --
which began taking over narcotics trafficking in the area around
1990 -- though attention has continued to focus on brothers Ramon,
Benjamin and Francisco Javier.
</P>
<P>
   One of the brothers, Francisco Rafael, has been imprisoned since
his arrest on charges of complicity in the cardinal's slaying. The
brothers have denied killing Posadas Ocampo. Church leaders say
they believe the cardinal was intentionally killed, possibly for
his campaign against drugs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Meat Consumption Ends Slump  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- At E&AMP;M Foods in the Chicago suburb of Skokie,
customers are drawn like magnets to the best and most expensive
beef: porterhouse, T-bone, strip steaks, filet mignon.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a low-fat craze that came and went. The veggie craze
came and went. But beef -- that's part of us,'' owner Ed Figlewicz
said. ''Americans have always liked beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the line spills out into the street some Saturdays at
the Paulina Market on the city's North Side, where steaks are the
prized item in a butcher shop bursting with beef.
</P>
<P>
   Upscale steakhouses buzz with big dinner crowds in the downtown
Loop and along Rush Street, a hub of Chicago nightlife, similar to
scenes in other cities from Boston to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of flat sales, beef is back.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the '90s, a nation long known for its love of
burgers and steaks seemed to have had its fill of red meat amid
concerns it might not be so healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But now no one's asking where the beef is. U.S. beef consumption
rose 2 percent in 1999 to 66.2 pounds per person, the highest since
the 1980s, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Factoring in higher prices, consumer spending on beef shot up 5
percent to $49.2 billion, according to Chicago-based marketing firm
Technomic Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has come back,'' says Ray Lekan, co-owner of the
51-year-old Paulina Market, which had one of its best years ever in
1999 thanks to beef. ''It's slowly becoming more popular again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's shaken off the cholesterol onus, the gray cloud that's
been over it for so many years,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Beef's glory days may not last. Production is forecast to fall 3
percent this year, driving prices still higher, due to the
liquidation of breeding herds during down years. And marketing
research shows chicken will surpass beef as Americans' meat of
choice by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But last year's modest jump brought huge relief to an industry
that has been standing still while chicken and turkey fly up from
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the first time in 20 years, we're seeing beef demand
stabilize,'' says Chuck Schroeder, chief executive officer of the
National Cattlemen's Beef Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''It isn't a skyrocketing increase, but it says consumers have
renewed interest and enthusiasm for beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Several factors explain the latest beefing up of America. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   -- With the U.S. economy soaring, people are eating out more than
ever and high-cost items such as steaks and other choice cuts of
beef are more popular.
</P>
<P>
   -- The nationwide craze for the low-carbohydrate, high-protein
diet has made beef a diet staple for many.
</P>
<P>
   -- Taking a page from the poultry industry's cookbook, the beef
industry has been stressing convenience and speed. From
rotisserie-style roasts to fully cooked ground beef and
microwaveable pot roasts and stews, it has been flooding
supermarkets since late 1998 with heat-and-serve products that can
be prepared in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The industry got the message'' says Chuck Levitt, meats
analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. ''It knew it needed to
prepare more quick-preparation products.''
</P>
<P>
   -- A $30 million yearlong marketing campaign launched last fall
promotes beef's nutritional value, focusing on nutrients such as
zinc, iron, protein and several B-vitamins. The beef industry even
claims lean red meat can be part of a cholesterol-lowering diet.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgence of beef has made the livestock industry a rare
bright spot among U.S. farmers, many of whom are in the doldrums
over low prices for agricultural commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Recovering from hard times that ended in about mid-1998,
ranchers enjoyed the best prices for calves in December since 1994.
Feedlots have been profitable since early last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides U.S. consumption, they also have benefited from strong
U.S. exports to Asia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Among the beef industry's biggest fears is an economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two places people 'steal' from when their money gets
tight: their food budget and their insurance company,'' says Dave
Maher, a meat industry analyst for Securities Corp. of Iowa. ''That
means they might eat out less, and they might cut back on the
expensive cuts.''

<HEADLINE> Oregon St. Fires Hoops Coach Payne  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon State basketball coach Eddie Payne
and his staff were fired Sunday, a day after the Beavers completed
their fifth straight non-winning season.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State lost 83-65 to Oregon on Saturday night to finish
13-16 overall, including 5-13 in the Pacific-10. The Beavers were
52-88 overall and 20-70 in the Pac-10 in five seasons under Payne.
</P>
<P>
   ''Making changes in your program is never an easy thing to do,
especially when it involves good people,'' athletic director Mitch
Barnhart said in a statement. ''Sometimes the chemistry of teams
and events don't always produce the success level you are hoping to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State once was among the nation's most powerful programs.
The Beavers won four Pac-10 titles during the 1980s, went to the
NCAA tournament seven times and were ranked No. 1 for five weeks
during the 1980-81 season. But the team hasn't had a winning record
since 1989-90, Gary Payton's last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Beavers improved steadily during Payne's first four seasons,
going 6-21, 7-20, 13-17 and 13-4 last season, when Oregon State
defeated three Top 10 teams at home. With all five starters
returning, prospects were good for a winning campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The team's offense never became a threat, and center Jason Heide
was plagued by injuries. The Beavers upgraded with freshmen Brian
Jackson and Jimmie Haywood, but the better teams in the Pac-10
improved faster by bringing in more talented players.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance also began to falter, and Barnhart, who watched the
football program get competitive almost overnight under new coach
Dennis Erickson, lost patience. During the buzzer-beating upset of
Arizona last week, only 5,538 fans turned out, just over half the
capacity of Gill Coliseum. Overall, attendance was down more than
12 percent from last season.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State's outlook is bleak for next year, too. The team's
best player, junior point guard Deaundra Tanner, said he might
leave school and return to Los Angeles to be closer to his
3-year-old son. And to replace five departing seniors, Payne signed
just one player -- a 6-foot-11 Canadian -- and has four scholarships
left to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, 48, has one year remaining on his contract, for which the
school owes him a base salary of $135,000. Assistant coaches Leroy
Washington, Rich Wold and Chad Forcier have contracts that expire
in June.
</P>
<P>
   Payne was coach at East Carolina from 1991-1995, compiling a
record of 56-58. But his final two teams posted winning records,
and the Pirates reached the 1993 NCAA tournament.

<HEADLINE> Hart Wins Honda in Wild Finish  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL SPRINGS, Fla. (AP) -- When Brian Gay's 30-foot putt on the
17th hole hung on the lip of cup for 15 seconds and then dropped in
the hole, it looked like things were falling his way.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a bogey on No. 18, followed by a 1-stroke penalty
assessed after his round. As a result, Gay couldn't match a strong
finish by Dudley Hart, who birdied the final four holes Sunday to
overcome a 3-shot deficit and win the Honda Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Hart had completed his round and was anticipating a possible
playoff when he learned that Gay's putt on No. 17 was being
reviewed by PGA Tour rules official Slugger White.
</P>
<P>
   Gay, bidding for his first tour title, appeared to tie Hart for
the lead when his 30-footer from the fringe sat on the lip, then
fell into the cup. But after the round ended, White assessed Gay a
1-stroke penalty because of the delay before the putt fell in.
</P>
<P>
   Because Gay bogeyed No. 18, he lost by two strokes, so the
penalty didn't keep him from reaching a playoff. But it still
stirred controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty resulted from rule 16-2, which states that when the
ball overhangs the lip, it is considered at rest 10 seconds after
the player reaches the hole. If the ball falls in after that, the
player is assessed a 1-stroke penalty.
</P>
<P>
   White viewed television replays with Gay and determined that the
ball fell into the cup at least 13 seconds after Gay walked up to
the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked at the tape 10 times, and he and I looked at the tape
another five or six times,'' White said. ''We rolled it, we backed
it up, we did everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay was unhappy that the rule was interpreted literally. He
noted that he could have avoided a penalty by walking more slowly
to the hole, thus giving the ball more time to fall in before the
10-second rule took effect.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a gray area when you split hairs on a couple of
seconds,'' Gay said. ''If you ran to the hole when you hit your
putt out of excitement, you're hurting yourself, because once
you're there, the clock starts. So in actuality you should probably
dilly-dally around and try to beat the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the penalty dropped Gay from second place to fourth, it
cost him $88,933 -- more than he made all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, who lives 20 minutes from the Heron Bay course, pleased
the gallery by playing the final 10 holes in 6-under-par. He shot
65 to finish at 19-under 269.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's gratifying that I played well in front of all my family
and friends,'' said Hart, who earned $522,000. ''When you're trying
to get tickets for everybody and show them a good time, there can
be a lot of distractions. I'm glad I was able to put it all
aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Wentworth and J.P. Hayes tied for second at 18-under. Gay
and Jim Furyk were next at 17-under.
</P>
<P>
   With 24 of the world's 30 top-ranked players skipping the
tournament, unfamiliar names dominated the leader board. The
contenders played well down the stretch, and Hart played the best.
</P>
<P>
   A strong wind that blew for most of the tournament died down as
the leaders reached the final few holes, and Hart took advantage.
Playing in the next-to-last threesome, he made a 20-foot putt at
No. 17 to tie Gay and Wentworth for the lead, then sank a 3-footer
at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   The only other PGA Tour victory for Hart, 31, came in the 1996
Canadian Open. He said the win was especially gratifying because
his father is recovering from recent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dad, I'm keeping this trophy,'' he said with a grin. ''You got
the first one.''
</P>
<P>
Divots: Davis Love III, the top-ranked player in the field, tied
the course record with an 8-under 64 and finished 12-under. ...
Mike Hulbert finished 12-under to earn his first check this year.
He had missed the cut in all six previous tournaments. ... Casey
Martin, who rode a cart after winning an appellate court ruling
last week, couldn't capitalize on an opening 66. He shot 75 Sunday
and finished 5-under. ... For the first time since the 1999
Hawaiian Open, the entire field was under par. Ryan Howison
finished 76th and last at 1-under. ... Two-time Honda champ Mark
Calcavecchia shot 67 and finished 15-under. Defending champion
Vijay Singh shot 72 and finished 8-under.

<HEADLINE> Miami Ready For Marino Retirement  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. (AP) -- The curly hair is shorter now, and the waist
is wider. Dan Marino has changed a bit in the past 17 years, and
the NFL record book looks different, too.
</P>
<P>
   Marino planned to announce his retirement today, bringing to a
close the most prolific passing career in league history.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Dolphins anticipated the largest news conference in
the 35-year history of the franchise, eclipsing Jimmy Johnson's
retirement two months ago and Don Shula's retirement four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins officials worked for two days to prepare for the
announcement in the team meeting room -- the same location as for
the departure speeches by Shula and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the room is big enough,'' said Harvey Greene,
the team's vice president of media relations. ''But we have to make
do with what it is, because we understand Danny wants to low-key
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Big, cushy chairs in the meeting room were replaced with much
smaller folding chairs. Several tables were removed to make more
room for the media.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins hired an audiovisual coordinator to help with
dozens of television crews expected to attend Marino's news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's never wanted to bring attention on himself,'' Greene
said. ''He doesn't want to make this into a big deal -- although any
time Dan does anything in this market, it's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino, 38, wanted to go out like John Elway and retire as a
Super Bowl champion. But after parting ways with the Dolphins, he
reluctantly rejected an offer to play this year for the Minnesota
Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now that he's retiring, he'll become a young man again,''
former Miami quarterback Bob Griese said, ''because he's 38, and 38
is damned young.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends said Marino turned the deal down because of his bad
knees, his loyalty to the Dolphins and his unwillingness to be
separated from his wife and five children for an extended time.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us have to respect Dan for the right to make the
decision,'' Shula said. ''Something like this is never easy. I went
through it my final year.''
</P>
<P>
   Marino's records could last for decades. He holds NFL career
marks for touchdowns (420), yardage (61,361) and completions
(4,967).
</P>
<P>
   Vikings coach Dennis Green thought Marino could have extended
his career as well as his passing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''He still in my opinion has the capability to play,'' Green
said. ''I'm happy we offered him an opportunity. He had a choice
clear-cut. He made the decision, and I've got the utmost respect
and best wishes for him.''

<HEADLINE> Sorenstam Wins Welch's Circle K  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The LPGA Hall of Fame won't be ready for
Annika Sorenstam until 2003, after she completes her mandatory 10
years on the LPGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   But Sorenstam is ready for the Hall now.
</P>
<P>
   She met the other requirements Sunday, beating Pat Hurst on the
second playoff hole to win the Welch's-Circle K Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The one-point win -- Sorenstam's career 19th title -- put her at
27 points, the Hall's entry-level standard.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be a part of something -- an elite group like that -- is a
dream come true,'' she said. ''Especially when you know that maybe
when I'm 50 or 60, to know that I'm one of them. When I started to
play golf, I played it because I love it so much, and suddenly
you're achieving something like that. It's unreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, beaten by Karrie Webb last week in a playoff in
Hawaii, shot a 5-under-par 67, and Hurst closed with a 66 to finish
72 holes at a tournament-record 19-under 269. The previous best was
Chris Johnson's 272 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam sank a 4-foot birdie putt on the second extra hole
after Hurst parred it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was thinking, 'Here we go again,''' Sorenstam said. ''Last
week, I had the chance. If I could have birdied 18 last week I
would have won. Here, if I would have birdied 18, I would have won
again. I didn't want the same finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam improved to 6-3 in playoffs, dropping Hurst, whose
last championship was the 1998 Dinah Shore, to 0-2.
</P>
<P>
   The $105,000 first prize increased Sorenstam's earnings to
$184,870 and boosted her from 13th to third on the money list,
trailing only Webb and Laura Davies.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Juli Inkster matched the lowest finishing
score ever in the tournament with a 64, and was third at 270 -- her
third top-three finish in as many events.
</P>
<P>
   Dottie Pepper was alone in fourth at 271, one shot ahead of
Johnson and Se Ri Pak, who also shot 64.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, A.J. Eathorne, Michelle McGann, Brandie Burton and Moira
Dunn, who shared the third-round lead with Sorenstam, tied for
seventh at 273.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone except Hurst had too much ground to make up, especially
when Sorenstam holed a 114-yard sand wedge from the fairway for an
eagle-2 on the ninth hole.
</P>
<P>
   Just before that shot, Inkster sank a 60-foot putt for birdie on
No. 12. She was in the 13th fairway waiting to hit her second shot
when the crowd around the ninth green erupted in applause.
</P>
<P>
   Unruffled, Inkster reached the 470-yard, par-5 with her second
shot and rolled in a 30-foot putt for an eagle-3 that tied
Sorenstam again at 17-under.
</P>
<P>
   But Inkster had just one birdie left, and Sorenstam grabbed the
lead again when she birdied No. 13 and kept it with a birdie on No.
16.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst, though, birdied five of the last six holes to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's tough,'' Hurst said. ''Me, as a player, I have to step
it up to a different level when she's ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam and Hurst played No. 18, a 458-yard par-5, twice in
the playoff. Each woman birdied it the first time, but on the
second run-through, Hurst sliced her drive and wound up on the
wrong side of the cart path and almost into a grove of trees.
</P>
<P>
   She had enough room to swing, but her approach shot was short.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst's 60-foot chip for eagle rolled 20 feet past onto the
fringe, and her chip back was inches short.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam reached the green in two and left herself a 35-foot
putt over a knoll. She rolled that one 4 feet past and made the
comebacker.

<HEADLINE> Hall of Fame Trainer Lukas Wins One  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   A first, two seconds and two fourths in five Kentucky Derby prep
races isn't the worst thing that could have happened to Hall of
Fame trainer D. Wayne Lukas.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, Lukas would have preferred five victories over the
weekend, but if his 3-year-olds keep running well, the four-time
Derby winner might just pull off a fifth Derby win on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Surfside saved Lukas from a lost weekend when the sensational
filly won the $300,000 Santa Anita Oaks on Sunday, holding off
Kumari Continent by three-quarters of a length.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, although not as impressive as expected, moved
Surfside into a race against boys in the Santa Anita Derby on April
8.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got grandiose ideas, we're looking down the road,''
Lukas said. ''They don't give us anything extra for winning by six
or seven lengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas saddled the last filly to win the Derby, Winning Colors,
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   A look at Lukas' weekend ledger:
</P>
<P>
   -- Even-money favorite High Yield was beaten a head by Hal's Hope
in Saturday's $750,000 Florida Derby.
</P>
<P>
   -- True Confidence was 1{ lengths behind long shot Remember
Sheikh in Saturday's $200,000 El Camino Derby at Bay Meadows.
</P>
<P>
   -- Second-choice Exchange Rate was fourth in Sunday's $750,000
Louisiana Derby, won by Mighty.
</P>
<P>
   -- Sun Cat was fourth in the $100,000 Swale Stakes on the Florida
Derby undercard. Trippi was the winner.
</P>
<P>
   -- Another Lukas filly, Shawnee Country, won the $350,000 Fair
Grounds Oaks on Saturday, but she appears headed to the Kentucky
Oaks on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas said High Yield will head to the Blue Grass Stakes on
April 15 for a rematch with Hal's Hope, who won a stretch-long duel
with Lukas' colt to give 88-year-old owner-trainer Harold Rose and
jockey Roger Velez the biggest wins of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've never been to the Derby before,'' Velez said, ''but it
looks like we're going this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who has bred, owned and trained claimers for much of his
nearly 40 years in the racing business, is set for his second trip
to Churchill Downs. In 1984, his Rexson's Hope finished 10th in a
20-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time,'' he said, ''I'm going with a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the top Derby contenders who did not race over the weekend
were Anees, The Deputy and War Chant.
</P>
<P>
   Anees, winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, and The Deputy are
expected to meet in the San Felipe at Santa Anita on March 19; and
War Chant, the San Rafael winner, goes next in the Santa Anita
Derby, where Surfside will be waiting.
</P>
<P>
   In the Santa Anita Oaks, jockey Pat Day was aboard Surfside a
day after his second-place finish on Hal's Hope.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the fourth straight and seventh in nine lifetime
starts for Surfside, and the winner's share of $180,000 raised the
career earnings of the Kentucky-bred daughter of 1977 Triple Crown
winner Seattle Slew to $1,040,230.
</P>
<P>
   In the Louisiana Derby, Mighty rallied from last place entering
the final turn as jockey Shane Sellers guided his colt into the
lead for a two-length victory over More Than Ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was by far his biggest race,'' Mighty's trainer Frank
Brothers said.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, the 2-1 favorite trained by Bob Baffert, was
third, but the trainer said he was leaning toward running his colt
in the Blue Grass.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Pletcher, who trains More Than Ready, was encouraged by his
colt's first race around two turns.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope this quiets some of the critics who say he can't go two
turns,'' Pletcher said. ''He's absolutely ready to step up to the
next level.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Florida Derby undercard, Trippi improved his Derby
chances with a 1}-length victory over Ultimate Warrior in the
$100,000 Swale Stakes. Lukas' Sun Cat was fourth.
</P>
<P>
   In the El Camino Real Derby, Remember Sheikh's upset of True
Confidence in a field of 14 has his owner, Jeff Peppard,
considering a shot at the Triple Crown races.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll take it slow with him,'' Peppard said. ''We don't want
to put him over his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas can take consolation knowing that last year, Charismatic
finished second in this race before winning the Derby, Preakness
and Horse of the Year honors in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Tribune, Times Mirror May Merge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Tribune Co. and Times Mirror Co. were on the
brink of approving a merger late Sunday that would create the
nation's third-largest newspaper company, the Chicago Tribune
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co. would control operations of the combined companies,
including the Times Mirror flagship Los Angeles Times. The new
company would be based in Chicago, the newspaper said in its
Internet edition on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The combined daily newspaper circulation of the merged companies
would be 3.6 million, by the Tribune's count, ranking it third
behind Gannett Co. Inc. and Knight Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   ''Advanced discussions are under way between Tribune Company and
Times Mirror to merge the two companies,'' Martha Goldstein, vice
president of Times Mirror corporate communications, told The
Morning Call of Allentown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The new firm would include 11 daily newspapers, 22 television
stations and a combined market value of $11.7 billion, The New York
Times reported in Monday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   The Times Mirror board of directors was meeting late Sunday and
was prepared to endorse the deal, the Tribune reported. At the Los
Angeles Times, employees were told the company would issue a
statement Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The merger may need permission from the Federal Communications
Commission since FCC rules do not allow a company to own both a TV
station and a newspaper in the same market without a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror publishes
Newsday of Long Island, N.Y.; The Baltimore Sun; The Hartford
Courant; The Morning Call of Pennsylvania; and The (Stamford)
Advocate and Greenwich Time of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 million people read Times Mirror magazines,
including Field &AMP; Stream, Popular Science, GOLF Magazine, Outdoor
Life, SKI Magazine and SKATEboarding.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune company reported 1999 revenues of $3.2 billion and
has about 13,400 employees. Tribune Broadcasting owns and operates
22 major market television stations and reaches more than 75
percent of U.S. television households.
</P>
<P>
   The company also owns and operates four radio stations,
including three stations in Denver and WGN-AM in Chicago. Tribune
Entertainment, a subsidiary, develops and distributes TV
programming.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team.
Tribune Publishing publishes four market-leading newspapers: the
Chicago Tribune, the South Florida-based Sun-Sentinel, The Orlando
Sentinel and the Hampton Roads (Va.)-based Daily Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune newspaper said talks began last year and were
encouraged by the Chandler family, which has had an interest in the
Los Angeles Times since 1882, a year after it began publication.
The Chandler family controls much of the newspaper's voting stock.

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Airline Safety Fines Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Fines on U.S. airlines for safety
violations totaled more than $9.4 million last year, an increase of
at least 80 percent from the year before, according to a published
report.
</P>
<P>
   Security violations account for about half the amount fined last
year, and maintenance violations account for 38 percent, USA Today
reported today. The total amount of fines from last year could grow
because the Federal Aviation Administration withholds information
about security cases that were opened within the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Studying FAA records of enforcement cases for 23 jet airlines
since 1985, the newspaper found that maintenance and security
violations accounted for almost three-quarters of the dollar amount
of all fines against the airlines from 1985 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA fined or took administrative action against airlines an
average eight times each work day in 1998 for safety violations,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   America West was fined the highest amount last year, nearly $2.8
million, most of it for operating flights without performing
required inspections, the report said. ''Those matters are well
behind us ...,'' said Stephen Johnson, a senior vice president at
America West.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines was fined the most times last year, 177 in all,
and the second-highest amount, almost $2 million, the newspaper
said. Delta spokesman John Kennedy said the airline flies more
people than any other in the world, ''so you'd expect that the
number of fines would reflect that we're the busiest airline.''
</P>
<P>
   Continental was fined the least amount in 1999, $111,250, the
newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Bening, Spacey Take SAG Awards  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''American Beauty'' has swept the
preliminaries. Now it's on to the Academy Awards for the movie that
has emerged as the rock-solid Oscar front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The dark but hilarious fable of suburban mania took top Screen
Actors Guild honors Sunday night for Kevin Spacey and Annette
Bening, who play a couple whose marriage has lapsed into farce. The
movie also won the guild's ensemble acting award.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this movie actually tries to put out there is that in our
notions of what is beautiful or what we're told is beautiful,
sometimes we miss the things that are simple and clearly beautiful
in our own heart,'' Spacey said.
</P>
<P>
   Acclaimed stage director Sam Mendes, who made his feature-film
debut with ''American Beauty,'' took top honors Saturday from the
Directors Guild of America.
</P>
<P>
   Only four times in the 52-year history of the Directors Guild
awards has the winner failed to go on to receive the Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   The Screen Actors awards are only in their sixth year, but they
already have an accurate track record. Nine of the 10 previous
guild lead acting winners went on to take home Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Angelina Jolie won the actors guild's supporting female actor
award for her take on a hospitalized sociopath in ''Girl,
Interrupted.'' Michael Caine took the supporting male actor honor
for his role as an ether-toking abortionist in ''The Cider House
Rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Both also are nominated for supporting-actor Oscars, though the
guild's track record is weaker in those categories. Only half the
past winners have gone on to receive Academy Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Caine already has a supporting-actor Oscar for ''Hannah and Her
Sisters,'' as does Spacey for ''The Usual Suspects.''
</P>
<P>
   Shot for a modest $15 million, ''American Beauty'' has
capitalized on its leading eight Oscar nominations, padding its
gross by more than $20 million since it was re-released last month.
The movie is pushing the $100 million mark.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Spacey plays a dour middle-aged husband on a search
to restore meaning to his life. He smokes pot with a neighbor kid,
lusts after his daughter's high-school friend and unsuccessfully
tries to cut through the icy materialism that has possessed his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Bening said the cast and crew viewed it as a small picture from
the outset, even though it was produced by Steven Spielberg's
blockbuster-minded DreamWorks SKG studio.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought maybe if we got it right, we could make a quality
picture that maybe a few people would see,'' Bening said backstage
Sunday. ''We worked toward the hope that maybe it would be a great
movie, but we never thought it would be a popular movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Fox, who announced this year he is leaving ABC's
''Spin City'' because of his fight with Parkinson's disease,
received the award for male actor in a comedy series for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   The HBO mob series ''The Sopranos'' swept the dramatic TV series
awards. James Gandolfini won for male actor, Edie Falco for female
actor and the cast won the ensemble honor.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Poitier was honored with the guild's life achievement
award. The tribute included clips from such Poitier films as ''A
Place in the Sun,'' ''To Sir With Love'' and ''In the Heat of the
Night.''

<HEADLINE> Times Mirror agrees to be taken over by Tribune Co.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In a media merger creating the nation's
third-largest newspaper company, Tribune Co. will take over Times
Mirror Co. and end the dynasty that has controlled the Los Angeles
Times since 1882, the Times announced today.
</P>
<P>
   The $6.46 billion transaction will mark the end of Times Mirror
as a company. The Chandler family, which owns a majority of the
company's voting shares, initiated the deal and has pledged to
approve it, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the combined companies will boast a daily newspaper
circulation of 3.6 million, by the Tribune's count, including
readers in the nation's three largest cities -- New York, Los
Angeles and Chicago. By circulation, it will rank behind only
Gannett Co. Inc. and Knight Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, approved by Times Mirror directors late Sunday, still
must be approved by shareholders and is subject to federal review.
</P>
<P>
   It may require a waiver of Federal Communications Commission
rules forbidding a company to own both a TV station and a newspaper
in the same market. Tribune Co.'s broadcast holdings include
KTLA-TV in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Because it involved noncompetitive bidding, other bidders have
20 calendar days to top the Tribune Co.'s offer.
</P>
<P>
   Under the takeover, Times Mirror shareholders will have a choice
of taking $95 per share from Tribune Co. -- nearly twice the stock's
recent value -- or exchanging each of their Times Mirror shares for
2.5 shares of Tribune Co. stock. The Tribune Co. also will assume
about $1.4 billion in debt, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co. would control operations from its Chicago
headquarters and John Madigan, chairman of Tribune Co., would head
the new company, the Chicago Tribune said today.
</P>
<P>
   Times reporters leaving work early today said they were
surprised by the merger and uncertain about the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very unsettled feeling,'' said Carlos Selva, a reporter
with the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post news service. ''As for
me, I won't know until I get more details.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sale follows five years of dramatic changes at
Times Mirror under the stewardship of its chief executive, Mark H.
Willes. After arriving from General Mills in spring 1995, he closed
The (Baltimore) Evening Sun and New York Newsday and sold off
assets that substantially trimmed the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street rewarded those moves. The company's stock went from
$23.25 in June 1995 to a high of $72.62 in November 1999. Willes
pledged even more growth, particularly in the highly competitive
Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past 18 months, circulation growth was
disappointing and profits lower than expected. By Friday, the stock
had fallen to $47.94, a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Los Angeles Times was embarrassed by the
disclosure of a revenue-sharing deal with the Staples Center sports
arena. Under the arrangement, the two would share advertising
profits from an issue of the newspaper's Sunday magazine devoted to
the arena opening.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of criticism for the deal fell on Willes' protege,
Times Publisher Kathryn M. Downing, and Editor Michael Parks. Many
saw it as the result of Willes' campaign to break down walls
between business and news departments as a way to build the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Willes said he will leave after the deal is completed. Downing
said she does not intend to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Willes and the Tribune Co.'s new leadership
could help Times employees move beyond the bitterness many still
feel toward management over the Staples Center controversy, Jay
Christensen, an editor in the sports department, said today
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully this will put a close to that whole chapter,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Willes said he was ''totally surprised'' when he first learned
of the negotiations less than two weeks ago, since he believed the
Chandler family trust prevented the paper from being sold or
merged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators worked around that by giving the family four seats
on an expanded 16-member board and 40 percent of the seats on the
Los Angeles Times board. The Chandlers also retain certain special
rights including a say in the selection of the Times publisher.
</P>
<P>
   The merged companies would include 11 daily newspapers, 22
television stations and a combined market value of $11.7 billion,
The New York Times reported in today's editions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Los Angeles Times, Times Mirror publishes
Newsday of Long Island, N.Y.; The Baltimore Sun; The Morning Call
of Allentown, Pa.; and The (Stamford) Advocate, The Hartford
Courant and Greenwich Time, all of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 million people read Times Mirror magazines,
including Field &AMP; Stream, Popular Science, GOLF Magazine, Outdoor
Life, SKI Magazine and SKATEboarding.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune company reported 1999 revenues of $3.2 billion and
has about 13,400 employees. Tribune Broadcasting owns and operates
22 major market television stations and says it reaches more than
75 percent of U.S. television households.
</P>
<P>
   The company also owns and operates four radio stations,
including three stations in Denver and WGN-AM in Chicago. Tribune
Entertainment, a subsidiary, develops and distributes TV
programming.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company owns the Chicago Cubs baseball team.
Tribune Publishing publishes four market-leading newspapers: the
Chicago Tribune, the south Florida-based Sun-Sentinel, The Orlando
Sentinel of Florida and the Newport News, Va.-based Daily Press

<HEADLINE> Aetna plans to split in two, rebuffs takeover bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc., the nation's largest health insurer,
has declined a $10 billion takeover offer and instead announced
plans to split its health care and financial services businesses
into two publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   The troubled insurer will be separated into two independent,
publicly traded companies ''as soon as an orderly separation can be
achieved,'' the Hartford, Conn.-based company's board said in a
statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We strongly believe that the interests of our shareholders,
employees, customers and the communities in which we operate are
well served by this plan and by the additional steps we will be
taking to improve our businesses,'' said William H. Donaldson, who
was named chairman and CEO in a management shakeup last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each of our two core businesses has great potential, and each
will be better able to realize that potential as a separate
company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John G. Rowland talked with Donaldson on Sunday and later
applauded the decision to reject the takeover bid. The governor
also said he thought it was a smart move to split into two
companies.
</P>
<P>
   As for the possibility that corporate headquarters might move
out of Hartford, Rowland said he had been told that the company had
not made any decisions about those issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state will work with the company and offer any help we
can,'' Rowland added.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said Aetna's financial services business, which
sells annuities and other investment vehicles, had little in common
with its health insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long term this is a very logical move,'' Jim Lane, an analyst
with Salomon Smith Barney, said today. ''But it doesn't do a whole
lot for shareholders in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted some investors will be disappointed that Aetna rejected
a $70-a-share takeover bid offered last week from WellPoint Health
Networks Inc., a managed-care company, and ING Group, a Dutch
investment bank and insurer. WellPoint wanted Aetna U.S.
HealthCare, while ING was interested in Aetna's financial services
and international arms.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said Wellpoint-ING would likely have lowered its offer
after getting a look at Aetna's internal financial records. Aetna
probably decided not against the deal because if it opened its
books to Wellpoint-ING it would have lost bargaining leverage, Lane
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's board rejected the offer.
</P>

   ''The financial consideration mentioned in the ING/WellPoint
letter, even if taken at face value, significantly understates the
value of our company and does not reflect the current value or
future potential of our core businesses,'' Donaldson said. ''In
addition, the number of contingencies, substantial execution risk
and other considerations also contributed to the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The offer was received Feb. 24, the day before Aetna chief
executive Richard L. Huber was forced out and replaced by
Donaldson. Donaldson, a board member since 1977, is a co-founder of

   Aetna's stock, which traded as high as $99.88 last May, has been
under pressure as the company foundered due to high medical costs,
lagging profits and controversy over its policies toward patients.
</P>
<P>
   After hovering near its 52-week low of $38.50 for most of
February, the shares soared nearly 30 percent to $59.75 after the
takeover bid was unveiled. Aetna shares have since given back a few
dollars, ending trading Friday at $56.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said Sunday it also plans to sell off international assets
that do not fit with the new strategy, capitalize on Internet
opportunities that leverage Aetna's vast health care information
technology assets, improve its health units' financial performance
and relationships with physicians, hospitals and patients and
accelerate its existing cost-reduction program.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average is down 140
points in today's early going. Losing issues on the New York Stock
Exchange hold a 2-1 over gainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite Index is off 184 points and the Standard &AMP;

virtually all the major overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
   The only item of a fundamental nature for traders was word that
Japan's economy was in worse shape than expected.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, some analysts say the sentiment has turned so
decidedly against the old-line blue-chip stocks that bargain
hunters may soon be able to find some real value in the market amid
the beaten-down issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled in early trading today, following
a steep decline aboard, as technology shares came under intense
selling pressure following the dramatic rise in the sector in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 176.14 at 9,752.68 within
minutes of the opening of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 179.35 at 4,869.27, falling
from the record high reached on Friday. Last week, the Nasdaq rose
133.83 points, a gain of 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 18.24 at 1,376.83.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff began abroad, with financial markets in Asia and
European falling sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the decline was Japan's Nikkei stock average, which fell
2.8 percent after the Japanese government announced the economy
shrank more than expected in the last quarter of 1999. It was the
second consecutive quarter of gross domestic product, meaning the
economy was technically back in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had hoped that an economic recovery in Japan would
compensate for any slowdown in the United States in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in Asian markets set off selling in Europe too. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 4.1 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest selling today came in technology stocks, with many
investors pulling back their holdings amid concern that these
shares have soared too high, too fast in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of chatter of the weekend on the Wall Street
(television) shows about the impending doom of the Nasdaq,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ''The market by virtue of its recent
ascent, especially the Nasdaq, has set itself up for a bit of a
correction.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks tumbled in early trading today on the
heels of a steep decline abroad, as technology shares came under
intense selling pressure following the dramatic rise in the sector
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 144.87 at 4,903.75 in the
opening minutes of trading, falling from the record high reached on
Friday. Shortly after the opening bell, the index fell as much as
209.36 points, a loss of 4.1 percent, before regaining some of the
lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the wave of selling to investors eager to
lock in profits from the Nasdaq's sharp rise this year. The index,
dominated by technology stocks, was up 24 percent as of Friday's
close. Just last week, the Nasdaq rose 133.83 points, a gain of 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, investors found little reason to buy stocks in the
broader market. This morning, the Dow Jones industrial average was
down 80.04 to 9,762.61. The blue-chip index was also regaining
ground after tumbling as much as 190.49 points in early trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 19.54 at 1,375.53.
</P>
<P>

Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 2.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 3.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   European analysts also cited profit-taking, noting that
high-flying media, telecommunications and technology shares were
most severely affected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mondays always seem to have a dampening effect, particularly
after a good week,'' said Ken Joseph, director of European sales
trading at Credit Lyonnais in London.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, technology shares that have performed the best
this year were falling. Qualcomm fell 4| to 131{, JDS Uniphase fell
4\ to 133} and CMGI fell 5 9/16 to 130~.

<HEADLINE> Counsel To File Report on FBI Files  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray will file a
final report this week on the Clinton White House's improper
gathering of hundreds of FBI background files of Republican
appointees, the prosecutor's office announced today.
</P>
<P>
   The report is expected to be the first of three on the various
aspects of the six-year criminal investigation of the president and
the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent reports, all to be sent under seal to a panel of
three federal appeals judges who appointed Ray and predecessor
Kenneth Starr, will deal with the role of first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton in the purge of the White House travel office and the
Clintons Whitewater dealings.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said
''we have been through six years and $60 million'' worth of
investigations. ''It's certainly our hope that they report out in a
way that's done quickly ... that's consistent with the statute and
done without regard to politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers outside Ray's office described the plan for reporting on
the probe of the Clintons. ''The FBI files investigation has been
concluded'' and ''we intend to issue a report to the special
division under seal later this week,'' Ray said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's predecessor investigated the FBI files controversy, which
stemmed from an Army detailee at the White House, Anthony Marceca,
gathering FBI files on hundreds of Republican appointees from prior
administrations. The detailee's boss, White House security director
Craig Livingstone, resigned under fire. Marceca and Livingstone
were long-time political operatives for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca said that in some instances he passed on ''derogatory''
information from the files to Livingstone. Livingstone said he was
aware that Marceca was gathering FBI files, but knew no details.
</P>
<P>
   The president apologized for the file-gathering, calling it ''an
honest bureaucratic mess-up'' and saying ''I would never condone or
tolerate any kind of enemies list.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential aides said the FBI files were stored in a secure
vault and never used, blaming the Secret Service for providing
outdated lists of White House passholders -- which Livingstone's
office then relied on to order the background files from the FBI.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- While her mom stays home to campaign, Chelsea
Clinton will accompany her dad, President Clinton, to India,
Bangladesh and Pakistan on a trip beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Chelsea's second trip to South Asia. She went to
India and Pakistan with her mother, Hillary Rodham Clinton, on a
goodwill visit in April 1995. This time, the first lady will remain
behind to run for the Senate in New York. Chelsea will have time
off for spring break at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said Chelsea would not
be the first lady's stand-in at official events.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what she'll do but she'll serve the role she
normally serves as the president's daughter,'' Lockhart said.

   Aetna To Split Into Two Companies
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna Inc., the nation's largest health insurer,
has rejected a $10 billion takeover offer and instead plans to
split its health care and financial services businesses into two
publicly traded companies. Its stock skidded 13 percent in early
trading, dropping $7.12{ to $48.87{ a share today on the New York
Stock Exchange. Aetna, troubled by rising medical costs, several
class action lawsuits and cold relations with doctors and
hospitals, said it plans to make the split into two companies by

The transaction creates the nation's third-largest newspaper

Times Mirror voting shares, initiated the negotiations and supports
the deal, the paper said.

said today. The pair of breeding white-bellied sea eagles weren't
even discovered until the officials began their assessment of the

noise won't bother them.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- A fare increase of up to $40 per roundtrip

time in as many months that Continental has led bids to raise
fares, blaming soaring jet fuel prices. In January, Continental led
the industry with a $20 hike. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines
said yesterday they have matched Continental's latest increase.
Northwest Airlines matched in certain markets.

   Japan's Economy Back Into Recession
</P>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Flagging domestic consumption drove Japan's economy
back into recession late last year, puncturing hopes for a quick
recovery from the deepest slump since World War II. Gross domestic
product, the total value of goods and services, fell 1.4 percent in
the October-December quarter, while private consumption dropped a
steep 1.6 percent, the Economic Planning Agency said today. It was
the second consecutive quarter of GDP decline, meaning the economy
was officially back in recession after anemic growth fueled by a
massive government spending binge last year.

<HEADLINE> Tribune Co. to take over Times Mirror   </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL WHITE, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tribune Co. will acquire Times Mirror Co. in
a $6.46 billion deal that would create a multimedia empire
encompassing the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and 22
television stations, ending a family dynasty that dates back to
1882.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction creates the nation's third-largest newspaper
company and marks the end of Times Mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandler family, which has controlled the Times for 118
years and owns a majority of Times Mirror voting shares, initiated
the negotiations and supports the deal, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   Both papers announced the deal with front-page headlines today.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tribune Co. is the single best strategic partner for Times
Mirror,'' said Warren B. Williamson, chairman of the Chandler
Trust, which represents the family's interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The new company would boast a daily newspaper circulation of 3.6
million, by the Tribune's count. That would make it the nation's
third-largest newspaper company, trailing Gannett Co. Inc. and
Knight Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   The company would have 11 daily newspapers, 22 television
stations, magazines such as Popular Science, and four radio
stations. Internet sites operated by the company are expected to
earn $55 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our company will be the best positioned local market media
company for the future,'' John W. Madigan, chairman, president and
chief executive of the Tribune Co., said. ''National scale and
local depth across media will drive our top line growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal, approved by Times Mirror directors late Sunday night,
still must be approved by shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Communications Commission approval is not required, even
though Tribune Co. would gain Times Mirror newspapers in cities
where it already operates television stations, the companies said
in a joint news release.
</P>
<P>
   Under FCC policy, merging media companies can own a newspaper
and television station in the same city until the next license
renewal date. Tribune-owned stations in Los Angeles and Hartford,
Conn. -- the home of Times Mirror's The Hartford Courant, are not up
for renewal until 2006. Tribune Co.'s station in New York, where
Times Mirror operates Newsday, is up for renewal in 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the cross-ownership rule has not been modified by that
time, a waiver would be needed,'' the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the deal did not involve competitive bidding for Times
Mirror, it includes a provision under which other bidders have 20
calendar days to top the Tribune Co.'s offer, the Times said in
Monday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the takeover, Times Mirror shareholders will have a choice
of taking $95 per share from Tribune Co. -- nearly twice the stock's
recent value -- or exchanging each of their Times Mirror shares for
2.5 shares of Tribune Co. stock. The Tribune Co. also will assume
about $1.4 billion in debt, the Times reported.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune Co. would control operations from its Chicago
headquarters and Madigan would head the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Times reporters today said they were surprised by the merger and
uncertain about the impact.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very unsettled feeling,'' said Carlos Selva, a reporter
with the Los Angeles Times-Washington Post news service. ''As for
me, I won't know until I get more details.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed sale follows five years of dramatic changes at
Times Mirror under the stewardship of its chief executive, Mark H.
Willes. After arriving in spring 1995, he closed The Baltimore
Evening Sun and New York Newsday and sold off assets that
substantially trimmed the company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street rewarded those moves. The company's stock went from
$23.25 in June 1995 to a high of $72.62 in November 1999. Willes
pledged even more growth, particularly in the highly competitive
Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past 18 months, circulation growth was
disappointing and profits lower than expected. By Friday, the stock
had fallen to $47.94, a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Los Angeles Times was embarrassed by the
disclosure of a revenue-sharing deal with the Staples Center sports
arena. Under the arrangement, the two would share advertising
profits from an issue of the newspaper's Sunday magazine devoted to
the arena opening.
</P>
<P>
   The brunt of criticism for the deal fell on Willes' protege,
Times Publisher Kathryn M. Downing, and Editor Michael Parks. Many
saw it as the result of Willes' campaign to break down walls
between business and news departments as a way to build the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Willes said he will leave after the deal is completed. Downing
said she does not intend to resign.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Willes and the Tribune Co.'s new leadership
could help Times employees move beyond the bitterness many still
feel toward management over the Staples Center controversy, Jay
Christensen, an editor in the sports department, said today.
''Hopefully this will put a close to that whole chapter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Willes said he was ''totally surprised'' when he first learned
of the negotiations less than two weeks ago, since he believed the
Chandler family trust prevented the paper from being sold or
merged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators worked around that by giving the family four seats
on an expanded 16-member board and 40 percent of the seats on the
Los Angeles Times board. The Chandlers also retain certain special
rights including a say in the selection of the Times publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Los Angeles Times, The (Baltimore) Sun and the
Courant, Times Mirror publishes Newsday of Long Island, N.Y.; The
Morning Call of Allentown, Pa.; and The (Stamford) Advocate and
Greenwich Time, both of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 million people read Times Mirror magazines,
including Field &AMP; Stream, Popular Science, GOLF Magazine, Outdoor
Life, SKI Magazine and SKATEboarding.
</P>
<P>
   The Tribune company reported 1999 revenues of $3.2 billion and
has about 13,400 employees. Tribune Broadcasting owns and operates
22 major market television stations and says it reaches more than
75 percent of U.S. television households.
</P>
<P>
   The company also owns and operates four radio stations,
including three stations in Denver and WGN-AM in Chicago. Tribune
Entertainment, a subsidiary, develops and distributes TV
programming. In addition, the company owns the Chicago Cubs
baseball team.

<HEADLINE> Shalikashvili Boosts Test Ban Pact  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former U.S. military chief John Shalikashvili
said today he would try to allay the concerns of opponents of the
worldwide ban on nuclear weapons tests in a drive to gain approval
of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the feelings are very deeply held,'' Shalikashvili
said at a news conference designed to drum up support for the
treaty that won the support of only 48 senators, 19 short of the
required 67, last October.
</P>
<P>
   The former Army general, appointed by Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in January to lobby Senate foes, said he would
consider all options short of those that would require
renegotiating terms of the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that the world understand we are trying to
bridge differences,'' Shalikashvili said.
</P>
<P>
   Rejection of the treaty was a major foreign policy setback for
President Clinton and his administration. Opponents argued
safeguards against cheating by other countries were inadequate and
that the United States had to continue testing to keep its nuclear
arsenal up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said passage was a foreign policy priority and that the
treaty was ''too important to abandon.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has conceded, however, it could not gain
approval this year, its last. The drive is geared to next year,
when Clinton will have left office.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not about politics or the legacy of a particular
administration,'' Shalikashvili said.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the likely Republican presidential candidate,
has said he would oppose the treaty while supporting a continuing
U.S. voluntary ban on nuclear weapons tests. Ratification would
force the United States to conduct foreign policy ''with one arm
tied behind its back,'' Bush has said.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic candidate, called
the vote against ratification ''breathtakingly irresponsible.'' He
is certain to support Senate approval if he wins.
</P>
<P>
   Shalikashvili was one of a number of U.S. military chiefs whose
support for the treaty was cited by the Clinton administration in
its bid for ratification.
</P>
<P>
   He and Albright said they hoped that with more time to consider
the issues the treaty might be approved. ''It's too early to
tell,'' Shalikashvili said.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stumbles on Selloff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks edged back from a steep early decline
today, but remained mostly lower in the wake of a widespread
decline abroad. Technology shares came under intense selling
pressure following the dramatic rise in the sector in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 98.27 at 4,950.35 at late
morning, falling from the record high of 5,048.62 reached on
Friday. Shortly after the opening bell, the index fell as much as
209.36 points, a loss of 4.1 percent, before regaining much of the
lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the wave of selling to investors eager to
lock in profits from the Nasdaq's sharp rise this year. The index,
dominated by technology stocks, was up 24 percent as of Friday's
close. Just last week, the Nasdaq rose 133.83 points, a gain of 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other market indicators were also lower, although their declines
were more modest. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 8.14 to
9,920.68 at midday, having recovered from a loss of as much as
190.49 points, or 1.9 percent, within minutes of the opening of
trading.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 9.28 at 1,385.79. The
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 9.37 at 594.44.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing the reflection of investors' nervousness, but
overall, the outlook remains strong,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff began abroad, with financial markets in Asia and
European falling sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the decline was Japan's Nikkei stock average, which fell
2.8 percent after the Japanese government announced the economy
shrank more than expected in the last quarter of 1999. It was the
second consecutive quarterly decline of the gross domestic product,
meaning the economy was technically back in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had hoped that an economic recovery in Japan would
compensate for any slowdown in the United States in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in Asian markets set off selling in Europe too.
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.6 percent, Germany's Xetra DAX index
fell 3.5 percent and France's CAC-40 fell 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   European analysts also cited profit-taking, noting that
high-flying media, telecommunications and technology shares were
most severely affected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mondays always seem to have a dampening effect, particularly
after a good week,'' said Ken Joseph, director of European sales
trading at Credit Lyonnais in London.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, technology shares that have performed the best
this year were falling. Qualcomm fell 4 5/16 to 131 13/16, Oracle
fell 3 3/16 to 78 7/16 and CMGI fell 3{ to 132 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of chatter of the weekend on the Wall Street
(television) shows about the impending doom of the Nasdaq,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ''The market by virtue of its recent
ascent, especially the Nasdaq, has set itself up for a bit of a
correction.''
</P>
<P>
   A few high-profile technology stocks were higher today. Intel
rose 3| to 123 13/16, helping the Dow contain its losses.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, soared 35 5/16
to 83\ on the New York Stock Exchange after Tribune Co., publisher
of the Chicago Tribune, agreed to acquire it for $6.46 billion. The
combined company would have 11 daily newspapers, 22 television
stations, magazines such as Popular Science, and four radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune shares fell 7~ to 29 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume was moderate, with 471.29 million shares changing
hands at midday, compared with 555.39 at the same time on Friday.
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-5 margin on the NYSE and
by a 7-to-3 margin on the Nasdaq.

<HEADLINE> Customs Cracking Down on Ecstasy  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Customs Service is taking steps to crack
down on trafficking in Ecstasy as record amounts of the
hallucinogenic drug popular with teen-agers pour into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ecstasy has rapidly become a major concern for Customs,''
Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said today in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has created a task force to coordinate all cases
dealing with the drug and is training 13 drug-detection dogs to
specifically sniff out the drug.
</P>
<P>
   And, Kelly posted a message on Custom's Web site seeking to
educate parents and young people about the drug and its dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new measures we're taking are designed to keep the Ecstasy
problem from becoming a full-fledged epidemic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Oct. 1, Customs has seized nearly 4 million doses of the
drug -- an all-time high, officials said. For fiscal year 1999,
which ended Sept. 30, Customs inspectors confiscated 3 million
doses of the drug and in the 1998 fiscal year, they seized 750,000
doses.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe -- where many of the tablets come from -- the drug costs
just a few pennies a piece to make, Kelly said. But once the
tablets are sold in the United States, they can fetch $20 to $40
each, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of this profit margin, international crime groups have
become heavily involved in the Ecstasy trade,'' Kelly said. ''These
syndicates are capable of smuggling huge quantities of Ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs said the drug is popular among teen-agers, especially
those who frequent nightclubs and all-night techno-dance parties
known as ''raves.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas remain the primary venues for raves, Customs said.
But raves are also creeping up in suburban and rural communities--
and with those parties comes the illegal use of Ecstasy, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy's users usually experience feelings of euphoria and an
increased desire to interact socially, Customs said. Blood
pressure, heart rate and body temperature increase dramatically.
Other physical symptoms include involuntary teeth-grinding and
dehydration.

<HEADLINE> '50s Singer Battles King Book  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) -- More than 40 years after his first
brush with fame, Joe Bennett's not sure he wants this one.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephen King's latest book, ''Hearts in Atlantis,'' the
author includes lyrics from the 1957 song ''Black Slacks'' by
Bennett's group, the Sparkletones.
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett, a devout member of the Mormon Church, objects to
what he says is King's explicit and offensive language in the book.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to seem pious, but this is absolutely not
endorsed by me,'' he said. ''That's the bottom line. This is just
shock stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The song helped the group earn two slots on the Ed Sullivan Show
and was recorded by Simon &AMP; Garfunkel. The rights are owned by MCA,
which got $10,000 from King last year to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett didn't know the song was in the book until he got a
royalty statement last month. He asked King in a letter not to use
it again, ''but if he wants to, we don't have any legal ground to
stand on.''

<HEADLINE> Michael Jackson Cancels Poland Trip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Michael Jackson canceled a visit to Poland
this week after negotiations stalled on his proposed theme park,
but he still hopes to purse the project, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite calling off the trip, the pop star ''would like to
confirm his interest in Warsaw and hopes that his investment plans
will eventually come to fruition,'' said a statement issued by his
spokeswoman, Elizabeth Singler Mather, and Andrzej Machowski, a
spokesman for Warsaw's mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Pawel Piskorski invited Jackson for a two-day visit that
was to have started Tuesday. It was believed Jackson was to look at
possible sites for his planned family oriented theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson signed a letter of intent with Warsaw officials in 1997
to develop the $500 million park, but the two sides have not agreed
on a location.

<HEADLINE> BUSINESS SPOTLIGHT: Comcast digital cable battles satellite TV  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- As cable and satellite companies scramble
for viewers, the nation's third-largest cable provider hopes a
fast-growing digital service will make sure customers want dishes
only on the dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast Cable, a key player in mergers that reshaped the
telecommunications industry in the past year, is battling to stay
among the leaders by marketing 185-channel digital cable TV to
compete with the hundreds of channels satellite TV can offer.
</P>
<P>
   More than 550,000 customers have signed up for the digital
service, which nearly doubles the channels regular cable offers,
and lets them flip through new choices including 10 HBO channels
and 40 CD-quality, commercial-free music channels.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a product which is competitive with satellite,'' Stephen
B. Burke, president of Comcast Cable, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Burke said upgrading cable lines for digital service also helps
in the competition over whether other communications services reach
homes through cable TV lines, digital subscriber phone lines or
satellite dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast is already marketing Comcast@Home Internet access on
systems it has upgraded with fiber-optic lines, offering download
speeds up to 100 times faster than on dial-up connections.
Comcast@Home subscribers more than doubled last year to about
150,000.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, customers also will be able to make phone
calls over Comcast cable lines, predicted Burke, who worked at The
Walt Disney Co. as president of ABC Broadcasting before joining
Comcast in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And consumers will expect all those capabilities as
telecommunications companies move toward ''bundled'' services and
billing packages, said Jeffrey Kagan, an industry analyst based
outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumer service providers can't afford to be boxed into the
corner selling just one service. That's why they are all expanding
their core businesses. If they don't, they can't compete for a
growing universe of customers who are interested in buying multiple
services from one provider,'' Kagan said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year brought big expansion for Comcast, though it was
outbid for the No. 4 cable company, MediaOne, by AT&AMP;T. AT&AMP;T became
the leading cable company, controlling connections to 25 million
homes, followed by Time Warner with about 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   A strong No. 3, Comcast, which started 1999 with 4.5 million
customers, projects that it will finish this year with more than
8.2 million. Comcast has 1.16 million customers in New Jersey, and
operates in every county except Passaic and Sussex.
</P>
<P>
   The company has also been successful in the scramble for
telecommunications content, which is just as intense as the race
for customers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the merger by AOL, the largest Internet company,
with Time Warner was as important for bringing big-name content
sources such as Time magazine, Warner Bros. studios, CNN and HBO
into the AOL fold as for adding cable TV lines to deliver
high-speed Internet service to homes.
</P>
<P>
   Comcast has a two-thirds share in Comcast-Spectacor, owner of
the Philadelphia Flyers hockey team and Philadelphia 76ers
basketball team, and a 40 percent share of E! Entertainment
Television.
</P>
<P>
   Helping its bottom line, along with cable-division revenues that
rose 9 percent to more than $3 billion last year, were revenues
from its QVC shopping-channel subsidiary that jumped 19 percent to
$2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The growth makes the Philadelphia-based company ''a key player
in the consolidating and rapidly converging telecommunications
landscape,'' according to an analysis by Jessica Reif Cohen, an
analyst for Merrill Lynch. ''We believe Comcast will continue to be
a consolidator.''
</P>
<P>
   Comcast is actively pursuing more merger and expansion
opportunities, Burke confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are big enough now so that we can compete effectively. This
is a business we believe in and we would like to get bigger,'' he
said, though he wouldn't name any potential merger partners.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Burke said about one in 10 customers now opts
for the digital cable TV service, which adds $9.95 a month to a
regular cable bill.
</P>
<P>
   More than 550,000 customers have signed up since the service was
introduced in a few areas in July 1998, and Comcast officials
predict the number will top 1 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can get this without having to buy a dish, without having
to have somebody come to your house and get up on your roof and
install the dish, and it's $10 a month,'' said Burke.
</P>
<P>
   He wielded a big digital-cable remote control, a couch-potato's
dream with buttons to do everything but run to the kitchen for
chips. It will be able to order pizza, as interactive TV and online
capabilities grow.
</P>
<P>
   Viewers can scroll up and down through the channel guide instead
of just watching it roll by, and Burke counted 56 movies available
on a recent afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, digital cable boxes will come with a hard
drive that increases the system's flexibility, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's 56 movies, but not all available when I want to
watch,'' said Burke. ''In the future you will be able to watch
'Sour Grapes' on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What people want is more choice,'' he said. ''They want the
ability to have a movie when they want it, they want the ability to
stop the movie. In the future, you will be able to get a movie
exactly when you want it.''

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Genocide Trial Opens  </HEADLINE>
By JEROME SOCOLOVSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Calling it a ''triumph of evil,''
U.N. prosecutors showed footage of meadows filled with corpses and
bones decaying in mass graves as the trial opened Monday of the
highest-ranking Serb to go before a tribunal on genocide charges.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnian Serb Gen. Radislav Krstic is charged in Europe's
bloodiest massacre since World War II: the July 1995 slaughter of
at least 7,500 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica, a U.N.-declared
demilitarized zone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The manner in which these people perished and the scale of
this atrocity is truly incomprehensible by every standard of
humanity,'' said prosecutor Mark Harmon, a former unit chief in the
U.S. Justice Department. ''This is a case about the triumph of
evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The massacre at Srebrenica, Bosnia has come to symbolize the
terrifying tragedy of 1992-1995 Bosnian war's ''ethnic cleansing''
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution witness Jean Rene Ruez set the scene for the U.N.
war crimes tribunal. The French forensics expert narrated a film of
refugees being crowded into a U.N. compound in Srebrenica and
receiving assurances of safety from the Serbs, ''to make sure that
they would go like 'organized cattle''' to their deaths, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon showed the three-judge panel harrowing photographs of the
mass graves where the refugees ended up.
</P>
<P>
   A skull was still wrapped in a blindfold in one exhumed grave.
In another, the victim's wrists were tied with wire. Investigators
led by Ruez have exhumed 1,800 corpses over five years, and believe
2,500 more are still buried.
</P>
<P>
   Krstic, who commanded the Bosnian Serb army's Drina corps during
the war, is charged with every crime under the judges'
jurisdiction: genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and
grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions.
</P>
<P>
   He has pleaded innocent. Conviction would bring a maximum life
prison term. The U.N. court has no death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Almiro Simoes Rodriques of Portugal, Fuad Riad of Egypt
and Patricia Wald of Washington, D.C. listened as Harmon described
the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Over a period of about five days, thousands of Bosnian Muslim
civilians and Bosnian Muslim soldiers who had laid down their arms
were systematically murdered by members of the Bosnian Serb army,''
Harmon said.
</P>
<P>
   Those who tried to hide, he said, ''were hunted down with dogs
and slaughtered.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb offensive against Srebrenica was designed to wipe out
the Muslim population of an enclave deep inside an area of Bosnia
that the Serb leadership saw as strategically vital.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces ordered a Dutch peacekeeping battalion of 150
soldiers to stand aside and embarked on a campaign of extermination
and deportation. Muslim men were bused to execution sites, homes
burned and the main mosque razed. Women and children were
transferred to Muslim-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   Before the campaign, Srebrenica had been three-quarters Muslim
and one-quarter Serb. Ironically, the operation made it easier for
peacemakers to draw a map that was acceptable to all the warring
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being watched intently in Bosnia, particularly by
the bereaved wives, mothers, sisters and daughters of Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, they cannot forget or forgive Krstic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wish him a death penalty, for him to disappear from the
face of the earth,'' said Nedziba Salihovic, who lost her husband,
son, father, brother and 26 other male relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Kada Hotic, who lost two brothers, added: ''If he would have 10
lives, all 10 should be taken from him for all the horror he
caused. Life imprisonment would be a reward for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia
was established by the United Nations in 1993. So far, 14 Serbs,
Muslims and Croats have been convicted of atrocities and given
sentences of up to 45 years.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer: Lebanese Leader Assaulted  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- A Lebanese guerrilla leader sued Israel for
$1.5 million in damages Monday, saying Israeli soldiers raped and
tortured him in an effort to extract information about a missing
airman.
</P>
<P>
   The army spokesman's office said in a statement that the army
was not familiar with the allegations and that it would examine the
lawsuit when it receives it.
</P>
<P>
   Israel abducted Mustafa Dirani -- head of a small pro-Iranian
militia, the Believers' Resistance -- from south Lebanon in May 1994
in an attempt to win the release of Ron Arad, an air force
navigator captured in Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Dirani charged in his suit, filed in the Tel Aviv District
Court, that Israeli soldiers tortured him in the month after his
kidnapping. Dirani was beaten, violently shaken, deprived of sleep
and photographed naked, said his Israeli attorney, Zvi Rish.
</P>
<P>
   The detainee was raped by a soldier brought in especially for
the purpose in the presence of other soldiers, the suit said.
Later, according to the suit, the head of the interrogation team
sodomized Dirani with a broomstick, leaving him with severe
hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
   Rish said Dirani first hinted at the rape in a conversation
several weeks ago, and needed to be persuaded to file the
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The Shin Bet security service is usually responsible for
interrogating security prisoners. However, lawmaker Gideon Ezra,
who was a senior Shin Bet official at the time of the alleged rape,
said it was soldiers who interrogated Dirani in the first month
after his capture.
</P>
<P>
   Tomer Feffer, spokesman for the Israeli human rights group
Betselem, said that his organization knew of a few cases in the
last 10 years in which Shin Bet and army interrogators sexually
assaulted prisoners, but never a case of rape.
</P>
<P>
   Dirani was security chief of the Shiite Muslim Amal militia when
the militia captured Arad. Dirani later formed his own group, the
Believers' Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 21 Lebanese citizens have been held in Israel for
long periods as bargaining chips to trade for Arad. Five of the
Lebanese were freed in December. The Tel Aviv District Court has
twice ordered the release of the others, but the state appealed to
the Supreme Court, which has yet to rule.
</P>
<P>
   Arad was captured alive, but has not been heard from in more
than a decade.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tribune Co. will acquire Times Mirror Co. in
a $6.46 billion deal that would create a multimedia empire
encompassing the Los Angeles Times, the Chicago Tribune and 22
television stations, ending a family dynasty that dates to 1882.
The transaction creates the nation's third-largest newspaper
company and marks the end of Times Mirror. The Chandler family,

Times Mirror voting shares, initiated the negotiations and supports
the deal, the paper said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government is developing plans to

working on rules that would create a trading system in which
telecommunications companies could bid on frequencies that are

The Nasdaq composite index was down 71.04 at 4,977.58 in late

NY City Opera Opens Season   
An AP Entertainment Review, 
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- When George Gershwin's ''Porgy and Bess''
premiered in 1935, it was in a Broadway theater. Now, it is
accepted, and loved, as an opera.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Opera has opened its spring season with 14
shows of ''Porgy,'' using two casts and interspersing a few
performances of ''Tosca.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, the dynamic performers at the New York State
Theater included Marquita Lister, who first starred in this
splendid production in London. Her textured voice radiated Bess'
love for Porgy, as opposed to lust for Crown or for Sportin' Life's
powdered dope. Her entrance in a sexy red dress was a show stopper.
</P>
<P>
   Alvy Powell used his rich bass-baritone to convey the crippled
Porgy's moral strength and love for Bess. ''Bess, You Is My Woman
Now'' is the high point of the opera, and this rendition was no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Crown, the sexy bully, is often sung by a large man, but
medium-sized Timothy Robert Blevins used his muscled torso and
arms, his swagger and his take-charge baritone voice to fine
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how familiar the score may be, its beauty never ceases
to surprise. Chorus numbers are exquisite, conveying a strong sense
of community on Catfish Row, whether in mending fishing nets or
confronting white authority.
</P>
<P>
   As the opera began, greetings sounded strained; then voices
warmed up. Anita Johnson as Clara floated a lovely ''Summertime.''
Angela Simpson as the earth-mother-like Serena had star quality.
Her powerful ''My Man's Gone Now'' received lavish and
well-deserved applause.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Floyd as Jake, who sang ''A Woman Is a Sometime Thing,''
didn't always have the necessary volume. Dwayne Clark had Sportin'
Life's voluptuous moves mastered but not quite the voice to match.
The pushcart salesmen, Strawberry Woman and Crab Man, are always a
brief high point in the opera, and Adina Aaron and Duane Martin
Foster didn't disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   The cast was the same as on opening night Thursday. Lister,
Powell, Blevins and Simpson were making debuts with the New York
City Opera, as were the conductor, director and set designer.
</P>
<P>
   John DeMain conducted with affection for the music. Tazewell
Thompson directed and Douglas W. Schmidt designed the effective
set. Three three-story buildings made up Catfish Row. The center
one rotated to become the setting for a wake and gathering place
during a hurricane. Buildings glided away and were replaced by
trees for the picnic.
</P>
<P>
   The last performance is March 25.

<HEADLINE> DNA Match May Crack Old Murder Case  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Prosecutors on Monday said they
cracked a 21-year-old murder case, connecting a robber to the
stabbing through New York state's newly expanded DNA database.
</P>
<P>
   A DNA match linked Walter Gill to the death of Diane Gregory
''like the finger of God pointing down and saying, 'You can't get
away with it no matter how long it's been,''' said District
Attorney Jeanine Pirro.
</P>
<P>
   The second-degree murder charge against Gill, 49, was the first
to be brought as a result of the 1999 state law that expanded the
state's database on criminals, adding robbery to the offenses
requiring a convict to submit a DNA sample, Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   Gill, 49, is serving a 10-to-20 year robbery sentence and would
have been eligible for parole in May 2001. If convicted of murder,
he could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Gregory case was reopened after the victim's family
questioned if DNA technology could be applied to blood found near
the 22-year-old's apartment that police suspected came from the
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Gill had been a suspect in the August 1979 murder, but police
never had enough evidence to get a court order for a blood sample.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, he submitted a sample in January, and some of
the blood from the murder scene matched Gill's profile, Pirro said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appeared that he knew when the blood was taken that sooner
or later he'd be caught,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory's daughter, Lakisha Gregory, who was 2 when her mother
was killed, said through tears: ''I'm very happy. I'm just very
upset that I didn't have a mother to grow up with.''
</P>
<P>
   The break in the case lends support to a proposal to require DNA
samples from almost anyone convicted of a state crime, Gov. George
Pataki said. That pending bill, backed by the governor, would add
an estimated 120,000 samples to the databank each year.

<HEADLINE> Hajj Puts Preparations To Test  </HEADLINE>
By BASSEM MROUE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MECCA, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Thousands of security officers
patrolled the holy city of Mecca on Monday to smooth the way for
the annual Muslim pilgrimage that is expected to attract more than
2 million faithful from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to confirm that security personnel will be able
to carry out their duties in an excellent way,'' Interior Minister
Prince Nayef said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The hajj, an annual pilgrimage to Muslim holy sites that begins
Wednesday, tests Saudi Arabia's organizational competence and its
ability to avert the kinds of tragedies that have marred the hajj
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990 1,426 people were killed inside a tunnel leading to the
holy sites. In 1997, 343 people died in a fire that broke out in a
tent camp, apparently when some pilgrims were cooking. And in 1994,
270 people were killed in a stampede.
</P>
<P>
   Tragedy has already struck some this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian and Palestinian officials said six of their elderly
pilgrims died last week after being caught in a massive crush of
people at the Grand Mosque, Islam's holiest shrine, in Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Nayef, however, said only two people died, and that was
because of heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, more than 400 people, most of them Iranians, were
killed when Saudi authorities clashed with Iranians staging
anti-American demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Nayef said authorities do not expect demonstrations
during this hajj and ''we hope that our pilgrim brothers will feel
responsible like we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Aided by surveillance cameras, security personnel in the
traditional white Saudi robes will mingle with pilgrims, directing
them to exits and trying to ensure everything goes smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9,100 doctors, nurses, technicians and administrators
from different parts of Saudi Arabia will be working in hospitals
and medical centers during the pilgrimage, officials said. The
Saudi Red Crescent Society also will deploy 300 ambulances and
three helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   At the Ajyad hospital across the street from the Grand Mosque,
some 8,000 pilgrims are treated every day during the hajj, nearly
double the number of people who visit in normal days, the
hospital's Director General Dr. Mohammed Saleh Abdullah Habbash
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We treat whoever comes, for free. The Health Ministry has
supported the hospital with medical personnel from all over the
country,'' Habbash said.

<HEADLINE> Gays, lesbians try to keep ''Dr. Laura'' television show off theair  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Enmeshed in a bitter battle with gay rights
activists, radio talk show host Laura Schlessinger is about to find
out whether the show biz adage about any publicity being good
publicity is really true.
</P>
<P>
   The tough-talking ''Dr. Laura,'' who dispenses relationship
advice on her enormously popular radio show, is being criticized
for calling homosexuality a ''biological error'' and ''deviant.''
</P>
<P>
   Gays and lesbians upset about her comments have targeted the
''Dr. Laura'' television show that begins this fall. The anti-Laura
campaign is aimed at convincing her syndicator, Paramount, not to
distribute the TV show and stations not to broadcast it.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the television business suspect the effort may backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, I don't think it has had any effect except to
make the general public aware that she is doing a television talk
show, which they might not have been ... if this hadn't been in the
headlines,'' said Bill Carroll, an expert on TV syndication for the
Katz Television Group.
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the stations signed on to air ''Dr. Laura'' have
backed out. Paramount has also stood firm. But the campaign is
continuing despite Schlessinger's attempt to put out the fire with
an apology Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has said she doesn't hate gays, but that homosexual
activity runs counter to her religious beliefs. She supports
therapy for gays who want to change their sexual orientation, an
insulting concept for many homosexuals who believe that is an
attempt to change nature.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Klein, a spokesman for the Web site, www.stopdrlaura.com,
calls Schlessinger a homophobe and believes her remarks breed
intolerance. He says a double standard protects her at a time
baseball star John Rocker is widely condemned for racially and
ethnically insensitive remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're seeing is this idea that homophobia and anti-gay
bigotry is somehow less important than racism and other kinds of
bigotry,'' Klein said, ''and that's not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Schlessinger has lashed out at her critics, likening their
threats to terrorism. ''This guy Alan Klein and his Web site, this
is fascism,'' she said on her radio show.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Schlessinger said she's sorry that words
she used in a clinical context have hurt people. She said she did
not want others to use her words to disparage homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Klein called the apology ''hollow and half-hearted'' and said it
was ''a last-ditch attempt to save a multimillion-dollar
syndication deal'' by her and Paramount. He said a protest rally
scheduled for March 21 outside Paramount's headquarters is still
on.
</P>
<P>
   Some gay rights activists who don't like Schlessinger also don't
like the campaign against her show.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one thing to protest, to raise voices,'' said Bill Dobbs,
a member of Queer Watch. ''It's another thing to call for her show
to be knocked off the air before it is even broadcast. Too many gay
and lesbian people have been silenced over the years to use that
tactic.''
</P>
<P>
   KPIX-TV in San Francisco, which plans to run ''Dr. Laura,'' has
been deluged by calls and e-mails urging it to back out. The
station is keeping a close watch on the situation, said Jerry
Eaton, vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been talking to Paramount a lot about the show,'' Eaton
said. ''We're not going to support a show that denigrates any
individual or espouses hate or intolerance. We're seeking their
assurances that the show is not going to have those elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount executives aren't speaking publicly beyond issuing two
statements. They haven't even said much about the show's format,
and how close it will be to what Schlessinger does on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''In many respects, controversy is a positive,'' said Richard
Kurlander, a specialist on the syndication market for the ad firm
Petry Television. ''I'm sure Paramount -- if they would admit to it,
and I'm sure they won't -- would rather have this controversy take
place in September.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when ''Dr. Laura'' is scheduled to debut on stations seen
by more than 90 percent of the nation's television viewers.
</P>
<P>
   The market for new syndicated talk shows is tough right now --
the last clear hit was ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' four years ago
-- but ''Dr. Laura'' may have a better shot than most.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount did an effective job of getting out early and selling
the show to stations, Kurlander said. It's on CBS affiliates in
several big cities, which is a plus since CBS has been the
top-rated network in daytime for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The competition also appears to be thinning out; experts
anticipate talk shows by Roseanne, Martin Short, Leeza Gibbons and
Joy Browne won't be back in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Working against Schlessinger is the format's relative weakness.
Daytime chat ratings have been down over the past couple of years,
with courtroom shows like ''Judge Judy'' the hot format.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she has a legitimate shot,'' Kurlander said. ''I don't
think it's a sure bet by any stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   If the show's chances are somehow enhanced by a campaign aimed
at stopping it, well, Klein can live with that.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always a risk,'' he said. ''But the converse is
completely unacceptable and that is to not speak up. A community
that is silent loses its power.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Cut Losses Late in Session  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks narrowed their losses in late trading
today, shaking off the remnants of a steep decline in foreign
markets. In a reversal of recent fortunes, blue-chip stocks were up
while technology shares fell.
</P>
<P>
   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the
Nasdaq composite index was down 78.55 at 4,970.07, off the record
high of 5,048.62 reached on Friday. Shortly after the opening bell,
the index fell as much as 209.36 points, a loss of 4.1 percent,
before regaining much of the lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the wave of selling to investors eager to
lock in profits from the Nasdaq's sharp rise this year. The index,
dominated by technology stocks, was up 24 percent as of Friday's
close. Just last week, the Nasdaq rose 133.83 points, a gain of 2.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Other market indicators were mixed. The Dow Jones industrial
average was up 25.60 to 9,954.42, having recovered from a loss of
as much as 190.49 points, or 1.9 percent, within minutes of the
opening of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 9.78 at 1,385.29. The
Russell 2000 index of smaller companies was down 6.72 at 597.09.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing the reflection of investors' nervousness, but
overall, the outlook remains strong,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell steeply at the opening bell, after financial markets
in Asia and Europe dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the decline was Japan's Nikkei stock average, which fell
2.8 percent after the Japanese government announced the economy
shrank more than expected in the last quarter of 1999. It was the
second consecutive quarterly decline of the gross domestic product,
meaning the economy was technically back in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had hoped that an economic recovery in Japan would
compensate for any slowdown in the United States in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in Asian markets set off selling in Europe too.
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.5 percent, Germany's Xetra DAX index
fell 3.5 percent and France's CAC-40 fell 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   European analysts also cited profit-taking, noting that
high-flying media, telecommunications and technology shares were
most severely affected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mondays always seem to have a dampening effect, particularly
after a good week,'' said Ken Joseph, director of European sales
trading at Credit Lyonnais in London.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, technology shares that have performed the best
this year were falling. Qualcomm fell 4| to 131{, Oracle fell 1
3/16 to 80 7/16 and 3Com fell 4 3/16 to 64}.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of chatter over the weekend on the Wall Street
(television) shows about the impending doom of the Nasdaq,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ''The market by virtue of its recent
ascent, especially the Nasdaq, has set itself up for a bit of a
correction.''
</P>
<P>
   A few high-profile technology stocks were climbing today. Intel
rose 4] to 124 9/16, helping the Dow contain its losses. Dell rose
3| to 54~ in heavy Nasdaq trading after three Wall Street firms
raised their ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow components, J.P. Morgan rose 3 15/16 to 110.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, soared 36[ to
84 1/16 on the New York Stock Exchange after Tribune Co., publisher
of the Chicago Tribune, agreed to acquire it for $6.46 billion. The
combined company would have 11 daily newspapers, 22 television
stations, magazines such as Popular Science, and four radio
stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune shares fell 6~ to 30 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume was moderate, with 797.79 million shares changing
hands as of 3 p.m. EST, compared with 918.19 million at the same
time on Friday. Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin
on the NYSE and by a 2-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq.

<HEADLINE> Customs Cracks Down on Ecstasy  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the hallucinogenic drug ecstasy flows into
the country in record amounts, the Customs Service is strengthening
its efforts to nab traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has created a task force to coordinate cases dealing
with the drug, which is popular among teen-agers, and is training
13 drug-detection dogs to sniff out the substance, Customs
Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also posted a message on the Customs Service's World Wide
Web site, http://www.customs.gov, seeking to educate parents and
young people about the drug and its dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new measures we're taking are designed to keep the ecstasy
problem from becoming a full-fledged epidemic,'' Kelly said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Since Oct. 1, customs officials have seized almost 4 million
doses of the drug, an all-time high, the service said. For fiscal
year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, inspectors confiscated 3 million
doses and in the 1998 fiscal year, 750,000 doses.
</P>
<P>
   In December, customs officials in California confiscated 700
pounds of the drug, the single largest seizure of its kind in the
agency's history.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ecstasy has rapidly become a major concern for Customs,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, from where many of the tablets are imported, the
doses cost just a few pennies apiece to make, Kelly said. But once
the tablets are sold in the United States, they can fetch $20 to
$40 each, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of this profit margin, international crime groups have
become heavily involved in the ecstasy trade,'' Kelly said. ''These
syndicates are capable of smuggling huge quantities of ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mafia hit man Salvatore ''Sammy the Bull'' Gravano was
arrested in February for alleged participation in an
ecstasy-peddling ring.
</P>
<P>
   Customs said the drug is popular among teen-agers, especially
those who frequent nightclubs and all-night technodance parties
known as ''raves.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas remain the primary venues for raves, but they also
are creeping into suburban and rural communities. With those
parties comes the illegal use of ecstasy, the Customs Service says.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is chemically known as MDMA for
Methylenedioxymethylamphetamine.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy's users normally experience feelings of euphoria and an
increased desire to interact socially, the service said. Blood
pressure, heart rate and body temperature increase dramatically.
Other physical symptoms include involuntary teeth-grinding. To
counter this, some users suck on pacifiers.

<HEADLINE> Date-rape Drug Verdict Is Sealed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- A jury reached a verdict Monday in the case
against three men accused in the death of a 15-year-old girl whose
drink had been spiked with a ''date-rape drug.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge sealed the verdict while another jury weighing the
fate of a fourth defendant continued its deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is among the first in the country involving a death
caused by GHB, a colorless, odorless drug that renders a victim
unconscious within 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged the four men gave Samantha Reid a soft drink
spiked with GHB during a 1999 party. The teen-ager died the next
day. Her friend Melanie Sindone, now 16, fell into a coma but
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the men are charged with involuntary manslaughter and
poisoning; a fourth is charged with poisoning and being an
accessory after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   A separate jury was seated for one of the men because police
said he confessed.
</P>
<P>
   Poisoning carries a possible life sentence, the manslaughter
charge up to 15 years behind bars, and accessory up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton last month signed legislation toughening
federal laws against possessing, making or distributing GHB.

<HEADLINE> Rates Rise in Treasury Bill Auction  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury
securities rose in Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department sold $8.5 billion in three-month bills
at a discount rate of 5.730 percent, up from 5.690 percent last
week. An additional $7.5 billion was sold in six-month bills at a
rate of 5.860 percent, up from 5.825 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The three-month rate was the highest since May 1, 1995, when the
bills sold for 5.74 percent. The six-month rate was the highest
since April 3, 1995, when the rate was 5.90.
</P>
<P>
   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors
-- 5.893 percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling
for $9,855.20 and 6.124 percent for a six-month bill selling for
$9,703.70.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the
average yield for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index
for making changes in adjustable rate mortgages, was 6.18 percent
last week, unchanged from the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Putin Book Offers Glimpse Into Man  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin, a steely enigma
to most Russians, lets his guard down a little in a book of
interviews released Monday, less than two weeks before the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The book also includes interviews with his wife, two daughters
and friends, offering a personal side to a man who is all-business
in public. It even shows him in a candid photo moment, grimacing as
he gets a smooch from his poodle.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a 16-year veteran of the KGB and later head of its main
successor, the FSB, appears carefully controlled in public, but
says in the book that there were some impulsive currents in his
early life.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he didn't join the Pioneers, the Communist youth group
in which virtually all Soviet children were members, until the
sixth grade, he says: ''I was a hooligan, not a Pioneer.''
</P>
<P>
   And he reveals that in college he had some serious love affairs,
including one that was leading to marriage -- until he got cold feet
after rings and wedding finery had been bought.
</P>
<P>
   ''I looked like the last scoundrel, but I decided it would be
better to do that now than for her and me to suffer later,'' he
says in the book, entitled ''From the First Person -- Conversations
with Vladimir Putin.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, Vagrius, had planned to put 500,000 copies up for
sale, but pulled back after being told by election officials that
selling the book would violate Russia's election law and even lead
to Putin's dismissal from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Vagrius head Gleb Uspensky said Monday that the publishing house
decided to print just 50,000 copies and sell all them to Putin's
campaign headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The book discloses nothing that is likely to undermine Putin's
huge lead in opinion polls ahead of the March 26 vote. He has
consistently recorded support of around 60 percent, compared with
about 20 percent for his nearest competitor, Communist Gennady
Zyuganov.
</P>
<P>
   It also does much to reinforce the image of firmness that
apparently is Putin's strong suit with voters, especially his tough
stance on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, he maintains the offensive against Chechnya was
necessary to save Russia -- and, possibly, the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was confident that if we didn't stop the extremists, we
would face the threat of Russian turning into another Yugoslavia,''
Putin says. ''Disintegration of such a vast country would trigger a
global catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's rise from little-known bureaucrat to acting president
coincided with the Chechnya war. He was appointed prime minister by
President Boris Yeltsin in August, shortly Chechen rebels attacked
the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who took over the presidency when Yeltsin abruptly
resigned Dec. 31, denied that he was riding the war into the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   While maintaining a tough tone on Chechnya, Putin reiterated in
the book his recent statement that Russia may consider joining
NATO, albeit adding that the country's admission would be unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they would fear the destruction of NATO,'' he said.
''We are too powerful a force.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin, asked to name historical figures he admires, first said
Napoleon Bonaparte. Then he added former French President Charles
de Gaulle and German Chancellor Ludvig Erhard.
</P>
<P>
   The new personal revelations aside, many of Putin's positions
remain unclear, including detailed proposals on how to address
Russia's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, he promised to strengthen protection of foreign
investment in Russia, but warned that the country could not rely on
outside money alone to spur its sluggish economy.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov has repeatedly criticized Putin for failing to present
a detailed platform.

<HEADLINE> Sharif Trial Adjourned in Pakistan  </HEADLINE>
By ZAHID HUSSAIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) -- A Pakistani judge adjourned the trial
of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on Monday to consider the
defense lawyers' demand for a change of venue following the killing
of one of their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to call off the day's proceedings came after
Sharif's attorneys failed to show up in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers say they fear for their safety and want the trial
moved out of the southern city of Karachi, where a lead attorney in
the case, Iqbal Raad, was gunned down Friday by three men who
stormed his second-story law office.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Rehmetullah Hussein Jaffri said he wanted to give Sharif
time to consult his attorneys about their demand to move the trial
either to Lahore, the capital of eastern Punjab province, or to the
federal capital of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   The former prime minister has not said whether he supports such
a move, and told the court Monday he had only read of the boycott
by his attorneys ''in the newspapers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't had any contact with them, and their decision has
not been taken with my knowledge,'' Sharif said in a statement to
the court.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif also expressed concern over Raad's murder, saying it had
''sent shock waves not only through this country but also
internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It exposes the government's failure to provide security not
only to the lawyers defending us but to the common people,'' he
said. ''His brutal killing was meant to quiet a brave voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif, his younger brother, Shahbaz, and five other close aides
have been jailed since a military coup Oct. 12 toppled Pakistan's
elected government. The former prime minister has denied the
charges of hijacking, treason, kidnapping and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif is accused of refusing to allow a passenger plane
carrying army chief Gen. Pervez Musharraf to land in Karachi. The
plane eventually landed, but the pilot has testified that it had
only seven minutes of fuel remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the aircraft landed, Musharraf -- with the backing
of Pakistan's powerful military -- seized power from Sharif in a
bloodless coup.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution lawyer Raja Quereshi told the court today that the
Karachi-based Sindh provincial government has offered Sharif's
lawyers additional security.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was scheduled to resume on Tuesday when the
prosecution is expected to ask the judge to allow the case to go
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers throughout Pakistan went on strike to protest
Raad's killing, which police said was still under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Customs cracking down on ecstasy  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Customs Service is taking steps to
crack down on trafficking in ecstasy as record amounts of the
hallucinogenic drug popular with teen-agers pour into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ecstasy has rapidly become a major concern for Customs,''
Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly said Monday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has created a task force to coordinate all cases
dealing with the drug and is training 13 drug-detection dogs to
specifically sniff out the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also posted a message on the Customs Web site seeking to
educate parents and young people about the drug and its dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The new measures we're taking are designed to keep the ecstasy
problem from becoming a full-fledged epidemic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Oct. 1, Customs has seized nearly 4 million doses of the
drug -- an all-time high, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest single seizure -- some 200,000 tablets with a street
value of $5 million -- took place in October at Newark International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Customs agents searched three unclaimed bags that came in
on a flight from Amsterdam. The bags belonged to three Dutch
nationals who had been bumped from the flight and put aboard a
plane that landed in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   They were later arrested and pleaded guilty to drug smuggling.
They were sentenced earlier this month to multiyear prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   The three told investigators they were recruited in the
Netherlands as couriers and were to receive $10,000 each for the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal year 1999, which ended Sept. 30, Customs inspectors
confiscated 3 million doses of the drug and in the 1998 fiscal
year, they seized 750,000 doses.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe -- where many of the tablets come from -- the drug costs
just a few pennies a piece to make, Kelly said. But once the
tablets are sold in the United States, they can fetch $20 to $40
each, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of this profit margin, international crime groups have
become heavily involved in the ecstasy trade,'' Kelly said. ''These
syndicates are capable of smuggling huge quantities of ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Customs said the drug is popular among teen-agers, especially
those who frequent nightclubs and all-night techno-dance parties
known as ''raves.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban areas remain the primary venues for raves, Customs said.
But raves are also creeping up in suburban and rural communities--
and with those parties comes the illegal use of ecstasy, the agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy's users usually experience feelings of euphoria and an
increased desire to interact socially, Customs said. Blood
pressure, heart rate and body temperature increase dramatically.
Other physical symptoms include involuntary teeth-grinding and
dehydration.

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes Military Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A consensus is growing in Congress that it's
time to fix what many say is a broken promise of lifetime health
benefits for military retirees. Still undecided is how big, and how
costly, the fix should be.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the current military retiree health care system,
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said: ''We can no
longer squeeze blood from this stone. It is empty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, joined by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John
Warner, R-Va., and several Democratic leaders, is behind a bill
that would do for military retirees what he is so far unwilling to
do for all older Americans: ensure prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The majority leader's bill would expand the Pentagon's
mail-order pharmacy program for service families living far from
military hospitals to all Medicare-eligible military retirees and
their dependents, about 8 million people. But they first would pay
a $150 annual deductible.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton wants to provide all 39 million Medicare
recipients with up to $1,000 a year in prescription drugs
initially, at a cost to each of $26 a month in premiums.
Republicans have balked; they say two-thirds of Medicare
beneficiaries already have private prescription coverage.
</P>
<P>
   For military retirees, Lott's bill also would make improvements
in Tricare, the HMO-like health care program used by many retirees
and the families of active-duty service members, and extend some
other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Lott calls his program ''a reasonable and prudent first step''
to ''correct the broken promise of lifetime health care to our
military retirees and veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Others contend that it falls short. It ''does not do enough to
reform the military health care delivery system for our veterans,''
said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a Navy retiree.
</P>
<P>
   The former presidential hopeful said retirees he met in his
travels spoke of long waiting periods, lack of access to proper
care and drugs and the failure of the government to live up to its
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 20-year retirees are entitled to free care at
military facilities on space-available basis, or they can join a
Tricare program. At 65, all retirees are switched to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans complain that the closing of bases has reduced access
to military hospitals by 40 percent, that many health-care
providers are reluctant to deal with Tricare because of poor
efficiency and low reimbursement rates and that Medicare doesn't
pay for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''This problem of access has been going on since the base
closures began in the mid-1980s, and they are still trying to do
incremental change,'' said Mark Olanoff of the Retired Enlisted
Association, which supports more fundamental reform.
</P>
<P>
   When today's retirees entered the service, ''They were told
straight out that a prime element of their compensation for serving
20 years would be free health care for life,'' said Rep. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga. The current system, he said, is ''an inexcusable
breach'' of that promise.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the military a lot of what you do is on blind trust,'' said
Steve Robertson, legislative director for the American Legion. If
that trust is violated, he said, it's going to be hard to recruit
and retain service members.
</P>
<P>
   The American Legion, he said, believes better access to the VA
health care system, which now gives priority to veterans with
service-related disabilities, is smarter than putting more money
into Tricare.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood is sponsoring bipartisan legislation that would allow
retirees who entered the service before 1956 to enroll in the
health care program for federal civilians, the Federal Employee
Health Benefits Program, with the government paying 100 percent of
costs. Cost estimates for the bill run in the $8 billion to $10
billion a year range.
</P>
<P>
   ''So what?'' Norwood said. ''That absolutely means nothing to
me. We gave our word.''
</P>
<P>
   David Burrelli of the nonpartisan Congressional Research
Service, contends in a report on military health care that Congress
never authorized free health care for life for military retirees.
He said three recent court cases have rejected retiree claims
seeking free care at military facilities as a right or entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   But Defense Secretary William Cohen said in recent congressional
testimony: ''We have made a pledge. Whether it's legal or not, it's
a moral obligation that we will take care of all those who
served.''

<HEADLINE> Medication Urged for MS Patients  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) --You've been diagnosed with the often crippling
nerve disease multiple sclerosis. There are three drugs to treat
it. So wouldn't you try one right away?
</P>
<P>
   Few patients do, even though evidence is building that early
medication is better, the National Multiple Sclerosis Society says.
</P>
<P>
   And people who do take the shots often quit before the
medications start working because they don't understand that the
protective effects won't be noticeable right away.
</P>
<P>
   It's frustrating to many specialists who say the drugs reduce
the number and severity of MS attacks by about a third and are even
better at protecting patients' brains from MS' more stealthy
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Multiple Sclerosis Society is working to better educate
patients that the drugs -- Betaseron, Avonex and Copaxone -- are
insurance against future illness.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 350,000 Americans who have multiple sclerosis, only
70,000 take the drugs, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who take these drugs have got to believe that down the
road they will be less disabled, be less sick,'' says longtime MS
nurse Nancy Holland, the society's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   But having faith can be hard if you take weekly or even daily
shots that cost about $10,000 a year, suffer some annoying side
effects and still have an MS attack that puts you in a wheelchair
for weeks. The society is trying to get the message out that
medications may have prevented you from having three attacks
instead of just one.
</P>
<P>
   Multiple sclerosis occurs when the body's own immune system goes
awry and attacks the nerves and brain, slowly stripping away the
protective sheath coating nerve fibers.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, that damage builds up to cause muscle weakness or
paralysis, fatigue, dim or blurred vision, memory loss and other
cognitive problems.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients have MS attacks, recover and then suffer attacks
again -- the ''relapsing-remitting'' MS the three drugs target. Time
and amount of recovery between attacks varies. Some people steadily
worsen while others merely suffer mild weakness for decades.
There's no way to predict.
</P>
<P>
   The three drugs are not a cure. They don't reverse symptoms. But
they do reduce the frequency and severity of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 70,000 MS patients take the drugs, Holland said. And
surveys suggest up to a third of patients discontinue treatment
within nine months -- mostly because they don't perceive the
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the best evidence that patients still need the drugs is seen
on specialized MRI scans of patients' brains, says Dr. Henry
McFarland, neuroimmunology chief at the National Institutes of
Health. The scans show about half of MS patients suffer steady
buildup of nerve damage in their brains between full-blown MS
attacks -- times when they feel healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can probably see 10 times more disease activity on MRI''
than standard neurology exam spots, McFarland explained. He said
the drugs are very effective in stopping those brain lesions -- one
study found them 80 percent effective -- but few patients outside of
special clinical trials get the brain scans so they can't see the
benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Some research suggests the drugs protect better early in
disease; one recently concluded Avonex taken after the very first
attack of MS-like symptoms could significantly delay a second
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently the MS society is working to help patients start,
and stick with, medication as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   At MS centers nationwide, nurses demonstrate how to minimize
pain and side effects, which mostly include flulike symptoms and
injection site reactions and, with one drug, occasional
anxiety-like attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Among their tips:
</P>
<P>
   -- Hold a bag of frozen vegetables on the injection site before
and after the shot to numb it and minimize swelling.
</P>
<P>
   -- Schedule the shot near bedtime, taking over-the-counter
analgesics a few hours before to counter flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tuck a vial under your arm a few minutes to warm it before
injecting.
</P>
<P>
   Early treatment isn't right for every patient, cautioned
McFarland. He says it's OK to monitor closely those with very mild
symptoms who don't want to take the drugs, but he says treatment is
vital for anyone with several significant attacks within 18 months
or MRI scans showing active disease.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Mary Ellen Miller, who was repeatedly hospitalized at
the Johns Hopkins University Medical Center where she works until
she started Avonex two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember not having any energy -- that debilitating
tiredness,'' said Miller. Now her symptoms are mild. ''It's been
wonderful for me,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Ex Secretaries of State Back Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six former secretaries of state signed on to
President Clinton's campaign for low-tariff trading rights for
China.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Clinton, they said giving China both permanent
access to U.S. markets without high tariff barriers and membership
in the World Trade Organization are ''critically important tools''
for moving China toward a more open society.
</P>
<P>
   The six are Henry A. Kissinger, Alexander M. Haig, George P.
Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren
Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is in our long-term interest -- and that of others in the
international community -- to develop a relationship with China that
is stable and predictable,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clinton initiative is accepted by Congress, China no
longer would depend on annual congressional approval to ship its
products to the United States at normal tariffs. China's huge
market also would be opened wider to American exports.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents, including human rights advocates, argue that
abandoning an annual review would eliminate a potent weapon in
trying to influence China's policies.
</P>
<P>
   Senate supporters of the measure count a thin majority for
approval. The outcome in the House is more uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced the backing of
six predecessors Monday. She added that China's entry into the
World Trade Organization ''would encourage the rule of law and spur
the development of a more open society.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the Chinese foreign trade minister, Shi Guangsheng,
said if Congress refused to grant his government permanent
low-tariff trading rights China would deny American companies
access to Chinese markets. That, he said, would cause the United
States ''regret, for 20 years, for a generation.''

<HEADLINE> Weather Boosts Grains, Soybeans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices shot higher Monday on
the Chicago Board of Trade amid drought concerns in the central
United States and soybean harvest delays in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean futures surged nearly 3 percent to a three-week high
after the National Weather Service said U.S. farmers face a serious
threat this year from a ''worsening drought'' in the wake of the
warmest winter on record.
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting prices were weekend rains that didn't meet
expectations in midwestern U.S. crop areas, as well as continuing
rains in central Brazil that are holding back harvest progress.
</P>
<P>
   Corn rose nearly as sharply as soybeans as investors and farmers
fretted about the dryness that has been prevalent in the Midwest
since last summer -- its impact growing as spring planting season
nears. Prices hit a two-week high.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat was buoyed by the same weather worries and by the rallies
in soybeans and corn. But the buying wave was not as large as for
those commodities, with the big commodity funds not as bullish on
wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery rose 3{ cents to $2.63{ a bushel; May
corn rose 4 cents to $2.30} a bushel; May oats rose 1} cent to
$1.18\ a bushel; May soybeans rose 13\ cents to $5.23 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures declined on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle fell .15 cent to 72.45 cents a pound; April
feeder cattle fell .43 cent to 83.92 cents a pound; April lean hogs
fell .15 cent to 61.90 cents a pound; May pork bellies fell .02
cent to 93.35 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> China Resolved To Enter WTO  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Congress' denial of permanent low-tariff trading
rights wouldn't deter China's resolve to join the World Trade
Organization and could cause the United States to gamble away
business opportunities for a generation, China's foreign trade
minister said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress rejects normal trade relations, Beijing could invoke
a WTO rule allowing it to deny U.S. companies access to the Chinese
market, causing the United States ''regret for 20 years, for a
generation,'' Shi Guangsheng suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Shi's comments were the clearest indication so far that China
intends to seek entry into WTO, regardless of what the U.S.
Congress does and despite the risks market opening will bring to
its own struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the United States misses this opportunity, it will actually
lose the tremendous market of China and will be giving away the
opportunity for participating in this market to its competitors,''
Shi said at a news conference on the sidelines of the annual
session of the National People's Congress, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing can gain membership after it has reached accords with
all 135 member countries and after two-thirds of WTO members
approve. Agreements with just 10 countries still need to be
reached, and in most cases all that was required was the signing,
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton sent the proposal to make normal
trade benefits permanent to Congress, where labor and environmental
groups are lobbying against it. The administration, business and
most congressional Republicans support the China trade deal, and
there appears to be enough support to pass the U.S. Senate, but
support in the House remains in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton promised the proposal as part of a market-access deal
Shi and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky signed in
November to allow Beijing to join WTO, the Geneva-based
organization that oversees world trade rules. Clinton called the
trade deal a ''once in a generation'' opportunity, sentiments
echoed by Shi in his comments.
</P>
<P>
   Six former secretaries of state threw their support behind
Clinton on Monday, saying in a letter that the measure was
''critically important'' to helping move China toward a more open
society.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Henry A. Kissinger, Alexander M. Haig
Jr., George P. Shultz, James A. Baker III, Lawrence Eagleburger and
Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   China is the only major U.S. trading partner whose normal
trading status -- previously called most-favored nation status --
must be renewed annually. A positive vote by Congress would assure
China of the same access to U.S. markets and lowest-possible
tariffs that other nations now have.
</P>
<P>
   Shi said China was close to reaching a bilateral agreement with
the European Union, the largest of the trading partners with which
it has yet to reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Except for a few demands China is unable to commit to for any
trading partner, there are not many remaining issues,'' Shi said.
</P>
<P>
   The other countries that have not signed WTO deals with China
are Malaysia, Kyrgyzstan, Poland, Latvia, Switzerland, Mexico,
Costa Rica, Guatemala and Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   The recovery of neighboring countries from the Asian financial
crisis and government policies to stimulate the economy and
encourage exports have helped China's trade performance, as has
progress in revamping inefficient and uncompetitive state-owned
enterprises, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
   China's exports surged 41.2 percent to $31.57 billion in the
first two months of this year compared to the same period the year
before, he reported, saying this trend showed the country's trade
competitiveness was improving.
</P>
<P>
   Shi said exports rose 6.1 percent in 1999 to $194.9 billion,
while imports climbed 18.2 percent to $165.8 billion, leaving a
trade surplus of $29.1 billion.
</P>

   But China remains vulnerable to setbacks. The Asian economic
recovery remained fragile, and many industries are not competitive,
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are sober-minded about the challenges and pressures that
WTO membership will bring, especially for technically backward,
small enterprises with poor operation and poor management. The
pressure on those enterprises will be intense,'' Shi said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Shi insisted that the benefits of WTO membership far
outweighed the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no economy that has collapsed as a result of joining
WTO. On the contrary, WTO membership has promoted economic
development for all of them.''

<HEADLINE> Few Heart Patients Taking Aspirin  </HEADLINE>
By TROY GOODMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Too few heart patients are taking aspirin despite
its widely known ability to prevent heart attacks, according to a
study released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the American Heart Association's journal
Circulation, found that only 26 percent of patients who had heart
disease and could have benefited from aspirin took the pain
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ''This suggests that there's a substantial number of patients
who are at higher risk of more problems because they're not taking
aspirin,'' said Dr. Randall Stafford, an internist at Harvard's
Massachusetts General Hospital who led the study. ''As we all know,
this is a very inexpensive medication -- very affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular use of aspirin has been shown to reduce the risk of
blood clots that can block an artery and trigger a heart attack.
Experts say aspirin can also reduce the risk of a stroke and
angina, or severe chest pain.
</P>
<P>
   Because regular aspirin use can cause some side effects -- such
as stomach ulcers, internal bleeding and allergic reactions --
doctors are too often reluctant to prescribe it for heart patients,
Stafford said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a bias in medicine toward treatment and within that
bias we tend to underutilize preventative services -- even if
they've been clearly proven,'' said Marty Sullivan, a professor of
cardiology at Duke University in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford's findings were based on 1996 data from 10,942 doctor
visits by people with heart disease. The study may underestimate
aspirin use; some doctors may not have reported instances in which
they recommended patients take over-the-counter medications, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He called the data ''a wake-up call'' to doctors who focus too
much on acute medical problems and ignore general prevention.

<HEADLINE> U.S. South, Midwest Seeing Drought  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- That warm, dry winter has a dark side. A
drought has developed across the southern United States and much of
the Midwest, and it's likely to get worse in many areas before it
goes away, the government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to take a large, large amount of precipitation'' to
end the drought and ''we don't see anything on the horizon to bring
that in,'' said Jack Kelly, director of the National Weather
Service, which released its first-ever drought forecast.
</P>
<P>
   A drought occurs somewhere in the country every year, typically
costing about $6 billion in damage to crops and businesses. But
this is the first year the government has attempted to forecast
where and how droughts will develop. Scientists say that more
sophisticated data collection is making that possible.
</P>
<P>
   This year's drought ''could seriously impact farmers, water
resource managers, navigation interests and the tourism industry.
Forewarned is forearmed,'' said D. James Baker, the top official at
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees
the weather service.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists attribute the dry weather to La Nina, the weather
pattern that is related to cooler than normal temperatures in the
eastern and central Pacific Ocean. La Nina is expected to linger
for several months at least.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast said the drought is likely to intensify from
Arizona to the Carolinas this spring and could possibly get worse
in a section of the Midwest that stretches from northwest Ohio to
eastern Nebraska. That region isn't as dry as the South, so a few
significant rains could alleviate the problem, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama experienced their driest
February in 106 years. In Georgia, the drought dates back to May
1998.
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, Baton Rouge, La., had received 3.4 inches of
rain since the beginning of the year, well below the normal level
of over 11 inches
</P>
<P>
   East of the Mississippi River, streams are at record low levels,
according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Nearly all the streams
within the Ohio, Tennessee and lower Mississippi River basins and
along the Gulf and south Atlantic coasts are flowing below normal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Think of it as not having enough money in the bank. We have
not had enough water during our normally wet winter to put in our
groundwater bank for our normally dry summer and fall,'' said
Charles Groat, director of the Geological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   On the positive side, officials said the dry conditions mean
there is little likelihood of spring flooding.
</P>
<P>
   The drought that gripped the East Coast last summer disappeared
after a series of tropical storms.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials said it is too early to tell
whether this year's drought will have any impact on commodity or
food prices. However, more than 60 percent of the winter wheat crop
in Texas is rated no better than poor.
</P>
<P>
   As of now the jump in fuel prices is expected to have a bigger
impact on farm income. The high prices are likely to add as much as
$3 billion to farmers' fuel expenses, which last year were about
$6.4 billion, USDA economists said Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Promote Projects on Road  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Saying he has ''a lot of energy and a few
ideas'' left, President Clinton is combining a heavy fund-raising
schedule this spring with out-of-town appearances that the White
House hopes will push Congress to act on several thorny pieces of
his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton plans road trips to promote several major
legislative initiatives: prescription drugs for Medicare patients,
gun control, a raise in the minimum wage, a trade deal with China
and better consumer control over health care.
</P>
<P>
   Today in Cleveland, the president promoted his plan to cover
prescription drug bills as part of the federal Medicare program
that serves most older Americans. House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala were
on hand, along with some elderly Midwesterners struggling to pay
for medication.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton urged the crowd to write to their senators in Washington
and speak out in support of prescription-drug benefits for elderly
people regardless of income. ''Tell them it's not a partisan
issue,'' Clinton said. ''It's an American issue.''
</P>
<P>
   New Clinton administration statistics show the middle-income
elderly are caught in an expensive bind when buying prescriptions.
Middle-income people who have no private coverage for drugs pay, on
average, 75 percent more for their medication than those who have
coverage, the White House says.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton wants universal, voluntary coverage. Republicans favor
narrower coverage for lower-income elderly, which the White House
contends would leave millions unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, 776,000 middle-income elderly would be left out of the
GOP plan, the White House says.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio trip is Clinton's first major foray outside Washington
to address the prescription drug issue this year, and the opening
of what White House strategists call a calculated effort to put a
little hometown pressure on Congress. Similar theme events are
tentatively scheduled throughout the spring, said one aide who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has called the China trade deal the most important thing
before Congress this year. His chief lobbyist on the China deal,
Commerce Secretary William Daley, acknowledged last week that the
administration now lacks the votes to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook may be slightly brighter for the drug plan; for the
president's plan to give patients the right to sue their health
plans if they are denied care, and for gun control. Clinton wants
to ban importation of large-capacity ammunition clips, impose
background checks on buyers at gun shows and require more safety
devices for handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum wage legislation is in limbo after the House voted to
raise it last week but added tax cuts for business that the White
House calls unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say there is some Republican support for his
goals and bipartisan self-interest in passing some legislation
before the fall elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''We take the unconventional line that things can actually occur
in election years,'' said Chris Jennings, the White House health
care policy specialist.
</P>
<P>
   The White House acknowledges its best hope for passing
contentious legislation in the Republican-led Congress comes before
summer, when the political parties select their presidential
nominees and legislators begin their own fall campaigns in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The even larger deadline, of course, is the end of the
administration itself next January.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people talk about me now, I feel like I'm a witness at my
own funeral,'' Clinton said in a speech to visiting city officials
Sunday. ''You know, I've got nearly a year left in office, and a
lot of energy, and I've got a few ideas about what to do with the
remaining time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that energy will be spent raising political money across
the country, which offers an expeditious way to schedule the
out-of-town ''message events.'' The prescription drug speech,
arranged just a few days ago, follows a fund-raising lunch for
House Democrats in Cleveland that has been on Clinton's schedule
for weeks.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Flood Toll Rises To 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Steady rains continued to fall
Monday across northwestern Argentina, extending a week of heavy
rainfall and flooding that has left 10 people dead and forced some
15,000 people to evacuate their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities reported two deaths Monday in the central city of
Cordoba, 475 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. Cordoba was hit by
torrential rains, hail and blustery winds Sunday that left much of
the city without drinking water or electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Waters from the overflowing Suquia River uprooted trees and
flooded homes in Cordoba, Argentina's second-largest city.
Authorities worked Monday to restore services and transport food,
clothes and medical supplies to the rain-soaked provinces in the
northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rains and floods killed eight other people last week.
Meteorologists predicted more rain Tuesday in Cordoba and other
parts of the region.

<HEADLINE> CBS Flies Finalists for 'Survivor'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After flying the 16 ''Survivor'' finalists to a
deserted island Monday, CBS began walking a tightrope between
publicity and potentially embarrassing scrutiny of its summer
adventure series.
</P>
<P>
   CBS released pictures, occupations and first names of
contestants, but no last names. The network said the partial
identification had nothing to do with the ruckus caused by the
media's search into the background of Fox's multimillionaire groom,
Rick Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the network pleaded for the media to restrain itself
from trying to contact participants and their families because it
wants to keep secret who wins the show's $1 million prize.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope the press will treat this as an entertainment
product,'' said CBS spokesman Chris Ender. ''Movie critics didn't
reveal the plot of 'The Sixth Sense,' which has a secret ending. We
hope they have the same sensitivity here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' involves real people, not actors. It's part of the
trend of reality television that some believe hit its nadir when
Rockwell wed a stranger, Darva Conger, on Fox's ''Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire'' last month. Conger has since filed for
an annulment.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 ''Survivor'' participants, culled from among 6,000
applications, compete in endurance contests on an island in the
South China Sea. One by one, through 13 one-hour weekly episodes
that will air this summer, the contingent is whittled down to two
people. The losing contestants then choose the winner.
</P>
<P>
   In a Swedish version of the game three years ago, a losing
contestant committed suicide a month after returning home. The
Swedish television network denied any responsibility, but the man's
widow blamed the show after her husband came back ''deeply
depressed and agonized.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of CBS' contestants went through six hours of psychological
testing to determine their fitness, including a one-hour meetings
with mental health professionals, Ender said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's initial elation with the high ratings for
''Multimillionaire'' faded quickly when questions about Rockwell's
background surfaced, including a 1991 restraining order issued
against him after an ex-fiancee said he had threatened her.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's refusal to release the full names of ''Survivor''
contestants stops, or at least slows, any outsiders from making
checks. The network suspects that by releasing pictures and
hometowns of contestants, their identities will eventually surface,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''Other people have tried other methods to keep us from finding
out information, but it won't work,'' said Daniel Green, co-editor
of The Smoking Gun, an online news service that first revealed the
Rockwell restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   CBS also said it conducted its own criminal and civil background
checks of the participants just to be sure some embarrassing
history doesn't come to light.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly everything that happened with the Rockwell situation
took our awareness level to new heights,'' Ender said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 contestants range in age from a 22-year-old college
student from New Hampshire to a 72-year-old retired Navy SEAL from
Virginia Beach. They include a lawyer, neurologist, truck driver,
traveling salesman and river guide.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has a similar, perhaps even more controversial reality
series on tap for this summer. Called ''Big Brother,'' it features
a group of strangers who agree to live in a house fully equipped
with cameras and microphones for three months.

<HEADLINE> Africa Familiar for U.S. Military  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- The flood relief operation in
Mozambique marks the third time in seven years the American
military has jumped in to provide humanitarian help in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Aid missions to the continent have grown so common they're now
part of the U.S. training program.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the flooding in Mozambique left 1 million people in
need of assistance, Maj. Gen. Joseph Wehrle, commander of the 3rd
U.S. Air Force based in Britain, had organized a three-week
training exercise in the west African nation of Cameroon. The
mission: how to respond to a flood in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the Air Force was called in for the real thing, ''I was
already taking my malaria tablets,'' said Lt. Col. Tom Dolney.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 U.S. Air Force personnel and 15 aircraft are now in
the region, operating from the Indian Ocean coastal cities of
Maputo and Beira, and from an air base in neighboring South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Along with military units from several other countries, they
have served as the air wing for international aid groups, flying in
food and plucking stranded villagers from the flood zones in
central and southern Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   More than 14,000 people have been airlifted to safety, including
many who had been stranded in treetops. Most were rescued by South
African helicopter crews, which were the first to respond to the
disaster and for days were working alone, ferrying load after load
of flood victims.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Jeff Burrell said he was initially shocked by the ragged
condition of the flood victims when his helicopter landed in remote
villages along the Save River basin. The trip nearly turned into a
disaster when about 100 Mozambicans tried to storm the helicopter
as it touched down in one hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   ''We immediately began hovering, but one man was hanging on the
skids and refused to let go,'' said Burrell, a logistics officer
from Toccoa, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot didn't want to land amid the chaos, so the crew
scrambled to pull the man on board, Burrell said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the aircraft sent in for the aid effort is a U.S. C-130
cargo plane equipped with a powerful camera on its belly that can
detect damage to roads and railways. The camera can also search
isolated regions for displaced people who might otherwise be
overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   Huge Pave Low MH-53 helicopters can be refueled in the air,
giving them the range to reach refugees in distant regions beyond
the reach of most choppers.
</P>
<P>
   The marriage of Western militaries and international
humanitarian groups has become common in Africa, where young aid
workers dressed in shorts and T-shirts work alongside U.S.
servicemen dressed in long-sleeve camouflage despite the broiling
African sun.
</P>
<P>
   The aid groups have the expertise in organizing refugee camps
and feeding large numbers efficiently, but they need the aircraft
and logistical muscle that only the military can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Though President Clinton has been a leading proponent of greater
American involvement in Africa, former President Bush began the
recent trend when he sent troops to Somalia in December 1992 to
halt a famine that had claimed hundreds of thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans swiftly carved out safe corridors for aid
distribution and helped end the famine, but nearly 40 Americans
were killed in fighting with one of the factions in Somalia's civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   Scarred by the Somalia experience, the United States and other
Western nations kept their distance during Rwanda's genocide in
1994, when the Hutu majority slaughtered hundreds of thousands of
people, mostly minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
   After the fighting ended, the U.S. military provided logistical
support for the tide of refugees that fled to neighboring Zaire.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique is a country at peace, and that helped build a solid
consensus for U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in Washington last week and I didn't detect any
reluctance to getting involved,'' said Dean Curran, the U.S.
ambassador to Mozambique. ''We're getting loads of letters and
e-mails from U.S. churches, individuals and aid groups. The mission
has clearly touched the hearts of people in the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, NRA in War of Words  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Escalating a bitter feud with the National
Rifle Association, the White House today angrily accused the NRA of
making ''outrageous and disgusting'' charges about President
Clinton and called on the group's political supporters to repudiate
the statements.
</P>
<P>
   The White House response was prompted by an assertion by Wayne
LaPierre, NRA executive vice president, that Clinton exploits gun
deaths for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've come to believe that he needs a certain level of violence
in this country,'' LaPierre said Sunday. ''He's willing to accept a
certain level of killing to further his political agenda and his
vice president, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton read the remark verbatim today at the close of a
Democratic fund-raising speech in Cleveland to make the point, he
said, ''that there really is a difference between the two parties''
on gun control issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe he really believes this,'' Clinton said. ''And if he
does, we've got even more trouble than if it's a horrible political
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also lashed back from the presidential
campaign trail, demanding an apology from LaPierre.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who has spent time as I have -- many times -- with the
families of the victims of gun violence and felt the heartache,
seen the way gun violence tears families apart, couldn't possibly
make such a comment,'' Gore said in Miami. ''And I believe Mr.
LaPierre's comments reveal a kind of sickness at the very heart of
the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre held his ground. He said in an interview he can think
of no other reason for the administration's ''shameful'' lack of
enforcement of gun laws except that it is driven by politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's not for a political agenda, they need to say something
to the NRA or the American people that makes sense,'' LaPierre
said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Gore's demand that he apologize, LaPierre said:
''Vice President Gore needs to apologize to the American public for
not enforcing the existing federal firearms laws.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Clinton's challenge to him to look into the eyes of
Kayla Rolland's mother and other families that have lost children
to gun violence, he said: ''I think he should look them in the eye
and explain why he won't enforce the laws against crack dealers
with guns and take them off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said LaPierre's charge Sunday
was ''a sick attack on the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen anything this low in a long time in
Washington,'' Lockhart said, ''and if there are right-thinking
people in the NRA and the leadership of political parties who
support the NRA, they ought to stand up and repudiate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his remarks were aimed at Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
the apparent Republican presidential nominee, Lockhart said, ''I
think if it was in his heart that this was a repugnant statement,
he should say it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a new advertising campaign, NRA President Charlton Heston all
but accuses Clinton of lying in his characterizations of the group
as an impediment to sensible laws and public safety.
</P>
<P>
   The sparring is also over Clinton's effort to use his final year
to win some of the gun controls that have eluded him so far and
inject the subject into the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, interviewed Sunday on ABC's ''This Week,'' said people
can't take seriously the ''wounded rhetoric'' of the NRA, ''given
how ruthlessly brutal they were'' to members of Congress who helped
pass the Brady waiting-period bill and the ban on assault-type
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''These crocodile tears, I don't think it will wash with the
voters, even with Moses reading the script,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heston, an actor, played Moses in the movie ''The Ten
Commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre, also on ''This Week,'' attributed Clinton's renewed
focus on guns to his interest in getting Gore elected. ''The
pollsters and consultants are telling them, scare suburban women,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other steps, the president wants people who make purchases
at gun shows to be subject to background checks that could take as
long as 72 hours. Many congressional Republicans and the NRA want
any such checks to be instant, or at least no longer than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think that the knee-jerk reaction to any gun safety
measure is wrong,'' Clinton said of the NRA. ''If you do one little
thing that requires any accommodation ... they think it's the end
of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, they basically win through intimidation,'' Clinton
said. ''People are scared of them.'' But while the organization may
have over 3 million members, ''there's more people than that in
America,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Clinton, who taped the ABC interview Friday, LaPierre
wasted no time going after the ''level of dishonesty this man is
capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that the administration has been singularly lax in
enforcing gun laws already on the books. ''You can't care about
stopping crimes with guns and give the country a complete lack of
enforcement,'' the NRA official said.

<HEADLINE> Atlantic City, neighboring towns to get $52 million beachreplenishment  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- It's part of the routine, up and down
the Jersey shore: As the sun sets, the lifeguards move their wooden
stands and surfboats away from the water.
</P>
<P>
   Lifeguards at some beaches here can't do that anymore. Erosion
has clawed away at the beach near Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. At
high tide, ocean water rushes up under the Boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't even have enough room in summer to store our
equipment. We have to move the boats and stands every night,'' said
Bob Levy, chief of the Atlantic City Beach Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Relief is on the way -- for Atlantic City and its fellow Absecon
Island communities of Ventnor, Margate and Longport.
</P>
<P>
   A $52 million beach replenishment project is to begin after
Labor Day, dredging more than 3 million cubic yards of sand from
the ocean floor near Absecon Inlet and piping it onto thinning
beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole island really needs a good beach fill,'' said
Bernard Moore, director of coastal engineering for the state
Department of Environmental Protection. ''Atlantic City hasn't had
one since the early 1970s.''
</P>
<P>
   To complete the whole project in 2000 and 2001, however, more
federal money is needed, he said. The state's representatives will
ask for $23 million in fiscal year 2001, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the replenishment, project plans call for the
building of dunes parallel to the boardwalks and sea walls of the
island. That aspect of the project is getting a cool reception in
Ventnor because of concerns about beach access.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are worried that the dunes will grow over time,
obscuring ocean views from million-dollar homes and the Boardwalk
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Here, we've dodged the bullet when it comes to storms. We
haven't been seriously hurt at all,'' said city Business
Administrator William Thomas. ''So people are blase about why we
need this. They're more worried about the engineered beach and the
disruption it'll bring to their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said city officials have concerns about dune growth, too.
If they expand up under the Boardwalk, restricting air flow,
Boardwalk wood could get wet and rot away, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a chance to take part in a program that will cost us a
little money but has the potential to protect property and our
Boardwalk, which a lot of people think is our biggest asset. If we
don't do it, and we get the storm everyone knows we'll eventually
get and it destroys our Boardwalk, what will FEMA say? My concern
is they'll come in and say 'You had a chance to mitigate it and you
didn't,''' Thomas said. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Others have concerns about beach replenishment, too. Critics
have long blasted it as taxpayer-funded insurance for wealthy
oceanfront property owners. Supporters, on the other hand, say
beach replenishment protects the businesses that draw visitors --
and money -- to beach communities.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the American Littoral Society, the New Jersey
Audubon Society, Taxpayers for Common Sense and the National
Wildlife Federation targeting government spending called New
Jersey's beach-building projects Uncle Sam's ninth-biggest waste of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shore doesn't need to be protected, houses do,'' said
Elizabeth Hanratty, a spokeswoman for the American Littoral
Society. ''It's a vicious cycle. The national flood insurance
program is subsidized by the government and so is beach protection.
Our tax dollars are paying for them to stay there, and if they get
damaged, we're paying again to keep them there.''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Police Detain Kurdish Leader  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATMAN, Turkey (AP) -- Police detained a deputy head of Turkey's
only legal Kurdish party on Monday for a speech he made during a
meeting with a group of village leaders, his party said.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not say on what charges they detained Eyup Karagecili
of the People's Democracy Party. Details of his speech were not
released.
</P>
<P>
   His arrest appeared to be part of a wider crackdown on the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the party's leader, Ahmet Turan Demir, was sentenced
to three years in prison for holding a hunger strike in 1998 in
support of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Three mayors of mainly Kurdish southeastern cities were arrested
following meetings with European officials to discuss cultural
rights for Kurds. The mayors, all members of the People's Democracy
Party, were released pending trial on charges of aiding Kurdish
rebels. If found guilty, they face seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Karagecili was detained after he walked into a police station to
seek permission to hold a Kurdish spring festival on March 21. He
had met with Kurdish village leaders last week to prepare for the
festival.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our friend's arrest is just a continuation of the hindrances
that officials are putting in the way of our party's activities,''
said Hamit Geylani, a senior party official.
</P>
<P>
   The People's Democracy Party is facing closure on charges of
being a front for Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which
has fought a 15-year war with Turkish forces for Kurdish autonomy.
Some 37,000 people, mostly Kurds, have been killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The PKK announced a cease-fire last year, and said it wanted to
negotiate peace. Turkey refuses to talk with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's approximately 12 million Kurds are not recognized as a
minority. Turkey bans education and broadcasting in Kurdish.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Jets Hit Palestinian Base  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli-allied militiamen unleashed a
barrage of shells Monday on a coastal village in south Lebanon,
killing two people and wounding one, a Lebanese security official
said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the village of Mansouri hit a Lebanese army
checkpoint, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
A soldier and a passer-by were killed, and another soldier was
wounded. They were taken to a hospital in the southern port city of
Tyre.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, the Lebanese army opened fire with tanks on an
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army position, an army spokesman said.
The Lebanese army rarely gets involved in the southern Lebanon
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Mansouri, a predominantly Shiite Muslim village six miles south
of Tyre, sits below SLA outposts on the edge of the
Israeli-occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese security sources said the SLA attack was apparently
launched in retaliation for an attack by Hezbollah guerrillas on
the village of Hardon, a hilly position controlled by the SLA
militia inside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
   An official in the northern command confirmed the SLA in Hardon
had come under fire from Mansouri, but said he did not know if the
SLA returned fire.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli army radio quoted foreign news agencies as saying one
Lebanese civilian was killed and another wounded in the SLA fire on
Mansouri.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Israeli jets blasted suspected Hezbollah
positions in southern Lebanon with more than a dozen missiles and
pounded radical Palestinian guerrilla bases near the Syrian border,
Lebanese security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear what prompted the air raid on Syrian-backed Fatah
Uprising, which came two days after an Arab ministers' meeting in
Beirut condemned Israeli attacks on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first major onslaught since 1998 on Palestinian
guerrillas opposed to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's peace
deals with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials said the attack destroyed three multiple
rocket launchers, a 130mm artillery gun and a transport truck.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Fatah Uprising reported no casualties and
pledged to continue to fight and oppose the ''shameful and
humiliating'' peace deals between Arafat and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But local reporters said they saw an armed guerrilla at the
scene with blood dripping from his hand.
</P>
<P>
   Near the front line in southern Lebanon, Israeli jets staged two
air raids on suspected Hezbollah positions, firing a total of eight
missiles following earlier Hezbollah attacks against the Israeli
mountaintop outpost of Beaufort.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent word on casualties from Monday's raids.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting underscored the potential for violence at a time
when Israel has promised to withdraw from an occupied zone in
southern Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
   Israel said it would prefer to pull out with an agreement with
Syria, the main power-broker in Lebanon, but would proceed without
one. Israel has threatened heavy retaliation for post-pullout
attacks on Israel's northern borders.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon said it could not guarantee calm along the border if
Israel pulled out without reaching peace with Lebanon, Syria and
the Palestinians first.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Prime Minister Salim Hoss again warned that
unilateral withdrawal could lead to an escalation in violence, and
urged Israel ''to avoid the dangers and risks of a withdrawal that
is not part of a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees live in Lebanon,
and officials warn that militants among them might attack northern
Israel following a troop pullout.

<HEADLINE> South Up for Grabs in 2000 Race  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The once Solid South isn't solid anymore. The
political transformation of territory that once was a lock for the
Democrats -- and then became a stronghold for the Republicans over
the past two decades -- could make the states of the Old Confederacy
presidential battlegrounds this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do think the South is more in play than it has been,'' said
Hastings Wyman Jr., editor of the Southern Political Report
newsletter. ''The issues that moved the South into the Republican
column are all pretty much on the back burner or have
disappeared.'' He cited the end of the Cold War, the fading of
racial issues as a top priority and the Democrats' recent success
with the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats broke the steady GOP progress in 1998 by winning
governors races in Alabama and South Carolina and retaining the
governorship in Georgia. Exit polls suggest that a big turnout of
black voters combined with strong support from independents and
some crossover Republicans were key. And Arkansan Bill Clinton was
able to carve away four of 11 Southern states -- Arkansas, Tennessee
and Louisiana in both 1992 and 1996, plus Georgia the first year
and Florida the second.
</P>
<P>
   The region had grown increasingly Republican between the 1960s,
when Democrats dominated almost every level of Southern politics,
and 1998 when Republicans had the overwhelming majority of
governorships and Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, on track to be the Democratic nominee,
is showing increased strength in the Northeast, Midwest and
California and would love to carve off a few Southern states in the
2000 general election. That would give him a better shot at winning
the White House over Republican George W. Bush, the governor of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   While the South remains strong for Republicans, many believe the
political dynamic in the region is shifting -- people are more
responsive to issues like Social Security, education and health
care than to party labels.
</P>
<P>
   ''People in the South no longer think in purely partisan,
ideological terms,'' said Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, a
Republican. ''They are thinking in pragmatic, practical terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Democrats reclaimed the governorship in Alabama in
1998, state GOP executive director Twinkle Andress sees that as ''a
totally separate election'' from the presidential race and says
polls indicate Alabama is firmly conservative and Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Five states from the Old Confederacy -- Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas -- hold party primaries Tuesday,
along with Oklahoma. While the parties' nominees were settled a
week ago, the primaries still shine the spotlight on a region that
could play a crucial role in November.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is that the South will be the most Republican region
in the country,'' said political scientist Charles Bullock of the
University of Georgia. ''But that doesn't mean the Democrats can't
pick off some states. If you allow the opposition to sweep the
South,'' that would be more than 140 electoral votes, more than
half the number needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   A Democrat in the South needs roughly 40 percent of the white
vote and a heavy black turnout to succeed, according to a formula
cited by some political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the South -- South Carolina, Alabama, Mississippi,
Virginia and Texas -- are seen as very tough for the Democrats.
Other states such as North Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, Tennessee,
Arkansas and Florida are viewed as more likely to be competitive.
Until recently, the Democrats had little hope for Florida, where
Bush's brother is governor, but the state is now considered
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush retains a big advantage over Gore in the South,
according to several recent national polls.
</P>
<P>
   The battles will be fought in individual states, and David
Worley, state Democratic chairman in Georgia, sees similarities
with the 1998 governor's race there, won by Democrat Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a Republican candidate (for governor) with more money
than God running against a candidate seen as the successor to eight
very successful Democratic years,'' Worley said.
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, the Georgia Democratic Party was very
effective at mobilizing the black vote, which made up at least a
fourth of total voter turnout, reaching most black households in
the state several times in the closing days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''African-American voters are concerned about the same issues
that all voters are concerned about -- education, health care,''
said Worley, who has given seminars to Democrats in neighboring
states. ''There was a tendency in the past to think of appealing to
white voters in terms of message and to African-Americans in terms
of turnout.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina GOP chairman William Cobey said he expects Bush
to win there, but says he knows the Democrats will ''come after
this state vigorously.'' And Florida GOP chairman Al Cardenas said
he expects Florida will be competitive because it ''is a microcosm
of the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Democratic enthusiasm, Huckabee thinks the South will
provide the GOP a solid base, where Bush ''will be stronger than
garlic.''

<HEADLINE> Russians: Chechen Leader Captured  </HEADLINE>
By LYOMA TURPALOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   URUS-MARTAN, Russia (AP) -- Russia said Monday it had finally
captured senior Chechen warlord Salman Raduyev, an elusive fighter
who once raided Russia and seized hundreds of hostages and claims
to have set bombs at Russian rail stations.
</P>
<P>
   Raduyev -- who masks his war-scarred face with dark glasses and a
thick beard -- was the first high-level rebel leader seized by
Russia in the six-month-old Chechen war. The Russians say they are
questioning him at a Moscow prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the most odious bandit leaders,'' Acting
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting of top
ministers, using the standard Russian epithet for the rebels. ''Now
he's in prison, and that's where he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the arrest is likely boost to Russia's claims that the
rebels in Chechnya are being forced into irreversible defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But as a battle in the southern Chechnya town of Komsomolskoye
entered its second week Monday, rebels were using measures as
daring and desperate as Raduyev's to defend a stronghold ravaged by
artillery and air assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Raduyev was apprehended by Russian troops on Sunday in Chechnya
and brought to the Russian capital, Putin said. He was charged
Monday with terrorism, which carries a possible sentence of 50
years, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel warlord, in his early 30s, became one of Chechnya's
most notorious figures in January 1996, during the previous Chechen
war, when he led a raid on the Russian town of Kizlyar, taking
hundreds of hostages.
</P>
<P>
   He negotiated safe passage back to Chechnya, taking some of the
hostages with him, but Russian forces stopped the group at a border
village, setting off clashes that killed dozens of people.
</P>
<P>
   He also has claimed credit for two fatal railway station blasts
in Russia in 1997 and for an assassination attempt on Georgian
President Eduard Shevardnadze in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Raduyev, whose beard and glasses cover scars from a Russian
attack, has been one of the more recognizable faces of Chechnya's
guerrillas. He also is a distant relative of Dzhokhar Dudayev, the
leader of Chechnya's secession drive, who died in a Russian rocket
attack in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the town of Komsomolskoye, at the foothills of the Caucasus
Mountains, rebel snipers hid in deep pits dug under houses during
Russian artillery and air barrages, then emerged to fire at Russian
troops.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has stymied Russian forces in more than a week of
fighting to take the village, which rebels seized March 5,
embarrassing commanders who claimed to have rebels blocked in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The suffering of Chechnya's civilians in the war has brought
widespread criticism from the West and the pressure increased
Monday from a delegation from the Council of Europe, the
continent's principal human-rights body.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation, in a prepared statement, said it believed
''serious human rights violations and war crimes have taken place
in Chechnya on both sides'' and it called for an immediate
cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Eyewitnesses gave accounts of arbitrary killings and
harassment by Russian forces, as well as unacceptable actions of
violence by Chechen fighters, the implementation of (Islamic)
Sharia law and hostage-taking,'' the delegation said.
</P>
<P>
   The devastation of much of Chechnya has prompted wide criticism
from abroad and a delegation from the Council of Europe accused
both Russia and Chechen rebels of committing war crimes, calling
for an immediate cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has previously rejected such calls and Sergei
Yastrzhembsky, the Russian presidential spokesman for Chechnya,
reiterated on Monday the Kremlin's refusal to negotiate with
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dialogue with these people is impossible,'' Yastrzhembsky told
a news conference.

By ANDREW ENGLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- The U.S. aid agency may use ports
in Sudan and Somalia, two countries with which the United States
has strained or no diplomatic relations, to deliver emergency aid
to Ethiopian drought victims, a senior official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Aid to the 8 million victims in land-locked Ethiopia is
currently brought through the port of Djibouti, said Hugh Parmer,
assistant administrator of the U.S. Agency for International
Development. But Djibouti cannot handle the amount of food relief
due this year in the agency's expanded humanitarian mission.
</P>
<P>
   As alternatives, Parmer said the agency is looking at Berbera in
northern Somalia, and Port Sudan in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has not had a central government since 1991, and Berbera
is located in a separatist region that calls itself the Republic of
Somaliland, but is not recognized by any country. In 1993, 18 U.S.
Army Rangers were killed in the capital, Mogadishu, by Somalis
during an abortive attempt to seize a leading warlord.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with Sudan, meanwhile, are tense. The United States
withdrew its embassy staff in 1996, claiming Khartoum sponsored
international terrorism, and relations worsened further after U.S.
airstrikes against the country in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Ethiopia's 22-month border conflict with its
neighbor, Eritrea, USAID is unable to make use of the Eritrean
ports of Assab and Massawa, which could cope with the 120,000 tons
per month of food aid the agency intends to ship in, Parmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The war makes the logistical situation much more difficult,''
he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Port Sudan, which would be considered only if Berbera's
freight-handling capacity is insufficient, presents political
problems and has poor infrastructure. But ''the U.S. government
would probably allow it if were really crucial for humanitarian
aid,'' Parmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Parmer is on a tour of Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea, Kenya and
Djibouti, where some 15 million people are threatened by crop
failures resulting from prolonged drought. On Saturday he visits
Somalia, becoming the first senior U.S. official to visit Somalia
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Parmer will fly over Berbera on Saturday to assess road
conditions from the Somali port to Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Ethiopians affected by a two-year drought has
risen from 2.2 million to 7.7 million over the last 12 months,
according to USAID. The agency is also providing emergency relief
to 350,000 displaced people.

<HEADLINE> Aetna's Plan Makes Its Stock Sink  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors dumped shares of beleaguered Aetna
Inc. on Monday, a day after the nation's largest health insurer
rejected a $10 billion takeover bid and unveiled plans to split its
health care and financial services businesses into two publicly
traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people had a lot of hopes for this takeover,'' said
David Shove, an analyst for Prudential Securities. ''A lot people
are disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, hurt by rising medical costs, several class-action
lawsuits and cold relations with doctors and hospitals, said it
plans to divide the company by the end of the year. It was unclear
which business would keep the name of the company founded in 1853.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to separate health and wealth businesses should
create more value for shareholders,'' William H. Donaldson, who was
named chairman and CEO in a management shakeup last month, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But the move was panned by some securities analysts because it
does nothing to fix the company's struggling health insurance
business. The Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna's stock slipped 9
percent, dropping $5.25 to $50.75 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna on Sunday rejected a $70-a-share takeover bid offered last
month from WellPoint Health Networks Inc., a California
managed-care company, and ING Group, a Dutch investment bank and
insurer. WellPoint wanted Aetna U.S. HealthCare, while ING was
interested in Aetna's financial services and international arms.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna officials said the bid was too low and they had doubts the
smaller WellPoint would be able to integrate Aetna's larger health
business.
</P>
<P>
   The entire managed care industry has been in a funk for the past
two years due to rising medical costs and threats of federal
legislation that would expand patients right to sue their HMO.
</P>
<P>
   But Aetna, by virtue of its size, has been a lightening rod for
public criticism of managed care. It also has struggled to digest
recent acquisitions of Prudential HealthCare and NYLCare.
</P>
<P>
   Further, the company faces several lawsuits filed by the same
attorneys who successfully went after Big Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna's former CEO and chairman Richard Huber resigned last
month under the weight of Aetna's falling stock price. Aetna's
stock, which traded as high as $99.87{ last May, has been under
renewed pressure as the company's first quarter results found it
unable to control medical costs as good as the competition.
</P>
<P>
   A bit more than two weeks into his new job, Donaldson has moved
quickly to undo many of Huber's plans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to eliminating Huber's reorganization plan,
Donaldson said Aetna plans to sell up to half of the firm's
international business. Huber had rejected such a strategy and was
trying to build Aetna's brand around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson also said Aetna is considering dropping its
much-criticized ''all or nothing'' clause with doctors, that
requires them to either treat Aetna's low-paying HMO patients or
not treat any of Aetna's patients. Some doctors have filed suit
against Aetna to drop the clause because they believe it gave Aetna
too much power over them.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna plans to cut about $150 million in costs by reducing
technology and advertising spending and reducing staff through
attrition, Donaldson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested the company may shift it core health insurance
offerings from highly restrictive health maintenance organizations
to preferred provider organizations (PPO) plans that don't limit
which hospitals and doctors patients can use.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have said Aetna's financial services business, which
sells annuities and a line of mutual funds, had little in common
with its health insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long term this is a very logical move,'' Jim Lane, an analyst
with Salomon Smith Barney, said of Aetna's plan to divide. ''But it
doesn't do a whole lot for shareholders in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Aetna is unlikely to get any more bidders for its health
business, analysts said many companies might still be interested in
its financial services business.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint said it was disappointed with Aetna's decision, while
ING said it was keeping its options open.

<HEADLINE> Michigan Gets Gas Price Relief  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Gasoline prices are down slightly across the
state this week, AAA Michigan said.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide average price for a gallon of self-serve regular
dropped 3.3 cents to $1.58, the auto club said Monday. In the
Detroit prices, average prices for the same gallon dropped 2.4
cents to about $1.55.
</P>
<P>
   The decrease ends three straight weeks of hefty price increases,
each 5 cents or more.
</P>
<P>
   Prices average 59.2 cents a gallon more than gasoline cost
during the same week last year across Michigan, AAA said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a record high for the state was posted -- nearly $1.62
for a gallon of self-serve regular.
</P>
<P>
   The average retail price of gasoline nationwide, including all
grades and taxes, was about $1.59 per gallon on Friday, up 11.99
cents from Feb. 25, according to the California-based Lundberg
Survey of 10,000 stations.
</P>
<P>
   The costliest gas -- premium at full-service stations -- flirted
with the $2-per-gallon benchmark.
</P>
<P>
   But analyst Trilby Lundberg said consumers could take some
comfort that when adjusted for inflation, the average overall price
is still lower than the record set two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The true high was June 1980, with $2.66 for all grades
combined using today's dollars,'' Lundberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The International Energy Agency reported last week that the
United States and the world's other richest countries have depleted
their oil inventories to the lowest levels in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is worried
about the recent price volatility. Analysts now expect the group to
ease some of the production cuts that it made in 1998 and 1999 to
boost prices.

<HEADLINE> Sears building, railroads, mills among endangered sites  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A 19th century mill, a road lined by
75-year-old elm trees and a 1927 Sears building in Camden are among
10 historic sites in the state fighting for their lives, a
preservation group says.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation New Jersey released its sixth annual list of the
state's ''most endangered historic sites'' on Monday. It has
released names of 10 new sites each year.
</P>
<P>
   One is Pierson's Mill, a 2{-acre complex in Maplewood that
includes an 1830 grist mill and 1840 home owned for six generations
by the same family. The mill stopped working in 1916, but the
family adapted it into a garden supply center over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a major, major structure in our town,'' said Ginny
Kurshan, a member of Preservation Maplewood. ''It's just been there
forever. It's a link to our agrarian past.''
</P>
<P>
   The mill complex is now on the market for $1.65 million, and
Kurshan and others want the buyer to promise to keep the mill
complex from being torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Another site with an uncertain future is the Westside All Wars
Memorial in Atlantic City, a 1924 building constructed to honor
black veterans of all American wars. The building, with an
auditorium, gymnasium, tennis courts and playgrounds, has served as
a recreation center for Atlantic City's black community.
</P>
<P>
   But a leaky roof has caused damage and supporters fear the city,
which owns the building, will soon demolish it to build a parking
lot for hotel and casino employees.
</P>
<P>
   The list also includes a 1927 Sears Roebuck &AMP; Co. building,
built along Admiral Wilson Boulevard in Camden. The long-vacant,
Greek Revival-style building, one of the most modern department
stores in the world when it was opened, is slated for demolition as
part of a state project to clean up the boulevard before the
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this summer.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey Department of Transportation proposal to realign
part of state Route 571 and remove three traffic lights on Route 1
would destroy 15 of the 76 elm trees that line Washington Road in
West Windsor Township, the preservation group said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Road Elm Allee, which leads into the Princeton
University campus, is nearly three-quarters of a mile long. The
60-foot-high Princeton elms were planted in 1925, and the road is
on the state and National Registers of Historic Places.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites listed by Preservation New Jersey include:
</P>
<P>
   --Lustron Homes, steel-paneled residences built by the government
to alleviate a post-World War II housing shortage. Only 16 are
believed to exist in New Jersey, and two in Bergen County -- one in
Closter, the other in Alpine -- are in danger of demolition because
of development pressures, the society says.
</P>
<P>
   --Ferracute Machine Company, founded in Bridgeton in the late
1800s by inventor Oberlin Smith, who later became famous for
inventing magnetic recording. The company shut down in 1968 and the
building is vacant and its owner faces bankruptcy problems.
</P>
<P>
   --Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse, built between 1906
and 1908 in Jersey City to house the generators that powered the
train stations and tunnels linking New York City and New Jersey.
The city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which
co-own the vacant, brick structure with ornamental steel-framed
windows, are considering tearing it down to make room for
development along the Jersey City waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   --Morris-Saltar-Hartshorne-Tredwell House, a Rumson home which
passed through four owners, one who operated it as an inn. Part of
the home dates to 1711, making it one of the oldest in the state.
Some residents want to tear it down to build four new homes.
</P>
<P>
   --Hackett-Strang House, an 1864-era farmhouse in Mannington
Township that sits in at least 2,000 contiguous acres of farmland.
Salem County is prepared to buy the farm with farmland preservation
funds that require the owner to protect the farmland, but not the
house, the society says.
</P>
<P>
   --Betsy Frazee House, a Scotch Plains home built between 1720 and
1740 where Lord Cornwallis was said to have stopped with his troops
when he smelled Frazee's baking bread during the Battle of Short
Hills. The building has been neglected for decades.

<HEADLINE> Ex New York Governor Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Malcolm Wilson, who served as caretaker
governor of New York for a year after Nelson Rockefeller resigned
in 1973, died Monday at 86.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative Republican, Wilson was Rockefeller's lieutenant
governor for 15 years before stepping into the top spot. Eight
months later, Rockefeller was appointed vice president by President
Ford after Richard Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson ran for governor in his own right in 1974, losing to
Democrat Hugh Carey in the post-Watergate backlash that engulfed
GOP candidates across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Wilson had a career in banking and law.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent surgery for an aortic aneurysm in 1991 and had been
in failing health in recent years. A family friend said Wilson died
at his daughter's home in New Rochelle.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson served in the Navy during World War II, seeing action
during the Normandy invasion.

<HEADLINE> Clear Channel To Sell 12 Stations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Radio One Inc., one of the largest
broadcasting companies targeting black listeners, has agreed to buy
12 stations in seven cities from Clear Channel Communications Inc.
for $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio-based Clear Channel is selling about $4 billion
worth of stations to meet regulators' demands for approving its
pending merger with Dallas-based AMFM Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Radio One, based in Lanham, Md., would buy KBFB-FM in Dallas,
KBXX-FM and KMJQ-FM in Houston, KKBT-FM in Los Angeles, WJMO-AM and
WZAK-FM in Cleveland, WVCG-AM in Miami, WJMZ-FM in Greenville,
S.C., and WFXC-FM, WFXK-FM, WNNL-FM and WQOK-FM in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Clear Channel operates 874 radio and 19 television stations in
the United States and has equity interests in more than 240 radio
stations internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Radio One, which also said Monday it will buy six stations in
Charlotte, N.C., and Savannah, Ga., from Davis Broadcasting Inc.,
and three stations in Indianapolis from Shirk Inc., would own 48
stations if the deals are closed.
</P>
<P>
   Radio One chief executive Alfred C. Liggins III said the deal
would transform his company into the second-largest U.S. operator
of urban radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Clear Channel were down 12{ cents, to $62, in trading
Monday on the New York Stock Exchange. Radio One shares fell $2.31\

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen, Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A slump on Wall Street pushed the dollar to a
six-week low against the Japanese yen on Monday, but the U.S.
currency recovered some of its losses as the stock market recovered
a bit from its early lows.
</P>
<P>
   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 96.49 cents, up
from 96.16 cents late Friday. The dollar also was quoted at 105.55
Japanese yen, down from 106.22. The dollar fell to 104.83 yen early
Monday, its lowest level since Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled on Wall Street in early trading Monday.
Technology shares were especially battered as investors cashed in
on the recent dramatic gains in the sector.
</P>
<P>
   As overseas investors sold their stocks, they then sold their
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But stocks did manage to bounce back from the early lows,
helping lift the dollar late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 18.31 to 9,947.13, having
recovered from a loss of as much as 190.49 points within minutes of
the opening of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, down as much as 209.36 in the early
going, regained some lost ground but still had its fourth-worst
point drop ever. It fell 141.30 to close at 4,907.32.
</P>
<P>
   The slump in U.S. stocks added to an already difficult day for
the dollar against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   Investors shrugged off a new government report showing that
Japanese gross domestic product -- the total value of goods and
services -- fell 1.4 percent in the October-December quarter. It was
the second consecutive quarter of GDP decline, meaning the economy
was technically back in recession.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing numbers, however, were not considered a sign
that Japan's economy was headed further downhill, and government
officials were quick to point out hopeful indicators, such as a
rise in capital expenditure.
</P>
<P>
   The 4.6 percent increase in corporate capital investment -- the
first rise in nine months -- encouraged many investors to begin
buying yen.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. currency was also lower Monday against the euro on
speculation that the European Central Bank may tighten monetary
policy as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   A newspaper report said that Wim Duisenberg, president of the
ECB, may boost interest rates at this week's ECB council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6698 Swiss francs,
down from 1.6730, and 1.4617 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4580. The
British pound rose to $1.5785 from $1.5768.
</P>
<P>
   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0269
German marks, down from 2.0333; 6.7978 French francs, down from
6.8194; and 2,006.60 Italian lire, down from 2,012.96.

<HEADLINE> Garry Kasparov: touting chess as an aggressive sport, on theInternet  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- World chess champion Garry Kasparov travels the
world -- but never with a chessboard.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he trains on a laptop that sat in his Manhattan hotel
suite Monday. Inside were his secret strategies for a worldwide
Internet tournament against 30 young opponents -- all at once, and
live from Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   But Kasparov kept his personal computer far away from any
Internet link.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want anything to happen to that database, for it to
get out,'' said the Russian, his eyes flashing across the American
room with an amused, sly smile.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, starting at 4 p.m., a giant screen is to broadcast
the Internet games in Times Square while Kasparov's moves are
beamed from a studio behind it. Among his opponents, all teen-agers
or younger, 10 were to play him from chessboards there and 20
others make electronic moves in countries from India to Uruguay,
Indonesia and China, and across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ''United Nations of Chess'' is to unroll live at
www.KasparovChess.com. The site, to be officially launched Tuesday,
offers live coverage of international chess events, as well as
lessons aimed at beginners, pick-up games against both humans and
the computer, and chess products.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of my missions in launching this site is to engage more of
the world's children in chess,'' says Kasparov, who has helped
schools all over the globe start chess programs. In New York, a
study showed that disadvantaged kids learning chess have improved
their academic test scores.
</P>
<P>
   ''It teaches them how to assume responsibility for their own
action,'' says Kasparov. ''Because in the game of chess, no one is
going to help you, and at the end of the game, you pay for your
mistakes. If you lose, there's no one to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the top players in Tuesday's games were more than a half
dozen youths from the greater New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Kasparov's site also is hosting the World Chess Championship --
games involving 600 schools that began competing March 1. The
series ends in June, with the winner invited to play Kasparov
face-to-face.
</P>
<P>
   To this champion, his cerebral game is definitely a sport -- the
second most popular after soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But at 36, he's a senior among the best players; most champions
are in their 20s. Kasparov says physical training boosts his
concentration and helps keep him on top of ever-younger rivals. He
swims and rows, and does 100 pushups at a time.
</P>
<P>
   And he trains his mind ''by quarrying information,'' says
Kasparov, gesticulating with the quick, agile movements of an
athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me it's very important to feed my brain with
information,'' he says. ''Unfortunately, there's quite a lot of
garbage around. But still, I believe I could reprocess the
information and find the real flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is his playing style, which he calls ''dynamic chess,
with a lot of aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   From his Moscow home, he roams the world about seven months of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   This week in New York, he spread a huge map on his hotel room
floor. Then he and his 6-year-old daughter Polina crawled around
pegging flags on the countries he has visited, 45 in all. He plans
to take the girl, who lives in New Jersey with his ex-wife, to her
dream spot, the jungles of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   While he carries a Russian passport, Kasparov is a native of the
former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, born to a Jewish father.
</P>
<P>
   From his Moscow home, he keeps tabs on Russia's unstable
political scene, occasionally writing newspaper editorials. But
several years ago, when he realized his opinions couldn't change
Russia's course, he decided to focus on the field where ''I can
make a difference,'' he says -- chess and education.
</P>
<P>
   And now, high-tech chess.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is an ideal medium for the game, which has all but
failed on television against more visually active sports. ''On
television, basketball looks better, tennis looks much better,''
says Kasparov. ''On the Internet, it's the other way around. We can
establish the link between chess and the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with his new activity, the remarried father of a
3-year-old son has ''put some more order in my life,'' he says.
''If your mind is disturbed, if you are jumping from one subject to
another, it's difficult to generate enough energy for winning, and
resisting tension.''
</P>
<P>
   And everybody, he adds, ''expects me to win.''
</P>
<P>
   He has delivered -- with the knockout confidence that once
belonged to Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that my performance in the past years is unprecedented
in the sport,'' he says matter-of-factly. ''There's no one in the
history of any game where one person was crowned No. 1 14
consecutive years.''

<HEADLINE> US Talking To N. Korea on Terrorism  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a move to smooth relations, the Clinton
administration is advising North Korea how it can clear its record
on terrorism and take a big step toward economic ties with the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   A declaration renouncing terrorism is a likely precondition.
Another is expulsion of terrorism suspects.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is one of seven countries branded by the State
Department as a sponsor of terrorism. Under law, this bars all but
humanitarian aid to the Pyongyang government and rules out
international bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced the opening of
discussions on terrorism at a joint news conference here with South
Korean Foreign Minister Lee Joung-Binn.
</P>
<P>
   She said Michael Sheehan, director of the U.S. office to counter
terrorism, had taken up the subject in talks with North Korea in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   The secrecy-shrouded talks have recessed for the two delegations
to consult with their capitals, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said South Korea had not been a target of North Korean
terrorism for years. His statement in response to a question could
improve North Korea's chances.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the two Koreas remain locked in an armed standoff,
the Communist North appears eager to break out of its isolation and
the South seems eager to help.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lee said, ''U.S.-South Korea relations are as strong
as ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks in New York are aimed mostly on arranging a visit by a
top North Korean official to Washington. A possible candidate to
head the delegation is Kang Sok Ju, North Korea's first deputy
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang was put on the terrorism list because of involvement
in the midair bombing of a South Korean airliner near Burma, now
Myanmar, in 1987. All 115 people on board the Korean Air plane
died.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea lost a strong ally with the collapse of the Soviet
Union a decade ago. It is pursuing normal relations with Japan, and
stepping up its overtures to already-friendly China while also
approaching the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed ''the
increasingly positive signs'' on the divided Korean peninsula and
strongly endorsed the quick resumption of a dialogue between North
Korea and South Korea, a U.N. spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''While the issues in question remain most challenging, he
believes that they can be successfully addressed through dialogue
and determination,'' spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   On request, Annan is ready ''to contribute to the efforts aimed
at reducing tensions and promoting mutual confidence in the
region'' and looks forward to a North Korean visit to Washington,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
   In a ceremony here, Albright and Lee signed an agreement to end
the practice of having Americans and South Koreans who work in each
other's countries paying social security taxes to both governments.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Congress objects, the double-taxation will end probably
next April. Several thousand American and South Korean workers will
be affected.

<HEADLINE> Adventists Sue Over Use of Name  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The national headquarters of the Seventh-day
Adventist Church asked a federal judge Monday to bar a West Palm
Beach church it considers ''a hate group'' from using the
denomination's trademark name.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper and radio advertising run nationally by the Eternal
Gospel Church of Seventh-day Adventists denounces Catholics and
most Protestants for worshipping on Sunday, likening them to
satanists and pagans.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Tew, an attorney for the national denomination, called
the offshoot church ''a hate group'' and branded the campaign ''a
classic case of a breakaway church trying to use the mother
church's name.'' The name ''Seventh-day Adventist'' was registered
as a trademark in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pershes, the attorney for the West Palm Beach church,
told U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King that ''Seventh-day
Adventist'' is a generic term describing the religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we have here is the trademark law being used in a
religious context when it was intended to be used commercially,''
Pershes argued. ''One particular religion, even if it's a large
segment of the religion, should not be allowed to get a monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   The court fight has attracted worldwide interest among the
denomination's 10 million followers.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Standish, an evangelical pastor from Melbourne,
Australia, plans to testify in support of church pastor Rafael
Perez's right to use the Adventist name.
</P>
<P>
   ''The issue is vital to religious liberty,'' Standish said
outside court. ''Anyone who wants to can call themselves a
Seventh-day Adventist, but you must remember there's a day of
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The religion's name is based on its two basic tenets of honoring
Saturday as the Sabbath and anticipating the second coming of
Christ.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Stances on Health Care  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A look at health care proposals of Republican George
W. Bush and
Democrat Al Gore:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bush:
</P>
<P>
   Coverage-Tax Breaks: Expand tax-protected medical savings
accounts so anyone who wants to set one up to help cover health
costs may do so. Allow tax deductibility of long-term care
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare: Keep as a federal commitment but offer ''more choice
and more private sector alternatives for the elderly.'' Supports
unspecified drug benefit, and subsidies to help poorest of the
elderly afford supplementary or alternative coverage.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs: Favors requirement that patients be covered for hospital
emergency care, that women be able to go directly to gynecologist,
and patients with ongoing illnesses not be forced to change
doctors, among other protections. Also favors independent review
process and ultimate avenue for legal action by patients, but says
any federal move on this front should not supersede protections in
place in states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore:
</P>
<P>
   Coverage: Expand Children's Health Insurance Program, which
subsidizes premiums for working poor. Plan would offer subsides to
more children, plus their parents, in families that earn too much
now to qualify but not enough to afford private insurance on their
own. Also would allow children of wealthier families into the
program, with families paying the full cost.
</P>
<P>
   Tax breaks: 25 percent tax credit for people who buy private
health insurance because they don't get it at work. People who do
get insurance at work would also get a 25 percent tax credit on
premiums -- if the company has fewer than 50 employees and joins a
''purchasing coalition'' to negotiate affordable rates.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare: Add prescription drug benefit and let uninsured
Americans aged 55 to 65 buy into Medicare coverage. Drug plan would
offer free coverage for low-income recipients, catastrophic
coverage for all, and optional cost-sharing benefit for others with
premiums of $44 a month when phased in.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs: Supports right of patients to ''independent appeal'' when
denied treatment, guaranteed coverage of emergency room treatment,
and ''redress'' for actions of the HMO, among other protections.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. May Change Primary Rules  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Stung by accusations that he had tried to
stack the deck in New York's primary for George W. Bush, Gov.
George Pataki is proposing to make things more open next time
around.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's proposal, announced Monday, would allow all nationally
recognized Republican presidential candidates onto the New York
ballot and make the state's primary a winner-take-all contest for
the party. New York Republicans would also get to vote directly for
the candidates, not for delegates as is currently the rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Campaigns should not get bogged down needlessly by
technicalities that draw attention away from the candidates'
ideas,'' Pataki said in a statement on his proposal.
</P>
<P>
   State GOP Chairman William Powers, citing the results of last
week's primary, said Monday that ''winner-take-all looks pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic Chairwoman Judith Hope said the changes would be
''just another way of rigging the primary'' for the party
favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   New York Democrats apportion their delegates based on the vote
for each candidate competing in the party's state primary. In last
week's New York GOP primary, Bush won at least 67 of the 93
delegates at stake. Sen. John McCain took the rest. Pataki ran the
Texas governor's campaign in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and Powers led an unsuccessful effort to use the state's
complex ballot access rules to keep everyone but Bush off the March
7 primary ballot. McCain took to calling Pataki and Powers
''comrade'' and compared the New York ballot access rules to the
old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge's order eventually opened the ballot to McCain.
Publisher Steve Forbes, who had pulled out of the race before the
primary, and Alan Keyes were also on the New York ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pataki's plan, all GOP presidential candidates who
qualified for matching federal funds would have spots on the New
York GOP ballot. Also, the two Republican members of the
four-person state Board of Elections could add other Republicans,
designating them nationally recognized candidates. Other candidates
seeking to get on the GOP ballot would have to collect the
signatures of 5,000 party members.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, all GOP candidates must collect signatures from party
members in any of the state's 31 congressional districts in which
the candidates want to field delegate slates. There are, in effect,
31 mini-primaries with three GOP delegates elected in each
congressional district.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria City Blacked Out  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Doctors treated patients in a parking lot
Monday as Nigeria's commercial capital struggled for a fifth day
with almost no electricity or water supply.
</P>
<P>
   The poorer areas of the city were in almost complete darkness,
while women and children carrying jars on their heads roamed the
city in search of water. Seventy percent of Lagos' water comes from
an electricity-dependent plant on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The government-owned National Electric Power Authority shut down
its nationwide network Thursday after its thermal power generating
systems in Lagos broke down. An explosion at a hydroelectric plant
in northern Niger State compounded the company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Power was restored to some parts of the country on Sunday, but
not at sufficient levels to power many domestic appliances.
Businesses across the city were forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our work has come to a complete halt,'' said Emeka Okafor, who
supplies computers to banks and oil firms. ''We have computers to
supply but we cannot send them out without testing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even hospitals with generators were forced to reschedule
surgeries because the trickle of electricity available was
insufficient to power some equipment.
</P>
<P>
   A surgery intern was suturing the wounds of an injured man in
the parking lot at Lagos Island General Hospital, where he could
get light from a building across the street which was powered by
its own generator.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can see the conditions we're working under. Patients can
die, and there's nothing we can do,'' Dr. Folabi Grillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Power failures are common in Nigeria, earning NEPA the nickname
''Never Enough Power Anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A NEPA spokesman said the company had received inadequate
funding over the years to maintain its plants, warning that power
failures were likely to persist until a major overhaul was done.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until adequate funds are made available, we are going to be in
this unfortunate situation,'' said Malam Muhammed Mousa-Booth, a
NEPA public relations official.

<HEADLINE> Report Coming on FBI Files Probe  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moving a step closer to wrapping up his
investigation, Independent Counsel Robert Ray said Monday he is
filing a final report this week on the White House's improper
gathering of FBI background files.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the first of three involving President Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton that will be completed in the coming months.
The reports are likely to be publicly released by a panel of three
federal appeals court judges as the November general elections draw
near.
</P>
<P>
   One coming out this spring will deal with the role of Mrs.
Clinton, a candidate for the U.S. Senate in New York, in the firing
of White House travel office staff. Another report on the Clintons'
Whitewater land dealings will follow sometime this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the timing, the judges might not issue the
Whitewater report until after the election. The Clintons and others
named in the document would have 90 days to respond to any
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have been through six years and $60 million'' worth of
investigations, presidential spokesman Joe Lockhart said at the
White House. ''It's certainly our hope that they report out in a
way that's done quickly ... that's consistent with the statute and
done without regard to politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, declined to
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month, Mrs. Clinton said the Independent
Counsel's investigation ''has nothing to do with any of my campaign
decisions or how I'm trying to present myself.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't do anything about what other people say or do and at
the end of the day there's no there there,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   One issue in the FBI files probe was whether Mrs. Clinton was
behind the hiring of White House security aide Craig Livingstone,
whose office collected FBI background files on hundreds of people,
including Republican appointees from prior administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said she had no role in Livingstone's hiring. An
FBI report quoted former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum as
saying that Livingstone had been highly recommended by the first
lady. Nussbaum said he had been misquoted in the FBI report.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says the files were mistakenly gathered based on
outdated lists of White House passholders.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was questioned in January 1998 about the FBI files
controversy by then-prosecutor Kenneth Starr's office. Ray took
over for Starr, who stepped aside last October.
</P>
<P>
   The report on the travel office will assess whether Mrs. Clinton
had a larger role than she or presidential aides have acknowledged
in the mass firings at the travel office in 1993, which took place
amid a White House-inspired FBI criminal investigation of the
operation.
</P>
<P>
   A White House memo that surfaced 2{ years after the dismissals
said Mrs. Clinton was the key figure in the dismissals, which the
first lady has denied being a part of.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitewater report will deal in part with Mrs. Clinton's
legal work for her business partners' failing Arkansas savings and
loan -- work that wasn't revealed until her law firm billing records
turned up inside the White House under still-unexplained
circumstances. Before the records appeared, Mrs. Clinton testified
she knew almost nothing about the deal.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Georgia company is recalling 18,600 pounds
of chicken breast fritters that may have been sold in packages that

Kentucky, Tennessee, Kansas, Florida, Oklahoma, Arizona, Ohio,
North Carolina and Pennsylvania, according to the Agriculture
Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>

<HEADLINE> AM-CT--Murder in Greenwich, Conn Bjt,690  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Michael Skakel's arraignment in the
25-year-old murder of Greenwich teen-ager Martha Moxley is expected
to have all the drama of a celebrity trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy cousin, who will be arraigned Tuesday, is expected
to draw a media horde, as well as friends of his high-powered
family and a familiar figure from the O.J. Simpson trial. Former
Los Angeles police Detective Mark Fuhrman, who wrote a 1998 book
about the Moxley case, has been hired by ABC as a consultant to
provide commentary on the case for ''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, the 39-year-old nephew of the late U.S. Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy, will be arraigned as a juvenile because he was 15 when
Moxley, also 15, was bludgeoned to death with a golf club on Oct.
30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Under confidentiality laws designed to protect juveniles, such
proceedings are generally closed to the press and public.
</P>
<P>
   But Judge Maureen Dennis, acting on a request from five
newspapers and The Associated Press, ruled last week that the media
would be allowed in the courtroom. The judge agreed with the
newspapers' argument that Skakel has already effectively waived his
juvenile confidentiality rights, both because he is an adult and
because his name and the charges against him are already well-known
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's attorney, Michael Sherman, said he is uncertain whether
Skakel will enter a plea during the arraignment. The proceeding is
expected to last just a few minutes, as Skakel is formally
presented in court and the murder charge against him is read.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel denies any involvement in Moxley's death. The case went
unsolved for more than two decades until an investigative grand
jury was convened in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although the grand jury proceedings were closed to the public,
prosecutors said in court documents that they were told by former
students at the Elan school in Poland Spring, Maine, that Skakel
made ''admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley'' while he was
a student there from 1978 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel was arrested in January after Judge George Thim -- acting
as a one-man grand jury -- ruled there was enough evidence to charge
him in Moxley's murder.
</P>
<P>
   Moxley's mother, Dorthy, said Skakel's arraignment is a critical
step in her long quest to bring her daughter's killer to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like a miracle, after all this time,'' said Mrs.
Moxley, who plans to be in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Martha's brother, John, who was 17 when his sister was murdered,
also plans to be there. But both he and his mother said they will
be there to support prosecutors, not out of any desire to confront
Skakel, who they have not seen since he was a 15-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I never had to see him, it would be fine with me,'' said
John Moxley. ''I don't need to look him in the eye. I'm going (to
the arraignment) for my own peace of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said Skakel will have some of his own supporters,
including friends and family members, in the courtroom. He would
not say which members of the Skakel clan will attend.
</P>
<P>
   ''The key thing is to focus on what's important here, and that
is a fair trial and the presumption of innocence,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel is the son of Rushton Skakel Sr., who is the
brother of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman, who named Michael Skakel as the killer in his 1998
book, ''Murder in Greenwich,'' has been hired by ABC as one of
several consultants who will provide commentary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's one of many voices we'll have on the subject. Basically,
he was chosen for his insight and knowledge of the case,'' said
Sonya McNair, a publicist for ''Good Morning America.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has generated such widespread press attention that
Stamford court officials set up a pool of reporters to cover the
arraignment because there are not enough seats in the courtroom to
accommodate the media crush.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeding will be held in the civil courthouse in Stamford
rather than a smaller juvenile courtroom.

<HEADLINE> Ex Officials Back Clinton on China  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, bowing to
congressional criticism about secret trade deals, will release the
full text of its market-opening agreement with China on Tuesday,
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   These officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Monday that the complete text of the deal would be sent to each
member of Congress and released to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   The decision represents an about-face for the administration,
which had been insisting that it could not make the deal public
because China was still in negotiations with Europe and other
countries over the terms under which it will enter the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a US-China deal reached in Beijing in November, China agreed
to remove barriers that American exporters have long complained are
keeping billions of dollars of their products out of the Chinese
market.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Clinton administration said it would support
China's entry into the WTO. But under WTO rules, Congress must
scrap its annual review of China's trade status and grant it
permanent normal trade relations in order for U.S. exporters to
receive the benefits of the cuts in tariffs and other trade
barriers. Permanent normal trade relations status is enjoyed by
almost all countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The full text of the November agreement has been available to
members of the House and Senate and staff members with appropriate
security clearances for reading in secure reading rooms. But
lawmakers had complained that the secrecy was difficult to justify.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert urged the administration Monday to
make public all details of the agreement ''so that all the elements
of this agreement are ready for responsible consideration by
Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have insisted that all of the
agreement's details were released in November when the deal was
announced even though the exact text of the document was withheld.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents in the labor and environmental movements have said
such a major change in U.S. policy should not be voted on without
both sides having a chance to examine the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the administration released a letter signed by six
former secretaries of state urging Congress to grant China
permanent normal trade relations.
</P>
<P>
   Henry A. Kissinger, Alexander M. Haig, George P. Shultz, James
A. Baker III, Lawrence Eagleburger and Warren Christopher wrote
that the permanent trade status and membership in the World Trade
Organization would help move China toward a more open society.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents, including human rights advocates, argue that
abandoning an annual review would eliminate a potent weapon in
trying to influence China's policies.
</P>
<P>
   The China trade legislation is supported by the Republican
leadership and a large majority of Republicans in the House,
Hastert said in a speech to the Electronic Industries Alliance. If
House Democratic support is as weak as has been reported, ''I
cannot solve this problem for the president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert urged Clinton to do more to try to rally Democratic
support to overcome opposition from labor unions and human-rights
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, the Chinese foreign trade minister, Shi Guangsheng,
said if Congress refused to grant his government permanent
low-tariff trading rights, China would deny American companies
access to Chinese markets. That, he said, would cause the United
States ''regret, for 20 years, for a generation.''

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformer Had Death Threats  </HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- An Iranian reformer gravely
wounded in an assassination attempt had received death threats
since he began probing the slayings of five dissidents by the
Intelligence Ministry, a colleague said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Hajjarian, who remains in a coma after being shot Sunday
by an unidentified gunman, knew much about Iran's shady
Intelligence Ministry, which he had helped found after the 1979
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Journalist Akbar Ganji said he and Hajjarian -- who runs the
Sobh-e-Emrouz daily newspaper -- had called for answers about the
killings of the five political dissidents in 1998. Using his
contacts at the ministry, Hajjarian is believed to have been the
source for exposes that Ganji wrote about the killings, although
Hajjarian once denied that he had leaked the information.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hajjarian played a big role in exposing those behind the
serial killings, and for that he had received many, many death
threats in recent months,'' Ganji said after visiting Tehran's Sina
Hospital, where Hajjarian was in intensive care. His doctor said
his condition had improved slightly, but friends said he was
fighting for his life.
</P>
<P>
   In a Sobh-e-Emrouz article Monday, Ganji wrote that ''His Gray
Eminence'' -- believed to be a veiled reference to former
Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahian -- had never forgiven Hajjarian
for attempting to find out who was behind the dissidents' killings.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1999, the Intelligence Ministry admitted the killings
of five writers and intellectuals associated with the opposition
had been carried out by ''rogue'' ministry agents. President
Mohammad Khatami subsequently overhauled the ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian angered the hard-liners by making what they considered
to be provocative statements during last month's parliamentary
elections, which the hard-liners lost for the first time since the
1979 Islamic revolution brought the Shiite Muslim clergy to power.
</P>
<P>
   Once a hard-liner himself, Hajjarian began to speak out for
freedom of expression and greater political plurality after being
silenced for opposing the presidency of Hashemi Rafsanjani, who
stepped down in 1997. Hajjarian later became an adviser to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, witnesses said two men on a motorcycle approached
Hajjarian, who was a city councilor, outside the municipal council
offices in central Tehran. One aimed a handgun at Hajjarian and
fired two shots from less than three feet away. One of the bullets
hit Hajjarian in the face, then lodged at the back of his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami visited Hajjarian in the hospital Monday night,
following a visit by U.S.-based neurosurgeon Jamshid Ghajar. Iran
had asked Ghajar to return to the country to treat Hajjarian.
</P>
<P>
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but pro-reform
newspapers and Hajjarian's reformer allies blamed hard-liners. The
motorbike had a high-capacity engine that only security forces and
police can use.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in northern Tehran on Monday, several mortar rounds
hit an apartment complex, injuring two people. An opposition group
trying to overthrow the Islamic government claimed responsibility
for the attack, which appeared unrelated to the one on Hajjarian.

<HEADLINE> Report: Water Should Cost More  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Water is too cheap, and selling it should be a
good business, says a commission trying to keep the world's
depleted fresh water supplies from drying up.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will not get conservation, stoppage of waste, adoption of
appropriate techniques and private-sector investment unless you can
get the full cost back,'' said Ismail Serageldin, a World Bank vice
president who heads the World Commission on Water for the 21st
Century.
</P>
<P>
   This would require subsidies for the estimated 1 billion poor
people who do not have access to safe water or the 2 billion who
lack water for proper sanitation, Serageldin said. But he said
subsidies should no longer go to water utilities, which are often
inefficient and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   With communications, oil and power generation offering far more
lucrative investments for tapping into global needs, relatively few
companies around the world are in the water business. Most people
depend on governments that are not doing a very good job, says the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 6 percent of the world's water is managed by private
companies, Serageldin said, citing the limited cost recovery that
can be expected from water businesses -- about 25 percent, compared
to 140 percent for telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our attitudes on managing water must change,'' Serageldin said
in an interview. ''In the name of the poor, we've been defending
these absurd pricing policies that result in the poor not getting
any access to water because they get rationed out.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, in a report last year, described systems in
place around the world where the poorest people actually pay more
than the rich for limited and often unsafe water.
</P>
<P>
   The new report proposes full-cost pricing of water combined with
subsidies for the poor, increased private investment in water
development, regulation that gives people who need the water final
say over its management, global sharing of successful practices,
and strong environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
   Serageldin said the commission believes annual investment in
water development of up to $80 billion will have to be doubled,
with most coming from private industry.
</P>
<P>
   The commission sites successful community efforts at water
development in Karachi, Pakistan, and in Brazil as examples of
grassroots water development that is needed.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that governments explore creative ways of funding
and managing water, including ''water stamps'' for the poor to be
used to buy water the way Americans get foods stamps, or providing
for a bidding to run water projects that would encourage
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are imaginative ways in which to do this,'' Serageldin
said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is presenting its report to the Second World
Water Forum starting this weekend in The Hague. The commission's 20
members come from global, government and non-government agencies
and organizations.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Stumble on Selloff Overseas  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks stumbled Monday in the wake of a
widespread selloff abroad. Technology shares came under intense
selling pressure following the dramatic rise in the sector in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 141.38, or 2.8 percent, to close
at 4,907.24, its fourth-worst point drop in history. The damage was
even more intense in the opening minutes of trading, when the index
was down as much as 209.36 points, or 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the wave of selling to investors eager to
lock in profits from the Nasdaq's sharp rise this year. The index,
dominated by technology stocks, was up 24 percent as of Friday's
close, and even after Monday's selloff is up 21 percent since the
start of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Other market indicators fared better. The Dow Jones industrial
average rose 18.31 to 9,947.13, having recovered from a loss of as
much as 190.49 points, or 1.9 percent, in the early going.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 11.45 to 1,383.62 and the Russell
2000 index of smaller companies, which has also risen to new
records in recent sessions, fell 13.67 to 590.14.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing the reflection of investors' nervousness, but
overall, the outlook remains strong,'' said John Shaughnessy, chief
investment strategist at Advest Inc. of Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks fell steeply at the opening bell, after financial markets
in Asia and Europe dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the decline was Japan's Nikkei stock average, which fell
2.8 percent after the Japanese government announced the economy
shrank more than expected in the last quarter of 1999. It was the
second consecutive quarterly decline of the gross domestic product,
meaning the economy was technically back in recession.
</P>
<P>
   Investors had hoped that an economic recovery in Japan would
compensate for any slowdown in the United States in the coming
years.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in Asian markets set off selling in Europe too.
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down 1.5 percent, Germany's Xetra DAX index
fell 3.5 percent and France's CAC-40 fell 2.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   European analysts also cited profit-taking, noting that
high-flying media, telecommunications and technology shares were
most severely affected.
</P>
<P>
   On Wall Street, technology shares that have performed the best
this year were falling. Qualcomm fell 5 15/16 to 130 3/16, Oracle
fell 2~ to 78} and 3Com lost 4| to 64 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a lot of chatter over the weekend on the Wall Street
(television) shows about the impending doom of the Nasdaq,'' said
Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co., in Kansas City, Mo. ''The market by virtue of its recent
ascent, especially the Nasdaq, has set itself up for a bit of a
correction.''
</P>
<P>
   A few high-profile technology stocks gained ground Monday. Intel
rose 1 15/16 to 122[, helping the Dow contain its losses. Dell rose
3{ to 54} in heavy Nasdaq trading after three Wall Street firms
raised their ratings on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Among Dow components, J.P. Morgan rose 5 15/16 to 112.
</P>
<P>
   Times Mirror, publisher of the Los Angeles Times, soared 37
11/16 to 85| on the New York Stock Exchange after Tribune Co.,
publisher of the Chicago Tribune, agreed to acquire it for $6.3
billion. The combined company would have 11 daily newspapers, 22
television stations, magazines such as Popular Science, and four
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Tribune shares fell 6] to 30 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, and by a 2-to-1 margin on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.24 billion shares, compared with
1.39 billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   Shaughnessy said he anticipates the volatility that marked
Monday's session will endure throughout the week. Later this week,
the government will release its latest Producer Price Index and
Consumer Price Index reports, closely watched barometers of
inflationary pressures in the robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   The market's gyrations in recent weeks have been underpinned by
worries that continued economic growth will encourage the Federal
Reserve to continue raising interest rates this year in an effort
to force a slowdown to a more sustainable expansion. Higher
interest rates are generally bad for stocks, because corporate
profits suffer as it becomes more expensive to borrow money.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's concern that these numbers could be so robust that it
would increase the odds of aggressive Fed tightening,'' Shaughnessy
said. ''So it's probably going to be a wild week.''

<HEADLINE> Tribune a Pioneer in Multimedia  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Tribune Co. has long been aggressive in
seeking out new ways to reach information- and
entertainment-obsessed Americans, from its 1924 acquisition of WGN
Radio to its early involvement in ''new'' media, including a 1991
investment in America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet's transformation of the industry and most
newspapers' move to the World Wide Web have only confirmed and
accelerated that multimedia strategy, Tribune executives said
Monday in discussing the $6.3 billion acquisition of Times Mirror
Co.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our company was one of the pioneers in radio and one of the
pioneers in television,'' Jack Fuller, president of Tribune
Publishing Co., said Monday. ''We've been seeing it that way for
most of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   But the officials also emphasized that the 153-year-old Tribune
remains a newspaper company at its core.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are bullish on the future of newspapers,'' said Scott C.
Smith, publisher and chief executive officer of the Chicago
Tribune, calling newspapers ''the last great medium in any city.''
</P>
<P>
   ''While newspaper audiences have declined modestly over the last
20 years, they've declined less than any TV station's audience
has,'' he said. ''They still have far more share than any cable or
Internet source has.''
</P>
<P>
   Media-watchers say those looking for insight into Tribune Co.'s
plans for its acquisitions, primarily in Los Angeles and New York,
should look at the history of its Chicago holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The company owns the largest-circulation Chicago newspaper, a
leading radio station in WGN, a top television station in WGN-TV
(which it founded in 1948), a 24-hour cable news channel and some
small publications. It reaches about 13 percent of the local market
via the Internet, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   All that adds up to a powerful package for not only consumers
but advertisers, according to analysts, who echo the company's
insistence that all the branching out doesn't mean newspapers are
on the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not that newspapers are becoming weak, it's that there
are so many options,'' said Rudy Hokanson of CIBC World Markets
Corp. in New York. ''If you've got newspapers, broadcast and a
strong Internet presence, you have considerable influence.''
</P>
<P>
   ''(Tribune officials) have a clear vision of what a media
company is now,'' he added. ''They've been very smart operators.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading the Tribune Co. empire is John Madigan, 62, a
Chicago-area native with a background in business administration.
Madigan joined Tribune as chief financial officer in 1975, was the
Tribune's publisher from 1990-94 and became president in 1994. He
ascended to chief executive officer in 1995 and chairman in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, the company has significantly expanded its
reach, claiming even before the merger to reach 75 percent of U.S.
households.
</P>
<P>
   Madigan told investors, bankers and analysts last week that
Tribune's multimedia efforts are paying off financially, too. Its
10-month-old Tribune Interactive, created to manage Internet
activities, is on track to generate $30 million in revenue this
year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced a 23 percent investment in iBlast Networks, a
national wireless network to deliver speedier Web downloads of
digital media to consumers, the creation of a new sports Web site
for Chicago, and other moves.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're aggressively moving to exploit multimedia opportunities
in broadcasting and publishing to their fullest extent,'' he said
then. ''The value of mass media assets is increasing in today's
fragmented world.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Candidate Behind Bars  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bobby Wightman-Cervantes, seeking the
Democratic nomination to take on Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, won't be out glad-handing voters or passing out campaign
leaflets at polling places during Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   He's in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The gadfly lawyer, one of five little-known Democrats vying for
the nomination, was arrested at his Dallas home Thursday night and
is serving a 90-day sentence for contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview Monday from a Dallas County jail,
Wightman-Cervantes accused the Dallas judicial establishment of
incarcerating him because of his allegations of corruption on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did this to get it out in the press to humiliate me and
cost me the election,'' he contended. ''That's what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas County District Judge David Godbey, who found
Wightman-Cervantes in contempt, denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute dates to 1997, when Wightman-Cervantes wrote Godbey
a letter accusing the judge of corruption. He filed a motion to
have Godbey disqualified from hearing a car accident liability case
Wightman-Cervantes had before him at the time. He later sued the
judge for $50 million in a separate lawsuit that ultimately was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Godbey responded by filing a grievance against
Wightman-Cervantes with the State Bar of Texas and instigating the
contempt charges. ''Mr. Wightman, as a lawyer, wrote a letter to me
as judge ... that was contemptuous,'' Godbey said.
</P>
<P>
   Wightman-Cervantes was sentenced to 90 days but remained free as
he made unsuccessful appeals in state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The order says 10 days after any stay is vacated, he is to be
picked up,'' Godbey said. ''And that's what happened. We have no
control over the timing. Mr. Wightman had control over the
timing.''
</P>
<P>
   The sentencing judge held out the possibility of reducing
Wightman-Cervantes' 90-day sentence, due to end June 6, if he
apologizes to Godbey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never,'' said Wightman-Cervantes, who has battled the state
bar's attempt to have him undergo a mental examination.

<HEADLINE> Syria's New PM Names Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syria's new prime minister, Mohammed
Mustafa Miro, formed a new 37-member Cabinet on Monday, charged
with pursuing an overall Middle East peace settlement and boosting
the country's ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   The reshuffle is seen as an effort by President Hafez Assad,
Syria's paramount leader, to press ahead with promised social and
economic reforms. His son and heir apparent, Bashar, said in
remarks published last week that the country was in need of change
in all spheres of life.
</P>
<P>
   Economic stagnation has ''regretfully become the most dangerous
phenomenon that has shrouded the Syrian economy throughout the past
few years,'' the government-run newspaper Tishrin warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Exports declined by 20 percent in 1999 compared to a year
earlier, creating a shortage of hard currency and leading to a drop
in imports and public consumption, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's comment was the first official indication that
lack of economic progress was the reason behind the resignation
last Tuesday of the 8-year-old government of Mahmoud el-Zoubi.
</P>
<P>
   Syria has also entered into peace talks with Israel, although
negotiations stalled in January over the issue of the Golan
Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of el-Zoubi's Cabinet retained their posts in
Miro's new government, including Defense Minister Maj. Gen. Mustafa
Tlas, Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and Interior Minister
Mohamed Harba. Mohamed Imadi also keeps his job as economy
minister.
</P>
<P>
   As in the previous Cabinet, the ruling Baath party had the
lion's share of the ministerial portfolios, taking 26 seats. The
remaining 11 went to the seven parties grouped in the so-called
National Progressive Front, which includes independents and
Communist, Socialist and Nasserite parties.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cabinet, to be sworn in Tuesday, includes two women
ministers and 14 political newcomers.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Supports IMF Nomination  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After rejecting Germany's first candidate,
President Clinton has thrown U.S. support behind banker Horst
Koehler's nomination to head the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton informed German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of his
decision in a telephone call on Monday, according to White House
press secretary Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders agreed that Koehler, president of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development in London, should come to
Washington to meet with IMF board members, particularly
representatives of poor countries.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president and Chancellor Schroeder also agreed that
Koehler should retain the talented management team at the IMF,''
Lockhart said. That would include Stanley Fischer, German-born
American who is acting IMF director.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration blocked Germany's first choice, Caio
Koch-Weser, because the Americans said the deputy finance minister
lacked the international standing needed to run the 182-nation IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, one of three remaining candidates, secured unanimous
European Union backing Monday, as Koch-Weser had done before
Clinton turned him down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's agreement with Schroeder about retention of top IMF
staff was seen as a show of support for Fischer, who was the IMF's
deputy director before taking over as acting chief after Frenchman
Michel Camdessus retired in February.

<HEADLINE> Notre Dame Hires Arizona State AD  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BEND, Ind. (AP) -- Notre Dame hired Arizona State athletic
director Kevin White on Monday to help clean up its once pristine
image, tarnished by the school's first major NCAA violation last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Notre Dame has set the bar very high for a long time,'' White
said. ''I think we need to keep the bar set where it's at and
perhaps take it up a notch.''
</P>
<P>
   White will be the first Notre Dame athletic director to report
directly to the university president in a shakeup of the department
prompted by the school's first NCAA probation. That resulted from
the relationship between a booster and more than a dozen players.
</P>
<P>
   Former athletic director Mike Wadsworth resigned under pressure
last month following a tumultuous five years that included a
downturn in the football program, flirtations with joining the Big
Ten conference and ex-assistant football coach Joe Moore's age
discrimination lawsuit, which the university lost.
</P>
<P>
   School president the Rev. Edward A. Malloy then declared he
would assume control of the athletic department, a responsibility
that executive vice president E. William Beauchamp had for 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''An athletic director needs to be sponsored in that way -- I use
that word carefully -- and needs to have a direct relationship and a
tie-in to the president of the university to realize the most
potential. I just think it's critical,'' said White, sporting a
gold tie with navy stripes.
</P>
<P>
   White, expected to begin his stint at Notre Dame in mid-April,
has a reputation for cleaning up programs. While the athletic
director at Tulane, he helped resurrect the basketball program
after a point-shaving scandal led the university to disband the
team for four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He dealt with another basketball point-shaving scandal while at
ASU, bringing in Rob Evans in 1998 to take over the program.
</P>
<P>
   White also reorganized ASU's fundraising structure, pulling
various independent booster groups into one organization, the Sun
Angel Foundation, which he brought under university control. The
move eased worries that the various bodies created the perception
that an NCAA infraction could easily occur.
</P>
<P>
   He also linked the amount of contributions groups and
individuals make to the university to the benefits they receive.
The move boosted ASU's annual giving from $1.8 million in fiscal
year 1997 to an anticipated $6 million in 2000. It also helped him
turn a $2.97 million deficit into a more than $1 million in surplus
during his first two years in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a chance to try to determine who were the most highly
regarded among the athletic directors at various places in the
country, and one name kept coming up from multiple sources,'' said
Malloy, who headed the university's search.
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old White, and a native of Amityville, N.Y., did his
undergraduate work at St. Joseph's College in Rensselaer, about 70
miles from Notre Dame. He's also served as athletic director at
Maine and Lorras College, a small Catholic school in Dubuque, Iowa.
He holds a master's in athletics administration from Central
Michigan and a doctorate in education from Southern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited because he's excited about being here,'' said
first-year men's basketball coach Matt Doherty, one of several
Irish coaches to attend the announcement. ''You don't leave Tempe,
Ariz., for South Bend, Ind., unless you have a passion for this
place.''

<HEADLINE> Surprise, Worry Greet Media Merger  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT JABLON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Surprise and concern rolled through newsrooms
Monday as word broke that the Tribune Co. will buy Times Mirror Co.
to create the nation's third-largest newspaper empire.
</P>
<P>
   From telephone operators to beat reporters in Baltimore, Los
Angeles, Chicago and cities in between, the announcement of the
$6.3 billion deal was met with the questions: How, what and when?
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hermann, police reporter for The Sun, a Times Mirror daily
in Baltimore, heard about it from a television reporter as they
covered the funeral for a 22-year-old policeman killed last week in
a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'How does it feel to be working for a new company,'''
Hermann said. ''And I said, 'What?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun and the Los Angeles Times convened meetings with
staffers to answer questions about the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sun, Frederick Rasmussen, the newspaper's longtime
obituary writer, said the editorial staff greeted the news with
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's a sense of uneasiness -- I think that's just
natural,'' Rasmussen said. ''There wasn't any gnashing of teeth and
people weren't moaning or groaning or ruing the sale.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Times, Publisher Kathryn Downing told several hundred
workers that the Tribune Co. had committed to preserving the
newspaper's independence and did not envision large layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Some expressed curiosity about why the Chandler family, which
has owned the Los Angeles newspaper since 1882, would initiate the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''With luck, we've got some very good reporters out asking the
Chandlers that question, and I hope to read about it in the Los
Angeles Times,'' Downing replied to laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Others were more subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there are still many more unanswered than answered
questions, and as a result there's a mix of anxiety and
anticipation in the newsroom,'' said longtime columnist Patt
Morrison. ''After 112 years, this is a very big change to absorb in
one morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumors of the acquisition surfaced on Friday, but it was
generally believed that terms of the Chandler Trust forbade such a
sale.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dwyre, the Times' sports editor for 19 years, said if the
paper had to be sold, he was glad it was to the Tribune Co., which
owns four newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune, 22 television
stations and baseball's Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have done a hell of a lot worse,'' he said. ''They
didn't buy this paper to destroy it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times has been the scene of recent turmoil under the
stewardship of Times Mirror chairman and chief executive Mark H.
Willes, who sought to maximize profits by relaxing the traditional
separation between news reporting and the business side of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the newspaper acknowledged it had split about $2
million in advertising revenue from a Sunday magazine devoted to
the Staples Center, a newly opened downtown sports arena.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the tension, Times staff may welcome the change
''because they know a solid newspaper company will be in charge of
the newspaper again,'' said Brett Levy, who works in information
technology.
</P>
<P>
   A wait-and-see attitude prevailed at the Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone is really worried -- it's more like,
'What's going to happen next?,''' said George Gunset, a reporter
who has been with the paper for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Said reporter James Janega: ''I'd rather have my company merge
than get a severance package.''

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Workers Rights Lag in Myanmar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Forced labor, including child labor, are
widespread in Myanmar, and the government ignores workers' rights,
the U.S. Labor Department said in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, required by Congress, updates a 1998 review of labor
conditions in Myanmar, also known as Burma, which reached similar
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Based on findings of the U.S. Embassy in Rangoon, the report
says forced labor is used to construct roads, dikes, canals and
projects to support tourism, military operations and commercial
ventures of the military.
</P>
<P>
   ''The latest report on labor practices in Burma reinforces our
position that the international community must continue to push for
a democratic transition in that country,'' Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman said in a statement accompanying the report.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Forward Suspended  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE SCHREINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky forward Desmond Allison was
arrested on drunken-driving and marijuana possession charges and is
not expected to play in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tubby Smith suspended the 6-foot-5 sophomore on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like losing part of your family,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Kentucky (22-9) plays 12th-seeded St. Bonaventure
in the first round Thursday in the Midwest Regional in Cleveland.
Allison's absence leaves the Wildcats with only nine players.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a real challenge for us to go in and keep our
focus -- both mentally and physically -- against a very good St.
Bonaventure team,'' said Smith, who led Kentucky to a national
title and a regional final in his first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Allison, alone in a black Ford Explorer, registered a
blood-alcohol level of 0.113 on a breath test, a police report
said. The state limit for drivers 21 and older is 0.10. For drivers
under 21, it is 0.02.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer who searched the car, which was registered to
someone other than Allison, found alcohol and less than an ounce of
marijuana, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The vehicle was registered in the name of Marvin Stone's father,
the school's sports information office said. Marvin Stone is a
freshman forward at Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   According to university policy, the 20-year-old Allison will be
suspended temporarily. If convicted, he will be suspended
indefinitely and forfeit his scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said he worried about Allison's suspension becoming a
distraction for his team, coming off an 86-72 loss to Arkansas in
the quarterfinals of the Southeastern Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to use it as a motivating factor to persevere, to
show that we can rekindle that enthusiasm and use it as a real
catapult to help us play better and play together,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Bonaventure coach Jim Baron dismissed any notion that his
Bonnies (21-9) might be catching the Wildcats at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kentucky's been there before and Tubby's a great coach, so we
can't overlook any adversity that they may be going through,''
Baron said. ''We have to worry about ourselves and that's the most
important thing at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison started 29 of Kentucky's 31 games this season, averaging
7.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 2.4 assists. He is the team's top foul
shooter, a 3-point threat and among the team's best passers and
defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's just one of our best all-around athletes on the team, and
when you take away that type of athlete ... we really don't have
anyone on the perimeter that has that type of physical stature,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Camara, a 6-11 sophomore averaging 7.0 points and 4.6
rebounds, will move into the starting lineup. Camara started nine
games this season, and will team with 6-10 center Jamaal Magloire.
</P>
<P>
   Tayshaun Prince, the Wildcats' second-leading scorer at 12.9
points, will switch to small forward, Smith said. Point guard Saul
Smith will slide over to shooting guard at times when his backup,
J.P. Blevins, plays.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said other backup players, like freshman power forward
Marvin Stone and sophomore guard Todd Tackett, must contribute
more.
</P>
<P>
   ''This can give players a sense of urgency that they can
contribute now, that they can do more. ... They know that they've
got to reach down and bring their best game,'' Smith said.

<HEADLINE> Texas Highway Collision Kills 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNI, Texas (AP) -- A car and a tanker-truck collided head-on in
south Texas Monday, killing all seven people in the car,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place on a state highway about 40 miles east
of Laredo, said Webb County Justice of the Peace Alfredo Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The seven were traveling eastbound in a Chevrolet Cavalier that
collided with the westbound 18-wheeler, whose driver was taken to
Mercy Regional Medical Center in Laredo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if the car lost control or the truck lost
control,'' Garcia said. ''We'll have to wait and see what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident was reported at 12:43 p.m. No other information was
available.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been to several accidents and this is the worst one I've
seen,'' Garcia said. ''Believe me, it's a total mess.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Work in India Limited  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Relations between India and Pakistan ''have
sunk to a dangerous level,'' limiting what President Clinton can
accomplish when he visits the two countries next week, foreign
policy experts told the president Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The India-Pakistan tensions ''all too easily could lead to
conflict,'' nearly two dozen experts said in an open letter to
Clinton. Signers included Robert Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to
Pakistan, and Frank Wisner, former U.S. ambassador to India, as
well as experts from think tanks, foundations and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was co-sponsored by the Brookings Institution and the
Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will arrive Sunday evening in India on the first visit
there by a U.S. president in 22 years. On Monday, he will go to
Bangladesh, making the first stop by an American leader. Returning
to New Delhi late that night, Clinton will spend the next four days
in India meeting with leaders, addressing the parliament and
sightseeing with his daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton will go to Pakistan on the first
presidential visit since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan, the world's two newest nuclear
countries, claim the Himalayan territory of Kashmir and have fought
two wars over the area. The two countries came to the brink of war
last summer with a clash that resulted in more than 1,000
casualties. Tensions were heightened further by a military coup
last October in Pakistan and the Christmas-eve hijacking of an
Indian Airlines plane with what many in India believe was
Pakistan's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy experts urged Clinton to set modest goals for
his trip: to build an expanded, post-Cold War relationship with
India, to stem ''the drift toward war'' between India and Pakistan,
to persuade Pakistan to embrace economic reform, the rule of law
and more responsible behavior toward terrorism, and to highlight
the potential success of Bangladesh as a moderate Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any attempt to persuade India to eliminate its nuclear arsenal
will fail and poison the atmosphere for the constructive discussion
of issues,'' the letter to Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   It also urged India and Pakistan to take steps to reduce the
chance of conflict over Kashmir but advised the United States to
get directly involved in diplomacy relating to Kashmir only if all
parties express an interest. India has opposed any outside
mediation, saying that would merely reward Pakistani aggression.

<HEADLINE> Explosion Injures 32 in Argentina  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   USHUAIA, Argentina (AP) -- A powerful explosion ripped through an
industrial park in southern Argentina on Monday, injuring at least
35 people.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters said the blast occurred in a factory where
explosives used in road construction were stored, sparking a fire
that quickly spread to several nearby factories and set off a
second explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Television images showed huge plumes of smoke billowing from the
factory plants as firefighters worked to recover people from inside
the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   They eventually brought the flames under control, but only after
the second blast blew out the windows of houses within in a
500-yard radius of the industrial complex, injuring several
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful blasts reportedly lifted the roof off a nearby
school and forced the evacuation of some 30 students, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least five people working in and around the factories were
hospitalized with severe burns, said Mario Pombo, a spokesman with
the city government of Ushuaia, the world's southernmost city,
1,515 miles south of Buenos Aires. One person was admitted to
intensive care at a local hospital with burns covering almost 90
percent of his body, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters, reporters, and policemen were among those who
suffered minor injuries.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Telekom Looks for Partners  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Deutsche Telekom AG may have backed
off its pursuit of U.S.-based Qwest Communications International
Inc., but the German giant is still on the prowl for an
international partner.
</P>
<P>
   The aborted Qwest deal followed a bungled attempt to buy Telecom
Italia SpA that also ruined its partnership with France Telecom. At
the same time, its Global One alliance with Sprint Corp. and France
Telecom has withered on the vine, chalking up mostly losses.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts are upbeat about Deutsche Telekom's prospects,
noting the telecom titan has money to burn -- and is too big for any
competitor to easily swallow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deutsche Telekom has a significant war chest. I can think of
20 to 25 companies they are looking at,'' said Ian Johnston, a
telecommunications analyst with J.P. Morgan in London. ''It's not a
question of large or small deals. I think they have room for
both.''
</P>
<P>
   With $276 billion in market capitalization, Deutsche Telekom
ranks third in the telecom world behind Britain's Vodafone AirTouch
PLC and Japan's NTT DoCoMo. That makes it an unlikely takeover
target, so it can safely go corporate raiding from the shelter of
its locked-up domestic market, where it generates nearly 90 percent
of its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   A few companies are believed to be at the top of Deutsche
Telekom's shopping list, including Spain's Telefonica, Telecom
Italia Mobile SpA, Cable &AMP; Wireless Communications of Britain and
Bermuda-based Global Crossing Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom chief executive Ron Sommer has made no secret
about his goal of filling in his company's coverage through
international acquisitions. Four areas are key to the strategy:
mobile communication, data transmission aimed at business
customers, Internet networks and e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Nailing down a bigger portion of Europe's quickly expanding
mobile market and catering to high-profit business clients
worldwide are likely to take priority for the former state-owned
monopoly, which is still 65 percent-owned by the German government.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the company would likely seal some kind of deal
before management is distracted this summer with the planned public
offering of T-Online, Deutsche Telekom's Internet service
subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   A pairing with Telecom Italia Mobile or Telefonica is seen as
helping Deutsche Telekom expand into the mobile market -- but
neither is a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Telecom Italia Mobile is owned by Telecom Italia, which rebuffed
Deutsche Telekom's overtures just last year. And analysts are not
enthusiastic about a merger with Telefonica, which would bring
extensive holdings in Latin America -- a market Deutsche Telekom has
traditionally avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Teaming with U.S.-based Qwest would have given Deutsche Telekom
a global foothold in business data transmission, but that deal ran
head-on into a pending merger between Qwest and U S West. Deutsche
Telekom's involvement vaporized last week after it was approached
to buy out both American companies.
</P>
<P>
   Shares were down 5.50 euros, or 5.6 percent, to 92.25 euros
($89.08) Monday in an overall slumping German market.
</P>
<P>
   In the data transmission field, Cable &AMP; Wireless and Global
Crossing still stand out as potential partners. Cable &AMP; Wireless
recently made itself more attractive by selling off its Hong
Kong-based residential service and bulking up on Internet networks.
Global Crossing, meanwhile, has been increasing its global stretch
with an undersea fiber-optic cable network.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts caution that Deutsche Telekom doesn't necessarily
need a blockbuster mega-deal. Instead, it may go after a series of
smaller takeovers.
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year Deutsche Telekom bought out mobile phone
operator One2One, the smallest of Britain's four mobile phone
companies. In February, it took over Lagardere's Club Internet,
France's second largest Internet service provider.

<HEADLINE> Unions, Wal-Mart Clash Over Butchers  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TYLER, Texas (AP) -- The United Food and Commercial Workers is
seeking an injunction against Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to prevent the
giant retailer from eliminating meat cutting departments at 180
stores with prepackaged meat.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which claims that the changes are in retaliation for
union organizing at one of Wal-Mart's stores, asked the National
Labor Relations Board on Monday for assistance in its fight against
the world's biggest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   An injunction would allow the union to continue seeking support
from Wal-Mart workers nationwide while preserving the butchers'
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to eliminate the meat cutters came just weeks after
the butchers at the Jacksonville, Texas, Wal-Mart voted 7-3 to join
the UFCW, the first successful union vote in the country at a
Wal-Mart, a company well known for its opposition to organized
labor.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart adamantly denies that the decision to replace butchers
at 180 of its Supercenters in six states had to do with the
pro-union vote -- or pending elections and organizing drives in
Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart said the change has been under consideration for nearly
a year.
</P>
<P>
   The union, however, argues that the action was a direct response
to the union activities and points out that federal law requires
Wal-Mart to negotiate with it before eliminating the jobs.
</P>
<P>
   UFCW spokesman Greg Denier said the action was an attempt to
deny employees a voice in the workplace. He said Wal-Mart was
responding not only to the Jacksonville vote but to organizing
efforts at about 20 Wal-Marts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, union officials say that Wal-Mart's actions have
strengthened support for organized labor, with employees at dozens
of other stores now seeking representation.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Edwards, a UFCW organizer, said meat cutters and mechanics
at six Texas Wal-Marts will petition for a union vote in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are filling out cards by the droves,'' he said. ''They
know the only way to save their jobs is to reach out to the union
and vote the union in.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Dority, president of the United Food and Commercial
Workers, and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney gathered with a group
of 200 people on Monday in Tyler, Texas, at a rally against
Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wal-Mart may be the biggest retailer and the biggest employer
in the United States, but they are not bigger than the law, they
are not bigger than the American labor movement, and together we
are going to cut them down to size,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica Moser, a spokeswoman for Bentonville, Ark.-based
Wal-Mart, said a majority of Wal-Mart employees have rallied in
support of the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have seven out of 915,000 associates that have voted'' to
unionize, she said. ''Our associates for 38 years have said we
don't want or need union representation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's opposition to unions in its stores is legendary in
business circles.
</P>
<P>
   The company argued unsuccessfully -- all the way to Washington --
that all 300 store employees in Jacksonville, and not just the 10
meat cutters, should have been able to vote on joining a union.
</P>
<P>
   Now it argues that union officials took improper actions to
influence the vote, and a hearing is scheduled for March 28.

<HEADLINE> Fiat, GM Form $2.4 Billion Deal  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN HYDE, AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. and Italian industrial giant
Fiat SpA announced a $2.4 billion alliance Monday in the latest bid
by rival automakers to cut costs by sharing parts and people.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Fiat will swap 20 percent of its Fiat Auto
subsidiary for about 5.1 percent of GM's common stock -- making the
Italian company GM's largest shareholder. Fiat and GM will form
joint ventures in engine building and purchasing that could
eventually involve thousands of workers on two continents.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was aimed at strengthening both companies in Europe,
where competition has become fierce, and Latin America, where many
automakers hope to grow. But GM and Fiat officials emphasized that
competition between the two would remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is cooperation between two companies that want to remain
independent,'' Fiat chairman Paolo Fresco said. In Europe, ''we're
going to compete quite aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance continues a trend among automakers toward
partnerships or mergers that began with the merger of Chrysler
Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG in 1998, and continued with deals between
Ford Motor Co. and Volvo AB, Renault SA and Nissan Motor Co., and
GM and Subaru. In fact, GM and Fiat are competitors in bidding for
troubled South Korean automaker Daewoo Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Automakers believe such deals will cut the massive costs of
designing and building new vehicles by allowing companies to share
components and factories around the world. Such deals are seen as
especially important in Europe and Latin America, where smaller,
less profitable cars are far more popular than in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Fiat said they would form joint ventures in engine
building and purchasing in Europe and Latin America, and would also
look for savings in their financial operations. The companies said
the benefits of the alliance could amount to $1.2 billion in
savings in three years, growing to $2 billion a year within five
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the era when Fiat and General Motors were founded,
automaking was a national or regional affair,'' said GM chairman
Jack Smith. ''Today, automaking has become a global affair.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the agreement, GM has the first right to bid on the
rest of Fiat Auto if Fiat decides to sell in the future, but Fresco
said Fiat had no intention to do so. The deal is subject to
approval by U.S. and European Union regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat -- which with its automaking and other businesses accounts
for about 5 percent of Italy's gross domestic product -- is an
Italian institution, with so much clout that honorary chairman
Gianni Agnelli has been called the uncrowned king of Italy. The
conglomerate is Italy's largest private employer, and has 220,000
employees around the world, including 7,000 at subsidiaries in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the world's seventh-largest automaker has seen sales and
profits slip over recent years, and there have been rumors of
foreign mergers or buyouts. Fiat's share of the Italian market,
once 60 percent, has dwindled to 39 percent as competition eroded
its dominance. And a bet that South America would be a major source
of growth has not paid off yet due to widespread economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fiat Auto posted an operating loss of $116 million
compared to $106 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Agnelli had recently acknowledged that the company was on the
lookout for international partners.
</P>
<P>
   ''We laid down two goals: an alliance as strong as possible, and
autonomy,'' said Agnelli, the 79-year-old leader of Fiat's founding
family, which was reported to have rebuffed overtures from
Germany's DaimlerChrysler AG that have might have meant
surrendering control.
</P>
<P>
   Fiat leaders did not directly answer questions on whether job
cuts would follow but suggested they could, stating that remaining
competitive ultimately was the best way to guarantee employment.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance has already received the blessing of Italy's major
union confederation, CGIL. Its leader, Sergio Cofferati, told the
Rome daily La Republica that the deal would be ''a turning-point
which is good for the Italian economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While a handful of Ferraris are imported to the United States
every year, Fiat has not sold any of its own brands in the United
States since 1993, when it stopped importing Alfa Romeo cars.
Fresco said the alliance might allow Fiat to reintroduce Alfa
Romeos through GM dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of GM were unchanged at $77.81\ at 4:30 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange. U.S. shares of Fiat rose $1.18} to $36.06\,
also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Dallas Teagues' OK's 4-Year Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The Dallas Cowboys have agreed to terms on
a four-year contract with free agent free safety George Teague.
</P>
<P>
   The team, which made the announcement via it's Web site Monday,
refused to release the financial terms of the deal. Unnamed
sources, however, told The Dallas Morning News that Teague was
expected to count about $800,000 against the club's 2000 salary
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Teague's experience and
leadership make him a valuable part of the Cowboys' defensive
backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ''George is a proven talent that brings experience and
playmaking ability to our secondary,'' Jones said, according to the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Teague's agent, Jordan Woy, did not immediately return calls
made by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year veteran has played seven years in the NFL,
including three with Dallas. He's had a season career-high 102
tackles, including 44 solos.
</P>
<P>
   The signing assures the Cowboys of keeping their safety tandem
of Teague and Darren Woodson intact, the team said. It's still
uncertain what will happen with Deion Sanders, but Dallas plans to
have newly acquired free agent Ryan McNeil and Kevin Smith at the
cornerback position next year.
</P>
<P>
   Teague, a former Green Bay Packers first-round draft pick in
1993, also has 15 career interceptions and three more in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also signed free agent Brandon Tolbert to a one-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tolbert, a seventh-round draft choice out of Jacksonville in
1998, was signed to the Dallas practice squad on Nov. 24, 1998, and
moved on to the active roster the next month. But a right knee
injury in July landed him on the injured list for the 1999 season.

<HEADLINE> Arizona's Woods Status Uncertain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- The status of Arizona's Loren Woods for the
NCAA tournament remained uncertain Monday despite the selection
committee being told to assume the 7-foot-1 center would not play
because of a back injury.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona athletic director Jim Livengood said Monday that he told
the committee to make its decision on the assumption that Woods
would not be able to play throughout the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But Livengood said a final determination on Woods' playing
status has not been made.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a chance he might play. We don't know right now,''
Livengood said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods missed the last five games of the regular season with what
has been described as a compression injury to a disk in his back.
There has been widespread speculation that the injury was serious
enough that he was out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Thompson, chairman of the NCAA selection committee, said
Sunday that the committee had been told that Woods would not play
in the tournament. Livengood said that information came from him
because he felt that it would be unfair to hint that Woods might
play in order to add to the argument that the Wildcats deserve a
top seed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its information that Woods was not expected to play, the
committee still made Arizona the No. 1 seed in the West. The
Wildcats play Jackson State on Thursday in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lute Olson has repeatedly said that no decision on whether
Woods will play will be made until a final report is in from
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Livengood, who served on the selection committee but was not
part of any discussion or decision involving Arizona's seeding,
said he felt he did the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''From an integrity standpoint, I thought this was the way to go
rather than say there's a chance he might play,'' Livengood said.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the committee decided to make Arizona the top seed
in the West because the Wildcats beat Stanford without Woods last
Thursday. Arizona finished the season 3-2 without its big center,
beating UCLA, Stanford and California, but losing at Oregon State
and Oregon.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Likes NCAA Bracket  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Though disappointed about their No. 2 seed in
the NCAA tournament, Cincinnati players don't mind their draw or
their destination.
</P>
<P>
   They're going south -- where it's warm -- to play teams they think
they can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a good draw, a very good draw,'' senior forward Pete
Mickeal said. ''I don't have a problem with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats (28-3) were in line for a No. 1 seed in Cleveland
until Thursday, when center Kenyon Martin broke his leg and
Cincinnati lost to Saint Louis by 10 points in its first Conference
USA tournament game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of going north, they're heading to Nashville, Tenn., as
the No. 2 seed in the South with an opening game Friday against
North Carolina-Wilmington (18-12).
</P>
<P>
   Should they win that one, they'd play either Tulsa (29-4) or
UNLV (23-7) in the second round Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats are 4-0 against North Carolina-Wilmington,
including an 81-52 victory last season in Cincinnati. They haven't
played Tulsa in 27 years, but blew UNLV away 106-66 last Jan. 2 at
the Shoemaker Center.
</P>
<P>
   From Mickeal's standpoint, that's a good situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We get Wilmington, we beat Wilmington, we get the winner of
UNLV/Tulsa,'' Mickeal said. ''If it's UNLV, it would be great
because we've already played them. If it's Tulsa, we can beat
Tulsa. They're pretty good, but we can beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   If they get past the second round -- something they haven't done
in the past three tournaments -- there's a possible matchup with
Ohio State in the round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Martin's out for the tournament, the Bearcats think
they can handle this bracket.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we come to play, we can beat anybody,'' Mickeal said.
''And then that possible matchup with Ohio State in the Elite Eight
-- hmmm. That would be real sweet. I think everybody in Ohio wants
to see that and they might just get what they're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though they didn't get the No. 1 seed they were looking
for, the Bearcats got a region that suited them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you would have asked people if we couldn't go to Cleveland,
where would you like to go, Nashville would be our second option.''
</P>
<P>
   Why? It's close and has a suitable climate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not as good as Cleveland, but at least it's a warm
place,'' senior forward Jermaine Tate said. ''It's not that far and
it's a little bit warmer, so that's a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the site or seed, the Bearcats' main concern is
themselves. Martin averaged 25.5 points over their last eight
games, carrying them down the stretch. Now, he's relegated to
cheering from the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ''The No. 1 thing is to get everybody on the same page,'' Tate
said. ''We all didn't have to be on the same page with Kenyon
there; he pretty much just carried us. Now we've got to go out and
play as a whole.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Visits Bosnia  </HEADLINE>
By AIDA CERKEZ-ROBINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Bosnia will continue to
reduce its military, and NATO will not let up in its pursuit of war
crimes suspects, NATO's secretary-general said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia's multiethnic presidency reduced its defense budgets and
armed forces by 15 percent last year and confirmed in a meeting
Monday that it would do so again this year, Lord Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard what they said, and I will hold them to it,'' said
Robertson.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson also said NATO would stay committed to its Bosnian
peacekeeping mission, which includes help in returning refugees to
their homes, arresting war crimes suspects and reforming the media.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just the armed forces that need to be reduced, but
the army of the unemployed. And that means attracting new jobs,''
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We at NATO can help create the conditions for a prosperous and
stable country. But (only) you, the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina,
can bring it about,'' he said, urging voters to turn against
extremism in next month's municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''These policies of ethnic division failed you then and cannot
help you now,'' he said. New politicians must arise who will
provide law and order in the country and tackle corruption.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with U.S. Gen. Ronald Adams, the commander of the
NATO-led Stabilization Force, or SFOR, Robertson said NATO troops
would continue to arrest war crimes suspects in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a day-by-day basis, we continue to watch for those with a
guilty conscience and those who have been indicted,'' he said.
''There won't be a lasting peace until all of those who have been
indicted are brought to justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson visited a reconstruction project in the Sarajevo
suburb of Stup, where French SFOR troops were rebuilding 216 houses
destroyed during the war, which ended in 1995 after more than three
years of fighting. The project and will enable about 1,000 people
to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson was also scheduled to hold talks with the members of
Bosnia's multiethnic presidency and leaders of the democratic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   This is Robertson's second visit to Bosnia as NATO chief. About
24,000 NATO-led peacekeepers are stationed in Bosnia, reduced from
50,000 troops in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said he was looking forward to withdrawing more troops
when it was possible to leave ''a self-sustaining, multiethnic
democracy behind.''

<HEADLINE> UNLV Back in NCAA Tournament  </HEADLINE>
By TIM DAHLBERG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- UNLV isn't used to being treated this kindly by
the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Runnin' Rebels back in the NCAA tournament --
for only the second time since Jerry Tarkanian's Final Four team of
1991 -- UNLV might have gotten a break in the seedings.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV plays Friday in the South Regional against Tulsa, a team
UNLV is very familiar with and beat twice last season when both
schools were in the Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   And, if UNLV (23-7) can get by that game, the Rebels could face
a Cincinnati team depleted by the loss of Kenyon Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know you would call it a break or not,'' UNLV coach
Bill Bayno said Monday. ''There's no easy games, but I think there
is more parity this year than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   UNLV, which won its last seven games to get selected as the 10th
seed in the South, is in the tournament for the second time under
Bayno, who inherited a program in disarray five years ago and has
struggled trying to meet the expectations of fans spoiled by
Tarkanian's success.
</P>
<P>
   Bayno can only hope the stay is longer than it was two years
ago, when his team was bounced in the first round by Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got four players who were on the team two years ago, but
this is really a new experience for us,'' Bayno said. ''We've just
got to stick with what got us here.''
</P>
<P>
   What got UNLV in the tournament was a strong finish to the
season that helped ease memories of blowout losses to North
Carolina, Cincinnati and Utah during the season.
</P>
<P>
   After a 96-52 defeat at the hands of Utah on Feb. 21, UNLV won
its last seven, including three straight to win the Mountain West
Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   In the conference tournament final Saturday night, UNLV played
arguably its finest half of the season, opening up the game with a
26-2 run and blowing out Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our sense of urgency and intensity was tremendous in that
game,'' Bayno said. ''Now all we have to do is find a way to
duplicate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa (29-4) is ranked 18th, and has lost to only two teams all
season. One of those teams is Fresno State, which beat the Golden
Hurricane three times, including the WAC championship game.
</P>
<P>
   UNLV beat Tulsa twice last year while both were in the WAC, but
Bayno said that doesn't mean much.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't seen them in a year, and they're a different team
now,'' he said. ''We're familiar with them, but the negative is
they're familiar with us, too. I don't think you can worry about
that or analyze that.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Dalron Johnson said the mere fact the team made the
tournament after many had written UNLV's chances off isn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one-game elimination,'' Johnson said. ''We can't be
sitting around dwelling on the fact that we're excited to make the
tournament. It's time to get back to work.''

<HEADLINE> 'Spiderman' Climber on Supervision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The French daredevil known to his fans as
Spiderman pleaded guilty Monday to criminal trespassing charges for
scaling the 110-story Sears Tower in downtown Chicago last year.
</P>
<P>
   Alain Robert, 37, of Pezenas, France, was placed on court
supervision for one year for his spectacular but unauthorized Aug.
20 climb to the top of the 1,450-foot skyscraper.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown office workers watched astonished as he went hand over
hand up the side of the building, one of the world's tallest.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also ordered the daredevil to have no illegal contact
with the Sears Tower in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The slightly-built Robert has climbed more than 30 skyscrapers
as publicity for his shampoo-maker sponsor. He appeared in court in
his customary long and heavily peroxided hair, a dangling earring
and black leather trousers.
</P>
<P>
   Robert nor his attorney immediately returned telephone calls to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State's Attorney Pattie Ehsaei said Sears Tower
management was happy with the outcome. ''I think this was the most
equitable disposition of the case,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> No West Bank Withdrawal Date Set  </HEADLINE>
By SAMAR ASSAD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian and Israeli negotiators failed to
reach agreement Monday on the timing of an Israeli withdrawal from
6.1 percent of the West Bank and a release of Palestinian security
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Israel did, however, reportedly soften its position on a key
Palestinian demand to be given Jerusalem suburbs as part of the
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators met for over three hours in a Jerusalem hotel but
did not announce any dates for the implementation of three interim
peace issues. It was the second time negotiating teams met since
talks were resumed last week.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians expect Israel to carry out an overdue Israeli troop
withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank, release at least 150
Palestinian security prisoners and conclude an agreement on the
opening of a second land route for Palestinians between the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said the Palestinians want
implementation ''within the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   Erekat would not say if that meant before the four-day Muslim
holiday of Eid al-Adha, which starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His Israeli counterpart, Oded Eran, said a withdrawal and
prisoner release before Thursday would be ''very difficult'' but
that he believed an understanding is possible in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Eran said Israel is still deciding on the withdrawal maps, which
have been discussed with the Palestinians but not shown to them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We intend to have a very rapid internal procedure to conclude
this issue,'' Eran said.
</P>
<P>
   Israel TV said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would present
the maps to his security Cabinet for approval Wednesday. The TV
said that the Palestinians would be given full control over two
Arab villages close to Jerusalem, Anata and Ubeidiya, and the
Beitunia village near the Palestinian city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plan would partly meet a Palestinian demand to include
Jerusalem suburbs and other densely populated areas in the
withdrawal, though the Palestinians had asked for villages closer
to Jerusalem's walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   They suspended talks last month after Israel refused to include
those villages in the 6.1 percent withdrawal and set a time line
for an additional pullout ahead of a final peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Barak broke the deadlock
last week in a series of three meetings in which Barak apparently
displayed flexibility over the location of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat adviser Nabil Abourdeneh said the leaders had agreed then
that the withdrawal and prisoner release would take place
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the sides agreed that the additional troop pullout
would be discussed in Washington next week, when the two sides
resume negotiations over a final peace treaty, slated for
September.

<HEADLINE> Martin, Fizer Lead AP All-America  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL, AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cincinnati center Kenyon Martin, whose broken leg ended his
season and caused some controversy with the NCAA tournament
selection process, and Iowa State forward Marcus Fizer got the most
votes Monday for the AP All-America basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   Also selected to the first team were Indiana guard A.J. Guyton,
Texas center Chris Mihm and Notre Dame forward Troy Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, just one vote shy of being a unanimous selection, also
was the Conference USA player of the year after averaging 18.9
points, 9.7 rebounds and 3.4 blocked shots. The 6-foot-8 senior
broke his leg three minutes into the Bearcats' tournament
quarterfinal matchup with Saint Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The loss caused Cincinnati, ranked No. 1 at the time, to be
selected as second seed for the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very happy to receive this honor,'' said Martin, a
three-time defensive player of the year in the conference. ''It's
one that I have to share with my coaches and teammates. They've
done so much for me and my career and they have been so supportive
with my injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was selected to the first team on all but one of the
ballots from the 68-member national media panel, and had 336 points
in the 5-3-1 system.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's very deserving. He is unquestionably the best player in
the country,'' Cincinnati coach Bob Huggins said of the Bearcats'
first All-America selection since Danny Fortson in 1997. ''Aside
from the obvious, in terms of his contribution, he brings more
intangibles to the floor than anybody in college basketball. As
great a player as Kenyon is, he is even a greater person.''
</P>
<P>
   Fizer, the Big 12 player of the year and the conference's
leading scorer the last two seasons, led the Cyclones to their
first league title since 1945 and is their first All-American since
Gary Thompson in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-8 junior averaged 23.2 points and 7.5 rebounds while
shooting 57 percent from the field, including 43 percent from
3-point range. He received 57 first-team votes and 313 points.
</P>
<P>
   Guyton, the Big Ten player of the year and the fourth-leading
scorer in Indiana history with 2,097 points, was on 33 first-team
ballots and had 226 points.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-1 senior averaged 20.3 points this season while shooting
42 percent from 3-point range. He is Indiana's career leader with
280 3-pointers, and was the first Hoosier to be an All-American
since Calbert Cheaney in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm received just 17 first-team votes, but his 200 points were
one more than Murphy, who was on 27 first-team ballots,
</P>
<P>
   Mihm, a 7-foot junior, averaged 17.9 points, 10.6 rebounds and
2.4 blocks while shooting 53 percent for the Longhorns. He is
Texas' first All-American since the AP began selecting a team in
1948. In 1935, Jack Gray was a consensus All-America selection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a lot of goals as a team and a lot of individual goals
this season, and this was one of them,'' Mihm said. ''It feels
great to achieve that. I was mentioned as a preseason All-America,
and that's nice and all but it really doesn't count until the
season's over and you've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the Big East player of the year, was the first player to
lead the conference in scoring and rebounding in the same season.
The 6-9 sophomore averaged 22.8 points and 10.8 rebounds, and is
Notre Dame's first All-American since Adrian Dantley repeated in
1976.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great honor for Troy and the Notre Dame basketball
program,'' said first-year Fighting Irish coach Matt Doherty.
''It's great to see Troy recognized for his hard work. There is not
a more deserving individual than Troy because of his work in
basketball and the type of young man that he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Two players from Duke and Michigan State led the second team.
</P>
<P>
   Duke senior guard Chris Carrawell, who finished one point behind
Murphy in the voting, and teammate Shane Battier, a junior forward,
were selected to the second team. Michigan State senior guard
Mateen Cleaves, a first-team selection last season and a
second-team pick in 1998 who missed the first 10 weeks this season
with a broken foot, and teammate Morris Peterson, a senior forward,
also were on the second team.
</P>
<P>
   The final member of the second team was Fresno State senior
guard Courtney Alexander, the nation's leading scorer at 25.3
points per game.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State senior guard Scoonie Penn was a third-team selection
for the second straight season, and he was joined by seniors Pepe
Sanchez of Temple, Mark Madsen of Stanford and Eduardo Najera of
Oklahoma, and LSU sophomore Stromile Swift.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players selected for the preseason All-America team
made the first team. Joining Penn and Cleaves on that team were
Chris Porter of Auburn, Quentin Richardson of DePaul and Terence
Morris of Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Conservatives Shine in Spain  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM BROWN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The ruling conservatives on Monday quietly
savored a landslide victory in general elections that gave Spain
its strongest right-leaning government and weakest opposition in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote gave reformer Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar, a
47-year-old former tax inspector, a free hand to implement his
plans for economic change for the first time and dealt a crushing
defeat to the left.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping win by his Popular Party appeared to put an end to
a long-held notion about Spanish politics that endured through
Aznar's first 4-year term: that Spain was basically a center-left
country.
</P>
<P>
   The daily El Mundo, which generally supports the government,
proclaimed Aznar ''the undisputed leader'' of all European
center-right politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory speech, Aznar tried to quell opposition fears that
his party would steamroll over them in Parliament and promised to
remain ''open to dialogue with all parties, social representatives
and all of Spanish society because we're all necessary for the
progress of Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   The left-leaning daily El Pais said Aznar had enjoyed ''a day of
glory'' and disproved naysayers who had pointed to his razor-thin
margin of victory in the last election in 1996 as evidence he would
not last.
</P>
<P>
   The vote tally surpassed even Aznar's most optimistic
expectations, giving him 183 seats in the 350-seat Congress of
Deputies, a gain of 27 from the last legislature. Up till now, he
ruled a minority government that relied on support from regional
nationalist parties to get bills passed.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish left suffered a humiliating drop in support. The
main opposition Socialist Party fell from 141 seats to 125, and the
communist-dominated United Left went from 21 to 8.
</P>
<P>
   In the last legislature those two parties combined had more
seats in parliament than Aznar's party. Now they have fewer than
the Socialists alone did in the last Parliament. In the vote tally,
the right outnumbered the left by more than a million votes.
</P>
<P>
   The two leftist parties had struck an alliance for this election
but it backfired. Analysts said many United Left supporters
abstained rather than endorse the deal with the Socialists. Many
Spanish communists accuse the latter of being centrist sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialists ruled under Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez from
1982 to 1996 when it was unseated by Aznar. Gonzalez's fall was
blamed in large part on corruption scandals tainting his
administrations. Gonzalez first took office seven years after the
death of the longtime dictator Gen. Francisco Franco in 1975.

<HEADLINE> Conn. Officer Convicted in Shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITCHFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- A white police officer was convicted of
manslaughter Monday for shooting an unarmed black suspect in the
back at point-blank range.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Smith, 28, had been the first Connecticut police officer
to be charged with murder for an action committed in the line of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   The jury acquitted the New Milford officer of murder but found
him guilty of intentional manslaughter in the December 1998
shooting of Franklyn Reid. Smith could get up to 40 years in prison
when sentenced May 5.
</P>
<P>
   ''A trillion, trillion, trillion thanks to the jury, for your
courage to do the right thing,'' said Reid's mother, Pearlylyn
Reid.
</P>
<P>
   The officer said he shot Reid, 27, because he believed Reid was
reaching for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''When he made that classic move, I thought, 'Oh (expletive),
I'm dead,'' Smith testified last week.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was unarmed. A short folding knife was discovered in the
pocket of a jacket found a few feet away from his body.
</P>
<P>
   Smith shot Reid once in the back. Prosecution witnesses
testified they saw Reid sitting or lying down moments before the
shooting; an expert testified for prosecutors that Smith's
bootprint was on Reid's shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the shooting, Reid -- who was wanted for failure to
appear in court -- had led Smith on a brief foot chase. Reid had
also eluded another officer earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Smith shook his head when the verdict was read, but made no
other comment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of Smith's lawyers, Judge Charles Gill
allowed the jury to consider the less serious charges of
intentional and negligent manslaughter, in addition to murder. The
jury began deliberating Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was wanted on charges of violating probation, telephone
harassment and failure to appear in court. His criminal record
included convictions on assault and sexual assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Smith initially brought protests from
hundreds of police officers. His conviction follows the acquittals
last month of four white New York City police officers in the
shooting death of West African immigrant Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   But the Reid case focused less on race than on the recent spate
of suspects killed by Connecticut police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight and Pearlylyn Reid, who moved with their three sons from
Jamaica to New Milford in 1986, had rejected an offer of assistance
from the Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York activist involved in the
Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they highlighted the police shootings in Connecticut.
Between December 1998 and November 1999, nine people were killed
and a 10th wounded in police shootings around the state.

<HEADLINE> NJ officials continue search for rapist  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey officials searched on both ends
of the state Monday for a rapist who authorities say was improperly
released from prison, and a prosecutor said a psychologist failed
in a recent evaluation to describe the suspect as violent.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation of Raymond Alves before his release concluded he
was at a low risk to repeat as a sexual offender, state Department
of Corrections spokesman Christopher Carden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jan. 21 evaluation also stated that Alves had no prior
history of violent crimes, although he was a convicted rapist,
Bergen County Prosecutor William H. Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation also failed to refer to an interview with a
prisoner in Florida who had said that Alves talked about killing
people, and the fact that he once tried to escape while Bergen
County prosecutors tried to take him into custody, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes one wonder whether anyone had bothered to look at the
file and find out what this man was about,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Alves, 58, was released from the Southern State Correctional
Center in Cumberland County on Thursday after serving a 23-year
prison sentence for raping two Clifton girls in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   He also was reportedly a suspect in several Bergen County
murders in the 1960s and 1970s, according to published reports. An
unidentified law enforcement source told The Associated Press that
officials did investigate Alves for murder.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officials acknowledged last week that they had
notified Bergen County prosecutors of Alves' release too late for
prosecutors to be able to launch a formal objection.
</P>
<P>
   ''We realize it's a serious mistake and we are aggressively
trying to find out exactly what happened,'' said Carden.
</P>
<P>
   A letter dated Feb. 29 and postmarked March 8 was sent to the
prosecutor's office informing them that Alves was scheduled for
release. The letter, addressed to ''Prosecutor Fahy,'' arrived in
Hackensack on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   John J. Fahy has not been the Bergen County prosecutor since
1995.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires that prosecutors be given 30 days notice when
a prisoner is to be released. Schmidt said that if he had been
given the time, he would have asked the state Attorney General's
Office to hold a civil commitment hearing to declare Alves unfit
for release.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt said that members of his staff have told him that
notification letters from the Department of Corrections often
arrive very close to the date of the prisoner's release, violating
the 30-day rule.
</P>
<P>
   ''This shouldn't have happened,'' Schmidt said. ''I'm afraid
there's going to be another victim.''
</P>
<P>
   State and Bergen County officials are seeking Alves on a Megan's
Law violation because he gave authorities a phony address in Falls
River, Mass., where he said he would be staying. The law requires
convicted sex offenders to tell New Jersey authorities where they
will live after they are released.
</P>
<P>
   Following leads from inmates and a social worker who interviewed
Alves, authorities were looking for him at shelters in Camden,
Bergen and Passaic counties, as well as Atlantic City and Las
Vegas, Schmidt said. Alves left prison with a $1,554 check and $100
in cash, and will likely need more money soon, Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Carden said the Corrections Department is investigating all
aspects of its notification process. ''Any part of the process ...
will come under scrutiny,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Elliott Ready For Comeback  </HEADLINE>
By KELLEY SHANNON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- While most of his team rested, Sean Elliott
took jump shots and ran drills until the sweat dripped off his
face.
</P>
<P>
   He's spent seven grueling months trying to get back into shape
after a kidney transplant, and he's not about to stop now.
</P>
<P>
   With family, friends and doctors watching Tuesday night, the
32-year-old Elliott will play in an NBA game for the first time
since his brother Noel donated a kidney to him on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of the pressure is going to come from within,'' Elliott
said Monday after an intensive workout with four teammates at the
Alamodome. ''I have a chance to make a statement to myself and also
to a lot of people that have gone through what I went through, just
people that have faced adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling pretty good about it. Probably nerves will be the
biggest thing I've got to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott planned all along to make his unprecedented comeback in
a home game. But as he worked out alone at first, then with the
team the last six weeks, he didn't allow himself to think too much
about how the night would unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Will he want the ball right away? What will be his first play?
</P>
<P>
   ''That's stuff that you daydream about,'' he said. ''I'm going
to try to let the game come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott expects to play about 10 minutes a game until he
rebuilds his stamina.
</P>
<P>
   He could barely walk right after the transplant. When he was
able to move about, he would get winded just climbing a flight of
stairs. Now, he's nearly back to the condition he was before the
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   He'll find out exactly how close when he plays against the
Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll probably be exhausted the first 30 seconds I'm on the
floor because I'll have a lot of adrenaline -- and the nerves,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after the Spurs won the NBA championship in June,
Elliott said he needed the transplant because of a disease that
prevents the kidneys from filtering waste from the blood. Without
the transplant, he would have been forced to undergo dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Though doctors didn't rule out a return to the NBA, no
professional athlete in a major sport has come back to the same
level of competition after a kidney transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course, to Sean, basketball is more than a game. It's a
career and a passion and always has been for him,'' said his
transplant surgeon, Dr. Francis Wright of Methodist Specialty and
Transplant Hospital. ''Sean is clearly a unique case.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk of injury to Elliott's new kidney -- positioned on his
right side and partially protected by the pelvic bone -- is minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't believe it is a scary situation,'' said Dr. Lewis
Teperman, director of transplantation for New York University and a
medical spokesman for the National Kidney Foundation. ''I don't
think anyone is going to intentionally hit him ... there, and to
normal injuries he'll respond fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's role on the court initially will be a small one, about
five or six minutes a half, Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sean's doing something that's pretty heroic and pretty
amazing,'' Popovich said. ''We want to step lightly as we begin
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, in his 11th season, was selected by the Spurs in the
first round of the 1989 draft with the third overall pick. Last
year, he averaged 11.2 points, 4.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists during
the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   His ''Memorial Day Miracle'' shot -- an off-balance 3-pointer as
he nearly fell out of bounds -- helped seal a victory for the Spurs
in the final seconds of a game against Portland in the Western
Conference finals last season.
</P>
<P>
   Fans eager to see Elliott return bought tickets at a furious
pace Monday. By late afternoon, about 3,000 tickets had been sold
for the day, compared with sales of about 300 the day before a
typical game.
</P>
<P>
   The Alamodome usually holds 20,557 for a Spurs game, although
upper levels can be opened to accommodate more than 34,000. Ticket
sales reached at least 22,000 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's older brother Noel, who is traveling from Arizona for
the game, will be one of the fans cheering him on. Elliott said
he's constantly reminding Noel that both of them are making
history.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were always close but the kidney transplant
strengthened their bond.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you can get closer, I guess we did,'' Elliott said. ''You
can probably say that. I've got one of his organs inside of me.''

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed in Texas Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNI, Texas (AP) -- A car and a tanker-truck collided head-on in
south Texas Monday, killing all seven men in the car, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place on a state highway about 40 miles east
of Laredo, said Webb County Justice of the Peace Alfredo Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The men were traveling eastbound in a Chevrolet Cavalier that
collided with the westbound 18-wheeler, whose driver was taken to
Mercy Regional Medical Center in Laredo, he said. A hospital
spokeswoman said the driver was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if the car lost control or the truck lost
control,'' Garcia said. ''We'll have to wait and see what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident was reported at 12:43 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The victims appeared to be between the ages of 20 and 39, Garcia
said. It was not immediately known if they were related.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been to several accidents and this is the worst one I've
seen,'' Garcia said. ''Believe me, it's a total mess.''

<HEADLINE> Covering Meant for Pope Collapses  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Part of a covering meant to protect the pope
from the sun collapsed Monday on the stage where he is to conduct a
huge open-air Mass near the Sea of Galilee next week, an Israeli
official said.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II is to address an estimated 100,000 worshippers from
that stage on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Father Antonio, a Catholic Church representative at Korazim,
where the stage has been built, said in a telephone interview that
''only a cable snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Israel Electric Corporation, however, said
the center pole supporting the roof buckled, and the roof collapsed
onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   The government-owned electric company has overall responsibility
for preparing the site, but the church chose to engage a private
Israeli contractor to build the stage, said the spokesman, Dedi
Golan.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the collapse, the church asked the electric
company to repair the center-pole and the roof, Golan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass is to be held on the Mount of the Beatitudes, the
Galilee hilltop where Jesus is believed to have delivered the
sermon beginning ''Blessed are the poor in spirit.'' The hill
overlooks the Sea of Galilee and the sites where tradition says
Jesus walked on water and performed the Miracle of the Loaves and
Fish.

<HEADLINE> Details of Plane Collision Released  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRADENTON, Fla. (AP) -- Both small planes involved in a deadly
crash on a runway last week were cleared for takeoff just seconds
apart, federal investigators said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to determine whether one of the pilots
erred by pulling in front of the other plane, or if a Federal
Aviation Administration controller allowed the two aircraft to come
together on a runway at Sarasota Bradenton International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators are still
examining all possible causes of the crash and will not make an
official finding for several months, NTSB spokesman Pat Cariseo
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The crash Thursday killed all four people on board both planes.
It ignited a huge fireball, but no one on the ground was injured.
The safety board released the new details after wrapping up
interviews with witnesses over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A Cessna 152 under the command of student pilot Charlie Heffner,
80, and flight instructor Lori Bahrenburg, 26, had been given
clearance for takeoff shortly after 10:35 a.m., Cariseo said.
</P>
<P>
   Seven to 10 seconds later, clearance was given to a Cessna 172
that carried Sarasota Flying Club leader and a retired Air Force
colonel, Julius Taubman, 81, and David Mouckley, a 75-year-old
Toronto businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Cariseo said the Cessna 152 tried to take off to avoid the
collision, but its propeller hit the other aircraft. The impact
came about 13 seconds after the Cessna 172 had been given clearance
for takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Cariseo said investigators were not able to detect any
mechanical problems in either plane.

<HEADLINE> Conservation Groups File Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- Twelve conservation groups filed a lawsuit
Monday seeking to force a federal decision on whether to protect
the lynx under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service missed a
Jan. 8 deadline for making a decision on the status of the lynx.
That deadline was set after an earlier delay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We simply cannot afford to wait any longer to implement
conservation actions to protect this magnificent, rare cat and our
northern forests where it lives,'' said David Gaillard of the
Bozeman office of the Predator Conservation Alliance, one of the
groups that filed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Fish and Wildlife Service officials have recommended the wild
cat be listed as a threatened species.
</P>
<P>
   At the agency's office in Helena, biologist Lori Nordstrom
acknowledged the deadline was missed and said a decision will be
issued soon, possibly within a couple of weeks. She declined to
comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive forest cat is so rare it seldom has been seen in
most of the lower 48 United States for years. Opponents say there
never were many to begin with and that trying to develop a presence
now could restrict logging and deny access to public land by
hunters and skiers.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Wilderness Action Network, Defenders of Wildlife and
the Biodiversity Legal Foundation are among the groups that filed
the suit in U.S. District Court in Washington.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed in Texas Highway Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUNI, Texas (AP) -- A car and a tanker-truck collided head-on in
south Texas Monday, killing all seven men in the car, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident took place on a state highway about 40 miles east
of Laredo, said Webb County Justice of the Peace Alfredo Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   The men were traveling eastbound in a Chevrolet Cavalier that
collided with the westbound 18-wheeler, whose driver was taken to
Mercy Regional Medical Center in Laredo, he said. A hospital
spokeswoman said the driver was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know if the car lost control or the truck lost
control,'' Garcia said. ''We'll have to wait and see what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident was reported at 12:43 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The victims appeared to be between the ages of 20 and 39, Garcia
said. It was not immediately known if they were related.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been to several accidents and this is the worst one I've
seen,'' Garcia said. ''Believe me, it's a total mess.''

<HEADLINE> Shark Alert! Tark Back in the NCAAs  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRESNO, Calif. (AP) -- Nine years later, Jerry Tarkanian has
returned to the NCAA tournament he once ruled. It's been a long
journey back.
</P>
<P>
   This is the coach who accused the NCAA of ''enforcement
atrocities.'' This is the coach the NCAA tried in vain to suspend.
This is the coach whose battles with the NCAA could fill law
journals.
</P>
<P>
   Now he leads Fresno State into a first-round game Thursday
against Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted Monday there's no rancor, just a sense of
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no vindication in getting back to the tournament. It's
a big honor for the university,'' said Tarkanian, a 1955 graduate
of Fresno State. ''This is my school. This is my alma mater.''
</P>
<P>
   The 69-year-old coach is a few pounds heavier, and chews on his
neatly folded white towels a bit less than when he took UNLV to the
national championship in 1989-90.
</P>
<P>
   His Runnin' Rebels returned to the Final Four in 1990-91, and
went 26-2 the following year. But by then UNLV was in NCAA trouble
again, and Tarkanian was forced to resign after publication of
photos showing three former players in a hot tub with a convicted
sports fixer.
</P>
<P>
   The last few years have been an odyssey for Tarkanian, who will
be making his 17th NCAA tournament appearance. He ranks sixth with
37 NCAA tournament victories.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian had a short stint as coach of the San Antonio Spurs,
promising never to coach again after getting fired just 20 games
into the 1992-93 season. Much of his time was spent contesting the
NCAA in cases reaching as high as the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he returned to coaching. He took the job at Fresno
State and pledged to revive a program with just two winning seasons
in the previous decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs have won at least 20 games in each of Tarkanian's
five seasons, but were overlooked by the NCAA tournament selection
committee each of the previous four years. This time, with a 24-9
record and a Western Athletic Conference tournament championship,
the Bulldogs were impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Though Fresno State fans accused the NCAA of conspiring to keep
Tarkanian out of the tournament the previous four seasons, the
coach felt the omissions were justified.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last four years, we were very close but we never won the
game we needed to get in,'' he said. ''I didn't feel we deserved to
get in any of those years.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Fresno State features the nation's leading scorer,
Courtney Alexander, and one of its top rebounders, Larry Abney.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who transferred from Virginia after being convicted
of hitting, choking and kicking his girlfriend, averaged 25.3
points per game this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 shooting guard returned for his senior year,
turning down a probable NBA first-round selection. He'll be playing
in the NCAA tournament for the first time since Virginia lost in
the first round to Iowa when he was a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ''This feels so much better than I ever could have imagined,''
Alexander said. ''I've been in school five years and I've played in
one NCAA tournament game, and I'm ready to play again.''
</P>
<P>
   Abney, who ranked fourth in the nation in rebounding with 11.9
per game, had 35 rebounds against SMU this season -- the most in an
NCAA game since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Bulldogs and Badgers play Thursday in Salt Lake
City, most of the attention will be on Tarkanian -- the sad-eyed
coach who has 733 victories and ranks second only to Dean Smith
with 28 seasons of 20 or more wins.
</P>
<P>
   The man who has been feuding with college basketball's
establishment since writing newspaper columns critical of the NCAA
three decades ago has seen Long Beach State and UNLV go on
probation on his watch.
</P>
<P>
   His history of mixing success with scandal has continued at
Fresno State, which will be making its first NCAA tournament
appearance since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   A federal investigation into accusations that star point guard
Chris Herron and other players shaved points four seasons ago has
new momentum. A second grand jury began hearing evidence in
February, more than a year after the first panel disbanded without
bringing any charges. And several of Tarkanian's players at Fresno
State have had serious legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tarkanian, who has never lost in the first round of the NCAA
tournament, knows things are a lot different now from his heyday
with UNLV.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most fun thing I've ever experienced in my life is going
to the Final Four,'' said Tarkanian, who made it there four times.
''We were always one of the top seeds. We always went to the
tournament figuring we'd win it. When I was at UNLV we always
prepared for the second game. Now we're preparing for Wisconsin.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton's India Agenda To Be Limited  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Relations between India and Pakistan ''have
sunk to a dangerous level,'' limiting what President Clinton can
accomplish when he visits the two countries next week, foreign
policy experts told the president Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The India-Pakistan tensions ''all too easily could lead to
conflict,'' nearly two dozen experts said in an open letter to
Clinton. Signers included Robert Oakley, former U.S. ambassador to
Pakistan, and Frank Wisner, former U.S. ambassador to India, as
well as experts from think tanks, foundations and other
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was co-sponsored by the Brookings Institution and the
Council on Foreign Relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will arrive Sunday evening in India on the first visit
there by a U.S. president in 22 years. On Monday, he will go to
Bangladesh, making the first stop by an American leader. Returning
to New Delhi late that night, Clinton will spend the next four days
in India meeting with leaders, addressing the parliament and
sightseeing with his daughter Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Clinton will go to Pakistan on the first
presidential visit since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan, the world's two newest nuclear
countries, claim the Himalayan territory of Kashmir and have fought
two wars over the area. The two countries came to the brink of war
last summer with a clash that resulted in more than 1,000
casualties. Tensions were heightened further by a military coup
last October in Pakistan and the Christmas-eve hijacking of an
Indian Airlines plane with what many in India believe was
Pakistan's involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy experts urged Clinton to set modest goals for
his trip: to build an expanded, post-Cold War relationship with
India, to stem ''the drift toward war'' between India and Pakistan,
to persuade Pakistan to embrace economic reform, the rule of law
and more responsible behavior toward terrorism, and to highlight
the potential success of Bangladesh as a moderate Islamic country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any attempt to persuade India to eliminate its nuclear arsenal
will fail and poison the atmosphere for the constructive discussion
of issues,'' the letter to Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   It also urged India and Pakistan to take steps to reduce the
chance of conflict over Kashmir but advised the United States to
get directly involved in diplomacy relating to Kashmir only if all
parties express an interest. India has opposed any outside
mediation, saying that would merely reward Pakistani aggression.

<HEADLINE> Bush Embracing Capitol Hill GOP  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- George W. Bush, embracing Capitol Hill Republicans
after months of keeping his distance, told them Monday: ''Be
patient, help is on the way.'' Al Gore wanted to talk campaign
tactics, pressing Bush to ditch TV ads ''selling candidates the way
dog food and soap suds are sold.''
</P>
<P>
   As primary voting headed into a Southern ''Super Tuesday'' with
all the suspense gone, the two remaining major candidates -- Gore
from Florida, Bush from stops in Mississippi and Louisiana -- dueled
over which of them has the makings of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore said Americans want to continue the prosperity
begun under the Clinton-Gore administration. ''We know what works.
Are you with me?'' he asked cheering doctors, nurses and
administrators at the University of Miami's teaching hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offers only ''risky'' tax cuts that no one but
special-interest campaign donors want, Gore said. ''Leadership can
make a difference. Experience can make a difference in the quality
of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at a campaign rally at Brandon High School in Brandon,
Miss., Bush declared, ''America wants somebody not of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He shared the stage with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and
Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'd like to tell this Congress is be patient, help is on
the way,'' said the Texas governor, who, earlier in his campaign,
froze congressional Republicans out with criticism of their agenda
and ideology. GOP leaders are trying to hold on to majorities in
both houses, a task that will be easier if Bush runs a strong
presidential campaign, and Bush would like a Republican Congress if
he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore staged his main campaign stop of the day at Jackson
Memorial Medical Center to underscore that Bush has offered no
comprehensive health proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Just the fact that he was in Florida -- and was coming back after
going home to Tennessee to vote on Tuesday -- was significant. Some
supporters had written off Florida earlier in the campaign because
the governor here is Bush's brother, Jeb. After a weekend of polls
showing that Gore has erased Bush's lead nationally, Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla, said Monday that Florida is back ''in play'' for
Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and the other five primaries of the Southern ''Super
Tuesday'' were rendered all but meaningless when Democrat Bill
Bradley and Republican John McCain dropped their campaigns. Far,
far back, Republican Alan Keyes is still in.
</P>
<P>
   Reissuing a challenge, Gore asked Bush to reject TV and radio
campaign ads in favor of twice-weekly debates and joint town
meetings where, the vice president said, he could stand his health
proposal against Bush's proposed tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he doesn't want to debate until fall because ''America
is now going into a hibernation period when it comes to politics.''
On Gore's call to stop 30-second ads, he said, ''Maybe he wants the
newspapers to decide who the president is, I intend to take my
message directly to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said of the 30- and 60-second campaign ads: ''They end up
concluding everybody running's a dirty dog. These ads masquerade as
real, meaningful dialogue -- they're not. Most of them are slogans
and fuzzy images and selling candidates the way dog food and soap
suds are sold.''
</P>
<P>
   During a rally later at the airport in Oklahoma City, Bush said,
''I think the best reform is to end Clinton-Gore in Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan rejoined the
fray, seconding the attacks of the major parties' presumptive
nominees on each other. On NBC's ''Today'' show, Buchanan said Bush
''hasn't demonstrated the depth or capacity or wisdom or
knowledge'' to be president.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the vice president ''hasn't told the truth'' about
his fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple during his 1996 re-election
campaign. Gore's new focus on overhauling campaign finance rules
carries ''a real element of cynicism,'' said Buchanan, who hopes to
pick up the anti-establishment mantle carried by McCain.
</P>
<P>
   As for the two major contenders and health care, Gore has
proposed expanding CHIPS, a federal-state health insurance program,
to all children and low-income parents, and allowing senior
citizens between 55 and 65 to buy into Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered that he favors expansion of CHIPS, making it less
expensive for employers to provide health insurance, and
encouraging states to develop basic health care safety nets that
''trust people to make decisions for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At a high school outside New Orleans, an adult in the mostly
student audience asked Bush how he would ''keep Gore honest''
during the campaign. ''It's going to be a heck of a challenge,''
Bush replied, adding he hoped ''the American people will see
through all the rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ''Americans want somebody to come into office that will
restore dignity and honor to the White House and lift the spirits
of the country.'' A student then asked Bush to justify his
criticism of President Clinton for being ''vague'' during the
Monica Lewinsky investigation when Bush himself will not answer
more questions about whether he ever used illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said reporters had looked into his past. ''You can draw any
conclusions you want, but what you cannot draw is the conclusion
that I have not brought honor and respect and dignity to the
highest office in my state,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Gore met in Nashville, Tenn., with more than 30
Democratic mayors plotting get-out-the-vote and message strategies
for the fall. He also dipped into the traditionally Republican
money chest of Belle Meade, a wealthy Nashville suburb, with a
$200,000 fund-raiser reception at a privately-owned historic
mansion.

<HEADLINE> Astros Players Tied Up, Robbed  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two men burst into an unlocked hotel room
where five Houston Astros minor leaguers were watching television,
tied up the players and a female guest and robbed them at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Police shot one of the gunmen minutes later as he struggled with
a sixth player in an adjacent room. The other assailant escaped.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The players were identified as Morgan Ensberg, 24; Derrek
Nicholson, 23; Keith Ginter, 23; Michael Rose, 23; Eric Cole, 24;
and Aaron Miles, 23. The woman was identified as Alicia Szczerba,
23.
</P>
<P>
   The armed robbery took place late Sunday night at a Holiday Inn
in Kissimmee, where the Astros' minor leaguers stay during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly they're shaken up right now, but overall they
handled themselves well,'' Astros assistant general manager Tim
Purpura said.
</P>
<P>
   The five players and Szczerba, a friend of one of the players,
were in a hotel room watching television when the gunmen burst
through the unlocked door around 11 p.m EST Sunday. They tied up
the players and Szczerba at gunpoint and took cash, said Cmdr. Fran
Iwanski, a spokeswoman for the Kissimmee Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their doors were unlocked, which may have started this,''
Iwanski said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen then moved to an adjacent room, where Miles was by
himself. Players in the first room, meanwhile, managed to untie
themselves, call 911 and lock the door to their room.
</P>
<P>
   When a police officer arrived, one of the gunmen ran out of the
second-floor room and jumped over a railing to the ground. Police
were searching for him late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The other gunman remained in the room pointing his gun at Miles
while backup officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to call him to give up and come out,'' Iwanski
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman apparently let his guard down, Miles tried to
wrestle the weapon from him. Officers heard the struggle, broke the
hotel room window and ordered the gunman to surrender. They shot
him when he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would not release the weapon,'' Iwanski said.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded gunman was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center,
and was listed Monday in stable but critical condition. Police were
unable to identify him because he had no identification and was
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian woman staying with her husband and son in the room
underneath the ballplayers' room said she heard yelling and
screaming, the shattering of the hotel room's glass window and
three shots fired.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like it was raining when the glass shattered,''
said Gail Wolkowski, of Thunder Bay, Ontario. ''You saw police
running everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, maintenance workers washed away blood from
the walkway in front of the hotel room and covered the shattered
window with a wood plank.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have no intention of moving the minor leaguers out of
the hotel but were meeting with security officials from the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, following its
routine, was investigating the police shooting.

<HEADLINE> Monday's Commodities Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE CARPENTER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soybean prices bolted nearly 3 percent higher Monday on a
sobering forecast that U.S. farmers, already reeling from a long
slump in agricultural commodities, now face a serious drought
threat after the warmest winter on record.
</P>
<P>
   In other markets, natural gas prices jumped amid concerns about
supplies for summer, oil inched higher on similar notions and sugar
rose 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Soybean and grain futures, already on the move upward, surged
when the U.S. National Weather Service released its
first-everdrought forecast. Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois and Indiana --
among the most productive farm states -- all fall in the driest
area.
</P>
<P>
   Weather service director Jack Kelly said it would take a
''large, large amount of precipitation'' to end the drought, and
officials said drought conditions appear likely to continue and
worsen at least through April.
</P>
<P>
   Also supporting prices were weekend rains that didn't meet
expectations in Midwest crop areas, as well as continuing rains in
central Brazil that are holding back harvest progress.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans hit a three-week high, while corn rose to a two-week
high as investors fretted about the approach of spring planting
season, about three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans for May delivery rose 13\ cents to $5.23 a bushel; May
corn rose 4 cents to $2.30} a bushel; May wheat rose 3{ cents to
$2.63{ a bushel; May oats rose 1} cent to $1.18\ a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a tad early to see the markets get this excited,''
said Allen Dever, grains analyst for Doane Agricultural Services in
St. Louis. ''But if it (dryness) persists through the growing
season, then people would want to know why the prices didn't go up
sooner.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy analysts said the natural gas market remains tight as the
result of concerns about supplies as the high-use summer season
draws near. April natural gas settled up 8.6 cents at $2.86 per
1,000 cubic feet on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Crude oil also edged up in choppy trading as an uneasy market
awaits the March 27 OPEC meeting to find out how much additional
oil will be injected into a needy market, and when.
</P>
<P>
   April crude rose 26 cents to $32.02 a barrel. In other energy
commodities, April heating oil rose .91 cent to 75.45 cents a
gallon and April unleaded gasoline fell . 31 cent to 99.11 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   In London, April Brent crude fell 5 cents to $28.89 a barrel on
the International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar rose to a one-month high on a heavy dose of short-covering
-- the buying of futures contracts to balance previous sales -- by
large funds and speculators. A surge in demand in Asia helped spur
the technical rally, traders said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Mason Ordered By Judge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A Manhattan judge Monday signed an order of
protection Monday that requires Charlotte Hornets basketball star
Anthony Mason to stay away from two men with whom he scuffled
outside a Harlem bar last month.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Analisa Torres signed the order
directing Mason to keep clear of Albert McGibboney and Basil
Parker, who say Mason, 33, beat and kicked them outside Perks Bar
around 4 a.m. on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Torres allowed Mason, charged with two counts of misdemeanor
assault, to remain free on $1,000 bail. The judge signed the same
order for Mason's codefendant, William Leary, 26, and also let him
remain free on $1,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Torres warned that the complainants must leave Mason alone, too.
''This order of protection is not a sword,'' she said. ''It is a
shield.''
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Mason's lawyer, Frank Rothman, the judge
postponed the defendant's next court date. Rothman asked her to
allow Mason, a former New York Knicks forward who was traded to the
Hornets in 1996, to be available if he is needed for the NBA
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said outside court that he learned McGibboney and Parker
have retained civil attorneys and may file a civil damages suit
against his client. He did not know the names of the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Mason's ''bad boy reputation'' and the fact that he earns
$5 million to $10 million a year, Rothman said his client ''is an
easy target'' for people who want to provoke Mason and then sue
him.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman told the judge that Mason's party included about five
people, while the group that allegedly started the fight included
about 10 to 20 men. Three men from the rival group were charged
with misdemeanor assault.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman said Mason, a New York native who is 6-foot-8, 280
pounds, was trying stop the fight when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anthony was trying to pull people apart,'' Rothman said.
''When the fight started, he was outside. When police arrived they
asked him to help pull people apart, and that's what he was
doing.''

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspect Sought in Maryland  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX DOMINGUEZ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- A police search of wooded areas Monday failed
to flush out the man suspected of killing four people and
kidnapping his girlfriend during a rampage last week.
</P>
<P>
   A line of 60 police officers, spaced about 100 yards apart,
marched through two state parks about 15 miles from Baltimore in
hopes of finding Joseph Palczynski.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing and no one has been found,'' said police spokesman
Bill Toohey. Police would not say what led them to the parks, but
they say Palczynski obtained outdoor equipment over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Palczynski, 31, shot and killed three people March 7
while kidnapping his estranged girlfriend, and then shot a fourth
person the next day as he tried to steal a car. The girlfriend
escaped Wednesday night and Palczynski disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   He resurfaced in Virginia, stealing guns and a van and forcing a
man to drive him back to Baltimore over the weekend, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a woman accused of buying weapons for Palczynski
was ordered held in federal custody for a mental exam.
</P>
<P>
   Constance Waugh, 48, was arrested Friday and charged with lying
on a federal form by saying she, not Palczynski, planned to use the
weapons, federal officials said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, she faces up to 10 years for the so-called ''straw
purchases,'' said Mike Campbell of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.

<HEADLINE> Icahn Readies Directors for Nabisco  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARSIPPANY, N.J. (AP) -- Financier Carl Icahn has assembled a
slate of nine directors to seek election to the board of Nabisco
Group Holdings Corp., the snack food giant said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The group headed by Icahn has raised its stake in the company to
8.9 percent, after buying 3.35 million shares between March 2 and
March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco on Monday responded by adopting a shareholder plan,
commonly known as a ''poison pill'' initiative. Such plans are
designed to ward off any hostile takeover bids by allowing a
company to increase its number of shares and make a takeover effort
prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn sought the election of a proposed slate to the company's
board last year, when RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. split its tobacco
and snack foods business. Eight of the nine directors Icahn
proposed are the same people he proposed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn had favored a different method of breaking up RJR Nabisco,
saying it should spin off its food interests and keep its U.S.
tobacco operations. Instead, RJR Nabisco spun off R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco, the maker of Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group Holdings has an 80.5 percent stake in Nabisco,
which makes Oreo cookies, Planters peanuts and Ritz crackers.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not yet scheduled its annual shareholders'
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what Icahn's goals are. A spokesman
from Icahn's New York company did not immediately return a message
seeking comment on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nabisco Group Holdings rose 6\ cents to $8.68} in
trading at 4:30 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Vanishes Into Thin Air  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Michael Jordan is not in the arena, which
means the owners' box is usually dark. He's no longer staring down
and trash-talking his players while driving the paint at practice.
</P>
<P>
   He's not even in town.
</P>
<P>
   His Airness' commuter job as Washington Wizards part-owner and
president of basketball operations has become a stay-at-home job.
Jordan hasn't attended a game at the MCI Center since the Feb. 24
trading deadline, the day the basketball immortal realized he was a
mere front office mortal when it came to reviving the miserable
Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, in New York on Monday to receive the Jackie Robinson
Foundation's Robie Humanitarian Award, said he will be at both
Wizards home games this week.
</P>
<P>
   He said he will be a regular at MCI Center, but noted, ''I will
pick and choose the times.''
</P>
<P>
   But he won't be on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can't play,'' coach Darrell Walker said. ''He can't make a
shot. What is he going to do because he's in the stands? He sat in
the stands before and we got beat by 20. ... Being in the crowd is
not going to help. You control your own destiny on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan also couldn't trade, and that just about killed any hope
of salvaging the season.
</P>
<P>
   He initially tried to kick-start the team by firing the coach
and joining in at practices, but he soon realized what everyone
else already knew: The Wizards don't have the talent or the
chemistry to win, and the only way to improve them would be to
trade one of their star players' huge, long and virtually
untradeable contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan couldn't pull it off, so he went home to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going to be the big difference?'' point guard Rod
Strickland said. ''I don't know how many player personnel directors
or owners or whatever he is go to every game. That doesn't make a
difference. We've got to go out and play when we step between the
lines. Michael Jordan being there or not shouldn't have any bearing
on the outcome of games.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan said he'll also attend some practices but doesn't want to
be overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want the players to worry about me being over their
shoulders,'' he said. ''But it is important to show the team I'm
supporting them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards have actually played somewhat better since the last
Jordan sighting in D.C. They are 4-5 since the trading deadline,
including an overtime victory over New York last week. After that
game, Jordan called Walker late at night and told the coach he was
''having a drink for you and the guys'' after watching the game on
television.
</P>
<P>
   But, congratulatory phone calls aside, there's the nagging
question of whether Jordan is already beset with Wizards malaise.
Jordan has been known to change his mind when things don't go his
way, so it's an open debate as to how long he'll stick to the task
now that he realizes the depth of his team's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Wizards minority owner Ted Leonsis, who brokered the deal that
brought Jordan to Washington, thinks Jordan is in it for the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Michael Jordan is doing anything until he wins a
championship,'' said Leonsis, whose group also owns the NHL's
Washington Capitals. ''I don't think his being allows that. I don't
think that's what he's about.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonsis, however, doesn't deal with Jordan on basketball issues.
The man who does, general manager Wes Unseld, regularly shoos off
interview requests concerning Jordan. Unseld did not return calls
seeking comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Unseld's silence is reflected throughout the organization.
Bringing Jordan to Washington was a major coup, by far the team's
biggest event of the season, yet there is not a single mention of
him anywhere in the extensive media notes the staff prepares for
each game.
</P>
<P>
   His coach at Chicago, Phil Jackson, will be in town Thursday as
his Los Angeles Lakers play the Wizards. The Chicago Bulls come to
the MCI Center on Saturday, but Jordan has few links with his old
team. Besides, the Bulls have beaten the Wizards twice already this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should be at both,'' Jordan said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When Jordan signed on, the good-natured one-liner on everyone's
lips was that the best way for Jordan to help the Wizards would be
for him to suit up and play.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at least for this season, that appears to be the only way
he could help them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe put on a jersey. That's about all he could do for us,''
guard Mitch Richmond said. ''Maybe give us a couple more speeches,
but that's about it.''

<HEADLINE> UConn Women Finish Season No.1  </HEADLINE>
By CHUCK SCHOFFNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through all the upsets, routs and buzzer-beaters in this college
basketball season, there was one constant: Connecticut women were
No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where they were Monday in The Associated Press final
women's poll - the same spot they were in when the season started.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the fourth time since the poll started in 1976-77
that a team was ranked No. 1 every week.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids handled it really well,'' said Connecticut coach Geno
Auriemma. ''I think we were so focused on who we had to beat
because the schedule was so hard in November and December that we
never had time to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut (30-1) received 41 of a possible 44 first-place
votes from a national media panel and goes into the NCAA tournament
as the No. 1 seed in the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies won the Big East regular-season and tournament
championships and were dominating in most of their victories. They
reached 100 points seven times this season, and have outscored
their opponents by an average of 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think one thing getting lost in all this is we have a lot of
talent,'' Auriemma said. ''I looked at the tape of our last game
with Rutgers and we had Sue Bird, a sophomore, and Kennitra
Johnson, a freshman, at guard and three sophomores up front.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sometimes has amazed me that we played so many good games
against so many good teams with such young kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee was the most recent team to last all season at No. 1,
accomplishing that feat in 1997-98. Texas did it in the 1985-86
season and Louisiana Tech in 1980-81.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier made the poll for the first time as the only newcomer in
the season's final round of voting. The Musketeers (26-4) came in
at No. 24 after winning the Atlantic 10 Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington, which had been 23rd, dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   The teams ranked two through five were the same as last week:
Tennessee, Louisiana Tech, Georgia and Notre Dame. Penn State
climbed one spot to sixth and Iowa State jumped three places to
seventh after overwhelming all three of its opponents in winning
the Big 12 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, UC Santa Barbara and Duke completed the Top Ten.
</P>
<P>
   The top four teams in the poll were seeded No. 1 in the NCAA
tournament. Tennessee is the top seed in the Mideast, Louisiana
Tech in the Midwest and Georgia in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut received 1,097 points in the voting. That was 42
more than Tennessee (28-3), which received the three other
first-place votes. Tennessee handed UConn its only loss, 72-71 in
Storrs on Feb. 2. That came a month after Connecticut won in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech fell five spots to 11th after losing to Texas in the
Big 12 semifinals. Then it was Mississippi State, Purdue, Old
Dominion and LSU, followed by Auburn, Boston College, Oklahoma,
Virginia and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, Tulane, North Carolina State, Xavier and Michigan held
the final five places.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier, which gave Connecticut a scare before losing 86-84 in
the second round of last year's NCAA tournament, relies on balance
and excellent shooting. The Musketeers have made 49.8 percent of
their shots, and four players average between 10 and 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   ''They always make that extra pass,'' said Xavier coach Melanie
Balcomb. ''Sometimes we even over pass. It's just the fact they're
so unselfish and they all care about each other. All they want to
do is win.''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Students End Sit-In  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Protesters at the University of Michigan
on Monday ended their 37-day sit-in at the office of a secretive
campus society accused of mocking and misusing American Indian
customs and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 6, a group of minority students occupied the
wigwam-themed office of the Michigamua society and demanded that
the group be expelled from the university.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said the 98-year-old society had not honored a
1989 promise to drop the use of ''Native American culture and
pseudo-culture'' from its rituals.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters said in a statement that they ''decided that in
order to truly be effective in attacking these systemic problems of
institutional racism, we must be out of the psychologically damning
environment of the Michigamua 'wigwam.'''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters left after they removed genuine and pseudo-Indian
artifacts from the Michigamua office, university spokesman Joel
Seguine said. He said the items were taken to the university's
Natural History Museum for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   The students also expressed disappointment with the university's
response to their complaints.
</P>
<P>
   University President Lee Bollinger said the university was
examining its policies on office space assignment and repeated its
opposition to racial or ethnic stereotyping, as well as to campus
sit-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Michigamua (pronounced mi-chi-GAW-muh) was founded in 1901, its
name taken from the Ojibway words for ''great water.'' Each year it
invites a select group of campus leaders -- all male until this year
-- to join.
</P>
<P>
   It counts former President Ford and late U.S. Supreme Court
Justice Frank Murphy among its alumni.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, each new inductee got a ''tribal'' name upon
joining. Other rituals included loincloth wearing, body painting
and holding ceremonies around a totem pole. In response to growing
criticism, the group promised in 1989 to abandon such practices.
</P>
<P>
   Current inductees of Michigamua, which counts six women and
eight minority students among its 24 members, claim they reject the
old practices.

<HEADLINE> Reports Critical of NASA's Approach  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the wake of two botched missions to Mars,
reports on NASA's ''faster, better, cheaper'' approach to space
exploration suggest the agency is trying to do too much with too
little money and not enough oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The reviews released Monday do not recommend a return to the
large, expensive space missions of the 1970s and 1980s. Instead,
management must be held accountable, goals clearly set and, if the
money isn't available, programs downsized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to slow down some, not rush too quickly into important
programs and projects, plan and implement them more carefully, and
move away from fixations on cost and near-term gain,'' said Tony
Spear, who led one of the reviews and is a former manager at NASA's
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was especially difficult for NASA: In addition to
losing two Mars probes, space shuttle flights were delayed, the
Hubble Space Telescope temporarily shut down and other missions
either missed their targets or failed at launch.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regard the loss of those two missions as a wake-up call in
respect to how we manage and implement flight projects,'' said
Larry Dumas, deputy director of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin ordered reviews, including the
two released Monday: Spear's analysis of ''faster, better,
cheaper'' and a report on management by the Mars Climate Orbiter
failure board. Last week, another board made 81 recommendations on
shuttle management, safety and technical issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''We knew this change would not be easy,'' Goldin said in a
statement. ''We knew we would have problems. We pushed, we
monitored and we initiated these reviews to find the areas which
need correction.''
</P>
<P>
   A common theme runs through both reports: ''Faster, better,
cheaper'' missions place too much emphasis on cost and schedule
reduction and too little on management, oversight, leadership and
evaluating risk.
</P>
<P>
   The Climate Orbiter, for instance, was lost when a contractor
failed to convert measurements into metric units. The $125 million
probe flew too close to Mars on Sept. 23 and is believed have
burned up in the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake itself was not as serious as the failure to catch
it, the review board said. Its first report, issued in November,
attempted to remedy the failures before Mars Polar Lander arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But the $165 million spacecraft was last heard from on Dec. 3,
just as it was beginning its descent to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's Management 101. They're basically saying there are four
things you have to balance: cost, schedule, content and risk,''
said John Pike, an analyst for the Federation of American
Scientists. ''But they don't say very much about how to balance
those.''
</P>
<P>
   The reports are vague in specifics: The Climate Orbiter board
proposed a new mantra called ''Mission Success First'' that would
help employees keep focused as the agency shifts from a small
number of pricey missions to many cheap ones.
</P>
<P>
   The space agency will decide what specific actions to take by
midsummer, said W. Brian Keegan, NASA's chief engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin implemented the ''faster, better, cheaper'' philosophy in
1992 in response to shrinking budgets and fears that the agency was
placing too much emphasis on too few missions.
</P>
<P>
   Those concerns were realized a year later, when the $1 billion
Mars Observer disappeared as it was about to start orbiting the Red
Planet. Years of development were lost when the probe vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Goldin continues to emphasize that future missions should be
smaller, launched more often and cost less money. At first, that
approach seemed to work: Mars Pathfinder's Independence Day 1997
landing was nearly flawless, and the orbiting Global Surveyor
continues to operate.
</P>
<P>
   Spear, who was Pathfinder's project manager at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory, said engineers and scientists ran into trouble while
developing the second generation of Mars spacecraft -- the doomed
Climate Orbiter and Polar Lander.	   ''So (faster, better, cheaper) is not
resting on your laurels,
not just accepting past ways without good reason,'' he said. ''It's
the questioning the reason for every practice, it's continuously
stepping out with new methods, new technology and taking prudent
risk.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Wins 12 Hawaii Delegates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore collected 12 Hawaii
delegate votes at the Democratic Party convention this summer while
former presidential candidate Bill Bradley picked up two during
party caucuses last week, state party leaders said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A presidential preference poll was used to apportion 14 of the
state's 33 Democratic delegates.
</P>
<P>
   The rest will be chosen by their political office or selected
later by party leaders, who will apportion them to the candidate of
their choice. All are expected to go to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In the ''Super Tuesday'' contest, Gore won 1,080 votes and
Bradley got 235 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Delays in getting information from neighboring islands delayed
the party's final report.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Gore Trade Charges  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- George W. Bush cast himself as a Washington
outsider Monday even as he embraced Republican congressional
leaders after months of keeping his distance, telling them: ''Be
patient, help is on the way.'' Al Gore talked tactics, pressing
Bush to ditch TV ads ''selling candidates the way dog food and soap
suds are sold.''
</P>
<P>
   As primary voting headed into a Southern ''Super Tuesday'' with
all the suspense gone, the two remaining major candidates -- Gore
from Florida, Bush from stops in Mississippi and Louisiana -- dueled
over which of them has the makings of a president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Gore said Americans want to continue the prosperity
begun under the Clinton-Gore administration. ''We know what works.
Are you with me?'' he asked cheering doctors, nurses and
administrators at the University of Miami's teaching hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Bush offers only ''risky'' tax cuts that no one but
special-interest campaign donors want, Gore said. ''Leadership can
make a difference. Experience can make a difference in the quality
of leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   However, at a campaign rally at Brandon High School in Brandon,
Miss., Bush declared, ''America wants somebody not of Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He shared the stage with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and
Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi, standing in front of a mural
depicting the U.S. Capitol dome. While the governor has campaigned
in recent month with GOP congressmen in their home states, he gave
Lott and Cochran prominent display both at his speech and his news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'd like to tell this Congress is be patient, help is on
the way,'' said the Texas governor, who, earlier in his campaign,
froze congressional Republicans out with criticism of their agenda
and ideology. GOP leaders are trying to hold on to majorities in
both houses, a task that will be easier if Bush runs a strong
presidential campaign, and Bush would like a Republican Congress if
he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore staged his main campaign stop of the day at Jackson
Memorial Medical Center to underscore that Bush has offered no
comprehensive health proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Just the fact that he was in Florida -- and was coming back after
going home to Tennessee to vote on Tuesday -- was significant. Some
supporters had written off Florida earlier in the campaign because
the governor here is Bush's brother, Jeb. After a weekend of polls
showing that Gore has erased Bush's lead nationally, Sen. Bob
Graham, D-Fla, said Monday that Florida is back ''in play'' for
Gore in November.
</P>
<P>
   Florida and the other five primaries of the Southern ''Super
Tuesday'' were rendered all but meaningless when Democrat Bill
Bradley and Republican John McCain dropped their campaigns. Far,
far back, Republican Alan Keyes is still in.
</P>
<P>
   Reissuing a challenge, Gore asked Bush to reject TV and radio
campaign ads in favor of twice-weekly debates and joint town
meetings where, the vice president said, he could stand his health
proposal against Bush's proposed tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he doesn't want to debate until fall because ''America
is now going into a hibernation period when it comes to politics.''
On Gore's call to stop 30-second ads, he said, ''Maybe he wants the
newspapers to decide who the president is, I intend to take my
message directly to the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said of the 30- and 60-second campaign ads: ''They end up
concluding everybody running's a dirty dog. These ads masquerade as
real, meaningful dialogue -- they're not. Most of them are slogans
and fuzzy images and selling candidates the way dog food and soap
suds are sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reform Party contender Pat Buchanan rejoined the
fray, seconding the attacks of the major parties' presumptive
nominees on each other. On NBC's ''Today'' show, Buchanan said Bush
''hasn't demonstrated the depth or capacity or wisdom or
knowledge'' to be president.
</P>
<P>
   And he said the vice president ''hasn't told the truth'' about
his fund-raiser at a Buddhist temple during his 1996 re-election
campaign. Gore's new focus on overhauling campaign finance rules
carries ''a real element of cynicism,'' said Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   As for the two major contenders and health care, Gore has
proposed expanding CHIPS, a federal-state health insurance program,
to all children and low-income parents, and allowing senior
citizens between 55 and 65 to buy into Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Bush countered that he favors expansion of CHIPS, making it less
expensive for employers to provide health insurance, and
encouraging states to develop basic health care safety nets that
''trust people to make decisions for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   At a high school outside New Orleans, an adult in the mostly
student audience asked Bush how he would ''keep Gore honest''
during the campaign. ''It's going to be a heck of a challenge,''
Bush replied, adding he hoped ''the American people will see
through all the rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ''Americans want somebody to come into office that will
restore dignity and honor to the White House and lift the spirits
of the country.'' A student then asked Bush to justify his
criticism of President Clinton for being ''vague'' during the
Monica Lewinsky investigation when Bush himself will not answer
more questions about whether he ever used illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said reporters had looked into his past. ''You can draw any
conclusions you want, but what you cannot draw is the conclusion
that I have not brought honor and respect and dignity to the
highest office in my state,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Monday, Gore met in Nashville, Tenn., with more than 30
Democratic mayors plotting get-out-the-vote and message strategies
for the fall. He also dipped into the traditionally GOP money chest
of Belle Meade, a wealthy Nashville suburb, with a $200,000
fund-raiser reception at a privately owned historic mansion.

Commons Voting on Referendum Bill Expected To Last 30 Straight
Hours
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   A parliamentary tactic that won widespread attention in December
for its novelty, if not its effectiveness, restored gridlock to the
House of Commons on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   MPs began the process of voting on 411 amendments to the Liberal
government's clarity bill, which sets up some rules on how Ottawa
would respond to a Quebec sovereignty referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The roll-call voting is expected to last about 30 straight hours
as every MP rises in turn -- 411 times -- to signify their vote. The
process is likely to end sometime early Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloc Quebecois, the only party uniformly opposed to Bill
C-20, has proposed 403 amendments (another 700 or so were
disallowed by the Commons Speaker). Eight more amendments came from
other opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Bloc's tactic is similar to one used by Reformers last
December to stall the Nisga'a land claims legislation.

Loblaw Facing Demolition of its Newest Store
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Loblaws was scrambling Monday to find a way to
avoid a shocking court order that would force Canada's largest food
retailer to demolish a big grocery store slated to open next week.
</P>
<P>
   The judgment, supporting the complaint of a competitor that the
$15-million to $20-million building contravenes city zoning laws,
is just the latest difficulty for Toronto-based Loblaw since it
began courting the Quebec market.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're examining all our legal options,'' Laurent Pepin,
spokesman for Loblaw and its Quebec subsidiary Provigo, said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Loblaw's chances to save the store in the Montreal-area
community of Brossard appear limited. Even if the company appeals,
the 7,200 square-meter building still has to be flattened within 30
days, unless a judgment to save it comes first.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge was brought by Gerard Villeneuve, owner of a Metro
Inc. franchise supermarket in a nearby mall, supported by some
other merchants.

Jane Stewart Says She ''Resented Personally'' Accusations Against
Her
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Human Resources Minister Jane Stewart lashed out
at one of her most dogged critics Monday, accusing Reformer Diane
Ablonczy of repeatedly calling her a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart again faced nonstop questions about the grants scandal
unfolding in her department as the Commons resumed sitting after a
one-week break.
</P>
<P>
   Under continued probing by Ablonczy, the Reform human resources
critic, the minister said:
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Speaker, I want to say that I have resented personally the
accusations that this member has made against me, calling me a liar
outside this House -- because she is wrong,'' Stewart shouted.
</P>
<P>
   That ended question period.
</P>
<P>
   After, Stewart would not stop to answer questions outside the
House.
</P>
<P>
   Ablonczy did not back down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, there's no trust or credibility left in this
minister,'' Ablonczy said in a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's resignation, ''would be a good first step,'' in
solving the problem, she added.

Ontario Appeal Court Reserves Decision in 'Bondage Bungalow' Case
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- An appeal court reserved its decision Monday on
whether the purpose of wild fantasies at a dominatrix's pleasure
pad was sexual arousal or sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   Terri-Jean Bedford admits she manacled, tortured and humiliated
her clients -- mainly wealthy patrons with wild fantasies -- in
exchange for money at her Toronto home.
</P>
<P>
   But she insists she didn't offer them sex.
</P>
<P>
   Bedford's lawyer Alan Young told a three-judge panel at the
Ontario Appeal Court that activities at her ''bondage bungalow''
were no more like prostitution than the service offered by a girl
at a country fair's kissing booth.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted in 1998, Bedford was fined $3,000 for operating a
common bawdy house, which was divided into theme rooms that
included a nursery, a dungeon and a classroom.	   ---
British Columbia To Sell Fast Ferries
</P>
<P>
   VICTORIA, British Columbia (AP) -- The British Columbia
government will try to get the fast-ferry monkey off its back by
selling the scandal-plagued vessels and absorbing the huge debt of
the British Columbia Ferry Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Joy MacPhail, the minister in charge of the Crown corporation,
said Monday the government will take on $1.1 billion in debt in an
effort to ensure the corporation remains afloat.
</P>
<P>
   The three catamaran fast ferries -- one of which isn't even
finished yet -- have a book value of $40 million each, although they
may sell for a higher or lower price than that.
</P>
<P>
   It cost $463 million to build all three.
</P>
<P>
   The project has added almost a half-billion dollars in debt to
the ferry corporation's books.
</P>
<P>
   She said it was time to put an end to a failed experiment.

<HEADLINE> Leftists Gain in Salvador Vote  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP) -- The country's former leftist
rebels celebrated advances Monday in nationwide elections, but the
governing rightist and their allies appeared to maintain a narrow
majority in congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Silva, candidate of the leftist Farabundo Marti National
Liberation Front, easily won re-election as mayor of the capital in
Sunday's voting. His leftist party also for the first time beat the
ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance in elections for the
National Assembly, or congress.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dramatic rebound for the Front, known as the FMLN,
which was trounced in last year's presidential voting by Francisco
Flores of the Alliance, or ARENA, which has governed the country
for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   With 88 percent of the Assembly vote counted, the FMLN and ARENA
were tied with 35 percent each, said Julio Hernandez, a magistrate
in the Supreme Electoral Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   Early calculations indicated the FMLN would have 31 seats in the
84-member Assembly, and that ARENA would have 29, he said. Three
years ago, ARENA won 28 seats to 27 for the leftists.
</P>
<P>
   But the conservative National Conciliation Party, which works
closely with the government, was expected to win 14 seats -- enough
to keep rightists in control of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez estimated that the center-left Democratic Center Union
would have three seats, the Christian Democratic Party five and the
National Action Party two.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the leading political force in the country; the partial
results give us a plurality in the Assembly, and we have also taken
important city halls from ARENA,'' said Schafick Handal, a former
guerrilla commander who is now an FMLN congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ARENA also won 124 of 262 mayoral seats -- the most of any party,
but fewer than the 161 it had held. The FMLN won 78 mayoral seats,
30 more than it previously held. Among the 78 were eight of the 14
provincial capitals, including San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Many saw Silva's re-election as a possible launching pad for the
2004 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   With 92 percent of the vote counted in the capital, the
Boston-born gynecologist had 56 percent of the vote to 39 percent
for ARENA's Luis Cardenal.
</P>
<P>
   Silva vowed to try to form a broad coalition of parties to
govern the city -- something that also might be useful in a future
presidential bid in a multiparty political system.
</P>
<P>
   The FMLN became a political party after signing a peace treaty
with the government in January 1992.

<HEADLINE> Monitors: Kyrgyzstan Election Marred  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL ROTHBART, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan (AP) -- Election monitors accused the
government Monday of interfering in weekend parliamentary
elections, a charge that undermines the country's image as a
democratic leader in Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary results released Monday showed that candidates
supported by President Askar Akayev had taken a majority in the
105-seat legislature. Full results of the Sunday vote were expected
later in the week.
</P>
<P>
   The alleged violations in Sunday's second round of parliamentary
elections included voters receiving ballots already marked with
candidates sympathetic to Akayev, according to the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the main group monitoring
elections in post-Soviet countries.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials also reportedly blocked observers from
viewing the count, the OSCE said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The positive conditions for fair and competitive elections,
which the existing legislation could have ensured, have been
undermined,'' according to a statement by the observers.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-seven of the 90 directly-elected legislative seats were
at stake, after no candidate won a majority in those districts in
the first round in February.
</P>
<P>
   The government first drew fire prior to the voting when the
courts disqualified nine opposition candidates on what the
observers characterized as trivial charges. Four more cases are
still pending.
</P>
<P>
   Kyrgyzstan, a poor, mountainous country of 4 million people, had
been considered the most democratic to emerge from Central Asia.
But Akayev, who has led the country since the 1991 breakup of the
Soviet Union, has increasingly cracked down on dissent in recent
years.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys: Intruder Killed JonBenet  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- John and Patsy Ramsey suggested that police look
to their ''inner circle'' to find their daughter's killer, perhaps
someone who was familiar with the family and may be a pedophile,
according to transcripts of an interview released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys said they believe an intruder may have waited for
hours in their home before strangling and beating the 6-year-old
child beauty queen, according to the interview, which is to air
Friday on ABC's ''20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe that we have ever knowingly met anyone that
can be this vicious. But someone killed our daughter. So we have to
start looking. We start at the inner circle and keep moving out,''
Patsy Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys also accused police of ignoring such evidence as a
handprint and DNA that could not be matched to family members or
friends. And they denied involvement in JonBenet's death, as they
have since her body was found Dec. 26, 1996, in their Boulder home.
</P>
<P>
   The ABC interview and others were scheduled to coincide with the
release of the Ramseys' book, ''The Death of Innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet was found beaten and strangled in the basement of her
parents' expensive Boulder home on Dec. 26, 1996. Patsy Ramsey
called police that morning after discovering a ransom note
demanding $118,000 for her return.
</P>
<P>
   John Ramsey and a family friend found JonBenet's body several
hours later. No suspects have been named. Boulder authorities have
said the parents remain under an ''umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   A Boulder County grand jury investigating the case adjourned in
October. No charges were filed but police are continuing the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys, who moved to suburban Atlanta with their son,
11-year-old Burke, have rarely talked publicly about JonBenet's
death.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with ''20/20'' and NBC's ''Today'' show, the
Ramseys discuss the intruder theory, which is similar to one posed
by retired Colorado Springs police Detective Lou Smit.
</P>
<P>
   On the ''Today'' show, John Ramsey suggested that people assume
an intruder killed JonBenet and he asked the public to contact
authorities if they had any leads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to try to persuade people that I'm innocent.
That's not important here. I want people to be objective and listen
and think. Because that's how this crime is going to be solved,''
he said, according to a transcript from an interview to air next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Smit gave his first extensive interviews to the Denver Rocky
Mountain News and Newsweek magazine, both on newsstands Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Smit, a well-respected investigator known for solving tough
cases, was called out of retirement in March 1997 to help the
district attorney's office with the Ramsey investigation. He
resigned in September 1998, saying he could not ''in good
conscience, be a part of the persecution of innocent people.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe there's evidence of an intruder, and I believe
people should still be looking for him ... ,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Smit, evidence that points to an intruder includes:
</P>
<P>
   -- A metal baseball bat found outside the Ramseys' home. Fibers
on the bat matched a carpet found in the basement near the storage
room where JonBenet's body was found. The bat was found ''in a
place where kids normally wouldn't play,'' Smit said, refusing to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   -- DNA evidence from JonBenet's fingernails and underpants that
indicates her attacker was a male. Authorities have not been able
to match the DNA to a specific individual.
</P>
<P>
   -- Peanut-shaped foam packing material and leaves found in the
basement that Smit thinks might have been tracked inside by someone
entering through a broken basement window.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Mark Beckner said the department has spent ''an
incredible amount of time'' following up on leads, including those
put forth by Lou Smit,'' Beckner said.
</P>
<P>
   Boulder County District Attorney Alex Hunter criticized Smit,
saying he had released confidential information. Smit denied that
he has violated any confidence.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Sierra Leone Rebels Hinder Troops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Despite promises to allow
unhindered access to international peacekeepers, Sierra Leone's
former rebels on Monday turned back a contingent of U.N. troops who
were moving into rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, a British official who just returned from
Sierra Leone blamed the former rebels' leader Foday Sankoh for
failure to implement a peace deal ending the country's bloody
8-year civil war, saying he wants to maintain a ''military
option.''
</P>
<P>
   In the West African nation Monday, soldiers from Sankoh's
Revolutionary United Front refused to allow 107 Indian peacekeepers
and six military observers past a roadblock between the
southeastern towns of Daru and Koidu, the hub of Sierra Leone's
rich diamond trade.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF soldiers said they did not have clearance to let an
armed escort move forward, U.N. officials said. The peacekeepers
later returned to their base.
</P>
<P>
   The RUF, which was brought into a power-sharing government last
year after signing the peace deal, controls much of Sierra Leone's
eastern region.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh has repeatedly promised to give the United Nation's 6,000
peacekeepers freedom of movement in Sierra Leone, but his soldiers
have continued to hinder them.
</P>
<P>
   Cease-fire violations remain commonplace despite the July peace
accord, and U.N. officials have reported rebels looting villages,
burning houses, raping women and mutilating civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Few rebels have handed in their weapons, as required by the
accord. Last month, the United Nations warned the country's rebels
to turn in their guns or face a ''forceful response'' from the
6,000-strong U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is absolutely unacceptable to the U.N. that any of the
parties who have signed an agreement should be in some way
retaining their armed forces or their weaponry and not handing it
in,'' Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock told reporters
after a Security Council meeting on Sierra Leone. ''The council's
authority, in support of the Lome peace agreement, is being
thwarted here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh, who became a minister in Sierra Leone's government under
the agreement, is ''confused'' and ''worried about his own
position,'' said Greenstock, who met Sankoh during his trip to the
country. ''I think there's an element there in his thinking that he
must retain a military option still.''
</P>
<P>
   RUF rebels killed tens of thousands and cut off the arms, legs,
ears and lips of many more in a bid to gain power through fear
during Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war.

   Cooney's career, mostly as an illustrator, spanned 60 years and
110 books. The last, ''Basket Moon,'' was published in September.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney's first book, ''Uncle Snowball,'' was published in 1940.
She won the Caldecott Medal, the highest U.S. honor for a
children's book illustrator, in 1959 for ''Chanticleer and the
Fox.'' The book was Cooney's adaptation of a story from Geoffrey
Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Her illustrations for Donald Hall's ''Ox-Cart Man'' garnered
another Caldecott in 1980. ''Miss Rumphius,'' published in 1982,

Aleksandar Nikolic:
</P>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Aleksandar Nikolic, a basketball
pioneer in Yugoslavia who was inducted into the Hall of Fame in
1998, died Sunday after a short illness. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolic coached the Yugoslav national team from 1951 to 1965,
building it into an international powerhouse. Under Nikolic,
Yugoslavia won its first international basketball medal -- a silver
at the 1961 European Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he created the ''Yugoslav school of basketball,'' which
produced many coaches and stars who dominated non-NBA basketball
and won European, world and Olympic titles.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolic was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame at
Springfield, Mass.
Nicholas Walter:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Nicolas Walter, an internationally known
anarchist, died of cancer on March 7 in the central England town of
Milton Keynes, British newspapers reported Monday. He was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Walter reached a worldwide audience in 1969 with the publication
of his short booklet, ''About Anarchism.'' It was translated into
dozens of languages including Japanese, Serbo-Croatian, Greek,
Chinese and Russian, The Independent newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, Walter was responsible for leaking secret
British government reports about what the country would do if there
was a nuclear war, prompting large-scale protests.
</P>
<P>
   Walter also wrote for British newspapers and journals and worked
on radio and television programs. He kept up production of booklets
throughout most of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Walter is survived by his wife and two daughters.
Malcolm Wilson:
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Malcolm Wilson, who served as caretaker
governor of New York for a year after Nelson Rockefeller resigned
in 1973, died Monday after a long illness. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   A conservative Republican, Wilson was Rockefeller's lieutenant
governor for 15 years before stepping into the top spot. Eight
months later, Rockefeller was appointed vice president by President
Ford after Richard Nixon's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson ran for governor in 1974, losing to Democrat Hugh Carey
in the post-Watergate backlash that engulfed GOP candidates across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Wilson had a career in banking and law.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson served in the Navy during World War II, seeing action
during the Normandy invasion.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Questions Mrs. Clinton's Run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee predicted Monday
that Hillary Rodham Clinton will have a hard time winning her
campaign for a Senate seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard for me to believe that New York would elect someone
to be senator who's never lived there, been educated there, worked
there,'' Huckabee told reporters during a question-and-answer
session. ''Someone who moves to Arkansas and said 'I've never lived
here, never been educated here, never had a job here and I want to
be your next senator.' They'd be hooted to the next border.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton, a former Arkansas first lady, could win a
Senate seat from his state, Huckabee said she could not. ''Her
views are far left of center,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''National Republicans are attacking Hillary Clinton because
they know that (New York City Mayor) Rudy Giuliani will be a
reliable vote for their right-wing agenda in the Senate,'' said
Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans -- including the Republican Giuliani, who is
Clinton's likely opponent and has campaigned with Huckabee -- have
labeled her a ''carpetbagger'' for running for a Senate seat from a
place where she had never lived. She recently bought a house in a
New York City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Huckabee also took a swipe at President Clinton, saying the
former Arkansas governor will ''go down in history as the most
polarizing president of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He just has a way of drawing a line in the sand and saying
Democrats on this side, Republicans on that side and let's have a
stalemate,'' Huckabee said.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials were not immediately available for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Will Ask U.N. To Stay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Guatemala's president wants the U.N.
mission monitoring 1996 peace accords to stay here past its
scheduled departure at year's end, his office said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   President Alfonso Portillo has not specified how much longer
he'd like MINUGUA, as the mission is known, to stay, spokesman Jose
Maria said.
</P>
<P>
   MINUGUA monitors compliance with the peace deal between
government forces and leftist guerillas that ended the 36-year
civil war. It has a broad range of responsibilities, which include
monitoring electoral reforms and overseeing projects for improving
drinking water in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Bertrand de la Grange, spokesman for the UN's Guatemala effort,
said an extension would have to be approved by the General
Assembly, but that ''it's obvious the peace process in this country
has a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   MINUGUA's 1999 edition of its annual human rights report
documented 4,800 human rights violations here, a striking increase
from 1998's total of 1,200 abuses. The report blamed last year's
''serious deterioration'' in human rights on the continued weakness
of Guatemala's legal system.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Aviation Director Fired  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The director of aviation for the
Philadelphia International Airport was fired Monday as federal
officials looked into the airport's radar tracking system, which
malfunctioned last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor John F. Street's decision to dismiss Alfred Testa Jr. came
10 months after his appointment by then-Mayor Edward G. Rendell. It
was effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal not related to Friday's radar problems, which the
Federal Aviation Administration oversees, city spokeswoman Barbara
Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the decision came down today, it was not made today.
The mayor made the decision some time ago,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Testa's attorney, Geoff Johnson, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Testa's dismissal came after an announcement that the FAA would
send a five-member team to Philadelphia Tuesday to investigate the
radar system's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The control tower's automatic radar system shut down temporarily
Friday after three circuit cards malfunctioned in one of the
system's eight processors of the computer's mainframe.

<HEADLINE> Children's Author, Illustrator Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- Children's author and illustrator Barbara
Cooney, whose works received a National Book Award and two
Caldecott Medals, has died. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney's career, mostly as an illustrator, spanned 60 years and
110 books. The last, ''Basket Moon,'' was published in September. A
resident of the coastal town of Damariscotta, she died Friday at
Maine Medical Center after a long illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was a star of children's publishing throughout the United
States, and I doubt that there is a school library or public
library in which she is not represented,'' said Tim Moses,
spokesman for her publisher, Viking Children's Books. ''We're going
to miss her very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooney's first book, ''Uncle Snowball,'' was published in 1940.
She won the Caldecott Medal, the highest U.S. honor for a
children's book illustrator, in 1959 for ''Chanticleer and the
Fox.'' The book was Cooney's adaptation of a story from Geoffrey
Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Her illustrations for Donald Hall's ''Ox-Cart Man'' garnered
another Caldecott in 1980. ''Miss Rumphius,'' published in 1982,
was one of The New York Times' 10 best illustrated books of the
year and received the next year's National Book Award for
children's picture books.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her artwork was terribly reflective of her personality, which
was apparently on the surface very simple, and yet she was an
immensely complex and talented lady,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney was born in New York City in 1917. She grew up on Long
Island and moved to Maine 17 years ago. She knew the state from
childhood visits to her grandmother, who was a teacher in a
one-room schoolhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Many of her books focused on the culture, history and society of
Maine. Her love for her new home and for books prompted her to
donate $850,000 in 1997 to help build a library in Damariscotta.
</P>
<P>
   A fan of the author, Gov. Angus King dubbed Cooney an official
state treasure in 1996 and named a ''Barbara Cooney Day'' that
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Barbara's death is a tremendous loss to the literary community
and to the people of Maine,'' King said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cooney is survived by her husband, four children, three
grandchildren and one great-grandchild.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Sweat Lodge Request  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge on Monday rejected a
convicted serial killer's request that he be allowed to participate
in an Indian sweat lodge ceremony before his execution this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Darrell Rich had gone to federal court to try to
force prison officials to allow Rich, who is part Cherokee, to use
a sweat lodge on prison grounds as a religious last rite.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a simple proposition. It really is just a matter of
whether or not you can let this man go to church before he is
executed,'' lawyer James Thomson told U.S. District Judge Vaughn
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials said the sweat lodge is too high a security
risk. Allowing Rich to be unrestrained in a ceremony that includes
a rake, a shovel and hot rocks is ''just a formula for disaster,''
said Dannette Valdez, a deputy attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat lodges are used in some American Indian religious
ceremonies to purify the spirit. Participants sit within an
enclosed structure and pray while water is poured over fire-heated
rocks.
</P>
<P>
   Walker agreed that prison officials have legitimate security
concerns and said they have given Rich the same treatment as
inmates of other faiths.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's lawyers are appealing the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Rich was convicted of killing three women and a girl and
attacking five other women. He is scheduled to die early Wednesday.
Gov. Gray Davis on Friday turned down a request for clemency.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, Rich said the ceremony was ''critical for
making amends and preparing to meet my Maker, my ancestors and
those persons I have harmed during my time on the earth.''

<HEADLINE> Chavez Rejects Press Freedom Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- President Hugo Chavez on Monday
rejected a report by the InterAmerican Press Association
criticizing his government's performance in respecting press
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual meeting in Cancun, Mexico, over the weekend, the
IAPA expressed concern about a provision in Venezuela's new
constitution, pushed through by Chavez, requiring the news media to
publish ''truthful information.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Venezuela respects ''in a generic way''
basic press freedoms, the report criticized Chavez's ''constant
threats and insults against the print media and their editors and
directors.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Freedom to criticize is respected absolutely,'' Chavez told
reporters in Caracas, adding: ''I'm not going to lose any sleep
over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez reiterated earlier statements saying certain elements in
the media have ''manipulated and blackmailed in the name of freedom
of expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former army paratrooper who staged a failed coup
attempt 8 years ago, became president in February 1999 promising to
rule in favor of the poor. His leftist coalition has transformed
Venezuelan politics, virtually eliminating the traditional parties
that ruled Venezuela during four decades of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   An IAPA mission in November traveled to Venezuela to express
concern about the new constitution's ''truthful information''
clause, saying it could be used to squelch press freedom in the
South American nation.

<HEADLINE> Official: Drug Arrest Well Planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The arrest of a major Mexican drug suspect
last weekend was well-planned, not the result of a chance weapons
check, a human rights official involved in the case said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican attorney general's office said that Jesus Labra was
arrested after he was spotted with a .38-caliber pistol during a
check for illegal weapons among spectators at a youth football game
in the border city of Tijuana. Labra is suspected of being a leader
of the Tijuana-based Arrellano Felix drug organization.
</P>
<P>
   But Victor Clark Alfaro, president of Tijuana's Binational
Center of Human Rights, said the arrest was the result of a
well-planned operation. Clark Alfaro was in the police station
where Labra had been detained to assure Labra's safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''The operation was planned in Mexico City with federal agents
there working in coordination with military officials here,'' he
said in a telephone interview from Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how the case against Labra would be affected if
the arrest had been well-planned instead of a chance weapons check.
Labra's attorney, Gustavo Galvez Reyes, has accused authorities of
arresting his client without a warrant, but Labra did face a court
order to testify on possible drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Labra, about 50 years old, was a prominent businessman in
Tijuana a decade ago before rumors linking him to the Arellano
Felix brothers arose and he dropped out of public view.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexico City daily Reforma said Labra was married to an aunt
of the brothers and had been a key figure in the gang since it
began to take over narcotics trafficking in the area at the start
of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous local press accounts said Labra was arrested Saturday
when heavily armed men in civilian clothes charged directly at
Labra on school grounds where a football game involving Labra's son
was being played.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office said in a statement Sunday that
when soldiers inspecting for weapons tried to question Labra, he
tried to escape and was subdued by soldiers, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Galvez Reyes, Labra's attorney, claimed that agents from the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration participated in the arrest.
Terry Parham, chief spokesman for the DEA, said in a telephone
interview from Washington that the agency had no role in the
investigation or arrest.

<HEADLINE> FCC Seeks Airwaves Trading System  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the proliferation of cellular telephones,
pagers and other wireless devices, federal regulators that oversee
the nation's airwaves are devising ways to utilize it more
efficiently. They are looking at plans that treat airwaves as
commodities to be bought and sold on the open market -- a shift from
the traditional licensing process.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has laid out various steps
they are taking to better utilize existing portions of the
airwaves, and is looking to create a secondary market so that
companies can have access to slices of the airwaves being held by a
licensee but not in use.
</P>
<P>
   One way to achieve this is to encourage license holders that
aren't using all of their frequencies to post that availability on
a Web site for other interested companies.
</P>
<P>
   FCC officials say they are ultimately looking to set in place a
system that fuels innovative uses and let the marketplace determine
the value of the frequencies.
</P>
<P>
   Moving toward this secondary market for frequencies, the FCC
created last week a new class of commercial licensees called
''guard band managers'' in anticipation of an upcoming auction.
These managers will receive their licenses through the normal
bidding process, but could turn around and lease slices of the
airwaves to commercial service providers or third parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an innovative and efficient approach to licensing,''
FCC Chairman William Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, the government licenses each user and
regulates what frequencies and signal power it can use. The rights
have never been bought and sold in a secondary market.
</P>
<P>
   But the burgeoning use of wireless devices -- expected to grow in
the years ahead -- has regulators looking for creative ways to
harness existing spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ''For your industry and for the commission, the biggest
challenge is the dwindling supply of quality spectrum,'' Kennard
told the wireless industry at a convention last month.
</P>
<P>
   In developing this new secondary market, the FCC would allow
licensees who own the rights to a slice of the airwaves to profit
from any surplus, such as parts not in use 24 hours a day. The
commission is expected to hold forums on the issue this spring.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the commission also will begin looking into a new
technology called software defined radio, that also helps to make
more efficient use of unused portions of the airwaves. Using a
system akin to a computer chip, these radios can find frequencies
that are not being utilized, and then make the necessary
adjustments so those frequencies can be used by the device.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if several broadcasters are covering the same
sporting match, they could use software defined radios to seek out
frequencies that perhaps taxi drivers in the area are not using,
FCC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   It could be several more years before consumers benefit from the
technology -- but ultimately it will make it easier for them to
access the airwaves when they want to without running into
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC also is expected to auction frequencies this spring that
are particularly good for delivering wireless Internet service to
home and handheld computers. These frequencies currently belong to
analog TV broadcasters using channels 60 to 69. Those broadcasters
will eventually shift to digital and have to give up those analog
channels, but that could take years.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard is urging broadcasters currently occupying those analog
channels to voluntarily negotiate deals with the auction winners so
that the airwaves can start being put to use to provide wireless
data and other services as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Nader: I'll Qualify for All States  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Consumer advocate and Green Party presidential
candidate Ralph Nader predicted Monday that he will qualify for the
November ballot in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said that while the Reform Party is somewhat fractured,
his party is ''growing quite readily'' as an alternative to the
Democratic and Republican parties -- ''which is really one party
with two heads wearing make-up.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to be on every state's ballot,'' he told about 100
people who turned out at the University of Nevada, Reno. ''This is
going to be a four-party race in November.''
</P>
<P>
   The progressive Green Party, founded in 1996, shares Thomas
Jefferson's and James Madison's view of government as ''a public
check against the excesses of monied interests,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   The abolitionist, trade union, environmental and consumer
movements all have targeted the same evil -- ''excessive
concentration of power and wealth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said too many working Americans have been left behind in
the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who received less than 1 percent of the vote as the Green
Party candidate for president in 1996, said he plans to visit all
50 states. Nevada is the eighth state he has visited so far.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nader said Republican George W. Bush should welcome
him as a participant in presidential debates with Vice President Al
Gore, not only as a strategy to divide liberal votes but also to
help mask what he said were Bush's poor debating skills.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you aspire to the presidency, you should be able to speak
without a TelePrompTer and without cue cards for more than 15
seconds,'' Nader said.

North Korean diplomats are turning gregarious. They just visited
Canada for the first time, they're talking to counterparts in New
York and they're preparing to play host to envoys from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   These days, rival South Korea is also seeking the world's ear:
its foreign minister, Lee Joung-binn, was in Washington on Monday
for talks with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the two Koreas remain locked in an armed standoff,
their parallel diplomatic campaigns ally them in the same pursuit:
Communist North Korea appears eager to engage the world it has
simultaneously spurned and relied on for decades, and Seoul is
anxious to help.
</P>
<P>
   A striking symbol of Pyongyang's policy shift could come in
April if a visit by a top North Korean official to Washington goes
ahead as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, U.S. and North Korean envoys opened talks in New York
to discuss the trip. One possible candidate to lead the delegation
is Kang Sok Ju, North Korea's first deputy foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea could be acting out of desperation as much as a
desire for reconciliation if it dispatches Kang to a nation it has
long regarded as the crucible of imperialist evil.
</P>
<P>
   Years of famine brought on by drought, floods and economic
mismanagement forced the totalitarian state to appeal for food
donations from international donors, including the United States.
Aid workers say the situation remains precarious.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile and nuclear programs and human rights
record would likely be on the agenda in Washington. Also, North
Korea wants the United States to remove it from a U.S. list of
countries that sponsor terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang was put on the list because of involvement in the
midair bombing of a South Korean airliner near Burma, now Myanmar,
in 1987. All 115 people on board the Korean Air plane died.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington meeting would be a vindication of the so-called
''sunshine'' policy of South Korean President Kim Dae-jung, who has
tried to woo the recalcitrant North with sports, business and
cultural contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Kim is under domestic pressure to show results from his
gradualist policy, which critics say has failed to win concessions
and has instead funded North Korea's military machine. Opposition
leaders have seized on the issue ahead of parliamentary elections
on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea also has a home audience to please. While its
diplomats talk behind closed doors to American negotiators, its
official media pumps out diatribes denigrating the United States as
''brigandish,'' ''impudent,'' ''sinister'' and ''criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang still refuses to talk, at least publicly, to the
government in Seoul, which it rejects as illegitimate. In a speech
last week in Berlin, South Korea's Kim delivered another appeal for
direct talks and offered more economic help to the North.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan praised the ''the increasingly
positive signs'' on the divided Korean peninsula, and urged North
and South to quickly open dialogue, spokesman Fred Eckhard said
Monday. Annan stands ready to help efforts to reduce tensions and
promote mutual confidence, if asked to take a role, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the strength of U.S.-South Korean ties is evident in
the 37,000 American soldiers stationed on the Korean peninsula,
there is concern that North Korea is trying to drive a wedge in the
alliance by talking only to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that they don't have that illusion of any possibility
of isolating our country,'' said S.J. Yoon, a presidential
spokesman in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of allies by the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade
ago, North Korea is pursuing ties. Normalization talks with Japan,
which has decided to resume food aid to the North, are expected to
start next month.
</P>
<P>
   Four Foreign Ministry officials visited Canada earlier this
month, and several British diplomats are expected to visit
Pyongyang in April or May. Canada and Britain have donated aid to
North Korea but neither has immediate plans to establish official
diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is also stepping up overtures to its chief ally,
China, perhaps to ease any concern in Beijing about its new
contacts with the West. In a highly unusual move, North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il visited the Chinese embassy in Pyongyang a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   China's decision in 1992 to formally recognize South Korea, now
a major trading partner, strained relations with the North. But
Beijing's own concerns about U.S. and Japanese sway in the region
may have encouraged it to improve ties with Pyongyang in the past
year.

U.S.-China Trade Deal To Be Detailed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bowing to congressional criticism about secret trade
deals, Clinton administration officials said they will release tomorrow the full
text of its market-opening agreement with China. In a US-China deal reached in
Beijing in November, China agreed to remove barriers that American exporters
have long complained are keeping billions of dollars of their products out of
the Chinese market. In return, the Clinton administration said it would support
China's entry into the World Trade Organization.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian and Israeli negotiators failed to reach
agreement Monday on the timing of an Israeli withdrawal from part of the West
Bank, but Israel reportedly softened its position on a key Palestinian demand to
include Jerusalem suburbs as part of the withdrawal. Palestinians expect Israel
to carry out an overdue troop withdrawal from 6.1 percent of the West Bank,
release at least 150 Palestinian prisoners and conclude an agreement on the
opening of a second land route for Palestinians between the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank. Israel TV said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak would present the
withdrawal maps to his security Cabinet for approval Wednesday.

Spain Conservatives Win in Landslide

   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- The ruling conservatives won a landslide victory in
general elections that gave Spain its strongest right-leaning government and
weakest opposition in a generation. The sweeping win by the Popular Party of
reformer Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar appeared to put an end to a long-held
notion that endured through Aznar's first 4-year term: that Spain was basically
a center-left country. Sunday's vote dealt a crushing defeat to the left. The
vote gave Aznar 183 seats in the 350-seat Congress of Deputies, a gain of 27

the makings of a president. In Florida, Gore pressed Bush to drop TV ads

months of keeping his distance, urging them: ''Be patient, help is on the way.''

Study: Estrogen Won't Block Heart Disease
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Challenging a medical doctrine that has stood for two
decades, a study found no evidence that estrogen supplements protect older women
from heart disease. The findings are likely to confuse doctors and patients
alike about the already complicated decision of whether to take estrogen for
many years after menopause. That belief has been a centerpiece of women's health
care since the 1980s and has helped make the estrogen pill Premarin the most
widely prescribed medicine in the United States.

day after the nation's largest health insurer rejected a $10 billion takeover
bid and unveiled plans to split its health care and financial services
businesses into two publicly traded companies. Aetna, hurt by rising medical
costs, several class-action lawsuits and cold relations with doctors and
hospitals, said it plans to divide the company by the end of the year. The

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Sacramento State basketball coach Tom
Abatemarco resigned Monday, a week after the Hornets finished the
season 9-18.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on university letterhead, received by news
organizations Monday, Abatemarco wrote that ''due to personal
reasons, I will be unable to continue as head basketball coach, and
am, therefore, resigning effective immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Abatemarco nor the university officials responded to
telephone messages left Monday afternoon seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Abatemarco had been under pressure because of reports of
strained relations with some of his players. Fourteen players left
the program during Abatemarco's three-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic director Debby Colberg said earlier this month that she
would evaluate Abatemarco, 48, who was paid $76,596 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Abatemarco inherited a woeful program that had gone
20-112 the previous five years. After going 1-25 in his first
season, Abatemarco led the Hornets to a 3-23 mark in 1998-99.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Pedophile Sentenced To Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- A convicted pedophile and killer
was sentenced to death Monday for the murder of two young sisters
he strangled after he raped one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Howard Steven Ault case led to a new Florida law expanding
public access to information on convicted sexual predators.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit Judge Marc Gold accepted jurors' September
recommendation that Ault be sentenced to death for the 1996
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Ault was convicted Aug. 11 of first-degree murder in the deaths
of DeAnn Mu'min, 11, and her 7-year-old sister, Alicia Jones. Ault
raped the older girl.
</P>
<P>
   Ault, 33, also was convicted on two counts of capital sexual
battery, kidnapping and aggravated child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   He was on supervised community release for a 1988 sex crime when
he befriended the girls' mother and picked the children up from
school one day, promising them candy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Ault's case, legislators passed a bill in 1997
tightening loopholes on public listings of registered sexual
predators and adding several new measures, including providing
photos of convicted sexual offenders on request.

<HEADLINE> Toyota Sets Up S. Korea Subsidary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Toyota Motor Corp. has set up a sales subsidiary in
South Korea and become the first Japanese automaker to begin
full-scale operations in the country, the company said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It marks the first time Japanese-made cars will be sold in South
Korea other than on a trial basis, said Toyota spokesman Koki
Konishi.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota made the move after the South Korean government lifted an
import ban on automobiles from Japan in July, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new Toyota Motor Korea Co., set up in Seoul recently, is
capitalized at $7.4 million and wholly owned by Toyota Motor.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota Motor Korea plans to kick off sales activities in January
of next year, with a sales target of 800 Lexus models in its first
12 months. It will initially employ 18 local workers, Konishi said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Toyota began selling its U.S.-made Avalon and Camry
models in South Korea on a trial basis but sales were meager,
Konishi said.

<HEADLINE> Young, Old, Borges Win Book Awards  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Honoring the young and the old, the living and
the dead, the National Book Critics Circle gave awards Monday night
to a 30-something novelist, an octogenarian poet and the late
Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Lethem won the fiction prize for ''Motherless
Brooklyn,'' the story of an orphan with Tourette's syndrome who
grows up to be a detective. Lethem has written several previous
books, including the crime novels ''Amnesia Moon'' and ''Gun, With
Occasional Music.''
</P>
<P>
   ''After the ceremony I'm being taken out to dinner by my
publisher and I'll probably spend the whole meal pinching myself,''
said Lethem, who turns 36 this year and whose book already has been
optioned for a movie, with Edward Norton expected to play the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Among the fiction finalists were the acclaimed South African
writer J.M. Coetzee, whose novel ''Disgrace'' already had won
Britain's Booker Prize, and David Gates, a two-time nominee and an
admirer of Lethem's book.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved the language, and I loved the concept. Who would have
had thought of such a story?'' Gates said of Lethem's book.
</P>
<P>
   The poetry prize went to 84-year-old Ruth Stone, for her
collection ''Ordinary Words.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges, who died in 1986, won in the criticism category for
''Selected Non-Fictions,'' a compilation of essays, lectures and
film reviews published last year to mark the centennial of his
birth.
</P>
<P>
   The general nonfiction award went to Jonathan Weiner for ''Time,
Love, Memory: A Great Biologist and His Quest for the Origins of
Behavior.'' Harry Wiencek received the biography-autobiography
prize for ''The Hairstons: An American Family in Black and White.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Book Critics Circle also gave out three honorary
awards, including a lifetime achievement prize to retired New
Yorker film critic Pauline Kael. In a statement read by humorist
Roy Blount, Kael offered a hopeful -- and sardonic -- future for her
beloved art form.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the last few years a number of prominent journalists have
suggested movies are finished,'' Kael said. ''They argue that
people have stopped going because the highly touted ones are often
disappointing or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're wrong, I think. They are assuming people are rational
about going to movies. It isn't just publicity that turns us into
suckers. We turn ourselves into suckers.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Book Critics Circle, founded in 1974, is a
not-for-profit organization of book editors and critics with 750
members nationwide.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Makes Historic Visit to Hanoi  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DONG PHU, Vietnam (AP) -- Peering into a mud hole six feet deep,
surrounded by rice paddies, Defense Secretary William Cohen saw for
himself the heroic efforts -- and possibly the futility -- of
America's quest to return home the remains of 2,000 servicemen
still missing from the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   In that hole stood a mud-caked forensic anthropologist, Dennis
Danielson, and a dozen others lifting slabs of earth into metal
buckets. One by one, the buckets were handed along a human chain of
dozens of Vietnamese workers, some of them nearly knee-deep in the
glistening mud, to be sifted by hand for even the tiniest scraps of
wire, metal or human remains -- clues to one more MIA mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will do whatever we can to bring some peace of mind to the
families who have lost their loved ones'' in the war that cost more
than 58,000 American lives, Cohen told reporters Monday at the
excavation site, thought to be the location of a downed U.S.
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are making every conceivable effort to find the remains and
bring them home,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Resolving the remaining missing-in-action cases, Cohen said, is
''the very highest of our priorities.'' It also is the main
foundation upon which Washington and Hanoi are attempting to build
a military-to-military relationship a generation after the last
U.S. combat forces withdrew from Vietnam in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was no coincidence that one of the first things Cohen
did upon arriving in Vietnam -- as the first American secretary of
defense to visit since the war -- was travel to the excavation site
near the village of Dong Phu, about 20 miles southwest of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers gawked and giggled at the commotion caused by a U.S.
defense chief, his security entourage, his stern-faced Vietnamese
military escorts and a gaggle of reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen thanked the Vietnamese -- who lost an estimated 3 million
of their own people during the war -- for their cooperation in
searching for missing U.S. servicemen. Later, in a Hanoi dinner
toast to his Vietnamese hosts, Cohen said the diggers are ''seeking
to heal the pain of a family who waits on their work.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday morning, Cohen spoke at the National Defense Academy,
the highest-level service college for Vietnamese military officers,
and was to meet with President Tran Duc Luong before flying to Ho
Chi Minh City, the former Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at the military academy, Cohen made only one
explicit reference to the war but said the United States and
Vietnam must ''understand and honor the past'' while seeking a new
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''In full view of a shared history of both pride and pain,'' he
said, ''I stand before you on behalf of the United States
Department of Defense to advance the interests of both our
nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Before trekking to the excavation site Monday, Cohen met with
Defense Minister Pham Van Tra and then with Prime Minister Phan Van
Khai.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward U.S. Ambassador Pete Peterson told reporters the talks
had been ''very cordial, very comfortable,'' and he described the
occasion as a historic step toward achieving truly normal relations
between former war enemies.
</P>
<P>
   ''You couldn't have imagined this happening four or five years
ago -- maybe not even two years ago,'' said Peterson, a former
prisoner of war who spent years at the infamous ''Hanoi Hilton''
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the main focus of his two-day visit will be
emphasizing the importance of joint U.S.-Vietnamese efforts to
find, recover and repatriate the remains of American servicemen
missing from the war.
</P>
<P>
   The last U.S. troops were withdrawn from Vietnam in 1973. Two
years later, the communist forces took Saigon -- now known as Ho Chi
Minh City -- and reunited the country. About 2,000 U.S. servicemen
are listed as unaccounted for in Southeast Asia, including about
1,500 on Vietnamese soil.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials believe, but have not yet proven, that the
aircraft lost at the site Cohen visited on Monday was an F-4B
Phantom jet piloted by Navy Cmdr. Richard N. Rich of Stamford,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Two pieces of bone have been found in the muddy earth but not
yet proven to be human, Danielson said in an interview. The
excavation is scheduled to conclude March 22, but the dig might be
resumed later, depending on the evidence gleaned from the scraps of
metal, wire and other items found so far.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's F-4B was shot down May 19, 1967, by a surface-to-air
missile. The plane's radar intercept officer, Lt. Cmdr. William
Stark, parachuted from the diving aircraft. He was captured,
imprisoned and released in March 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen is believed to be the first U.S. defense secretary ever to
visit Hanoi.

   Among the sites Cohen passed as his motorcade sped through the
city's dusty, bustling streets was the prison nicknamed the ''Hanoi
Hilton,'' where American POWs were held during the war. It is now a
war museum. Vietnamese officials later gave him a brick they said
was from the former prison.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters about the coincidence of his visit coming
amid Vietnam's national celebration of the 25th anniversary of its
defeat of U.S.-backed South Vietnam, Cohen said he preferred to
emphasize a different milestone -- the coming five-year anniversary
of the resumption of political ties.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton restored diplomatic relations with communist
Vietnam in June 1995.

<P>
   ''The reason I'm here is to look to the future,'' Cohen told
reporters.

<HEADLINE> Annan Warns on Iraqi Oil Industry  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq's oil industry will continue to
deteriorate, jeopardizing U.N. relief operations, unless more spare
parts are allowed into the country immediately, Secretary-General
Kofi Annan warned in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Annan called for the Security Council's sanctions committee to
double the amount of spare parts Iraq can buy and to streamline its
review of contracts for the equipment ''to offset permanent damage
to oil-bearing structures in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   The 63-page report details how low oil prices, bureaucratic
delays and blocked contracts have undermined efforts to improve
life for 22 million Iraqis living under U.N. trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. oil-for-food program, launched in 1996 to ease the
effects of sanctions on ordinary Iraqis, allows Baghdad to sell its
oil through U.N.-monitored sales. The proceeds go mainly to buy
food and medicine but $300 million every six months is earmarked to
buy spare parts for Iraq's oil sector.
</P>
<P>
   While $6.7 billion in goods have arrived in Iraq since the
program began, another $1.5 billion in contracts have been placed
on ''hold'' -- most for oil spare parts and equipment to upgrade
Iraq's electricity sector and water sanitation system.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has placed the bulk of those contracts in
limbo, saying it wants to make sure the goods aren't diverted for
military use.
</P>
<P>
   ''The effectiveness of the program has suffered considerably not
only due to shortfalls in the funding level, but also due to the
very large number of applications placed on hold,'' Annan said in
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Oil exports have fallen from 1999 levels by about 300,000
barrels per day, and Iraqi Oil Ministry officials say further
reductions are likely unless oil sector spare parts are delivered
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The report said production could decline another 5 percent to 15
percent unless the delivery of spare parts is accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability of the Iraqi oil industry to sustain the current
reduced production levels will be seriously compromised, unless
effective action is taken immediately to reverse the situation,''
it said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. oil industry experts visited Iraq in January to assess the
state of the industry and explore options for increasing production
and exports.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the United States would continue to take a hard look at
equipment bound for Iraq until U.N. weapons inspectors return, but
would look positively on a recommendation to increase Iraq's spare
parts quota.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said the $300 million every six months should be increased
to $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Annan also took the government of Iraq to task for failing to
present a clear plan for the purchase and distribution of
humanitarian supplies, and called on Baghdad to submit contracts to
the United Nations faster.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq was placed under trade sanctions after it invaded
neighboring Kuwait in 1990. Sanctions cannot be lifted until
weapons inspectors report Iraq is free of its weapons of mass
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Weapons Dug Up in Doctor's Yard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. (AP) -- Police found about 20 automatic and
semi-automatic assault weapons and some 50 rounds of incendiary
ammunition inside canisters removed from the yard of a doctor who
killed himself days after his business partner was shot.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons and ammunition were inventoried on Monday from the
remaining five plastic canisters found buried beneath a concrete
slab in Dr. Larry Ford's backyard, said Lt. Sam Allevato. When
police examined the sixth canister on Friday, they found 2 { pounds
of C-4 military-style plastic explosives.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, investigators found hazardous materials in jars in
Ford's home, and weapons and ammunition in 21 plastic containers
beneath a false floor. The contents were taken to FBI headquarters
in Virginia for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ford shot himself March 2, three days after his partner, James
Patrick Riley, was wounded outside his office by a masked gunman.
</P>
<P>
   Riley and Ford worked together at Biofem Pharmaceutical Inc., a
biomedical company formed to market female suppositories to prevent
sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was questioned in connection with the shooting but was not
suspected because he was in Biofem's office at the time,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ford's death, his attorneys have said the infectious
disease specialist did research on biological matters for the
federal government. The South African embassy in Washington is
investigating reports he provided biological weapons advice to the
South African Defense Force.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, NRA Continue Trading Barbs  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- President Clinton said the National Rifle
Association used smear tactics in accusing him of milking political
gain from gun violence. He challenged a top official of the group
to ''look into the eyes'' of bereaved parents and repeat the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of Cleveland appearances Monday, Clinton accused the
NRA of stalling his gun legislation with ''slash-and-burn''
strategies. And he upped the ante in a dispute that has taken a
bitterly personal turn.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's executive vice
president, said Clinton apparently ''needs a certain level of
violence in this country'' to serve his political ends. ''He's
willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his
political agenda and his vice president, too,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quoted that accusation to his audiences Monday and said:
''I would like to see him look into the eyes of little Kayla
Rolland's mother and say that; or the parents at Columbine; or
Springfield, Oregon; or Jonesboro, Arkansas; or the families of
those people that were shot in Memphis.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I want you to see what we're up against whenever we try to
change here,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But LaPierre held his ground, saying it is Clinton who owes the
parents of children killed by guns an explanation of why federal
gun laws are being so poorly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he should look them in the eye and explain why he
won't enforce the laws against crack dealers with guns and take
them off the street,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, came back with another round of retorts,
telling a Chicago fund-raising event Monday night that LaPierre's
comments were ''pretty hard for me to take.'' ''I guess he was
frustrated,'' Clinton said of LaPierre, adding that he believes the
NRA had made killing gun legislation its ''main mission in life.''
</P>
<P>
   He also tried to make light of the running dispute. ''It's
amazing to me that I get into these tussles with the NRA,'' Clinton
said. As Arkansas governor, ''I once got a lifetime membership to
the NRA. I think it's been revoked now.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre said the 6-year-old boy accused of shooting Kayla
Rolland came from a ''crack house full of guns and contraband.''
That, he said, is just the sort of situation the administration has
not bothered to prosecute in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's not for a political agenda, they need to say something
to the NRA or the American people that makes sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to a Democratic fund-raising event and a group
gathered to hear his plans for Medicare drug coverage before going
on to Chicago to raise almost $800,000 for the Democratic National
Committee at two more events.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal sparring was touched off by a new campaign in which
NRA President Charlton Heston implies in television ads that
Clinton lied when he characterized the NRA as stubbornly resistant
to reasonable gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''When what you say is wrong, that's a mistake,'' Heston says in
several of them. ''When you know it's wrong, that's a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said of the NRA: ''We ought not to engage in this kind
of political smear tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, campaigning in Miami, said LaPierre's
remark betrayed ''a kind of sickness at the very heart of the
NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone who has spent time, as I have -- many times -- with the
families of the victims of gun violence, and felt the heartache,
seen the way gun violence tears families apart, couldn't possibly
make such a comment,'' Gore said. ''I call upon him to apologize
for those comments to the people of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, LaPierre said ''Gore needs to apologize to the
American public for not enforcing the existing federal firearms
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George Bush, campaigning in Mississippi along with
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, shunned the fray and appealed
for restraint. ''I think we can have a civil discussion on
emotional issues without name-calling,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, said the NRA statements amounted to a personal
attack on him and only served to underscore differences between the
parties on gun control, ''and America has to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm trying to fire your energy for the coming combat,''
Clinton told his Democratic audience in Cleveland. ''Maybe he
really believes this. But if he does, we've got even more trouble
than if it's just a horrible political mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre insisted: ''Our gripe is with the policy, not the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun legislation that Clinton is pursuing would require
handgun purchasers to undergo background checks that could take as
long as 72 hours. Many congressional Republicans and the NRA want
any such checks to be instant, or at least no longer than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also wants background checks at gun shows, mandatory
child-safety locks and an option for states to issue photo licenses
to gun buyers.

<HEADLINE> Devils 3, Penguins 2  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils, in a scoring slump for
more than a month, twice opened two-goals leads before holding off
Pittsburgh 3-2 Monday night on Bobby Holik's goal off a Penguins
player's skate.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, trying to hold off Toronto and Philadelphia to keep
their nearly season-long lead in the Eastern Conference, had scored
more than two goals only twice in 12 games before taking a 3-1 lead
in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Holik scored the game-winner at 17:36 of the second, stealing
the puck near the blue line and shooting it off Penguins forward
Ian Moran's skate blade as Moran skated across the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Wright had an assist and scored to cut New Jersey's lead
to 3-2 late in the second period. But the Devils tightened up
defensively while allowing the Penguins only one shot in the first
15 minutes of the third period to finish 3-3-1 on their longest
road trip of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, attempting to win their fourth consecutive
conference regular-season title, were 3-7-2 in their previous 12
games before beating Pittsburgh for the third time in four games.
</P>
<P>
   By winning, the Devils (40-22-8) assured themselves of a fourth
consecutive 40-victory season.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins are 2-7-2 without the injured Jaromir Jagr, who
needed surgery last month on his left thigh and may not play again
until late in the season.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Penguins aren't generating much offense
without the NHL's leading scorer. They have gone 16 consecutive
games without scoring more than three goals, their longest such
streak since the 1970-71 -- only their fourth season in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Defensemen Krzystzof Oliwa and Scott Stevens each made nice
plays offensively to help New Jersey open a 2-0 lead, a rarity of
late as the Devils have struggled to score.
</P>
<P>
   Oliwa took Denis Pederson's drop pass behind the net and
centered to Jay Pandolfo, who jammed the puck into the net at 2:16
of the first period for his sixth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Less than four minutes later, Stevens grabbed the puck in the
neutral zone and sped it up the ice to Sergei Nemchinov, who
one-timed it over Jean-Sebastien Aubin's left shoulder from the top
of the left circle.
</P>
<P>
   Aleksey Morozov made it 2-1 later in the first period with his
11th goal and assisted on Wright's goal in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur won his 38th game of the
season, nine short of Bernie Parent's NHL record of 47 in a season.
The Devils have 12 games remaining.

<HEADLINE> Stars 4, Rangers 3  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jamie Langenbrunner had two goals and Mike
Modano extended his point streak to a career-high 10 games Monday
night as the Dallas Stars rallied for a 4-3 victory over the New
York Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner's second goal with 8:17 left, set up by Modano,
broke a 3-3 tie. The defending Stanley Cup champions, who trailed
3-1, got goals from Scott Thornton and Jon Sim in the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   Langenbrunner, playing his 300th career game, has 14 goals this
season for the Stars, who won for the 31st straight time on the
road when they score at least three goals.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Fernandez, playing his fourth consecutive game in place of
Ed Belfour, made 30 saves for his second win in as many days.
Fernandez, who hadn't made consecutive starts all season, is 2-2
since Belfour left the team.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, arrested last week on assault charges, is expected to
rejoin the Stars on Tuesday and be available to play Wednesday
night at New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez kept it tied when he stopped Radek Dvorak's penalty
shot with 29.5 seconds left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak had a goal and an assist for the Rangers, 1-4 in five
games. New York, in 10th place, wasted a chance to jump up to
seventh in the Eastern Conference playoff race.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who have 11 games remaining, have missed the
playoffs in each of the last two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty shot was awarded, with New York shorthanded, when
Dvorak was pulled down by former Rangers defenseman Sergei Zubov.
On the attempt, Dvorak deked to his backhand, but was denied when
Fernandez deflected the shot with the shaft of his goal stick.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton made it 3-2 at 7:03 of the second when he took a pass
from Joe Nieuwendyk in the high slot and scored his fifth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Sim's fifth goal with 3:50 left brought Dallas all the way back.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas grabbed a 1-0 lead just 1:47 into the game, with the
teams skating 4-on-4, when Langenbrunner scored on the Stars' third
shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers came back 14 seconds later when Dvorak beat
Fernandez with a rising slap shot from just inside the blue line.
Dvorak's 18th was also scored when both teams had a man in the
penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   New York made it 2-1, with the teams once again skating 4-on-4.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Leetch drew three defenders to him in the left circle and
fed Mathieu Schneider, who ripped a shot for his eighth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Petr Nedved's breakaway goal 2:49 into the second made it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars also were without forwards Jere Lehtinen (ankle),
Blake Sloan (leg), Guy Carbonneau (wrist), Brian Skrudland (chest)
and defenseman Shawn Chambers (knee). A woozy Darryl Sydor was
helped off the ice after he slid face first into the end boards.
</P>
<P>
   New York forward John MacLean missed his fourth straight game
with an eye injury.

<HEADLINE> Illinois Priest Ordered To Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RACINE, Wis. (AP) -- A priest accused of setting up a sexual
encounter via the Internet with an undercover agent posing as a
14-year-old boy was ordered Monday to stand trial on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John M. Furdek, 47, of Villa Park, Ill., was arrested
Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said he had traveled to Racine to meet the ''boy''
at a fast-food restaurant, intending to sell him anabolic steroids
-- a drug associated with muscle-building -- and to have sex.
</P>
<P>
   At a preliminary hearing, defense attorney Patrick Cafferty
asked the judge to rule only on the drug charges. He said he plans
to file a motion for dismissal on the sex-related charges against
Furdek, pastor of St. Alexander's Catholic Church in Villa Park,
Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Furdek was charged with possession of anabolic steroids with the
intent to deliver, possession of marijuana, attempted second-degree
sexual assault of a child, solicitation of a child, attempted child
enticement-sexual contact and possession of drug paraphernalia.

<HEADLINE> Sanwa Bank Said To Join Bank Merger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Sanwa Bank is in the final stage of negotiations to
combine its operations with those of Asahi Bank and Tokai Bank, in
a deal expected to create Japan's second-largest bank, media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will set up a joint finance holding company in
April, 2001 and merge in the fiscal year that ends March 31, 2002,
the Nihon Keizai business daily reported Tuesday. The banks have
combined assets of $971.6 billion (103 trillion yen), the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The three banks were to hold a board meeting on the integration
Tuesday ahead of a formal announcement later in the afternoon,
national broadcaster NHK said.
</P>
<P>
   The trio currently has about 1,000 domestic branches with some
34,500 employees, the Nihon Keizai said. Over the next three years,
they plan to eliminate about 7,000 jobs, NHK said.
</P>
<P>
   The bank would be third in size worldwide, behind the Mizuho
Financial Group -- to be formed out of the merger of Dai-Ichi Kangyo
Bank, Fuji Bank, and the Industrial Bank of Japan -- and the planned
merger of Germany's Deutsche Bank AG and Dresdner Bank AG.
</P>
<P>
   Tokai and Asahi tentatively agreed last year to combine their
operations under a joint holding company. The deal expected Tuesday
would add Sanwa to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our bank and Asahi Bank are considering various possibilities
for other financial institutions joining (the proposed) financial
holding company,'' Tokai Bank said. ''But nothing has been decided
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanwa Bank spokesman Yoichi Fujita also said nothing has been
decided, declining further comment. Asahi Bank released a similar
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended Monday's trading in shares of
all three banks.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks are combining their operations to improve their
balance sheets, which are saddled with billions of dollars in
irrecoverable loans from a speculative lending boom in the late
1980s and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   By combining their operations, Sanwa, Tokai and Asahi would be
able to increase their sources of revenue and fight off increasing
competition as Japan deregulates its financial sector, said Koyo
Ozeki, a senior analyst at Merrill Lynch Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a plus for the financial system,'' Ozeki said.
''On an independent basis, even one of the best banks such as Sanwa
doesn't necessarily have the ability to survive or win against the
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sakura and Sumitomo banks have also said they would merge by
2002 in what would be the world's fourth-largest behind the
Sanwa-Asahi-Tokai combination.

Congress Urged on Utility Industry
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson today said rapid change
in the electricity industry is causing reliability problems that could increase
the likelihood of power outages this summer. Richardson said Congress must pass
legislation to restructure the electric utility industry as it becomes
competitive or risk ''more long, hot summers of outages in America's cities.''
An Energy Department report says the transition to competition has caused some
utilities to focus on competing for markets, cutting costs and maximizing
prices, instead of assuring that power is kept flowing.

<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The New Jersey Devils, in a scoring slump for more than a
month, twice opened two-goals leads before holding off Pittsburgh 3-2 tonight on
Bobby Holik's goal off a Penguins player's skate. The Devils, trying to hold off
Toronto and Philadelphia to keep their nearly season-long lead in the Eastern
Conference, had scored more than two goals only twice in 12 games before taking
a 3-1 lead in the second period. Holik scored what proved the game-winner at
17:36 of the second.

<HEADLINE> 6 Dogs Kill Brazilian Girl  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Six guard dogs killed a 4-year-old girl
and injured her sister and their mother as they returned home late
from church, police and news reports said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred Sunday night on a small farm in
Carapicuiba, a rural district on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, where
the mother and the children's father live and work as caretakers,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police inspector Fernando Cesar Costa de Oliveira said the dogs,
all Rottweillers, were apparently set loose earlier in the day by
the owner of the farm to guard the property.
</P>
<P>
   The victim suffered bite wounds to the face and died
immediately, Oliveira said. Her 3-year-old sister was rushed to a
hospital in serious condition. The mother was treated for less
serious bites she received trying to protect the girls.
</P>
<P>
   The three were attacked in the yard as they returned home from
church, local television reported.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if the owner would be charged in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really tragic what happened,'' said Oliveira. ''There
should have been some way of controlling the dogs when someone
arrived.''

<HEADLINE> Jazz 87, Bulls 79  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Karl Malone and John Stockton just keep on
playing and the Utah Jazz just keep on winning.
</P>
<P>
   Malone and Stockton, making their first appearances at the
United Center since the 1998 NBA Finals, led Utah's big
third-quarter run Monday night as the Jazz beat the punchless
Chicago Bulls 87-79 for their eighth straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored 31 points and had 13 rebounds, while his longtime
running mate Stockton added 19 points with six steals and nine
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Brand led the Bulls, who have lost 11 of 12, with 26
points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Utah coach Jerry Sloan, whose No. 4 hangs in the rafters at the
United Center as a tribute to his gritty career with the Bulls,
passed Larry Brown for 10th place in career coaching victories with
his 718th.
</P>
<P>
   Hersey Hawkins gave the Bulls a 10-point lead when he hit a
3-pointer to open the second half.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone and Stockton then went to work, scoring 10 points
each in a 23-6 run, the final point coming on a free throw after a
technical foul on Chicago coach Tim Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   With Brand on the bench after picking up his fourth foul, the
Bulls managed just one basket in the final five minutes of the
quarter and trailed 64-59 heading into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls pulled within 70-66 in the final quarter, but Utah
scored 13 of its last 17 points from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Brand had 16 points and seven rebounds in the first half as the
Bulls shot 45 percent and took a 48-41 lead despite 14 points from
Malone.
Notes: In their previous appearance at the United Center nearly
two years ago, the Jazz won Game 5 of the NBA Finals and forced a
return trip to Salt Lake City, where the Bulls captured Game 6 and
their sixth title. Much has changed since for the Bulls, not much
for the Jazz. ... Floyd said the team is expecting a ruling on the
status of guard John Starks some time Tuesday. Starks is home in
Tulsa, awaiting an arbitrator's ruling on whether he can forfeit
the rest of his salary (about $900,000), leave the Bulls and join a
playoff contender. Floyd said if Starks does have to stay with the
Bulls, his playing time in the final weeks would be limited as the
team looks at its younger players. Starks hasn't played the last
nine games.

<HEADLINE> Oilers 3, Thrashers 0  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ryan Smyth scored all three goals in the third
period and Tommy Salo got his second shutout of the season as the
Edmonton Oilers ended a four-game losing streak, 3-0 over the
reeling Atlanta Thrashers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers have lost nine in a row and 21 of their last 22
games. Their record since a Jan. 14 victory over Philadelphia is
1-23-2.
</P>
<P>
   The game was scoreless after two periods, quite an
accomplishment for Atlanta after losing its last two games by a
combined 14-1.
</P>
<P>
   But Smyth ended the scoreless duel between Salo and Atlanta
goaltender Norm Maracle at 8:22. The Edmonton winger worked out of
the corner and flipped the puck behind the net to Doug Weight.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers defense allowed Weight to set up, then lost track
of Smyth in front of the net. He took a pass from Weight and
flipped the puck in the upper left corner past a helpless Maracle.
</P>
<P>
   About 1{ minutes later, Denny Lambert took out his frustrations
by checking Todd Marchant from behind in the corner, leaving the
Edmonton player crumpled on the ice. Marchant struggled to his feet
and remained in the game, but Lambert was given a five-minute
penalty and game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth took advantage of the power play for his second goal,
slipping a rebound past Maracle. Smyth finished off the hat trick
with his 25th goal at 18:07, firing a slap shot from the top of the
left circle that beat the Atlanta goalie under the right skate.
</P>
<P>
   Weight had two assists and Salo made 24 saves in a critical
victory for the Oilers. Edmonton's season-longest losing streak
dropped it behind streaking Colorado in the Northwest Division and
threatened the Oilers' Western Conference playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   The game drew a crowd of just 14,311 to Philips Arena, smallest
of the season for the Thrashers. Their previous low was 15,208 vs.
Vancouver on Nov. 22.

<HEADLINE> Two Brothers Appear in Bombing Plot  </HEADLINE>
By C.G. WALLACE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Two brothers who admitted to participating
in the 1997 bombing of a fur farm went before a judge Monday, one
to have his sentence reduced and the other to be sentenced for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Joshua Ellerman, 21, had his seven-year sentence reduced
by 13 months. He already has served 20 months. He confessed to
breaking into The Fur Breeders Cooperative in Sandy, planting five
bombs and lighting two fires that caused $1 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Clinton Colby Ellerman, 23, was sentenced to five
years by U.S. District Judge Jay Thomas Greene for building the
bombs used in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers confessed, which led to indictments against
four others. One suspect committed suicide and the other three men
were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers' confessions were the only evidence linking the men
to the bombing and to an alleged prior bombing plot.
</P>
<P>
   The two men could have been sentenced to up to 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both men had been affiliated with Straight Edge, a
sometimes-violent group that opposes drugs, alcohol, tobacco and
casual sex and in some cases are pro-animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Fur Breeders Cooperative is one of the country's largest and
provides materials and mink to hundreds of farmers in the West.

<HEADLINE> Judge Joins San Diego Mayor's Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A Superior Court judge narrowly beat out a
wealthy banker to win the second spot in the November run-off for
the San Diego mayor's seat, a tally of late-arriving ballots showed
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The race between Judge Dick Murphy and Peter Q. Davis had been
too close to call following the March 7 election. Of the 12 mayoral
candidates, only County Supervisor Ron Roberts had won enough
support -- 26 percent -- to clearly advance to the run-off. All three
are Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The second round is needed because no one won at least 50
percent of the vote last week.
</P>
<P>
   Davis initially had appeared to lead the count, but voting
officials had to tabulate some 90,000 absentee ballots and
''provisional'' ballots that needed to be verified as eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego County voter registrar announced Monday that
Murphy beat Davis 41,874 votes to 41,705 votes -- a difference of
just 169 ballots. Each polled about 15.7 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said the race had been ''an emotional roller coaster, but
we ended up just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a political newcomer who spent $1.25 million of his own
money on the campaign, offered his congratulations to Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ''He ran a great race and he was a gentleman the whole way,''
Davis said. ''That's the way it goes in politics.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 36 points as
the Detroit Pistons beat the Celtics 124-115 Monday night to end
Boston's four-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey Hunter added 25 points for Detroit, which improved to
3-1 under interim coach George Irvine, and Grant Hill had 14.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pierce led Boston with a career-best 38, while Antoine
Walker added 30.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit started out strongly, hitting eight of its first nine
shots, including four 3-pointers. That gave the Pistons a 20-6 lead
after just four minutes, and they led 32-23 at the end of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was more of the same, as the Pistons hit their
first seven shots to take a 50-30 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The margin was 72-47 at intermission, the highest-scoring half
for Detroit since it poured in 73 against the Celtics on April 16,
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Stackhouse had 25 in the half on 7-of-12 shooting from the field
and a perfect 8-of-8 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   Boston rallied in the third, and Walker's 3-pointer pulled it
within 11 before a Stackhouse jumper made it 94-81 at the end of
the period. Walker finished with 12 points in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hill started the fourth with a three-point play, moving the
margin back to 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit shot 23 free throws in the fourth quarter, just two
short of the team record. Boston had 21 attempts in the period,
which took nearly 45 minutes to play.
NOTES: Boston played without Danny Fortson, who missed the game to
attend a funeral. ... The Celtics are now 1-17 in the second game
of back-to-backs. ... Detroit's 40 points was its best second
quarter of the season, and just three off their team record. ...
Detroit shot better from the field (68 percent) than Boston did
from the free-throw line (64 percent) in the first half. ... Boston
had held each of its last two opponents under 80 points. Detroit
reached 80 three minutes into the third quarter. ... Three players
-- Stackhouse, Hill and Williams -- took Detroit's first 31 free
throws.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Eric Lindros was scratched from the Philadelphia
Flyers lineup Monday night because of a headache.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, second on the Flyers with 27 goals and third with 59
points, was beginning to dress for Philadelphia's nationally
televised game against the Phoenix Coyotes, but stopped because of
the pain.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros was examined by Flyers trainer John Worley and scratched
from the lineup shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials said the headache does not appear to be related
to the concussion Lindros sustained Jan. 14 at Atlanta, the third
of the six-time All-Star's career. Lindros missed four games
following that concussion.
</P>
<P>
   The center, who has missed 14 games this season with a variety
of injuries, will return to Philadelphia with the team on Tuesday
and will be re-examined by team doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros most recently missed five games in February and early
March because of back spasms.

<HEADLINE> Group Reports Journalist Deaths  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Last year proved to be one of the
deadliest yet for reporters around the world, with 87 journalists
and media staff killed while working, a media group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report on global press freedom, the Vienna-based
International Press Institute deplored 1999 as one of the worst
years on record for violations of press freedom and urged
governments to respect international conventions on freedom of
expression.
</P>
<P>
   ''Developments in the conflicts in Serbia, Sierra Leone and East
Timor were particularly distressing ... journalists were considered
legitimate targets and killed ... because people did not like what
they were saying,'' Johann P. Fritz, director of IPI, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia topped the list for the deadliest place to work, with
25 journalists and media employees killed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia topped the year as the most violent assignment in Latin
America, claiming the lives of seven journalists, according to the
report. Reporters also were killed in Argentina, the Dominican
Republic, Guatemala and Peru. Governments in the region also used
legal and economic pressure on journalists, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to armed conflicts, many reporters and editors were
victims of unexplained slayings, as well as assaults, imprisonment,
harassment and censorship, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists reporting on the Chechen conflict in Russia also
faced censorship, harassment, kidnapping and assaults.

<HEADLINE> Finland Marks Post Winter War Peace  </HEADLINE>
By MATTI HUUHTANEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Finns on Monday marked the 60th
anniversary of a truce that followed 105 days of fierce fighting
against Stalin's Red Army in the Winter War, possibly one of the
coldest in history.
</P>
<P>
   Finland lost, but the small country's resistance against the
Soviets helped secure its independence in post-war Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Some 23,000 Finnish soldiers were killed, and 45,000 wounded, in
a population of 3.7 million. But Finland's white-clad troops on
skis, which became famous as the ''ghost army,'' proved a stronger
force than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union put its losses at 217,500 dead or wounded, but
Finland estimated enemy casualties at up to 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many Soviets died of cold, with temperatures dipping as low as
50 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   The question of who began the war had been contentious until the
breakup of the Soviet Union when Russian historians admitted Stalin
was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   In secret talks with the Finns, Stalin demanded Soviet
fortifications on Finnish islands in the Gulf of Finland to protect
Leningrad, now known as St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   Finland rejected this as a violation of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   When negotiations broke down, the Finns still did not believe
that Stalin would attack, though Marshal Carl Gustaf Mannerheim had
mobilized over 180,000 men near the border for ''refresher
training.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 26, 1939, Soviet Foreign Minister V.M. Molotov accused
Finnish troops of firing at the Russians across the joint border
near the village of Mainila, in south-eastern Finland. The Finns
have consistently denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The peace treaty forced Finland to cede 11 percent of its land,
mostly large areas of eastern Karelia, and more than 400,000
Karelians were resettled in Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months later, Finland was embroiled in another war with
the Soviet superpower which lasted over three years, this time with
the help of Germany.

<HEADLINE> Airline Meets Over Bomb Scare  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Alaska Airlines said Monday it has demanded that
a security firm provide written guidelines about how it will
prevent future incidents such as a weekend scare in which a jet
returned to the airport because of a phony bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The device -- a backpack containing a hair dryer rigged to look
like a bomb as a test of airport security -- was found about 30
minutes into Saturday's flight from Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport to Ontario, Calif. The MD-80 returned to Sea-Tac and
passengers slid to the ground on emergency chutes. Two people
suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The dummy device was discovered by a flight attendant when she
reached into what she thought was a child's backpack for crayons
and found the hair dryer.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, the boy was carrying a backpack identical to the one
used in the security company's test. Security videos showed his
grandmother accidentally picked up the wrong bag from the X-ray
conveyor belt after the boy passed through a security checkpoint,
airline spokesman Jack Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   An executive of the security company, Utah-based Huntleigh
Security, met with Alaska Airlines officials Monday, Evans said.
The airline wants assurances that the simulated devices be treated
with the same care as a real bomb might be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Flight 444 was carrying 83 passengers and five crew
members.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers have been given complimentary round-trip tickets
after suffering ''the scare of their lives,'' Evans said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers, coming off a narrow
victory 24 hours earlier, ran their winning streak to 19 games as
they held off the Denver Nuggets 118-108 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal had 40 points, nine rebounds and seven assists
for the Lakers, whose run is the third-best in NBA history and the
longest since the Chicago Bulls had an 18-game streak end against
Denver on Feb. 4, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago went on to win the NBA title that season.
</P>
<P>
   With a victory Thursday night in Washington, Los Angeles can tie
the 1971-72 Milwaukee Bucks for the second-longest streak. The
1971-72 Lakers hold the league record of 33 straight.
</P>
<P>
   The Nuggets, who have lost six in a row, made things interesting
as NBA commissioner David Stern looked on. Denver trailed by 11
with 4:05 remaining but scored the next six points to close to
107-102 with 2:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal responded with two free throws, and Denver's Antonio
McDyess was called for an offensive foul. O'Neal made two more free
throws, prompting a fan to say, ''Hack-a-Shaq don't work no more.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, shooting 50 percent from the line, hit his last seven
free throws and finished the night 12-for-16.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, coming off a career-high 40 points in Sunday's
three-point win over Sacramento, scored 22, and Glen Rice added 20
for Los Angeles, which last lost Feb. 1 at San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Chris Gatling had 25 points to lead six Denver players
in double figures. Former Los Angeles point guard Nick Van Exel
finished with 17 points and 15 assists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the game's highlights came early in the fourth quarter
when Nuggets guard Chris Herren lost his left shoe while running
back on defense. The Lakers committed a turnover, and Herren hit a
3-pointer to pull Denver to 88-87 with 10:50 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Denver trailed by 10 early in the second half but three times
cut the lead to a point. Bryant, O'Neal and Rice kept the Nuggets
at bay, combining for Los Angeles' last 26 points of the third
quarter as the Lakers took a six-point lead into the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, chasing Philadelphia's Allen Iverson for the NBA scoring
title, had 22 points in the first half, including a short jump hook
as time expired to give the Lakers a 59-50 lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Denver's George McCloud served a one-game suspension for a
post-game scuffle with former teammate and current Orlando swingman
Ron Mercer. ... The Nuggets have had three losing streaks of at
least five games this season. ... The Lakers allowed more than 100
points for only the third time during their winning streak. ... Ten
of the Lakers' 19 straight wins have come on the road. ... Los
Angeles started a five-game road trip. ... Lakers coach Phil
Jackson moved within two victories of 600 for his career.

<HEADLINE> Astros Minor Leaguers Tied, Robbed  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. (AP) -- Two men burst into an unlocked hotel room
where five Houston Astros minor leaguers were watching television,
tied up the players and a female guest and robbed them at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Police shot one of the gunmen minutes later as he struggled with
a sixth player in an adjacent room. The other assailant escaped.
</P>
<P>
   None of the players was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The players were identified as Morgan Ensberg, 24; Derek
Nicholson, 23; Keith Ginter, 23; Michael Rose, 23; Eric Cole, 24;
and Aaron Miles, 23. The woman was identified as Alicia Szczerba,
23.
</P>
<P>
   The armed robbery took place late Sunday night at a Holiday Inn
in Kissimmee, where the Astros' minor leaguers stay during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly they're shaken up right now, but overall they
handled themselves well,'' Astros assistant general manager Tim
Purpura said.
</P>
<P>
   The five players and Szczerba, a friend of one of the players,
were in a hotel room watching television when the gunmen burst
through the unlocked door around 11 p.m EST Sunday. They tied up
the players and Szczerba at gunpoint and took cash, said Cmdr. Fran
Iwanski, a spokeswoman for the Kissimmee Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their doors were unlocked, which may have started this,''
Iwanski said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen then moved to an adjacent room, where Miles was by
himself. Players in the first room, meanwhile, managed to untie
themselves, call 911 and lock the door to their room.
</P>
<P>
   When a police officer arrived, one of the gunmen ran out of the
second-floor room and jumped over a railing to the ground. Police
were searching for him late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The other gunman remained in the room pointing his gun at Miles
while backup officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ''They tried to call him to give up and come out,'' Iwanski
said.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman apparently let his guard down, Miles tried to
wrestle the weapon from him. Officers heard the struggle, broke the
hotel room window and ordered the gunman to surrender. They shot
him when he refused.
</P>
<P>
   ''He would not release the weapon,'' Iwanski said.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded gunman was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center,
and was listed Monday in stable but critical condition. Police were
unable to identify him because he had no identification and was
unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian woman staying with her husband and son in the room
underneath the ballplayers' room said she heard yelling and
screaming, the shattering of the hotel room's glass window and
three shots fired.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounded like it was raining when the glass shattered,''
said Gail Wolkowski, of Thunder Bay, Ontario. ''You saw police
running everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, maintenance workers washed away blood from
the walkway in front of the hotel room and covered the shattered
window with a wood plank.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have no intention of moving the minor leaguers out of
the hotel but were meeting with security officials from the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, following its
routine, was investigating the police shooting.

<HEADLINE> Swingley Closing In On Iditarod Win  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEMBERTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE MOUNTAIN, Alaska (AP) -- Defending champion Doug Swingley
was closing in on his third victory in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog
Race late Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's get this thing over with. I want a shower,'' Swingley
said as he led his team of 11 dogs at a fast clip across the sea
ice of Norton Sound.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the shower beckons, Swingley figures he might as well
try to beat the record he set in 1995, when he finished the race in
9 days, 2 hours, 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm giving it a little bit of a try,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley decided at the Koyuk checkpoint to make a push to beat
his record. If he can make it to Nome before 10 a.m. Tuesday, he'll
set an impressive mark by pushing the trip below in less than nine
days.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley reached the White Mountain checkpoint at 5:33 p.m.
Monday. His nearest competitor, Paul Gebhardt was about 4{ hours
behind. Gebhardt left the Elim checkpoint at 4:48 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Swingley had a mandatory eight-hour layover at White Mountain
before he could hit the trail again for the final 77-mile leg of
the race. He has been setting a record pace for much of the race
and could pass under the burled arch on Nome's Front Street
sometime Tuesday morning, which would top his 1995 record.
</P>
<P>
   Farther back down the trail, mushers were bunched in a pack,
jockeying for position. By Monday afternoon, eight mushers had
passed through the Koyuk checkpoint, 171 miles from Nome.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff King left Koyuk at 10:12 a.m. He was followed by Charlie
Boulding at 12:15 p.m., Ramy Brooks at 2:14, Rick Swenson at 2:37,
Martin Buser of at 2:38 and Rick Mackey at 2:49.
</P>
<P>
   As Buser, a three-time champion, and Swenson, the only five-time
champion, rested their teams in Koyuk, they talked about what might
have been.
</P>
<P>
   Buser said he was at a disadvantage this year because there
wasn't enough snow early in the season to do much long-distance
training. Swingley has said he trains his dogs by running them 150
miles at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Buser said conditions were such that he put in a lot of 25-mile
runs. Swingley's strong showing has proved the value of distance
training, Buser said.
</P>
<P>
   Swenson said an accident just outside the Rohn checkpoint that
injured one of his dogs set him back by a few hours. Swenson said
his team was spooked by two people walking along the trail and one
of the dogs ran into a tree.
</P>
<P>
   If not for that, said Swenson, ''I would have given Doug a run
for his money.''
