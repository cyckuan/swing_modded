<HEADLINE> South African Govt. Urged to Speed up Pace of Black Empowerment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has to give more attention to deracializing economy,
especially by accelerating the pace of black empowerment and
affirmative action, Education Minister Kader Asmal said here on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We need to deliberately and consciously work on genuine
programs of empowerment and the transference of resources and
skills to larger parts of the black community rather than to a few
hand-picked individuals," said Asmal, member of a panel addressing
delegates at the on-going national conference on racism held in
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
"We need programs that will make a visible and lasting impact
on the lives of black people," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Linda Human, another panel member who is a consultant
in workplace transformation, said any strategies to remove
discrimination from places of employment had to be driven by top
management, who had to ensure affirmative action targets were
reached.
</P>
<P>
Companies had to be held accountable to make sure their
organizational culture was free of racism, Human said, adding that
codes of conduct had to be established to regulate workplace
behavior.

<HEADLINE> Liberian President Urges Guinea to Expel Liberian Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has urged his Guinean counterpart Lansana Conte to expel
Liberian rebels allegedly based in his country, according to
reports reaching here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I do not have a problem with Lansana Conte personally. We can
engage Guinea in dialogue to put a halt to the bust-up. This
government does not have a problem with Guinea," Taylor was quoted
as saying on Thursday on the state radio.
</P>
<P>
Liberian government forces have been battling rebels in the
north of the country since the rebels who allegedly entered from
Guinea about two month ago. Most of the fighting has taken place
in the Voinjama area, provincial capital of Lofa County bordering
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need for the Guinean government to take the war in
Lofa seriously so that its territory should not be used," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor has accused Guinea of harboring the dissidents bent on
toppling his administration, a charge Guinea repeatedly rejects.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Hopes U.N. Deploy Troops in Rebel Controlled Area Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Tejan
Kabbah has expressed the hope that U.N. peacekeepers would soon be
deployed throughout the country including the rebel-controlled
area, the state radio reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The returning of UNAMSIL (the U.N. peacekeeping force)
equipment by the RUF (Revolutionary United Front) is most welcome.
The government hopes the remaining equipment will soon be handed
over and that UNAMSIL will restart its deployment throughout the
country," Kabbah was quoted as saying on Thursday in Bumbuna, a
town about 160 kilometers northeast of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebels handed some seized U.N. vehicles back to the
UNAMSIL on Wednesday in an area about 120 kilometers northeast of
the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
They had captured the vehicles in May when RUF fighters took
hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
Much of the northern part of the country is still controlled by
the rebels, but Bumbuna has remained in the government hands
because a strong army presence has been maintained there to
protect a hydro-electric dam nearby.
</P>
<P>
The RUF, under new leader Issa Sesay, is showing signs of
willingness to renegotiate for peace under the Lome accord which
was supposed to end the war in July 1999.

<HEADLINE> GCC Denounces Iraqi Threats Against Kuwait, Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministers of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Saturday strongly condemned the
Iraqi government's media campaign and threats against Kuwait and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
In a final communique of the 76th session of the ministerial
meeting held in Saudi coastal city of Jeddeh, the ministers said
the Iraqi government will not serve security and stability of the
Gulf region and nor did it want to learn from past lessons.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic group established in
1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates. 
</P>
<P>
It also demanded the Iraqi government demonstrate good response
and cooperation towards the Security Council's resolution 1284 and
the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
(UNMOVIC), which replaced the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) last
December to supervise the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under sweeping U.N. sanctions since 1990 imposed
shortly after it invaded its neighboring Kuwait and under relevant
U.N. resolutions, Iraq's eradication of weapons of mass destruction
is a prerequisite for lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The arms inspections have been suspended since last December as
the defunct UNSCOM withdrew all its members from Iraq to escape U.
S. and British airstrikes against the country.
</P>
<P>
UNMOVIC is training its staff for possible continuation of
weapons inspections in Iraq which has so far refused the return of
the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
But the council underscored its well-known and firm position
towards the preservation of the independence of Iraq, its
territorial integrity and integration into the region.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly launched verbal attacks on Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, saying the two states are "partners in the crimes" against
Iraq because they provide bases for U.S. and British planes that
patrol a no-fly zone in southern Iraq and frequently attack targets
in the area. 
</P>
<P>
It also says Saudi Arabia and Kuwait are responsible for
prolonging the U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian-Sudanese Committee Convenes First Session in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of Egypt and
Sudan met here on Saturday for the first session in 10 years of the
Joint Egyptian-Sudanese Committee, signing eight cooperation
agreements.
</P>
<P>
In their inaugural speeches, Egypt's Amr Moussa and Sudan's
Mustafa Othman Ismail expressed confidence that the committee
meeting will open new ways for closer cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two officials voiced hope that the two Arab neighbors will
join efforts to intensify their relations, Egypt's Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set to discuss rescheduling around 70 million
U.S. dollars of Sudanese debt to Egypt as well as measures to make
travel between the two countries easier. The two sides agreed to
pass on the matters to technical committees which were expected to
discuss them in detail in the coming week.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the session, Moussa and Ismail and other
officials of both sides signed eight agreements on cooperation in
agriculture, industry, wildlife, culture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Ismail told reporters after the meeting that the committee
session crowned the process of normalization between the two Nile
Valley countries, saying that he hoped it would boost economic
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Egypt recalled its ambassador to Sudan after a June 1995
assassination attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis
Ababa by Egyptian Islamists, in which Sudan was accused of
involvement.
</P>
<P>
But relations picked up in December 1999 after Sudanese Islamist
leader and former parliament speaker Hassan al-Turabi was sidelined
by President Omar al-Beshir.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has since appointed an ambassador to Sudan, Mohamed Assem,
who took office in Khartoum in May.

<HEADLINE> GCC Concerned Over U.S. Plan to Move Embassy to Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) on Saturday voiced deep concern over the U.S.
determination to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
considering such move as a violation of international laws and
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
This was part of a unified GCC stance toward the issue
pertaining to the Middle East peace process, said a communique
issued at the end of the two-day GCC foreign ministers meeting in
the western Saudi city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has said that he would transfer the
U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem to reward Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak for what the U.S. called his flexibility in the
peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The most recent Palestinian-Israeli peace talks at the Camp
David last month brokered by the Clinton failed over the future
status of Jerusalem, which both Israel and the Palestinians claim
as their capital.
</P>
<P>
And the hope for a permanent peace deal by the September 13
deadline is diminishing in view of the difficulties for the two
sides to come to agreement over key final-status issues.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the GCC ministers strongly criticized Israel
and held it "responsible for the suspension of the peace process
and negotiations between concerned parties due to Tel Aviv's
defiance to peace requirements."
</P>
<P>
The council, on the other hand, reasserted its firm stance that
just and lasting peace will not be realized except with the returns
of full rights to the Palestinians and the establishment of their
independent state with Jerusalem as its capital, the communique
said.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf alliance also expressed regret over the failure of last
month's Camp David summit between Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance established
in 1981, groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Defends Privatization Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Saturday strongly defended the privatization policy
that his government is carrying out, saying it has greatly eased
the tax payers' burden.
</P>
<P>
Addressing hundreds of ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) members
and supporters at a presidential campaign rally in Tanzania's
eastern Morogoro Region, the CCM National Chairman said
privatization has managed to turn around in terms of profitability
several big state-owned companies on the verge of bankruptcy,
which are now contributing billions of shillings to government
coffers.
</P>
<P>
"Our intentions of establishing public-owned institutions were
aimed at generating revenue for the government, but experience
during the last three decades showed us that most of the public
firms were inefficient.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue going like this. Having people with little
knowledge and poor business acumen is dangerous for the economy.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue and trust people who have no financial
discipline to run the parastatals on our behalf," said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as claims by opposition leaders that he is selling
off the country, saying Tanzania could not continue gambling in
its economic policies.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the economic successes achieved during his five-
year presidential term, Mkapa said Tanzania's economy is growing
at an average of 4 percent despite a series of odds such as floods
and droughts.
</P>
<P>
The shilling is stable as compared to major hard currencies,
and the government revenue collection has jumped from 29 billion
shillings (about 36.3 million U.S. dollars) monthly to an average
of 60 billion shillings (about 75 million U.S. dollars), he added.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who is seeking reelection for a second term during the

<HEADLINE> Palestinians, Israel Unlikely to Reach Final Accord by Year End: Egyptian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Saturday that it is unlikely that the Palestinians
and Israel will be able to reach a final peace agreement by the end
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told the Egyptian television that the Palestinians and
Israel will need as long as one year to negotiate the details of
the final peace accord after a framework agreement on the main
issues of the conflict is reached.
</P>
<P>
If the two sides are able to reach an agreement in the next
three months, before United States President Bill Clinton leaves
office, it will not be a "detailed, full and comprehensive
agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rather, it would only cover the main and fundamental lines of
the thorny issues, including Israeli withdrawal, the exchange of
lands, the return of Palestinian refugees and the status of
Jerusalem, Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
"The time is not long enough" in the coming few weeks to reach a
detailed accord on all the subjects, so if the two sides could
agree on the main lines of the accord, that would also be "a good
thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
That framework accord, which will cover all the main issues such
as Jerusalem, Israeli troop withdrawals, refugees, security and
water issues, would be filled in with the details of a final peace
agreement, a process that "could take a year," the Egyptian
minister told the Egyptian television channel one.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Egypt is hoping for such an agreement, but
admitted that there was still a possibility of failure.
</P>
<P>
He insisted the framework agreement must be balanced with
Palestinian sovereignty over East Jerusalem, warning that an
imbalanced accord would not last and would not lead to stability.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Govt Rejects Negotiations With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government
has ruled out the possibility of negotiations with the rebel group
known as the West Side Boys who are currently still holding seven
hostages, said a source reaching here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leonean Finance Minister James Jonah was quoted as
saying in Freetown, capital of the war-torn west African country,
that the government would not negotiate with the rebels for the
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Jonah said the West Side Boys did not pose a military threat to
the government, they wanted to make political nuisance by taking
hostages. The government would, therefore, not give in to the
demands of the rebels they set for the release of their captives.
</P>
<P>
The abducted soldiers, 11 Britons and one Sierra Leonean, were
captured by the West Side Boys last Friday when they were
patrolling along the Freetown-Masiaka highway, and five British
soldiers were released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The West Side Boys earlier set conditions for the release of
the remaining soldiers, demanding for a review of the Lome Peace
Accord, release of their supporters from prisons and reintegration
into the government army.

<HEADLINE> Gene Linked to BBS Disorder in Newfoundland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists link a
disorder gene to an unusually high number of Newfoundlanders to be
born with extra fingers and toes, according to Saturday's National
Post newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The gene, which causes a complex disease called Bardet-Biedl
Syndrome (BBS), is held responsible for 30 to 35 people suffering
from the syndrome, which also includes obesity, blindness and
kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
The incidence is about 10 times higher than an average
worldwide, with a proportion of one in every 15,000 people in
Newfoundland against one in 160,000 elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Most of the half a million Newfoundlanders can trace their
family tree back to the first 20,000 settlers, Canadian scientists
say, with the conclusion that both parents must have one of the
genetic mistakes that cause BBS.
</P>
<P>
The new discovery is to be published in this month's issue of
Nature Genetics.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Puts Forward Proposal to End Sufferings of Iraqi People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has offered written
proposals aimed at ending the sufferings of the Iraqi people who
have reeled under the 10-year-long U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The proposals were put forward during a meeting of the Gulf
foreign ministers, reports reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states decided to study the ideals, said a final communique issued
at the end of the two-day meeting held in the western Saudi city of
Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
The communique of the GCC that groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) said the GCC
top diplomats hoped the Iraqi government would adopt serious
measures to abide by United Nations' resolutions to end the
sufferings of its people. But communique did revealed the contents
of the proposals.
</P>
<P>
U.N. imposed sweeping sanctions on Iraq shortly after it invaded
Kuwait in 1990 and put the elimination of its weapons of mass
destruction as a pre-requisite for lifting the embargo.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal, who chaired the
meeting, also declined to disclose the details of the Qatari
ideals.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal said the Gulf governments would study these ideals
before presenting their notes on them. "I have nothing more to
add," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar made verbal proposals at the last GCC ministerial meeting,
but the foreign ministers demanded the ideals to be written.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the GCC foreign ministers urged Iraq to end
provocative media campaign against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for
hosting the U.S. military bases.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also repeated regrets over Baghdad's refusal to
Arab and international initiatives for realizing an acceptable and
active mechanism, as part of cooperation with the United Nations to
lift the 10-year economic sanctions and end the sufferings of its
people.

Shunsuke Nakamura broke the ice after slotting home a pass from

minute before leaving the pitch.

<HEADLINE> Sulu Vice Gov. Appointed to Negotiate for American Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
appointed Sulu Vice Governor Munib Estino Saturday to negotiate
for the release of an American hostage kidnapped by the Abu Sayyaf
in the south early this week.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said Estino's appointment would
mean that the certain Roland Sarmiento, supposedly tasked by the
government to negotiate for the release of Jeffrey Schilling, was
not duly authorized to do the job.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Abu Sayyaf had demanded Sarmiento
negotiate with them on the release of Schilling, who was abducted
in the southern city of Zamboanga last Monday and later
transferred to the rebels' camp in Jolo island, Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Schilling, who the rebels said is a spy of the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, was reportedly on a hunger
strike.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who had earlier threatened to behead the American,
promised not to harm him while negotiations continue.
</P>
<P>
They also denied issuing demands for a ransom of 10 million U.S.
dollars for his release, saying they only asked that American food
and medicine be sent for Schilling who is said to have health
problems.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf rebels have released 17 hostages, but are still
holding two Finns, one French, one German and one Filipino of the
original group of 21 hostages kidnapped from Malaysia's resort
island of Sipadan on April 23, and two French journalists seized
in Jolo in July while covering the hostage crisis.

"The conclusion of START III is possible only provided that the
ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) Treaty of 1972 remains inviolable,"
Ivanov stressed.
</P>
<P>
The issue of strategic stability "will be the focus of Russian
president's and foreign minister's meetings (with their partners)
at the upcoming Millennium Summit in New York and during Putin's
visit to Japan," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian-U.S. Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty III (START III)
, which was agreed in outline three years ago, is aimed at further
cuts in the number of both countries' nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday delayed a decision on the
deployment of a controversial national missile defense system,
which would violate the ABM Treaty signed by the U.S. and the
former Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Americans in Seoul Warned Against Possible Terrorist Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Seoul on
Saturday asked U.S. citizens to exercise much greater caution for
their safety due to information on possible terrorist actions
against Americans in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Embassy has received unconfirmed information that
terrorist actions by a non-Korean group may possibly be taken
against Americans, as well as U.S. government installations and/or
personnel in the Republic of Korea," the embassy said in a notice.
</P>
<P>
U.S. citizens in South Korea should review their own personal
security practices, be alert to any unusual activities around
their homes or businesses and report any significant incidents to
local police authorities, said the notice.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy and U.S. military installations throughout
South Korea are taking steps to increase security at all
facilities.
</P>
<P>
In July, when strong anti-U.S. sentiments appeared in South
Korea after the United States Forces Korea acknowledged discharge
of poisonous chemicals into the Han River, the U.S. embassy issued
a travel warning for American citizens in the country, advising
them to stay alert and keep a low profile and avoid large crowds
when visiting commercial districts.
</P>
<P>
In August, the U.S. embassy has reportedly installed 10 super-
modern security cameras in the trees just outside its compound in
downtown Seoul.

HANGZHOU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The 30 tide watchers swept
away Friday by tide were all rescued from the Qiantang River today,
and six seriously injured were sent to hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Friday afternoon, hundreds of tourists gathered off the
Qiantang River in Xiaoshan City to view its magical waves. All of
a sudden, the tide, three to four meters high, swept 30 of them
into the water.
</P>
<P>
Rescue staff and local residents tried to save them as soon as
the tide ebbed.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of tourists have come to the city to watch
the tide since September 15, when the Qiantang River Wave Watching
Festival started.
</P>
<P>
The festival has been held annually since 1994 and has
attracted some 3 million tourists.
</P>
<P>
The tides on the Qiantang are a strange phenomenon. Scientists
say that the bell-shaped mouth of the Qiantang River helps form
the tidal change, which can be as high as 3.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only the Moon Festival on the traditional Chinese
calendar, which falls on September 12 this year, was considered
the good time for tide watching. However, scientists say the
spring tide there is also interesting.

PHNOM PENH, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 20 Cambodian
journalists ended their three-day training Saturday on business
and economic reporting in Phnom Penh, which was co-sponsored by
the Club of Cambodian Journalists (CCJ) and the German Foundation
Konrad-Adenauer.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time for Cambodian journalists to get lectures
on business and economic reporting to improve their skills of
reporting on related issues although the economic and business
reporting is not so attractive to the readers in this war-torn
country.
</P>
<P>
The lectures were presented by two experienced journalists from
the Philippines who have covered economic and business reporting
for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The participants at the three-day lectures were publishers,
editors and senior reporters in the country.
</P>
<P>
"I found the course was very significant and useful for
Cambodian journalists to be clear on how to have proper, accurate
and credible reporting on economic and business,'' said Puy Kea, a
reporter from Kyodo News who attended the course.

<HEADLINE> American Hostage in Philippines Said on Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- An American abducted by the Abu
Sayyaf in the southern Philippines reportedly went on a hunger
strike, a local TV station reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ABS-CBN news channel said Jeffrey Schilling, who was
kidnapped by Abu Sayyaf rebels in Zamboanga city last Monday and
later transferred to their jungle lair in Jolo island, was on a
hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
The report can not be confirmed yet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abu Sayyaf spokesman Abu Sabaya Saturday denied
reports that they had demanded 10 million U.S. dollars in ransom
for the release of Schilling, whom they claim is an agent of the U.
S. Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
He reportedly said they had only asked that American food and
medicine be sent for Schilling, who is said to have health
problems.
</P>
<P>
The rebels have agreed to start talks for the release of the 24-
year-old American and promised not to harm him while negotiations
continue.
</P>
<P>
In another development, another group of the Abu Sayyaf led by
Ghlib Andang, alias Commander Robot, has reportedly asked the
government to send a medical team to look after ailing Wilde
Almeda, who led a group of 12 Filipino Christian evangelists to
the rebels camp in Jolo in early July to pray for the hostages
seized from Malaysia's resort island of Sipadan in April.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the group of evangelists were also taken
hostage by the Abu Sayyaf, but the rebels said they could leave
anytime if they wish.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has released 17 hostages but is still holding
one Filipino and six Europeans, including two French journalists
seized in Jolo in July.
</P>
<P>
Philippine government chief negotiator Robert Aventajado
expressed optimism Saturday that they would be freed in a few days.

WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton announced that he will not
authorize deployment of a national missile defense system but will
leave the final decision to his successor because the technical
uncertainties and diplomatic costs are too great at this time.
</P>
<P>
-- An appeal court in Denver acted on its own accord and
temporarily blocked Wen Ho Lee's release on one-million-dollar
bail, just minutes before the former Los Alamos physicist was
scheduled to return home after eight months in jail.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton's decision to put off work on a missile
shield comes just days before he is to meet world leaders in New
York. He has taken off the table an issue that might have soured
his scheduled meeting with other leaders of Russia, China and U.S.
closest allies in Europe, who voiced fears that the constructions
of the system could violate the ABM Treaty and trigger a new arms
race.
</P>
<P>
-- The presidents of South America's 12 nations, in a statement
issued at the summit meeting in Brasilia, rebuffed President
Clinton's recent appeal that they endorse an American-backed
military and police offensive against drug trafficking and
guerrilla groups in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> China Starts Surveys on Hangzhou Bay in Preparation for Sea Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A group of 80 Chinese
scientists today left Hangzhou, capital of east China's Zhejiang
Province, to start a series of surveys involving hydrology and
marine environment in Hangzhou Bay and the bay's ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
"The survey directly affects the design of the foundation for
the construction of a new bridge on Hangzhou Bay," Zheng Lianfu, a
research fellow who is heading the survey team, said, adding that
the task is arduous as Hangzhou Bay is well-known for its rough
tide surges.
</P>
<P>
According to Zheng, they will use 17 ships to carry out synchro
surveys into the hydrology and silting in navigational sea areas
in Hangzhou Bay. They will also spend one year monitoring waves to
provide detailed reports on wave movements.
</P>
<P>
The projected bridge will span across Hangzhou Bay from Cixi,
on the southern bank of the bay, and end at Haiyan County of
Jiaxing.
</P>
<P>
The thoroughfare, which will be a six-lane expressway super
bridge, will 40 kilometers long and will cost 6.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The main bridge will be 27.78 kilometers long. Construction on
the project will start in 2002 and is scheduled to be completed in
2006.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the bridge will link up with Shanghai,
Hangzhou and another coastal city of Ningbo and help cut the land
distance between Shanghai and Ningbo by 130 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe the new bridge will help promote the
development of an economic zone on Hangzhou Bay and the beach area.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to be Air Transport Carriers' Distribution Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Three key air transport
carriers in the world have eyed Thailand to be their center for
distribution of air mails and parcels to the region, according to
the Thai News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director-General of the Customs Department Rapee
Asumpinpong was quoted as saying that Thailand has comparative
advantage of geographical location, so three major air transport
carriers -- Fed-Ex, DHL and UPS are planning to use it as their
hub for distribution in the Indo-Chinese region countries,
including Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam as well as Malaysia,
Singapore, and Southern part of China.
</P>
<P>
The major carriers have begun to use their own air freighters
to deliver, rather than using the service provided by air liners.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Second Bangkok International Airport, known as Nong
Ngoo Hao Airport, which is scheduled to be officially open in
years, can well facilitate the plan, Rapee said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Russia Agree to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Russia have
agreed to cooperate in promoting tourism between the two countries,
the Thai News Agency (TNA) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wanwilai Promlakhano, deputy director of the Department of
Policy and Planning of the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (
BMA) said that she and representatives of the Tourism Authority of
Thailand (TAT) met the Russian tourism authorities and
representatives of 50 travelling firms in Moscow to exchange
information and opinions on tourism promotion between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed problems of tourism faced by the countries
and ways to address the problems, which will lead to increase in
tourist arrivals in Bangkok and Moscow, she said.
</P>
<P>
Wanwilai led a Thai delegation to visit Moscow in late August
to organize a tourism project, dubbed "the Bangkok Days in Moscow"
at a cultural center, aimed to open a new market and promote Thai
tourism in the country.
</P>
<P>
A main problem of attracting more Russian arrivals in Bangkok
was the language barrier and shortages of experienced guides who
can speak Russian fluently, she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The BMA was considering to employ some Russian people who stay
in Thailand on a temporary basis, and train them to be part-time
guides for Russian tourists, as the number of Russian arrivals in
Thailand normally increases in the last four months of every year,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the TAT forecast that the number of Russian arrivals
in Thailand would increase to 70,000 this year from 50,000 in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Opposition Leader Brought Back Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar opposition party leader
Aung San Suu Kyi was brought back home by the authorities Saturday
morning from Dala, the area where she had been barred from
travelling further after she stayed there for eight days, a
government statement said here Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The official Information sheet said all others who accompanied
Aung San Suu Kyi, general secretary of the National League for
Democracy (NLD), were also sent back respectively.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for the Myanmar authorities to manage
to end the incident in a way similar to that taken in the last
incident which took place in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
The statement described the NLD leader's return as being "
escorted back" in a motorcade facilitated by the government.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken when the NLD was urging the government to
lift travel ban on their leaders to continue their journey and
complaining about the poor living conditions by staying on the
roadside.
</P>
<P>
So far, the NLD has not yet officially commented on the latest
incident.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi, along with three other NLD leaders totaling
more than a dozen, was barred for security reason from travelling
further after she arrived at Dala in Yangon division last Thursday
en-route to Gungyangon and Kawmu areas in the same division to
meet her party members.

<HEADLINE> S. African Olympic Tennis Team Wants Former Coach Re-appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The South African Olympic
tennis team has recently en masse signed a document requesting the
National Olympic Committee of South Africa (NOCSA) to re-appoint
Charlton Eagle as their coach for the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
Eagle was replaced by acting chief executive of the South
African Tennis Association (SATA) Mohammed Sheik, but only in a
managerial capacity as Sheik has no coaching experience.
</P>
<P>
NOCSA wrote to SATA in August, stating that Eagle "had failed
thus far to attend to critical matters" and recommended that Sheik
take over the duties.
</P>
<P>
The letter also made it clear that the final choice on who will
manage or coach the South African Olympic tennis team rests with
NOCSA.
</P>
<P>
However, the South African tennis players are now requesting
NOCSA to "re-examine the current circumstances pertaining to the
role of Charlton Eagle with our Olympic tennis team".
</P>
<P>
The document, signed by South Africa's Fed Cup captain Eagle,
Davis Cup captain Craig Tiley, Wayne Ferreira, Amanda Coetzer,
Liezel Horn,David Adams, John-Laffnie de Jager and SATA player
representative Michael de Jongh, said that while they all have no
problem with Sheik as manager of the team, they did feel they
needed a coach.
</P>
<P>
"The coaching involves scouting, practice plans, emotional
support,on-court advice and strategy advice. Mr Eagle will make a
difference in all of these areas," the document stressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking from New York, Eagle said he had been aware that there
were certain requirements a manager had to meet as far as
attending meetings and camps are concerned, but that as he was
appointed as coach of the team, he did not have the same
responsibilities.

<HEADLINE> Heyns Possible to Repeat Historic Exploits at Sydney Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 2 (Xinhuaz) -- South African double
Olympic champion Penny Heyns will return to Sydney carrying the
hopes of the continent for a repeat of her historic exploits there
last year.
</P>
<P>
Following her stunning form at 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, in
which she broke two world records, an Olympic record and won two
Olympic gold medals in the 100m and 200m breaststroke, Heyns
struggled in 1997 and 1998 and began to despair that she would
never again be a major force in world swimming.
</P>
<P>
She began to slide down the world rankings after parting from
long-time coach Jan Bidrman, who moved to Calgary at the beginning
of 1997 to coach the Canadian national squad, while Heyns remained
behind in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
But after failing to win any medals at the 1998 world
championships in Perth, Australia and withdrawing from the
Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, Heyns decided to rejoin
Bidrman.
</P>
<P>
"I packed my bags and went to Calgary to join up with Jan and
just got back into it. I now believe the disappointments of 1998
are starting to work for me," said Heyns.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Pan Pacific Championships were a turning point for the
Durban-born swimmer, who didn't come home empty-handed with
clocking world records in the 50m, 100m and 200m (twice).
</P>
<P>
However the comeback was not without some controversy after
Heyns admitted using the controversial food supplement creatine.
</P>
<P>
"Creatine is not a stimulant. I am simply using it to improve
my diet," said Heyns, adding that she was only using the protein
supplement in small doses because she was scared that it could be
habit-forming or that she may become psychologically dependent on
it.
</P>
<P>
Although she has recently failed to deliver anything close to
her incredible form of last year Heyns remains strong favourite
for another double in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's head swimming coach Wayne Riddin is also
expecting medals from the breaststroke star.
</P>
<P>
"Penny swam a 1:08 (100m breaststroke) at the Canadian
championships, so her form's coming back. Her 50m and 100m swims
are what's important. She hasn't eased up yet," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
However, Riddin remained cautious, saying: "Olympic year is a
funny year. To predict anything at Olympics is foolish."

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Agrees to Extend Aceh Cease-Fire Accord Temporarily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
agreed in principle to extend a three-month cease-fire accord with
the rebel Free Aceh Movement (GAM) which expires Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and Security
Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told reporters here Saturday that
President Abdurrahman Wahid has approved the temporary extension
of the cease-fire -- the Joint Understanding on Humanitarian Pause.
</P>
<P>
But the minister gave no time frame for the extension.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia has agreed to extend the humanitarian pause in
principle. The president has agreed for the temporary extension
while we are waiting for a definitive consensus with GAM," Susilo
said after meeting with the president.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Geneva on May 12 for a three-month
cease-fire aimed at ending over two decades of violence in the
resource-rich northwestern province and alleviating the
humanitarian situation there.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Indonesian government and the GAM
agreed to reduce tension and stop violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
Rebels in Aceh have been fighting for 25 years for independence,
a greater share of oil profits, and the right to imposing Islamic
religious laws. Thousands have been killed in decades of fighting
between Indonesian security forces and Aceh rebels.

<HEADLINE> Manila Extends Legal Aid to Overseas Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and a
private lawyers' group have dispatched a joint team abroad to
determine legal aid requirements of overseas Filipino workers (
OFWs) and firm up a joint assistance program for them.
</P>
<P>
The joint team will go to OFW destinations such as Rome, Jeddah,
Athens and Riyadh to conduct a first-hand survey of the conditions
of OFWs in these cities, Undersecretary Benjamin Domingo of the
Department of Foreign Affairs said on a radio program over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
"We will make a complete survey," Domingo said.
</P>
<P>
Promoting the welfare of OFWs is one of the pillars of the
government's foreign policy, alongside economic diplomacy and
national security.
</P>
<P>
Some 800,000 Filipinos leave their country every year to seek
jobs abroad and there are now about 5.5 million OFWs, government
officials said. But the figures don't include undocumented
Filipino workers.
</P>
<P>
It is estimate that the number of OFWs exceeds seven who remit
home around seven billion U.S. dollars every year, a major source
of the country's foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Domingo said that since the Philippines has one of the highest
number of overseas workers, it must have the corresponding
mechanisms to help them.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the government, the Integrated Bar of
the Philippines, which boasts of 40,000 private lawyers, agreed to
help handle OFWs' cases abroad and also link up with lawyers'
associations in host countries concerned.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Greets 63 Prisoners at Panmunjom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) held a grand ceremony Saturday at the
truce village of Panmunjom to welcome 63 "unconverted long-term
prisoners" repatriated by South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The repatriates were greeted by the DPRK's senior government
officials and their relatives.
</P>
<P>
"Unconverted long-term prisoners" refer to the prisoners
detained and held by South Korea since the Korean War in the 1950s
and who would not change their political conviction.
</P>
<P>
The repatriates left the Pukak Park Hotel in northern Seoul at
8:00 a.m. Saturday (2300 GMT Friday) and crossed to the northern
side of the military demarcation line at 10 a.m. after DPRK
officials received their medical checklists from South Korean
officials.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the prisoners was included in the June 15
North-South joint declaration signed by DPRK leader Kim Jong Il
and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung at the end of the inter-
Korean summit in Pyongyang. The Red Cross delegations from
Pyongyang and Seoul signed an agreement on this issue on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK government earlier released the list of all 63
repatriates. Among them, the oldest is 89 years and the youngest
55.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Civilians Beaten by Israeli Soldiers along Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilian was beaten
by Israeli soldiers at the border on Sheikh Abbad hill after he
attempted to remove a plaque inscribed in Hebrew, the Daily Star
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted sources, a squad of Hezbollah observers on Abbad, as
claiming that Ghanaian U.N. peacekeeper soldiers positioned at the
summit of the hill failed to intervene.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said it had in on
knowledge of such an incident.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said the assault occurred on Thursday evening when
Mahmoud Abdel-Rhaman Sabbagh, 26, was hit several times with a
rifle butt when he and other civilians tried to remove two stone
plaques fastened to a wall on the Lebanese side of the border.
</P>
<P>
The border runs along the summit of the hill and bisects an
ancient tomb revered by Muslims and Jews. Israeli soldiers are
stationed to the east of the tomb in front of a new outpost.
</P>
<P>
Sabbagh reportedly received bruises to his back and shoulder.
</P>
<P>
The witnesses said that the Ghanaians had attempted to stop the
Lebanese from removing the plaques but gave up when Sabbagh and his
comrades refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
The peacekeepers moved away from the hilltop shrine to their
post 50 meters away, allowing the Israeli soldiers to step across
the unfenced border and beat Sabbagh, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, civilians were allowed to roam the hilltop and were
not prevented from approaching the border by Ghanaian UNIFIL
troops.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel said he had received "no reports
of any such activity occurring at Abbad."

<HEADLINE> Top Hamas Militant Sentenced to 12 Years in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- A leading Hamas militant was
sentenced to 12 years in prison by a Palestinian security court
Friday, local media Saturday quoted Khaled Al Kidra, general
prosecutor of the Palestinian state security courts, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, who topped Israel's most-wanted list for
masterminding a string of terror attacks in Israel, was convicted
of forming military groups, weapons possession and harming public
order.
</P>
<P>
Abu Hanoud, 35, is considered as a leader of the Palestinian
Islamic Resistance Movement's (Hamas) military wing, Izzedine al
Qassam, which has carried out a series of suicide bombings and
killed dozens of Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian militant group opposes making peace with Israel
and favors armed struggle to liberate lands occupied by Israel.
Abu Hanoud surrendered to the Palestinian police after he escaped
with wounds in a botched Israeli army raid that left three Israeli
soldiers dead in the West Bank village of Assira Al-Shamaliyah near
the West Bank town of Nablus late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army confirmed Thursday that the three soldiers of
the elite Duvdevan unit, or special troops in the West Bank, were
gunned down by "friendly fire" during the raid.

Istanbul Provincial Environment Director Yavuz Cengel said that
some 12 percent of the pollution in the Marmara Sea comes from
freely-emptied bilge waters from ships passing the straits.
</P>
<P>
The authorities will use both helicopters and satellite to
monitor ships to empty their bilge systems safely in specifically-
designed facilities.
</P>
<P>
Cengel said that "ships will be able to off-load their bilge
systems and solid waste in Istanbul in specific locations at the
entrance points to the straits. Any ship refuses to do so will be
fined." However, he did not mention the amount of fines to be
imposed on violators.
</P>
<P>
The bilge water and waste will be recycled, he added.
</P>
<P>
The project, still being drawn up, will be submitted to the
ministries of Health and Environment. In stage two of the project,
the levels of pollution in the Black Sea will also be tested.
</P>
<P>
Cengel said that "the only way to enter the Black Sea is via the
Bosporus. Any vessel that enters the Black Sea must be inspected on
its return journey with the cooperation of all Black Sea
countries."
</P>
<P>
Cengel also blamed waste water discharged from factories for the
pollution of the Marmara Sea. Once the level of hazardous chemicals
in industrial discharge is reduced and the bilge inspection project
enforced, the sea will see lower levels of pollution within five to
10 years.
</P>
<P>
"The Marmara Sea is not beyond saving. This is why such a system
is imperative," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Move Naval Headquarters Away from Earthquake Belt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish military will move
its naval headquarters from Golcuk in the Marmara region to Izmir
on the Aegean Sea, reported Turkish Daily News on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made in view of the devastating earthquake,
which hit the Marmara region on August 17, 1999. Golcuk was among
the cities suffering the heaviest damages in the quake that killed
17,000 people.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, the Navy's main base will also be
moved from Golcuk to Aksaz of Marmaris, Mugla province, on the
Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
After a year of search for an ideal location, Chief of the
General Staff Huseyin Kivrikoglu and Vice Admiral Lihami Erdil
announced recently that the Navy will be relocated in the Aegean
region.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Turkish naval submarines and ships have been billeted
at Eregli on the Black Sea and at Aksaz in Marmaris.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some naval institutions such as its
hospitals, logistical support units and shipyards will remain in
Golcuk.
</P>
<P>
The new naval headquarters building will be constructed in
Yenikale in the Inciralti district of Izmir, southwest of Turkey,
and the Navy plans to complete the move into it within the next
year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is a known earthquake-prone country, which stretches
along three established major fault lines.
</P>
<P>
Turkish and international experts have predicted that another
strong earthquake measuring above seven degrees on the Richter
scale will be most likely to happen in the Marmara region.
</P>
<P>
Golcuk is believed to lie on the top of a very active seismic
zone.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar's Value Linked with Knowledge Economy: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government's
chief scientific adviser Robin Batterham said Saturday Australia's
economic performance was closely linked to how well it performed
as a knowledge economy.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press, Batterham said
the decline of the value of the Australian dollar was inevitable
unless Australia dramatically lifted support for science and
research and development.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of knowledge increase will actually increase the rate
of fall of commodity prices and hence the Australian dollar. We
won't have to wait 30 years. We'll see it a lot sooner than that,"
he warned.
</P>
<P>
Figures released this week showed that the growth of gross
expenditure on research and development in the country had fallen
behind the rate of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He criticized that the thesis that science, engineering and
technology were essential foundations of innovation and the
knowledge economy was not widely accepted in the community.
</P>
<P>
"When I look at our present path, I look at the halving of the
Australian dollar over the last 30 years," the economist said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Courts in Dilemma over AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS scourge has started
affecting the administration of justice as more convicts state in
their mitigation pleas that they are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
This has put the judiciary in a dilemma since the law does not
say how courts should handle AIDS patients, High Court Judge Joyce
Aluoch was quoted by Kenya's major newspaper Daily Nation as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Judge Aluoch advised the magistrates on Saturday in a seminar
to ensure justice is not compromised by using their discretion to
decide wisely on cases involving AIDS victims.
</P>
<P>
"It has become quite common for convicted AIDS-infected people
to invoke their sickly status. But you have to be careful and
ensure your decision agrees with judicial principles," said Aluoch.
</P>
<P>
The east African country has been ravaged by the AIDS pandemic
with an infection rate of 14 percent among the people aged between
15 to 49.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Factories Drive up Sugar Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The crisis in Kenya's sugar
industry worsened Saturday when two major sugar factories
announced a price rise despite a continued fall in production.
</P>
<P>
Sony, one of the leading ffactories, announced a 39 percent
rise, bringing ex-factory prices from a 50kg bag to 2,705
shillings (about 36 dollars), up form 1,950 shillings (about 26
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The market demand for the commodity has exceeded the production,
which has dropped by 90 percent in the factory due to the acute
shortage of cane, Sony's acting general manager Charles Kanjagara
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is being worsened by unscrupulous wholesalers
who are conspiring to smuggle the commodity at exorbitant prices
to retail outlets in Tanzania," Kanjagara claimed.
</P>
<P>
As the shortage continues to bite, consumers in Nairobi started
queuing outside supermarkets, which usually opens door from 8:30
am, from as early as 6 a.m..
</P>
<P>
The El Nino rains in 1997 and 1998 damaged almost all sugar
plantations in Kenya and it takes two years for sugarcanes to
mature.
</P>
<P>
The sugar shortage is expected to last for six months,
according to the prediction of the agriculture ministry.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopeful of Resumption of Talks with MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
optimistic over the resumption of peace talks with the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) following reports that the
secessionist group plans to reconstitute its peace team.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Batenga, chairman of the government peace panel,
disclosed Saturday in a radio interview that reconstitution of the
MILF team was the result of weeks of back-door negotiations with
the MILF Central committee.
</P>
<P>
The MILF earlier withdrew all authority to its peace panel to
negotiate a peace agreement with the government in the wake of a
series of clashes with government troops in the southern island of
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"They will reconstitute the membership of the advisory panel
and the technical committee when the time is right as they
perceive. I strongly believe the time will be sooner than later,"
Batenga said.
</P>
<P>
He said communication lines remain open between the government
panel and the central leadership of the separatist group, which
has been fighting for more than two decades for a independent
Islamic state in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with the national peace policy, we have to
resolve the armed conflict in Mindanao through peaceful settlement.
A solution is imperative for a just, lasting and comprehensive
peace in Mindanao," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The war in Mindanao this year has claimed more than 1,300 lives,
including those of over 300 civilians, caused damage worth 89
million pesos (about 2 million U.S. dollars), and displaced some
450,000 people, according to a military report.
</P>
<P>
And the military has spent more than 1.3 billion pesos (about
29 million dollars) in pushing an offensive against forces of the
MILF.
</P>
<P>
Batenga said the government, on its part, is looking forward
towards attaining the environment necessary for the peace process
to proceed with the MILF.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet Cluster E, which deals with national
security concerns and political affairs, has instructed his panel
to make sure that the peace process with the MILF move forward.
</P>
<P>
"It is the desire of the government to pursue the peace process.
A sincere and final resolution of the final conflict must be done
through negotiation," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 2 (Xinhua) -- American investors will
explore trade and investment opportunities in Malaysia's rapidly
growing hi-tech corridors, U.S.-Malaysia Business Committee
Director Remy Nathan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Praising Malaysia's efforts in upgrading its work force with
high technology expertise, he said Malaysia has set out the right
policies and incentives to attract technology companies from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
He cited the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) as an example of
such efforts, which would nurture the birth of the country's hi-
tech generation.
</P>
<P>
"With its well educated work force and tremendous local talents,
we believe this country is well positioned to enjoy continued
rapid growth in the information technology sector," Bernama news
agency quoted him as saying upon arrival at the Langkawi
International Airport in northern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Nathan is leading a delegation from the U.S.-ASEAN Business
Council comprising eight chief executive officers and chairmen of
U.S. multinational companies specializing in hi-tech environment
on an eight-day trade mission to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is the largest source of imports among the ASEAN
countries and ranks 11th globally as a source of U.S. imports.
</P>
<P>
U.S. imports from Malaysia stood at 21 billion U.S. dollars
last year while its exports to Malaysia was about 9 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
U.S. investments in Malaysia have grown more than 300 percent
since 1990 and stood at 5.9 billion U.S. dollars at the end of
last year with most U.S. investments concentrated in the
manufacturing sector, particularly in electronics and components.

<HEADLINE> Power Cut in Kenya Could Extend to April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Energy Minister Francis
Masakhalia warns Kenyans that the current power rationing could
last until next April if the anticipated short rains in October
fails.
</P>
<P>
However, if the rains forecast by the Meteorological Department
is realized, the power rationing would ease accordingly,
Masakhalia was quoted by Kenya's leading newspaper Daily Nation as
saying.
</P>
<P>
If the rainy season arrives in October but with inadequate
rainfall, Kenyans should expect power rationing to continue at
reduced levels until the onset of the long rains next April,
Masakhalia said Saturday when attending a ceremony for the
installation of an emergency generating unit.
</P>
<P>
With the support of the World Bank, Kenya will introduce three
emergency fuel generating units of European firms in September and
October to reduce the power deficit.
</P>
<P>
The power shortage in the east African country has led to a
loss of over 2 million U.S. dollars since last September when the
rationing was adopted, according to local newspaper Standard.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the World Bank Country Director to Kenya, Harold
Wackman, said the bank is likely to provide a credit of 75 million
U.S. dollars to meet Kenya's cost in purchasing power.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Scientist Seeks Partnership With Ugandan Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 2 (Xinhua) -- French Scientist Luc Montagnier,
who discovered the AIDS virus, said he is ready to establish a
partnership with Ugandan AIDS scientists to address the epidemic
in Africa, the New Vision daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Montagnier said the partnership would look for cheaper AIDS
treatment strategies and vaccines, and establish the factors that
fuel the epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said he was surprised by the high rates of heterosexual HIV
transmission in the region, which was higher than that in
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Anti--retroviral drugs were not affordable in Africa and it was
the responsibility of scientists to design cheaper treatment, said
Montagnier.
</P>
<P>
"The drug companies are willing to reduce the prices. We can
also reduce the cost of treatment by reducing the duration of
treatment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Mondo Kagonyera said
Uganda was privileged to host Hontagnier, and would benefit from
his knowledge and experience.

HARARE, September 2 (Xinhua) --The Zimbabwean government is
determined to turn around the economy and uphold the already
peaceful and stable environment for the good of the country, vice-
president Joseph Msika said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Opening the annual Harare Agricultural Show, he said the
magnificent exhibits and products on display were an indication of
the country's ability to pull through the current hardships,
contrary to predictions often made by adversaries.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector, agricultural machinery and the
manufacturing sectors all illustrate the robust industrial base of
Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is generally expected that before the economy stabilizes it
has to go through some ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
He said the small-scale and communal farmers are major players
in the economy as seen by their participation at the show.
</P>
<P>
Through our land reform program, this sector will grow in size
and will produce more crops and livestock products," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that farmers had encountered problems
they never experienced before because of the enormous difficulties
besetting the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged the commercial, industrial, mining and informal
sectors, the civil society, the government and the agricultural
sector to work together for the prosperity of the country. End

BUCHAREST -- Farm production will face a setback this year,
said Romanian Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This will seriously influence the fulfillment of national
economic growth goals," he said. Romania this year is suffering
the worst drought in a century. "This has caused a 20 percent
decrease in farm production, or a loss of 500 million U.S. dollars,
or possibly even 1 billion dollars compared with an average bumper
harvest year," said the Romanian leader. Agricultural production
counts for 15 percent of Romania's gross domestic product. (

<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Before the mammoth military and mass parades in Ba Dinh square,

and humane society, and the country's wish to befriend all nations
and peoples in the world for the sake of peace, national

</P>
<P>

Vietnamese Communist Party in its 6th Congress in 1986 lifted the
country out of socio-economic crisis and ushered in a new stage of
development. The country's economy has seen relatively high growth

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Opposition Leader Denies Awareness of Assassination Attempt on President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's main opposition
leader has denied charges by President Chandrika Kumaratunga that
he was aware of the details of the last December assassination
attempt on her life, describing it as a smear to his name at the
start of the general elections campaign.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to President Kumaratunga dated August 31, Ranil
Wickremesinghe, leader of the main opposition United National
Party (UNP) said that he denied this "false allegation completely.
"
</P>
<P>
He accused Kumaratunga of choosing to challenge him publicly at
the start of the general elections campaign in the hope that she
might be able to smear his name.
</P>
<P>
"Even worse you have decided to do this whilst using your
Presidential immunity against prosecution," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ranil said that Kumaratunga made a similar allegation last
March in the Far Eastern Economic Review and the President stated
in a later meeting between them that she had been quoted out of
context.
</P>
<P>
He also blamed Kumaratunga on the rising living cost due to the
recent depreciation of rupee, the small island country's currency
and the slowness of the economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the official Daily News newspaper quoted in recent
days the International Herald Tribune as saying that the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) of Sri Lanka grew six percent in the first
half of this year on rising exports, garments and tea. It
demonstrated that the country's economy is expanding despite the
on-going 17 year ethnic war between government forces and
separatist Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the Uva Province convention of her Sri Lanka
Freedom Party last Wednesday, President Kumaratunga charged that
Ranil was aware of details of the assassination attempt on her
life during last December presidential elections campaign.
</P>
<P>
The President challenged Ranil to deny this allegation publicly
and clear his name, if the allegation was false.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga narrowly escaped an assassination attempt but lost
her vision in her right eye on December 18 last year when a Tamil
Tiger woman suicide bomber struck after an election rally in Town
Hall.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's 11th Parliamentary election is to be held on
October 10. Among the 45 recognized political parties to contest
for a 225-member Parliament seats, the main rivals are the ruling
People's Alliance and UNP.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Follow Path Best Suited to Own Conditions: Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will continue to follow
the path best suited to its own conditions, relying on its own
resources, Myanmar leader Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt was quoted
by Saturday's official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking here on Friday at the opening of the country's first
ever training course in diplomatic skills for senior officials
conducted by the foreign ministry, Khin Nyunt, first secretary of
the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council, said Myanmar
wishes to have friendly relations will all countries in keeping
with its independent and active foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"We have developed increasingly good cooperative relations with
liked-minded countries," he noted, "however, today some countries
are exerting all kinds of pressure on Myanmar in their efforts to
cast it in their own mold."
</P>
<P>
He charged these countries with openly interfering in Myanmar's
internal affairs without naming them.
</P>
<P>
He accused these countries of using every pretext from forced
labor and narcotic drugs to health and education conditions to do
so.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Myanmar will never bow to such pressure.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for Myanmar to participate more actively
and effectively in international arena in order to safeguard its
national interest and promote friendship and cooperation with like-
minded countries particularly with neighboring countries and those
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He added that Myanmar had diplomatic relations with only 67
countries before the present government took office in late 1988,
disclosing that the number of such countries has gone up to 85 and
will still grow to 100 in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, with the establishment of
diplomatic relations with 85 countries throughout the world,
Myanmar has opened 30 embassies and two consulates there, while in
Myanmar, embassies of 27 nations, offices of five U.N. agencies
and two consulates have been opened.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, in addition to being a member of the United Nations,
is also a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and
the BIMST-EC, another regional economic grouping comprising
Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Demands 10 Mln US Dollars for American Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Abu Sayyaf rebels demanded
Friday 10 million U.S. dollars in ransom for the release of an
American they seized in the southern Philippine city of Zamboanga
last Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels agreed to start talks for the release of Jeffrey
Schilling and promised not to harm him while negotiations continue,
the local Manila Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf gunmen, who had earlier threatened to behead the
alleged spy of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, also asked
that American food and medicine be sent for Schilling who is said
to have health problems, the newspaper said, quoting U.S. embassy
officials.
</P>
<P>
The rebel group spokesman, Abu Sabaya, reportedly said he was
ready to meet newly named government negotiator Rolando Sarmiento
and start talks on the release of Schilling who has been
transferred to the jungle lair of the rebels in the southern
island of Jolo.
</P>
<P>
He also recommended President Estrada's former adviser, Le Peng
Wee, as a go-between in negotiations. Wee has negotiated
successfully for the release of nine Malaysians kidnapped by
another faction of the rebel group from Malaysia's Sipadan resort
on April 23.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf has released 17 hostages but is still holding
one Filipino and six Europeans, including two French journalists
seized in Jolo in July.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns U.S. Violation of U.N. Norm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
issued a statement Friday accusing the United States of barring
its parliamentary delegation from attending the first global
gathering of parliamentary leaders.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the U.S. government refused to grant visas
to the Yugoslav parliamentary delegation, regardless of the Inter-
Parliamentary Union's formal invitation to the Yugoslav parliament.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the action violated the union's principle
and also failed to keep its promise of granting visas to all
participating countries equally.
</P>
<P>
The visa refusal shows that the U.S. government continues its
hegemonism policies and tramples on international law and the rule
of international relationships, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day millennium meeting of parliamentary leaders
opened at the United Nations headquarters in New York Wednesday
with the participation of 156 parliamentary leaders from 142

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Conflicts with guerrillas
should be solved through peaceful talks with the help of foreign
countries, said Colombian President Andres Pastrana here Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the South American Summit attended by the presidents of all
the South American countries, Pastrana said it doesn't mean
foreign military intervention in the peace process, and promised
that there is no civil war in his country.
</P>
<P>
"Colombia will never be a Vietnam," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conflicts with guerrillas in the country have dragged on
for 40 years, said the president. "Now it is time to seek a
settlement with the guerrillas through peaceful talks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana also mentioned the environmental pollution caused by
toxic chemicals discharged into rivers by local residents during
the cultivation, processing or trafficking of drugs.
</P>
<P>
He said he will discuss the issue with European Union delegates
in October to seek alternatives solutions for local residents
involved in drug-trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Peru Denies Purchase of Weapons From Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- The Peruvian Army is again
denying that no member of their armed forces involved in the
purchase of military weapons from Jordan, Defense Minister General
Carlos Bergamino said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peru announced last week that it had smashed a ring that flew
10,000 Kalashnikov rifles from Jordan to Colombian rebels, which
has lead to a diplomatic impasse between Peru and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government asserts that the purchase was made by a
gang of international traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Supporting the government's earlier statements, Bergamino said
there is no general by the name of Lucio Olivera in Peru's armed
forces. He claimed it is a fictitious name used by someone who
reportedly made the purchase on behalf of the Peruvian Army.
</P>
<P>
"One of the documents the Jordanian authorities have exhibited
to prove the legitimacy of the sale of 10,000 rifles to Peru has
the signature of 'General Olivera,' which tends to indicate the
traffickers deceived the Jordanians," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bergamino concluded by stating that the acquisition of weapons
in Peru must have the approval of the National Defense Council and
the purchase will be made through the bank of state.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso denied that his country intends to play a
hegemonic role in South America.
</P>
<P>
In the contemporary world, Cardoso said, it would be very
difficult for a country, even the United States, to have the
conditions necessary to impose its interests over those of others.
</P>
<P>
He said that the goal of Brazil is to share solutions with its
neighbors and to have in this way a presence in the area of
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Brazil can solve its internal problems such as poverty by
herself, he said. "Maybe it will assert some kinds of leadership
on the continent,' he said, implying that it doesn't mean seeking
a hegemonic role in South America.
</P>
<P>
Brazil should make more contributions to its neighboring
countries to help them resolve their internal issues. All this is
intended to promote mutual understanding as it did during its
mediation of peace talks between Peru and Ecuador, and the
disputes between Chile and Bolivia, he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Decision to Delay Missile Defense Responsible Move: Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir
Putin late Friday called U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to
put off the deployment of a national missile defense system "a
thought-out and responsible move."
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced Friday in a speech at Georgetown University
that he will leave to his successor the decision on beginning the
deployment of a national missile defense (NMD) system because "
there is not yet enough confidence in technology and in the
effectiveness of the system."
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton made this decision after a thorough analysis
and deep thinking, while also taking into account opinions of U.S.
allies and partners," Putin said in a statement, released by the
Kremlin press service Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
"The move will undoubtedly help to strengthen strategic
stability and security in the world and bolster the United States'
international prestige, especially ahead of the upcoming
Millennium Summit," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
"It does not mean that Washington and Moscow have identical
approaches to anti-missile defense. But Russia is ready to
continue active joint work with the United States and other
countries concerned on ensuring international security, including
further cuts in nuclear arsenals, the improvement of nuclear non-
proliferation regimes and the strengthening of global strategic
stability by political means," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president has already issued the necessary orders
to Russia's Security Council and Foreign Ministry to this end,
said the press service.

OTTAWA, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada has signed an
agreement with its 2,200 pilots to end the lingering threat of
strike originally planned for the first day of the month.
</P>
<P>
According to an announcement released late Friday by the
country's national carrier, the airline and its pilots association
signed a memorandum of settlement on a new four-year contract,
which ensures wage increases of up to 13 percent and more job
security for the union's 2,200 members.
</P>
<P>
The association has informed both Air Canada and federal Labor
Minister Claudette Bradshaw of its decision not to issue a strike
notice.
</P>
<P>
Federal mediator Bruce Outhouse was credited for the deal,
which was based on the mediator's recommendation of a four-year
contract until April 2004.
</P>
<P>
The pilots, who are trying to narrow the wage gap with their
American counterparts, will vote on the tentative settlement in
the next few weeks.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Repatriates 63 to Pyongyang via Panmunjom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea repatriated 63 "
unconverted" people to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) through the truce village of Panmunjom Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The repatriates, mostly in their 70s, who were released in
recent years after serving 15 to 45 years in South Korean prison
for alleged espionage and guerrilla activities on behalf of the
DPRK, refuse to renounce their communist ideology and are eager to
return to the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation is part of an inter-Korean agreement reached
at the end of June under the North-South Joint Declaration issued
at the close of the historic inter-Korean summit between South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung and DPRK leader Kim Jong Il in
Pyongyang on June 13-15 this year.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK returnees left the Pukak Park Hotel in northern Seoul
at 8:00 a.m. Saturday (2300 GMT Friday) and arrived at the
Freedom House on the southern side of the military demarcation
line (MDL) in Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
They crossed to the northern side of the DML at 10 a.m.
Saturday after DPRK officials received the repatriates' medical
checklists from South Korean officials.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, they received a medical check-up and a briefing on
the repatriation process at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
Initially, Pyongyang proposed to fly the returnees back on a
direct air route, but finally accepted Seoul's suggestion of using
the truce village.

ROME, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Italy's shooting team is going to
the Sydney Olympics with the aim of repeating the dead-eyed form
that has made them the most feared combine around, leading the
field in the sport.
</P>
<P>
Australia could not be more auspicious turf for the Italians,
who won the first of their six gold medals in Melbourne in 1956,
with Galliano Rossini.
</P>
<P>
Since then they have accrued a total of sixteen titles
including three silvers and seven bronzes - better even than the
United States,Russia and Germany, the other top shooting nations.
</P>
<P>
In Sydney, 18 gold medals will be up for grabs in the various
disciplines which include pistol, trap, air rifle, free pistol,
double trap, rapid-fire pistol, rifle prone, running game target,
three-position rifle and skeet.
</P>
<P>
Last time out, at Atlanta, Italy bagged two golds with Roberto
Di Donna in the pistol and Ennio Falco in the skeet.
</P>
<P>
Albano Pera won a silver in the double trap and Andrea Benelli
a bronze in the skeet.
</P>
<P>
Falco and Benelli are part of the team again this time, while
Pera has gone on to train the prone rifle shooters.
</P>
<P>
Italian sports shooting federation president Luciano Rossi
acknowledged that the opponents will be tough, especially the
Australians with their home advantage, who won two golds and a
bronze four years ago.
</P>
<P>
"But all eleven of our athletes are capable of getting the gold,

<P>
NEW YORK, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Martina Hingis won an easy
match to advance to the fourth round of the U.S. Open today,
sending a strong warning to the Williams sisters that she's ready
to take them on.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, who failed to win any major title since the 1999
Australian Open, defeated her Italian opponent Tathiana Garbin 6-1
and 6-0 within 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
"It will be great, definitely, to win a Grand Slam right here.
This is my chance," said the top-seeded Hingis.
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, Hingis will play Venus Williams in the semifinals,
with the winner perhaps competing against defending champion
Serena Williams in the
final.
</P>
<P>
"I watch her when she plays" Hingis said of Venus Williams, who
beat her in the Wimbledon quarterfinals en route to the title in
July. "I just have to play mine, not get too intimidated, do
whatever I've been doing so far."
</P>
<P>
Hingis will next face No. 11 Sandrine Testud who sailed over
Kristie Boogert 6-0 and 6-1, and she has won all 11 of their match,
including five this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Urges UNTAET to Form E. Timor Joint Border Committee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
urged the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor
(UNTAET) to sign an agreement on the formation of a joint border
committee as part of measures to ease disruptive activities along
the East Timor border.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Coordinating Minister for Political, Social and
Security Affairs Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said that with a joint
committee the two sides could conduct surveillance on all kinds of
incidents in the border area.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of a joint committee can ensure that fair
measures will be taken against Indonesia as it has been too often
that we have been blamed for supporting all kinds of incidents
happening on the border," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"It has become very unfair if every time we have to take the
blame ... The committee will have the authority to make
investigations and conduct surveillance each time an incident
occurs," Susilo said after a meeting with UNTAET chief Sergio
Vieira de Mellon here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Director General
for Political Affairs Hassan Wirajuda, the Indonesian government
had delivered the draft to UNTAET.
</P>
<P>
"However, UNTAET refused to sign the draft on the grounds that
they have to discuss it among themselves on September 7 and maybe
after September 10 they will be ready to have further talks about
it," Wirajuda added.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government said the Joint Border Committee will
be authorized to set rules on movements along the border between
East Timor and West Timor including on security conditions and
administration procedures for those who want to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
The committee can also be authorized to determine the
demarcation line between the two areas.
</P>
<P>
Susilo said during the meeting de Mello again alleged that
intensified activities on the border in the past month was
supported by and involved the Indonesian Military.
</P>
<P>
"But, from the facts we have on the field according to the
Udayana Regional Commander Maj. Gen. Kiki Syahnakri, the
allegations are baseless," he added.
</P>
<P>
There has been an upsurge in militia activity ahead of
Wednesday's first anniversary of a U.N.-brokered ballot that saw
the eastern half of Timor island vote to split from Indonesia
after more than 23 years of rule. The militias, who recently
killed two U.N. peacekeepers, operate from refugee camps in West
Timor, where Indonesian troops and police have failed to halt
their activities.

<HEADLINE> Romania Faces Setback in Agricultural Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Farm production will face a
setback this year, said Romanian Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This will seriously influence the fulfillment of national
economic growth goals," he said.
</P>
<P>
Romania this year is suffering the worst drought in a century.
"This has caused a 20 percent decrease in farm production, or a
loss of 500 million U.S. dollars, or possibly even 1 billion
dollars compared with an average bumper harvest year," said the
Romanian leader.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production counts for 15 percent of Romania's
gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The reduction of agricultural production will result in a drop
of 3 percentage points in the GDP, said Constantin Chirca, vice
chairman of the State Statistical Commission of Romania. "But
industrial growth in the year will make up for the loss," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to end a drop in the national economy occurring over
the past three years, Romania's GDP growth rate for the year 2000
has been set at 1.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Stops Importing Cattle From Uruguay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 1 (Xinhua) -- Mexico ceased from Thursday
importing cattle on the hoof from Uruguay because of the sanitary
crisis in the region, the authorities said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Uruguay, in a bid to revert the Mexican decision, has asked
Mexico to send a team to Uruguay for an on-the-spot assessment,
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Uruguayan exports of cattle to Argentina
and of sheep to the Brazilian market have also been interrupted
due to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Foot and mouth disease outbreaks were detected in Argentina in
the first few days of August, and later in the south of Brazil and
in Bolivia. Argentina sacrificed some 3,000 heads of cattle and
suspended meat exports to the United States, Canada, Mexico and
Chile. Brazil also killed some 400 heads of cattle, pigs and sheep.
</P>
<P>
No cases of the disease have been detected so far in Uruguay,
which has closed borders with Argentina and Brazil to prevent the
contagion of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Southern Common Market (Mercosur) experts met last weekend in
Montevideo to analyze the situation and declared a sanitary alert
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided to intensify border controls and to
restrict cattle and meat imports within the bloc. It also agreed
to send technicians to the zones, where the disease has been
detected, to find solutions to the problem.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Congress to Raise Minimum Wage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Saturday urged Congress to raise the minimum wage by one dollar
an hour to 6.15 dollars an hour.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, in his weekly radio address, said that his proposal to
raise the minimum wage has been the victim of every legislative
maneuver in the congressional handbook.
</P>
<P>
He urged Republican leaders in Congress to stop playing
legislative games and make the issue its first business when
Congress resumes after summer recess.
</P>
<P>
"Month after month, even with bipartisan support in Congress,
the Republican leadership has sat on our proposal to raise the
minimum wage," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"When they come back to Washington next week, I urge them to
send me a minimum wage bill as a first order of business," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton first proposed to raised the minimum wage by a dollar
in his State of the Union address in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
He said that his proposal means an increase of 2,000 dollars a
year for a full-time worker, enough for a family of four to buy
groceries for seven months or pay the rent check for five.

<P>
BOGOTA, September 2 (Xinhua) -- Seven members of the Colombian
armed forces died Saturday when a U.S.-made Colombian warplane
crashed amid heavy fighting between leftist rebels and government
force.
</P>
<P>
A military communique said that the plane, an AC-47, crashed
early Saturday morning against a mountain over 3,000 meters above
sea level when it was taking part in the fight against the members
of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Three officers and four technicians were aboard the plane.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, called "phantom plane," equipped with radar for
night operation, was taking part in a support mission for the
battalions that protect a base of army communications antennas,
the National Institute of Radio and Television.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was the bloodiest since U.S. President Bill
Clinton visited Colombia on Wednesday to support President Andres
Pastrana's fight against drug traffickers and leftist rebels.
</P>
<P>
The plane, used extensively by U.S. forces during the Vietnam
War, had been providing fire support for the ground troops.
</P>
<P>
Under a new 1.3 billion-dollar aid package, Washington is
sending 60 combat helicopters to the government security forces
and elite U.S. troops are training Colombian anti-narcotics army
troops.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Hopes Euro Has "Moment of Glory" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 2 (Xinhua) -- The euro will have its "moment of
glory," despite its recent struggles against the dollar, European
Commission President Romano Prodi asserted Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was important for "institutions to function"
and that the euro's value would follow.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before the prestigious Ambrosetti conference in
Italian northern city of Cernobbio, Prodi declared himself "
tranquil" in the face of the euro's weak standing against the
dollar, which hovered mostly between 88 and 90 cents this week.
</P>
<P>
Prodi added that "the economy itself must show itself to be
strong like America's."
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the euro needed help in the form of stronger
monetary policy, Prodi said that was the "great problem facing the
Europe of the future: how to adjust decision-making to the new
reality."
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the EU's future, Prodi said that expanding the
European Union eastward will result in "economic success for
everyone," despite the tendency of many to view enlargement as a "
danger".
</P>
<P>
Prodi insisted that expanding the group of 15 nations,
especially to include former Soviet-block nations, will be done "
in a way that reinforces and does not weaken the economy."

ROME, September 2 (Xinhua) -- About 400 neo-Nazis from northern
Italy and Germany marched to a top international think-tank
meeting which held in Cernobbio of Northern Italy Saturday,

Luminaries like Italian economic patriarch Gianni Agnelli,
Premier Giuliano Amato, European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg and European Commission President Romano Prodi were

Carrying placards like "national rebellion to globalization", "
we're together for history, you for power" and "we're against your
American imperialism," the far-rightists were mostly from Italy's
northern region of Lombardy and Veneto, but also some from Germany.
