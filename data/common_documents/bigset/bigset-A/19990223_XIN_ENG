<HEADLINE> Swiss Economic Growth to Slow Down in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss economic growth will
be further slowed down in 1999 but should recover in 2000,
according to a Swiss news agency report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report cited the German IFO institute as saying that the
growth of the actual gross national product in Switzerland would
be less than 1.5 percent. In 1998, the growth slowed down and
averaged at 1.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the German institute predicted that the Swiss economic
growth would recover in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to an agreement between Switzerland and the European
Union, to be implemented in 2001, the economic growth should
increase to almost two percent in 2000, the institute said in its
latest study.

<HEADLINE> Defense Guidelines Meet Opposition From Japan's Local Governments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 102 municipal
assemblies in Japan are openly opposing or questioning a set of
bills aimed at implementing the revised Japan-U.S. defense
cooperation guidelines, Kyodo News reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
An opinion endorsed by the municipal assembly of
Musashimurayama in Tokyo says the bills are intended to mobilize
Japan for war involving the U.S. military stationed in Japan,
violating the pacifist principle of Japan's Constitution, Kyodo
said, quoting a civic group.
</P>
<P>
Regarding Japan's logistics support for the U.S. military in
the event of an emergency in undefined "areas surrounding Japan,"
the Hiroshima municipal assembly called for the central government
to respect local governments' intentions, expressing concerns that
local municipalities may be forced to provide such support.
</P>
<P>
Of the 102 assemblies, 23 are in Nagano Prefecture, 14 in Akita,
10 in Tokyo, eight each in Tokushima and Hiroshima, and seven in
Hokkaido.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Japan and the United States adopted the new defense
guidelines which calls for Japan's more logistics support for U.S.
forces in emergencies in "areas surrounding Japan."

<HEADLINE> More Suspects of Political Killings Arrested in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced on Monday that
four more suspects were arrested in connection with the killings
of dissidents late last year.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor of the Iranian Military Court Mohammad Niazi told
the Islamic Republic News Agency that one of the four had fled to
Turkey but was brought back by Turkish police.
</P>
<P>
Niazi said that the suspects had stolen and hidden some
classified documents from the Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The police seized fake seals and stamped papers of various
organizations and organs, besides the stolen documents, when
searching the suspects' hideouts.
</P>
<P>
Forged papers of various organizations and institutions,
especially those of the security and military forces, as well as
forged passports and identification cards were among the seized
documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
He did not reveal the identities of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that 10 people have been arrested in
connection with mysterious political murders of dissidents in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry announced last month that some
of its own agents were involved in the political murders of an
opposition leader, his wife and several dissident writers.
</P>
<P>
The revelation triggered a sharp political quarrel between the
conservative and moderate factions and forced the conservative
Intelligence Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi to resign earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
Niazi said that the investigating team is determined to
continue its investigation until all those involved in the
murders are identified and brought to justice.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected the allegation that Israeli intelligence
service Mossad had a part in the murders, as hard-line
conservatives had suggested.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor called on the Iranian press to avoid making any
analysis or comment on the killings and allow the case to pass its
legal course under the prevailing favorable atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Moves to Link up Stock Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Stock exchanges in
southern Africa are to speed up the linking of their trading,
clearing and settlement systems, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The committee of stock exchanges of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), which met in Johannesburg late last
week, had resolved to build the region's market into a world
contender through enhanced regional cooperation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Johannesburg stock exchanges had put links on line
last November, and will soon investigate the possibility of
linking their central depositories and other systems, said Darrell
Till, Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) director of marketing,
research and development.
</P>
<P>
Mauritius already has a central depository, while South Africa
and Tanzania plan to make theirs operational within the next few
months, thus bringing paperless trading to their markets.
</P>
<P>
Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Zimbabwe and Zambia are planning to
use the Mauritius central depository system, Till said.
</P>
<P>
Regional exchanges which still use manual trading systems, such
as the floor, call-over or central order matching office, all had
plans to computerize their trading.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed that eventually all the markets in the
region should be accessible to traders through the same desk-top
screen, Till said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are starting into connectivity to frame future
automation of the individual exchanges, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges have made progress in harmonizing listing
requirements across the region, including substantially revising
their regulations into a similar pattern based upon 13 agreed
principles, which are in line with international requirements,
Till said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange leaders also agreed that stockbroker staff in the
region should take the same entry-level examinations set by the
Britain-based securities institute, and work should begin on
developing bond markets across the region.
</P>
<P>
The SADC is a 14-nation bloc established to promote trade and
economic cooperation in the region.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Official Arrives in Pakistan to Discuss Afghan Refugee Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Assistant High Commissioner
of the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Soren
Jessen-Petersen arrived here from Teheran Sunday on the second
stage of his week-long tour of Iran and Pakistan to discuss the
Afghan refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
The trip stems from UNHCR's increased concern about the plight
of the Afghan refugees, the largest single refugee group in the
world, the continued lack of U.N. presence in Afghanistan and the
unprecedented shortage of funds that has prevented the
repatriation of some groups of refugees who wish to return home.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Pakistan, Jessen-Petersen will meet with
Pakistani officials in both Islamabad and Peshawar, the
northwestern city adjacent to Afghanistan. He may also meet with
Taliban officials in Islamabad on Wednesday, according to a report
of News Network International of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Their talks are expected to focus on a number of issues
relating to the estimated 1.2 million Afghan refugees still living
in Pakistan and the 1.4 million in Iran, including concerns about
UNHCR's current inability to monitor the plight of those returning
or being forcibly sent back to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The UNCHCR sees its return to the war-ravaged country as vital
for monitoring the repatriation of Afghan refugees.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. agencies withdrew their international staff from
Afghanistan last August following the murder of an Italian U.N.
official in Kabul and two local U.N. staff members earlier in
eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.

<HEADLINE> Employees Working for Embassies In Zambia Requested to Pay Income Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Local and foreign employees
working for embassies in Lusaka will be subjected to paying income
tax with effect from March 1, 1999, the Zambia Revenue Authority
(ZRA) announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
ZRA commissioner Kelvin Donovan said in Lusaka that only
workers covered by diplomatic status are exempted from paying tax.
</P>
<P>
During a ZRA workshop on the taxation of embassy employees,
Donovan urged all embassies to comply and ensure that all the
affected workers start paying pay-you-earn (PAYE). The law will
take its course on all defaulting embassies, he added.
</P>
<P>
But he said that all local and foreign embassies had been
granted amnesty and they will not be required to pay all the
arrears.
</P>
<P>
ZRA will be going round to get the details of employees in
embassies in the country so that they start paying PAYE next
month.
</P>
<P>
" We want embassies to help us because the government needs the
money," Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the government plan to widen the tax base
and boost its revenues, he added.

MOSCOW, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The deaths of around 2,000

Most of these soldiers commit suicide, Marchenko said. "As a

by their fellow servicemen or officers of the units they serve

She said the murders of draftees or young soldiers are

<HEADLINE> EU Supports Zambian President's Peace Initiatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has
come out strongly in its support for Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba's peace initiatives in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
A statement from Bonn and Brussels made available to the Zambia
News Agency (ZANA) Monday said the EU remained deeply concerned
about the on- going crisis in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that the current conflict in the DRC can only be
resolved through a negotiated settlement acceptable to all the
Congolese people. This will allow the DRC and other countries in
the region to find peace, stability and democracy.
</P>
<P>
The statement welcomed DRC President Laurent Kabila's
preparedness to enter into negotiations with all parties to the
conflict including the rebels and encourages him to conclude a
ceasefire agreement as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The EU supported for the establishment of two committees on
border security and on ceasefire agreement, and it wouldl be
prepared to consider a rehabilitation program for the DRC in case
of an effective cessation of hostilities and internal progress of
peace, democracy and respect for human rights.
</P>
<P>
The EU reiterated its support for the principles of territorial
 integrity and the respect of sovereignty and security of the DRC
and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
It also called for negotiations of all parties with a view to
finding an urgent political solution to the conflict, leading to
the withdrawal of foreign troops from the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU also hoped that the negotiations should
address regional security problems and initiate an all inclusive
political dialog with all political parties.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak-India Bus Diplomacy, A Major Step </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The much awaited bus journey
by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee to Pakistan ended
over the weekend with a pledge by the top leaders of the two South
Asian nations to intensify their efforts for the settlement of all
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day historic visit by Vajpayee, the first by an
Indian prime minister to the rival South Asian neighbor in a
decade, the two countries signed three documents -- the Lahore
Declaration, a Memorandum of Understanding and a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The most important document among the three is believed to be
the Lahore Declaration. This is also the first major document
signed by the prime ministers of the South Asian nations in 27
years.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has described the Lahore Declaration
as "an important milestone" on the path to promoting peace and
security at the heart of which lies resolution of Jammu and
Kashmir issue, the core issue on which the two countries had
fought two major wars since their inception in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration testifies to the universally recognized
fact that Jammu and Kashmir is an issue between Pakistan and India
which needs to be resolved. Thus it is obvious that Jammu and
Kashmir is not an integral part of India as it is sometimes
propagated by the other side.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here are of the view that the signing of the Lahore
Declaration is the major outcome out of the two-day summit
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Lahore Declaration says that the two countries are
convinced that durable peace and development of harmonious
relations and friendly cooperation will serve the vital interests
of the peoples of the two countries, enabling them to devote their
energies for a better future.
</P>
<P>
They also agree that an environment of peace and security is in
the supreme national interests of both sides and that the
resolution of all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir,
is essential for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here noted that the major dispute which has caused the
strained bilateral relations between Pakistan and India and stands
as a potential threat to the regional peace and security is Jammu
and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
It is by no means unrealistic to expect a major breakthrough
over this long-lasting ticklish issue in a short span of a two-day
visit. However, it is a positive and welcoming development as the
two countries have reached consensus that Jammu and Kashmir is a
disputed area, and they will intensify their efforts to resolve
it.
</P>
<P>
Described by the media here as another major development in the
new security environment after the tit-for-tat nuclear tests in
May last year, the two countries also agreed to take immediate
steps to reduce the risk of accidental or unauthorized use of
nuclear weapons and to discuss concepts and doctrines to elaborate
measures for confidence building in the nuclear and conventional
fields aimed at prevention of conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has expressed its satisfaction over
the outcome of the two-day summit meeting, describing Vajpayee's
visit as "an important milestone in the bilateral relationship."
</P>
<P>
The focus throughout the visit was on promotion of stable
environment of peace and security between the two countries, for
which the two governments have made their commitments in the
Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that India and Pakistan will make their sincere
efforts to translate the vision contained in the declaration to
reality.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani side expects that the next round of their
"composite and integrated dialogue" on the outstanding issues
would be the occasion for India to demonstrate that the symbolism
of Vajpayee's visit had "foundation in sincerity."
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the leaders of Pakistan and India
have an uphill task ahead to bring down tempers in their countries
to make progress on all outstanding issues, especially on the
Jammu and Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
During Vajpayee's visit, a curfew-like situation was witnessed
in Lahore, the second largest city of Pakistan, as Islamic groups
fought pitched battles with police to protest against Vajpayee's
bus journey to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee's decision to bring along with him a star-studded
delegation of artists and sportsmen may have symbolized his
priority to rejoin the cultural thread that had been broken by
years of hostility between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
But apart from its being a gesture of goodwill, whether the bus
diplomacy would change any thing or influence the respective
positions of either side, is hard to say.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Asks Governors' Help on Education Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
asked the nation's governors Monday to support his proposed
education reforms, saying winning approval will be "tough
politics" but ultimately worth the battle.
</P>
<P>
"Some will say the federal government should be giving states
more flexibility, not demanding more accountability," Clinton
said. "I say it's a false choice, and the federal government
should be giving you more of both."
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore held a roundtable discussion
at the White House with 53 governors from the states and
territories attending the National Governors' Association's annual
winter meeting.
</P>
<P>
Clinton sought to find common ground with governors who are
split along political lines over the federal role in improving the
performance of public schools. Democrats have largely backed
Clinton's proposal, while Republican governors say Washington
should have limited say in the way education dollars are used.
</P>
<P>
"This is tough politics. I don't know that I could have passed
this through my legislature," Clinton said, referring to his
tenure as governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any business telling you whom to hire, how to
teach, how to run schools.... But let's not kid ourselves. We're
not doing our children any favors by continuing to subsidize
practices that do not work and failing to invest in practices that
do," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's proposals include building or modernizing 6,000
classrooms, hiring 100,000 teachers, reducing class size in the
early grades, starting more after-school programs, connecting all
classrooms and libraries to the Internet, stopping social
promotion and insisting on effective discipline.

<HEADLINE> Residential Burglary, Hijacking Rise in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The number of residential burglaries per 100,000 of the
population stood at 627 in 1998, 4.5 percent up from 1997, halting
the downward trend registered since 1995, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Car hijackings rose to 36 per 100,000 of the population last
year, after dropping from 32 in 1996 to 31 in 1997, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Illegal possession of firearms and street robbery were also on
the rise. Illegal possession of arms stood at 34 per 100,000 last
year, compared to 31 in 1997 and 32 in 1996, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Safety and Security Ministry said the rise in the number of
 hijackings was partly due to instability in central Africa, which
hampered coordinated efforts in cracking down on illegal motor
trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 and 1997, the number of hijackings had been brought
down as police agencies in southern African countries joined hands
in closing down the market for hijacked motor vehicles in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the rise in the street robberies and
thefts to the current economic climate.
</P>
<P>
South Africa experienced financial turmoil last year because of
the knock-on effects of the Asian crisis and the economy is
virtually in recession.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Hopes U.N. Mission Withdraw on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda reiterated here Monday his government's stand that United
Nations observer mission in Angola be withdrawn from the southern
African country on time.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during meetings with Chinese, French and
British ambassadors or charge d'affaires ad interim in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said that since the opposition National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) restarted the civil war, the
"objective condition" for U.N. mission's staying in Angola has
gone, therefore the Angolan government hopes that the U.N. mission
will "withdraw completely from the Angolan territory as scheduled"
when its term expires on February 26.
</P>
<P>
On U.N.'s request for stationing a mediation representative in
Angola, the Angolan foreign minister said the U.N. can have such a
representative, but he can only be stationed at the U.N.
headquarters in New York, and visit Angola from time to time to
collect on-the-spot information.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council will discuss the situation in Angola
in a few days. Miranda expressed his hope that the five permanent
members will support his government's above-mentioned position and
announce UNITA Chairman Jonas Savimbi a "war criminal" as did by
the Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
President Eduardo dos Santos, in a speech on January 15,
accused the U.N. mission in his country of making a series of
mistakes in the Angolan Peace Process.
</P>
<P>
On January 21, the Security Council issued a chairman's
declaration, stressing the importance of postponing U.N. mission's
term in Angola and demanding that Secretary-General Kofi Annan
hold consultations with Angola in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Economists Expect Recovery in Emerging Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Economists from a number of
world prominent financial companies expect a recovery for the
emerging markets in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
David Hale, chief economist at financial-services giant Zurich
Group, was quoted Monday by the Wall Street Journal as saying real
economic growth on the emerging markets would rise 1.2 percent in
1999, 3.2 percent in 2000 and 5.2 percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, another financial firm, is starting
to contemplate upward revision to its growth forecasts in the
crisis economies of Asia and Latin America and putting the growth
for Brazil at 3 percent next year compared with a forecast decline
of 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Some optimists were starting to conclude that the worst is
ending, especially for the emerging markets that have troubled the
world economy since the summer of 1997, the Journal said.
</P>
<P>
The economists attributed the upward trend to the interest-rate
cuts in the emerging markets and the United States as well. In the
fourth quarter of 1998, 37 central banks in all parts of the
world, from Latin America, to both East and West Europe and China,
initiated a total of 75 interest-rate cuts. Today Britain, Japan
and others have recently slashed rates to fuel their engines of
growth.
</P>
<P>
The cuts have pumped up the prices in financial markets,
especially stock prices. But some economists worried that the
surge of liquidity has not lifted demand for commodities.
</P>
<P>
The Journal said, however, the surprisingly small U.S. trade
deficit in last December may suggest the beginning of a turnaround
in troubled economies in the emerging markets, showing, in
particular, sings of bottoming-out for the past year's fall in
U.S. exports to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Over the balance of 1999, the dozens of interest-rate cuts
already made could begin to lift economic activity, the Journal
said, adding that Lag times are six months to 18 months before
such cuts work their way through the economy and if so, all the
liquidity from the easings should be fuel for a reheating of
demand in the emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
The international Monetary Fund, which has been forced to
revise downward its forecasts for 1999 and 2000 repeatedly, sees
now real world economic growth of 3.5 percent in 2000 from a
projected 2.2 percent this year.

GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have chosen March 12 as the new deadline for
the selection of the organization's new chief, trade officials
said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are facing many crucial and some difficult decisions to
make in the days to come and I want to count on your collective
support in facing the challenges ahead of us," said Ambassador Ali
Said Mchumo of Tanzania at the General Council meeting on Monday.
</P>
<P>
When elected as the General Council chairman on February 16,
Mchumo said that "the most urgent matter that has to be resolved
by the council is the election of the new director general"
</P>
<P>
The 134-member WTO has failed to meet at least three former
deadlines to reach consensus on who will succeed Renato Ruggiero
of Italy to be the next director-general.
</P>

The four candidates are Morocco's Hassan Abuyoub, Canada's Roy

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urged to Bring S. Leone Rebels to Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah has called on the U.N. Security Council to take
actions to bring the rebels and their allies to the negotiating
table, reports reaching here said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a broadcast speech to the nation on Sunday night, President
Kabbah asked the U.N. Security Council to consider further action
against the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) who is waging a
brutal war in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged "dialog and all calls for a political settlement be
directed to the RUF", saying "let the RUF and its supporters make
genuine concessions for peace if they really want peace."
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said that the permanent members of the Security Council
had the military and political clout to exert pressure on those
states who continue to supply weapons and logistics which are
being used to kill Sierra Leonean people.
</P>
<P>
He has offered dialog and sanctioned talks between the
detained RUF leader Foday Sankoh, the RUF field commanders and
allied soldiers loyal to a military junta which ousted him in May
1997.
</P>
<P>
A west African peacekeeping force of ECOMOG reinstated the
democratically-elected Kabbah government in March 1998 which was
disturbed by the rebels last month when they launched attacks on
capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
The Kabbah government has repeatedly accused neighboring
Liberia and Burkina Faso, whose president is the current chairman
of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), of helping the rebels
in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM: Iran's Diplomacy Based on Detente in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reiterated Monday that Iran's diplomacy focuses on
detente, confidence-building and partnership in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening session of the annual seminar on "the
prospects for the Persian Gulf and the current facts," Kharrazi
said any initiative regarding peace and stability in the Gulf
should include the principle of detente.
</P>
<P>
"The importance and sensitivity of the Persian Gulf have been a
momentous task for us to prepare the ground for understanding and
put an end to any kind of misinterpretations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi underlined that the factors behind the crisis in the
region should be removed by the regional states themselves, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He lambasted the presence of foreign forces in the Gulf and
said the foreign forces are not interested in the stability in the
region, because security in the region leaves no room for their
continued presence there. They need a crisis spot to justify their
presence, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister called on regional states to
remove any elements that may cause crisis and to leave no place
for foreign forces to justify their presence.
</P>
<P>
Iran spares no effort to help ease tension in the Gulf and to
this end it has considerably improved its relations with the
neighboring states, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that confidence-building is aimed at a common
military structure and cooperation among the Gulf states in
social, political, cultural and economic areas.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf states need a common and coordinated platform to
guarantee peace and security in the region, he said, adding that
the regional states have common grounds in religious, cultural and
economic fields and given their geopolitical situation, they
naturally have common interests and common concerns.
</P>
<P>
He believed that shuttle visits by trade, cultural and
scientific delegations and exchange of views between Iran and
other regional states on diplomatic and military grounds would
serve to build confidence.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 specialists from 16 states attended the two-day
seminar.

<HEADLINE> British Army Destroys Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The British Army has destroyed
all its anti-personel landmines, Defense Secretary George
Robertson said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The army's mine destruction program is now complete. No
British soldier will ever again lay an anti-personnel landmine,"
Mr Robertson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
That statement means that Britain's army has destroyed all its
landmines four years before the deadline set out in the Ottawa
Convention, which urge all countries to destroy the devices within
four years and comes into force on 1 March.
</P>
<P>
The convention was decided late 1997, shortly after the death
of Princess Diana, the late Princes of Wales who had been a
fervent campaigner against landmines.
</P>
<P>
"Last year I announced that we would destroy all Ministry of
Defense stocks by 1 January 2000. The British army's destruction
program has been particularly successful and is now complete,"
Robertson said.
</P>
<P>
But the British Royal Air Force still possess some mines "for
specific reasons" and due to destroy them by the end of this year,
a Defense Ministry spokesman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Britain has not manufactured or exported landmines since the
1980s and British forces last used mines in the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Ottawa Conventions, the use, production,
transfer and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines will be
banned by 1 March 2003.

<HEADLINE> WTO Moves to Quicken Process of Selecting New Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- In a move to push forward the
slow process of selecting their new leader, members of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) gave the chairman of the organization's
ruling body the mandate to take full charge of the process at a
meeting here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Newly-elected Chairman of the General Council Ali Said Mchumo
of Tanzania will "take full charge of the consultations leading to
the appointment of the new director-general", said WTO officials.
</P>
<P>
His predecessor, Ambassador John Weekes, did not feel to be in
such a position to conduct the consultations independently since
his country has a candidate for the director-general.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador William Rossier of Switzerland and a Brazilian
ambassador have then been named as facilitators under the guidance
of Weekes to carry out consultations.
</P>
<P>
The four candidates are Morocco's Hassan Abuyoub, Canada's Roy
MacLaren, New Zealand's Mike Moore and Thailand's Supachai
Panitchpakdi.
</P>
<P>
At the general council meeting on Monday, Mchumo asked
Ambassador Rossier to continue as a facilitator to assist him in
the consultations.
</P>
<P>
"I have no such conflict of interest since my country has no
candidate, and so as Chairman of the General Council, I believe it
is my duty to undertake this process of consultations as provided
in the decision I have just mentioned, and I intend to do it,"
said Mchumo.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed at the meeting that March 12 would be the
new deadline for the selection of the organization's new chief,
according to the WTO officials.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia, Iran to Resume Regular Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Iran
agreed on Monday to resume regular flights between the two
countries after a suspension of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after two days of talks between Ali
Al-Khalaf, head of Saudi Civil Aviation Authority and Behzad
Modhaheri, aid to Iran's roads and transportation minister and
head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, the Saudi Press Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Saudi Arabian Airlines will
fly to Tehran and three other major Iranian cities, Sheraz,
Mashhad and Asfahan, while Iranian planes will operate four
flights every week to Riyadh, Jeddah and Dhahran. But the accord
did not mention when flights will be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Iran started operating one flight weekly from Tehran to Jeddah
last April.
</P>
<P>
Iranian planes will also be allowed to stop in Saudi Arabia on
their way to Egypt, Kenya and South Africa, but are not allowed to
pick up Saudi passengers.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran were tense after Iran's
1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Iran used to criticize Saudi Arabia for its close ties with the
West, the United States in particular, and Saudi Arabia felt
uneasy about Iran's attempt at exporting revolution.
</P>
<P>
The two countries began to repair and improve their ties since
Iran's President Mohmmed Khatami, a political moderate, took
office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between Tehran and Riyadh saw a big boost
since February last year when Iran's former president Hashmi
Rafsanjani paid a 14-day official visit to the Gulf kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Khatami is reportedly preparing a visit to Saudi Arabia in
March.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Monday called for more efforts to achieve the goals
of the U.N. Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism by 2000.
</P>
<P>
"Let us redouble our efforts to see this process through to its
conclusion," he told the 1999 session of the Special Committee on
Decolonization, which was opened here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the "administering powers" will work closely with
the Committee to help the remaining non-self-governing-territories
(NSGT) to reach a "full measure of self-government".
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of the United Nations in 1945, more
than 80 nations have won independence and joined the U.N. as
sovereign states or through integration with other states. The
U.N. has 185 members now.
</P>
<P>
There are still 17 NSGTs administered by Britain, France, New
Zealand, Portugal, Spain and the United States, with 10 of them
under Britain.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly set up the Special Committee in 1961
and in 1991, it adopted a plan of action for the International
Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism, aimed at achieving
complete decolonization by the end of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Jordan-Saudi Ties Back to Normal: Jordanian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Jordanian official said
on Monday that the relations between Jordan and Saudi Arabia have
returned to normal.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arab radio from Riyadh,
Jordanian Minister of State for Development Tahir Kan'an said his
ongoing visit to Saudi Arabia is aimed at boosting the desire of
the two countries to rebuild bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Kan'an told the Cairo-based radio that the trade ties between
his country and Saudi Arabia "have also been put again on the
right track."
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two neighbors suffered a setback during
the 1990 Gulf crisis as Jordan sided with Iraq on its invasion of
Kuwait. Saudi Arabia cut off oil supply to Jordan in September
that year.
</P>
<P>
After the 1991 Gulf War in which Iraqi troops were driven out
of Kuwait, Jordan distanced itself from Iraq in a bid to end
international isolation. Its ties with Saudi Arabia pick up.
</P>
<P>
Now, Saudi Arabia is Jordan's second largest Arab trade partner
after Iraq. In 1996, Jordan exported goods worth about 184 million
U.S. dollars to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's relations with the Saudi Fund for Development, which
was formed to finance development projects in other Arab
countries, is expected to be resumed soon, Kan'an said.
</P>
<P>
Kan'an arrived in the Saudi capital on Sunday. Reports said
Saudi officials discussed with him ways of extending support to
Jordan, including promotion of trade, increase of Saudi investment
in Jordan and financial aids to Jordan's development projects.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The International
Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) said Monday it has seized
another genocide suspect after he was arrested in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Ignace Bagilishema, a former Rwandan mayor, was arrested in
Pretoria, Saturday by South African immigration authorities and
was transferred the same day to the U.N. court.
</P>
<P>
"I am aware that the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
in Arusha, Tanzania, has issued a warrant for my arrest based on
indictment confirmed by the tribunal which alleges that I
committed crimes in Rwanda in 1994," Bagilishema said.
</P>
<P>
"For reasons that are my own, I wish to be allowed to answer
these charges as soon as possible and therefore, I waive any
rights I have under South African law to appeal my present
detention and declare that I agree to my transfer to Arusha to
face charges," he added.
</P>
<P>
With these words, a statement issued by ICTR Monday said, the
44-year- old former mayor of Mabanza Commune, in western Kibuye
Prefecture, agreed to surrender him to the court.
</P>
<P>
Bagilishema was indicted on November 28 of 1995 for his alleged
role in the mass killings of over 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis
and moderate Hutus, in Rwanda in the middle of 1994.
</P>
<P>
He is charged with conspiracy to commit genocide, genocide,
crimes against humanity, and violations of Article 3 common to the
Geneva Conventions and additional Protocol II.
</P>
<P>
The accused is alleged to have, among other acts, agreed to
kill all the Tutsis in Kibuye Prefecture, and to have ordered
Tutsi men, women and children to seek refuge in the catholic
Church, the stadium, and Home St. Jean Complex in Kibuye Town,
with the knowledge that these locations would be attacked during
the genocide.
</P>
<P>
The Office of The Prosecutor investigators have doggedly
tracked Bagilishema for the past three years, during which
warrants for his arrest were issued to the governments of Zambia,
Australia, South Africa and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Bagilishema's surrender and transfer bring the total number of
indictees in the tribunal's custody to 35, most of them
high-ranking political, military and media leaders in Rwanda at
the time of the genocide.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three new judges were sworn in Monday. A ceremony
for it took place in the newly constructed third courtroom, which
make it possible for three trials to progress simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR was created by the United Nations Security Council in
November 1994 to bring to justice the leading architects fo the
genocide.

<HEADLINE> Romania and Bulgaria on Kosovo Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The escalation and the
internationalization of the Kosovo armed conflict would have very
serious consequences for Serbia and for the whole area as well, a
release of the press office of Romania's Presidency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, consultations by phone took place
between Romania's President Emil Constantinescu and his Bulgarian
counterpart Petar Stoyanov on Sunday and Monday. After these
consultations, the two presidents decided to address a joint
letter to Slobodan Milosevic, President of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents reaffirmed in the letter the fact that the
peaceful and lasting solution to the Kosovo conflict is a major
interest not only of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, but also
of the neighbouring countries, and first of all of Romania and
Bulgaria, the support Romania and Bulgaria did not cease to grant
to the efforts of the Contact Group for finding some political
ways that should guarantee both the sovereignty and the
territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and
the observance of the rights of all ethnic communities in the
region.
</P>
<P>
To support the must of a peaceful solution to the Kosovo
conflict, the two presidents said Romania and Bulgaria were
convinced that to accept a political agreement to resolve the
Kosovo crisis is not only the single reasonable way to stop a
dangerous escalation of clashes, but also the only guarantee to
safeguard the territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Presidents Constantinescu and Stoyanov requested President
Milosevic to endorse this political agreement as a whole, with the
belief that it was the only solution that guaranteed the major
interests of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the fundamental
rights of all citizens in Serbia and the common cause of peace in
the Balkans at the same time.

MOSCOW, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze announced Monday that his country will withdraw from
the Collective security Treaty of the Commonwealth of Independent
States.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot minister said here on
Monday that Egypt is the gate for exports to the Middle East and
North Africa.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Minister of Commerce, Industry and Tourism Nicos
Rolandis made the remarks during his talks with Egyptian Minister
of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili on means of bolstering trade,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
There are more trade opportunities in Egypt after the country
created a number of free trade zones to attract foreign investment
and forge joint projects for export to the markets in the
aforesaid two regions, Rolandis said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has set up six free trade zones in Cairo, Alexandria,
Ismailia, Suez, Port Said and Damietta.
</P>
<P>
Noting the geographical proximity between Egypt and Cyprus,
Rolandis said that it would help facilitate trade exchange and
enable Cyprus to market and promote Egyptian products in the
European markets.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili expressed regret over the low level of the trade volume
between the two countries, saying that although trade exchange
more than doubled last year compared to the previous year, it
still remains weak.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between Egypt and Cyprus did not exceed 72
million U.S. dollars last year, with Egypt's exports amounting to
32 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's exports to Cyprus include cotton products, edible oil,
oil by-products, iron, furniture, aluminum products, clothes, fish
and leather and imports include paper, shoes, filters and water
turbines.

<HEADLINE> Israel Satisfied at Admittance to EU Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
Ariel Sharon expressed Monday his satisfaction at the decision of
the Council of Ministers of the European Union (EU) to let Israel
participate in its fifth program for research and development.
</P>
<P>
The council voted 15 to 14 in Luxembourg on Monday to allow
Israel to participate in the program, which will unveil in March.
</P>
<P>
Several EU members in the past have voiced objections to
Israel's participation in the program, which is worth about 15
billion U.S. dollars over the next four years, due to its dragging
policy towards the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel has in the past five months held constant talks with the
EU over this issue.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said Israel viewed the decision as a proof that Israel
and the EU share common interests and as an indication of the EU's
confidence in Israel's scientific and technological capabilities,
according to Israeli Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also noted that both the European Parliament and the
Council of Ministers have accepted Israel's stance against the
politicization of research and development.
</P>
<P>
The decision underscores Israel's determination to promote
technological cooperation on the basis of mutual considerations,
interests and benefits, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Israel will pay about 45 million U.S. dollars annually to join
this program. But this will be worthwhile to Israel because its
research institutions and companies can participate in various
European research programs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Refuses to Step Aside in Jones Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge Monday
refused to step aside and let another judge decide whether to cite
President Bill Clinton for contempt over his testimony in the
Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said a conservative
legal group did not provide sufficient grounds for why she should
remove herself.
</P>
<P>
Wright had offered to consider stepping aside because of her
contact with a House impeachment case prosecutor and because her
law clerk provided House managers with an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
The only request that Wright step aside came from Judicial
Watch, a legal group representing Dolly Kyle Browning, a witness
in Mrs. Jones' case who said she had an affair with Clinton before
he became president.
</P>
<P>
Judicial Watch said that Wright could be a witness against the
president and that her stepping aside now would eliminate one
ground for possible appeal later.
</P>
<P>
Wright is considering a contempt charge against Clinton over
his remarks about his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky. The president said in a 1998 deposition that he
did not have a sexual relationship with Lewinsky. He later
acknowledged an "inappropriate relationship" with her.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Wright dismissed Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment
lawsuit. The judge said she waited to address the contempt issue
because of the president's impeachment trial and an appeal of Mrs.
Jones' case.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Jones' case ended in an 850,000 U.S. dollar settlement in
December last year.
</P>
<P>
The punishment for contempt can range from a reprimand to a
fine or jail.
</P>
<P>
On February 12, the U.S. Senate ended the impeachment trial
against Clinton and declared acquittal of the president.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, was
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with Lewinsky. The
two articles were approved by the House along partisan lines on
December 19 last year.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Protest Against EU Farm Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A four-day marathon farm
minister council of the European Union was preluded on Monday by a
protest of more than 30,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>
The farm ministers from the 15 union member states are
scheduled to discuss from Monday through Thursday price reductions
of agricultural products, by as much as 15 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Their effort is part of a reform program known as the Agenda
2000 aimed to improve the 35-year-old Common Agricultural Policy
(CAP) of the bloc.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the union,
described the CAP reform as the future of EU agriculture while
European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said that the EU
had no other way out but to gear via reform its CAP toward
expansion and not contraction.
</P>
<P>
He said that without reform EU farmers would have to prepare
for their main competitors in the next century from intervention
stocks from within their own countries instead of from
third-country markets.
</P>
<P>
The CAP reform would not affect adversely the EU farmers nor
would it cause a third of the farmers to lose their way of living
as had been suggested, said the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
But the protesting farmers, mostly from neighboring France and
Germany joined by those from Italy, Spain and Belgium,
demonstrated their disgruntle with the reform program by clashing
with some 5,000 policemen and gendarmes deployed to keep the
protesters away from the European Union headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Police had to use tear gas and water cannons to disperse and
bring under control the protesters as some vented their anger by
breaking the windows along the 5-kilometer streets reserved for
their demonstration march.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 people including 13 policemen got light injuries
from thrown objects during the clashes and police made 12 arrests.
Brussels authorities estimated that the damage caused by the
protesters was around 125,000 euro (137,500 U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Reach Agreement on Steel Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Russia have reached a tentative agreement on limiting Russian
exports of steel to the U.S., Commerce Secretary William Daley
announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
Daley said Russia agreed to curb exports of hot-rolled steel to
the United States to 1996 levels, and agreed to limit other steel
product exports to the United States to 1997 levels.
</P>
<P>
In return, the United States agreed to suspend an anti-dumping
case against Russian steel imports. The deal is subject to a
public comment period, the Commerce Department said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department made a preliminary determination in
the dumping case against hot-rolled steel from Russia and set
preliminary duties ranging from 71 percent to 218 percent. Those
duties would be suspended when the deal becomes final.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the annual quota for Russian hot-rolled
steel would be 750,000 tons per year, about 78 percent below 1998
import levels. The proposed suspension agreement also establishes
a minimum price range of 255 to 280 U.S. dollars per ton.
</P>
<P>
The department said that in light of a dramatic surge of
Russian hot-rolled steel imports in 1998, the agreement imposes a
six-month moratorium on imports of hot-rolled steel products from
Russia.
</P>
<P>
The department said that as a result of the moratorium, Russian
hot-rolled steel exports to the United States will be less than
345,000 tons in 1999, about 90 percent less than 1998 export
levels. It said a final agreement could be signed by the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration ruled on February 12 that Japan and
Brazil had illegally dumped hot-rolled steel in the United States
at prices as much as 70 percent below normal, and said that it
would impose enormous penalty tariffs on their products to protect
the domestic steel industry.

<P>
CAIRO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Oil Minister Hamdi
el-Banbi said on Monday that he is to hold talks with Turkish
officials on exporting Egypt's natural gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
El-Banbi made the remarks ahead of his visit to Turkey on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He described Turkey as an ideal market for Egypt's gas, saying
the issue was discussed during a summit between Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak and his Turkish counterpart Suleiman Demirel in
Ankara last month.
</P>
<P>
He said that an initial agreement has been reached among the
Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation, American oil company Amoco
and Turkey's Totas company to export Egypt's liquefied gas to
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The liquefied gas would be transported to Turkey by super
tankers, el-Banbi said.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study is underway to extend a 1,200-kilometer
pipeline from Port Said to Turkey in the Mediterranean Sea to pump
5 billion cubic meters of gas annually at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's proven natural gas reserves are estimated at 1.13
trillion cubic meters. Egypt has adopted a policy to control the
export of crude oil due to low prices in the world markets and
increase the export of natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Launches ECOWAS Travellers Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Central Bank governor
Kwabena Duffuor launched Monday a travelling check of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Accra, capital of
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Doffuor said that the launching of the travellers check marks
a significant milestone in the annals of the sub-region toward the
 realization of the cherished dream of a single monetary zone.
</P>
<P>
The checks are denominated in five, 10, 20, 50, 100 west
African Unit of Account (WAUA) and become regional legal tender
with immediate effect. The design of the check is indigenous to
the sub-region and includes the ECOWAS logo as well as the names
and flags of member countries, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The check, which is a regional instrument to facilitate trade,
tourism and cross-border transactions, was officially launched by
current chairman of ECOWAS, Nigerian leader Abdulsalami Abubakar
on October 30, last year during the last summit of the regional
body.
</P>
<P>
Duffuor reminded ECOWAS member countries to stick to the
criteria listed for macro-economic convergence in order to prepare
them fully toward a single currency unit.
</P>
<P>
They are the reduction in exchange rate variability to 10
percent a year, the reduction in inflation rate to a single
digit and the reduction in budget deficit and gross domestic
product ratios to five percent through 1998 and three percent by
2000.
</P>
<P>
Duffuor said a ceiling has been placed on central bank
financing of governments to 10 percent of the previous years'
revenue generated.
</P>
<P>
He said even though these might not be welcomed by some
governments, " these are the rules designed to guide domestic
policy makers in each member country toward the cherished goal of
a single currency in the sub- region."

<HEADLINE> Senior HK Official on Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people are now
much more aware of environmental problems and are expecting
something to be done about them, Rob Law, director of
environmental protection, said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing his department's work last year, Law said that the
increased public awareness was reflected in the number of total
pollution complaints received by the department, which represented
a 42 percent increase over 1997. By the same comparison, pollution
complaints handled by the department showed an increase of around
18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The total level of fines for pollution offenses had risen quite
dramatically over the last few years, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, he said, about 84 percent of customers
were satisfied with the overall operation of the Pollution
Complaint Hot Lines and the satisfaction rating for "One Stop Shop
" advice service was about 93 percent.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting some of the more significant achievements in 1998,
Law said the implementation of the Environmental Impact Assessment
Ordinance had received wide acclaim from international experts and
environmental authorities in many other countries.
</P>
<P>
During the year, he said, a complete ban on the importation
into Hong Kong of hazardous materials from developed countries was
introduced, Waste Reduction Framework Plan launched and Waste
Reduction Committee set up.
</P>
<P>
In addition, LPG Taxi Scheme had been endorsed, under which all
new taxis must use LPG from the end of next year and all existing
diesel taxis should also be phased out and replaced by LPG
vehicles within five years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Hong Kong also introduced additional roadside
monitoring stations and began publishing a new Roadside Air
Pollution Index, which is a world first and is certainly helping
to raise people's awareness of their air pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
After analyzing the causes of air pollution, Law put forward
new measures to solve this problem.
</P>
<P>
The measures include the complete ban of leaded petrol,
increasing penalties for smoky vehicle offenses, improving smoky
vehicle test and enforcement, implementing new controls on idling
vehicles, requiring retrofitting of diesel catalysts and
continuing to introduce the toughest emission standards for new
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
One of the most effective ways to ensure the limiting of the
growth in diesel vehicles in Hong Kong is to greatly expand rail
network, he added.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov told U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott
Tuesday that the use of force bypassing the U.N. Security Council
is "absolutely inadmissible."
</P>
<P>
"The use of force bypassing the charter-stipulated prerogatives
of the U.N. Security Council is absolutely inadmissible,"
Primakov's press secretary Tatyana Aristarkhova quoted him as
saying, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The talks dealt with the key aspects of Russian-American
relations, primarily in the sphere of disarmament and arms
control, Aristarkhova said.
</P>
<P>
"Primakov said that the inviolability of the ABM Treaty, the
corner stone of strategic stability, is of cardinal importance,"
the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
She said Primakov briefed the Americans on his government's
basic approaches to the attainment of economic stability in
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Primakov defended the 1999 budget, saying it is realistic and
creates all the necessary conditions for ensuring economic growth
and for settling all of the overdue social problems.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister spoke about the importance of reaching an
agreement with the International Monetary Fund on refinancing the
Russian debt on the earlier extended credits," Aristarkhova said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Kim Perrot, the starting
point guard for the two-time WNBA champion Houston Comets,
announced Monday she has been diagnosed with lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Perrot's illness has spread to her brain, causing several
tumors. The largest is located on the left side and will be
removed Wednesday. Radiation and chemotherapy will follow the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of the correct term that it's called, but it's a
rare form of lung cancer that is not caused from smoking," said
Perrot, who doesn't smoke.
</P>
<P>
"They don't know what caused it. I don't know what caused it."
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Perrot, who played four seasons overseas, has
been the Comets' floor general since making the team as a long
shot in Houston-area tryouts in 1997.
</P>
<P>
She averaged 8.5 points, 4.7 assists and finished second in
WNBA Defensive Player of the Year honors last season.
</P>
<P>
"The entire WNBA family is deeply saddened by the news of Kim's
illness," said Val Ackerman, WNBA president. "We know that her
personal resolve and competitiveness will help her in the fight
against this terrible disease."

<HEADLINE> About 150 Injured in Municipal Polls in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- About 150 people were injured in
clashes during the municipal elections in northwestern
Bangladesh's Sirajganj district Tuesday, sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Despite the incident and an opposition-sponsored countrywide
hartal (destructive strike) to resist the polls, the first day of
the three-day municipal elections in 136 of the 182 municipalities
across Bangladesh ended more or less peacefully
</P>
<P>
Voting in 18 out of a total of 930 polling centers were
postponed, mainly due to clashes among rival candidates and
snatching of ballot boxes, an Election Commission official said.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the elections, some 1,388,000 voters in 56
municipalities were expected to cast their votes to elect the
chairmen and commissioners of their respective cities.
</P>
<P>
Chief Election Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena told reporters
that the elections by and large was "peaceful" in all the
municipalities except for a few.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout was "quite good," he said.
</P>
<P>
But sources told Xinhua that the turnout was as low as 50
percent in certain municipalities in the south, and one person was
killed during pro- and anti-hartal conflicts in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four chairmen and 522 ward commissioners would be elected
on Tuesday, and elections will be held in 30 municipalities on
Wednesday, and in the remaining 50 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Some 75,000 security forces, including nearly two-thirds of the
police, have been deployed across the country to maintain law and
order during the elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition alliance, led by the major opposition
- the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, started their three-day hartal
Tuesday morning to resist the polls, vowing to foil the elections
if their four-point demand, including the resignation of the chief
election commissioner, was not met by the government.

<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Title favorite Brazil trounced
Hungary 6-0 to maintain an unbeaten record after two matches in
the King's Cup soccer tournament here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korea meanwhile battled back from two goals down in the
second half Tuesday to squeak out a 2-2 draw against the host
nation.
</P>
<P>
Alessandro Anatino put Brazil ahead in the 24th minute and
Victor Pinmeiro established a 2-0 first-half scoreline 10 minutes
later. The fiery young squad never looked back.
</P>
<P>
Captain Rodrigo Ramos put the match out of reach for the wrong-
footed Hungarians in the 66th minute. Ronaldo Moreira, Lucio
Santos and Luis Eduardo Schmidt padded the tally at will.
</P>
<P>
In the first match, Thai captain Kiatisuk Senamuang opened the
day's scoring in the 34th minute, taking a cross past the goal-
mouth from Thawatchai Damrong-Ongtrakul that slipped past three
DPR Korean defanders and tapping it in.
</P>
<P>
Chaichan Keawsen added a long shot for insurance in the 68th
minute. The Thais, who lost 1-4 in Sunday's opener to Brazil,
appeared to have the contest locked up.
</P>
<P>
But a free kick awarded to the DPR gave Kang Sun-il a chance to
narrow the margin and he shaved the left post to make it 2-1. Four
minutes later, Lee Hyok-chol drove past two Thais for the final
goal.
</P>
<P>
It was the second King's Cup draw for the DPR Koreans, who went
2-2 Sunday against Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Brazil faces DPR Korea and Thailand takes on Hungary in the
final round-robin play Thursday. The finals and third-place
decider are played Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Propose Lower Tax for Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The completely built-up cars
produced in Thailand may enjoy lower tax as the Industry Ministry
plans to propose that the product be categorized in the ASEAN
Industrial Cooperation (AICO) which calls for lower taxes for the
product of between zero and five percent.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the ministry's Office of Industrial Economics said
Tuesday that the proposal would be submitted during an Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Economic Ministers meeting to
be held in southern Thailand early next month.
</P>
<P>
The proposal is to be tabled before the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) goes into force in 2003. AICO is a program that pushes for
a sharp reduction in taxes in order to stimulate investment among
ASEAN members before AFTA enters into force.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is agreed at the upcoming meeting, it will be
discussed at an officials meeting to be held later this year,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The call for the tax reduction is aimed at stimulating
automobile industry in Asia which is now sluggish as well as
encouraging the use of cars built in the region.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is expected to benefit most as the country is
considered one of the automobile producing centers in the region.
</P>

"That depends upon the actions of the Serbs. What we need is
continued restraint. As I said, they've made a lot of progress.
They have these two big differences, each side having one
condition the other won't agree to. So we'll just have to see

CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said on Tuesday President Hosni Mubarak's visit to Italy
"was successful" and his talks with Italian leaders "were held in
a serious and warm climate."
</P>
<P>
The Italian side has shown "great interest" in Mubarak's views
on the issues on the agenda, the Middle East peace process in
particular, Moussa, who was accompanying Mubarak in the visit,
told Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
As part of the continued efforts to promote the bilateral ties,
Mubarak has invited Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema to
visit Egypt to further examine issues of joint interest, the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have also agreed to follow up the dialogs on
all issues and coordinate stances on the Egyptian-European Union
partnership, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak wrapped up a two-day visit to Italy on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Rome, Mubarak held talks with Italian
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and D'Alema on bilateral ties and
regional issues of common concern.
</P>

Italy is a key trade partner of Egypt. The trade volume between
the two countries stood at 2.3 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, with

RAMBOUILLET, France, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The outcome of the
Kosovo talks held here is still uncertain as Western and Russian

<P>
Nearly an hour after the deadline fixed by the Contact Group

province.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said after the
passing of the deadline that the Albanians had not yet given their
ultimate response.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks would not go beyond Tuesday, but would
be extended for hours in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Rubin confirmed that the Serb had agreed upon the political
wing of the peace plan, but have not "seriously committed" to the
military part of the plan, which includes the sending of up to 30,
000 NATO-led troops on a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs said that they accepted the political wing of the
peace plan only conditionally, because some changes had been made
in the text, including a hint that ethnic Albanians could hold a
self-determination referendum after a three-year interim period.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs reject a deployment of NATO troops in Kosovo, but
said a U.N.-auspiced force could be acceptable.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian delegation is apparently divided on the last day
of negotiations between the moderates and hard-liners representing
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), which sticks to its demand for
independence for Kosovo by demanding a referendum three years
later.
</P>
<P>
But all Western countries and Russia seem determined to make
the talks at least a half success and to push the two sides to
sign at least a partial agreement, in order to bring them to the
negotiation table again soon.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Western countries want to bring the negotiators
to another conference elsewhere in France in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
A partial agreement would mean a ceasefire and the postponement
of sending NATO troops to Kosovo and disarming the KLA, they added.
</P>
<P>
But Western diplomats estimate that it would be a major
concession by the Serbs if they agree to substantial autonomy in
the province.

BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Traffic police in Beijing have
vowed to enforce driving regulations after over 1200 people were
caught drunk driving in the five days prior to the Spring Festival,
while a further 325 were stopped for running red lights.
</P>
<P>
A major crack-down will see police monitor the capital's 200
major road intersections and 150 major streets in the suburbs in a
bid to curb dangerous driving.
</P>
<P>
According to traffic regulations, people who are caught driving
after drinking alcohol are liable to a fine of 50 yuan (about six
U.S. dollars) and be banned for three months. Serious drunk
driving will lead to a maximum of 15 days police detention, a fine
of 200 yuan (about 24 U.S. dollars), and a driving ban of six
months.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has 1.35 million automobiles and more than two
million people have driving licenses.
</P>
<P>
Last year, according to official statistics, there were more
than 35,000 traffic accidents in the capital in which over 1,400
people died. Violations of traffic regulations were the main cause
for most of the accidents.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Tuesday that "a lot of progress" has been achieved at the
Kosovo peace talks outside Paris but that "there are still some
important disagreements."
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on the Serbs and ethnic Albanians to exercise
restraint and hoped for a resolution Tuesday. Asked if he would
extend the deadline for their negotiations, Clinton said, "That's
up to the parties."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said there were problems on both sides of the talks.
The Serbs have refused to agree to a NATO-led force to police any
peacekeeping agreement. The Albanians want assurances of an
autonomy referendum after three years.
</P>
<P>
"And neither side will agree to the other's position on that, "
he said. "And so we're working through that today, hoping for a
resolution."
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke with reporters during a meeting with Democratic
and Republican congressional leaders. The meeting opened as the
deadline passed for the Kosovo talks.
</P>
<P>
Even so, Clinton said, "they've made a lot of progress and they
don't need to let this thing get away from them. We'll keep
watching it. And I expect there will be more news on it as the day
breaks."
</P>
<P>
"I think there will some sort of resolution about where to go
from here Tuesday. And we'll just have to see," Clinton said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Jackie Joyner-Kersee of the
United States will lose her 1988 heptathlon world record of 7,291
points at the end of the year because of a design change to the
javelin, one of the seven heptathlon events.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF, track's governing body, said Monday that a new
javelin will go into use on April 1. The new world record will be
recognized on January 1, 2000, using the new javelin, which will
land more often on its tip but not travel as far as the old one.
</P>
<P>
The current women's javelin record also will be erased. The
IAAF made a similar change to the men's javelin in 1986, wiping
out Uwe Hohn's throwing record.
</P>
<P>
However, Daley Thompson's decathlon record of 8,847 points --
set with the same javelin -- was allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Joyner-Kersee retired last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of 300-day
countdown to Macao's handover, some local celebrities said that
preparations for Macao's return to the motherland are pressing and
that Macao people should make concerted efforts to ensure Macao's
smooth transition and a steady transfer of power.
</P>
<P>
Kou Hoi In, director of Youth Committee under the Macao Chamber
of Commerce, said that Macao young people, who are lucky to live
in a new historical era, should have a strong awareness of social
responsibilities and take an active part in organizing the Macao
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"Youth in Macao should make greater efforts to publicize the
Macao Basic Law and ensure a steady transfer of power in Macao. In
addition, they are duty bound to bring about social prosperity and
economic expansion in Macao," Kou said.
</P>
<P>
Ng Si Meng, director of the Macao Association of Neighborhood
Communities, said that preparations for establishing the Macao SAR
are demanding now that only 300 days are left before the handover.
</P>
<P>
"The urgent work at present is to produce the 200-member
Selection Committee which will elect the first chief executive of
the Macao SAR on the basis of overall interests of Macao," Ng Si
Meng said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that both Chinese and Portuguese sides should
make more contacts and consultations with good consideration about
Macao's long-term interest and bilateral relations in handling
well remaining problems during the final stage of Macao's
transitional period.
</P>
<P>
Lo Pak Sam, chairwoman of the Macao Women's Federation, said
that the various kinds of work to organize the SAR have been well
underway since the Preparatory Committee for the Macao SAR was
established nine months ago.
</P>
<P>
"Macao people's enthusiastic application for membership of the
Selection Committee is a good proof that Macao residents aspire to
be masters of their own fate, which will lay a solid foundation
for electing the first chief executive," she said.
</P>
<P>
Charles C. Y. Chen, director of the Macao Association of
Returned Overseas Chinese, said that many Chinese used to live in
humiliation overseas. "Macao's return to the motherland is
something like a traveling man returning to his mother," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the returned overseas Chinese in Macao will
actively participate in the affairs concerning the establishment
of the SAR and create a more promising future under the leadership
of the first chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Kun Sai Hoi, director of the Macao Association of Civil
Servants, said that civil servants, who are part of local
residents, will also contribute to founding the Macao SAR. The
association will hold varied activities to enhance the awareness
of civil servants about their responsibilities in the course of
handover.
</P>
<P>
"Being a vital force to exercise 'Macao people governing Macao',
civil servants are ready to make concerted efforts with other
residents to ensure Macao's smooth return," Kun Sai Hoi said.

Macao, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here this afternoon that China will unswervingly carry out the "
one country, two systems" principle in Macao and implement well
the Macao Basic Law in the future Special Administrative Region (
SAR).
</P>
<P>
Wang Qiren, director of the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch,
made the remark at a grand reception to mark the new spring. Some
1,500 people attended the reception.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that Macao will achieve smooth transition
and steady transfer of power with the guidance of the 'one country,
two systems' principle and the Macao Basic Law, with continued
cooperation between China and Portuguese, and with the concerted
efforts of the Macao people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The director said that the Chinese government will resume
sovereignty over Macao in 300 days. "Although there are some
historical and current problems which are in dire need of
settlement, the overall trend is that Macao continues to move
toward a smooth transition."
</P>
<P>
"In the upcoming 300 days, we will go on to address ourselves
to various issues in Macao's transitional period. In particular,
we should do a good work in the construction of the Macao SAR and
preparations for the handover ceremony and relevant celebrating
activities," Wang Qiren said.

At the reception, Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira said that
the new year will bring about new outlook in Macao.

Joint Declaration 12 years ago to resolve the Macao question.
Since that time, the two countries have been working in a peaceful
atmosphere, and such an atmosphere will be carried on in the
future.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt that China and Portugal have been sharing
friendship, and have been making efforts to safeguard Macao's
benefits and stability with mutual understanding, the governor

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The 23rd Hong Kong
International Film Festival (HKIFF) to be held between March 31
and April 15 will feature record-breaking 301 films worldwide with
339 screenings, the Provisional Urban Council (PUC), the organizer,
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the details of the HKIFF, Jennifer Chow Kit-bing,

</P>
<P>
One of the sections of the HKIFF will be the Hong Kong Cinema
Retrospective Section with the special topic of "Hong Kong New
Wave - Twenty Years After", Chow said.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong New Wave takes 1979 as the landmark year when a
host of directors broke out of television to make their first
cinema features. With their innovation and acuteness, they
produced modern and realistic movies.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Cinema Retrospective will feature these directors'
representative movies such as "Jumping Ash", "The Butterfly
Murders", "The Secret", "Nomad", and "Lonely Fifteen".
</P>
<P>
Another section will be the Asian Cinema section. Apart from
installing an International Film Critics Federation award for
young Asian cinema to commend a quality film, the HKIFF, together
with the Hong Kong Arts Center, co-present "The Age of
Independents: New Asian Film &AMP; Video" to promote independent
spirits: low cost but innovative productions.
</P>
<P>
Apart from these, a new section "Director-in-Focus: Johnnie To"
under the Hong Kong Panorama 98-99 and "Born in Hong Kong" will be
added, Chow said.
</P>
<P>
Two special topics, namely, "Director-in-Focus: Kurosawa
Kiyoshi" and "A Tribute to Asian Documentary Film Makers: Haneda
Sumiko &AMP; Christine Choy" will also be featured.
</P>
<P>
This year, the film festival is further enriched with the
addition of "Kinderfest" to be presented during the Easter
Holidays, especially for kids and their families.
</P>
<P>
To encourage youth participation in film appreciation, three
free student previews have been specially arranged for middle
school students.
</P>
<P>
The popular outdoor film shows will continue and will be
offered free. Apart from film activities, HKIFF will also stage
free activities such as exhibitions and seminars.
</P>
<P>
This year, there are slight changes in film screening time to
facilitate audience to have more time to meet the film-makers
before or after screenings.

GUANGZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Spring Festival travelers
helped break records at Guangzhou's Baiyun Airport on Sunday when
511 aircraft carrying a total of 43,000 passengers took off or
landed during the day.
</P>
<P>
The highest passenger figures in 36 years is attributed to the
sharp increase in the number of people returning home after
visiting relatives or traveling during the Lunar New Year
celebrations, which fell on February 16 this year.

<P>
And on Monday a further 235 airplanes took off and 241 landed

</P>
<P>
According to the airport administration, many of the aircraft
which landed in Guangzhou, capital of southern Guandong province,
were from southwestern parts of China. Other popular departure
points included tourism resorts such as Haikou, capital of the
island province of Hainan in south China; Guilin, one of the most

<HEADLINE> Romania Hypes Eclipse to Promote Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Romania's National Tourism
Authority this week started a media campaign to promote "Eclipse
1999 - a life-time adventure" by broadcasting an advertisement on
the Eurosport and Discovery television channels.
</P>
<P>
The country has recently published a tourist map, offering
information about 89 of Romania's 725 hotels deemed as meeting
European standards.
</P>
<P>
The total sun eclipse, to occur at mid-day on August 11, 1999,
is a good opportunity for Romania to re-launch its tourism
publicity, said a report of the national Rompres news agency.
</P>
<P>
It has been estimated that the astronomical event in August
could attract to Romania about 500,000 - 1,000,000 foreign
tourists, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The climax of the eclipse will occur near the southern town of
Rimnicu-Vilcea and the maximum width of the band of totality (112
km) will also be observed in Romania. The coastal city of Mangalia
will have a probability as high as 83 percent of eyeing the
eclipse on a clear sky.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the eclipse is important to Romania because
Bucharest will be the only European capital that is located on the
central line of the band of totality.
</P>
<P>
The eclipse will occur in the middle of the tourism season. Its
band of totality will cover areas including all relief forms from
mountains, hills, plains to the Black Sea shore.
</P>
<P>
The next total solar eclipse visible in Romania will not occur
until May 6, 2,236.

<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Tuesday welcomed an announcement by
South Korea of amnesties for 17 long-term political prisoners and
demanded that they be allowed to join their families.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK also asked South Korea to hand over three of the 17
prisoners, who have already been released, to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to his Seoul counterpart Chung Won Shik, Jang Jae
On, chairman of the DPRK Red Cross, said their release was belated,
"but we welcome the announcement."
</P>
<P>
He said the return of the detainees would be "an important
turning point in opening the door to a wide range of contacts and
in bringing about a thaw in the frozen inter-Korean relations."
</P>
<P>
South Korea on Monday announced the release of 17 long-term
political prisoners in an amnesty for 8,812 prisoners to celebrate
Thursday's first anniversary of the administration of President
Kim Dae Jung.
</P>
<P>
The 17 prisoners, who refused to sign their names on South
Korean relevant documents, have served between 28 and 41 years.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's Justice Ministry said the 17 political prisoners
no longer pose serious threat to national security, because of
their advanced ages, but will remain under surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Park Sang Cheon Monday left unanswered the
question of whether any of the 17 prisoners would be returned to
the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Makes Progress in Mine Clearance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The number of Cambodia's
mine deaths and injured people has declined to just more than 100
a month since 1994 as a result of reduced hostilities and the hard
work of Cambodian Mine Action Center (CMAC), according to the
statistics available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sam Sotha, director general of CMAC, was quoted by the Vision
as saying that Cambodia is one of the most mined areas in the
world and at least 500 people were killed or maimed by mines each
month between 1991 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
"This figure has shown a gradual decline to just more than 100
since 1994 as a result of reduced hostilities and this figure may
decline even further with the complete end to hostilities in
Cambodia," he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, CMAC has to date cleared 90,000 land
mines and has destroyed up to 500,000 unexploded ordnance (UXO)
and has also collected some 200 million pieces of mines, bullet
shells and other shrapnel during the mine clearing activities.
</P>
<P>
CMAC is working hard to achieve zero casualties from mines in
the near future and undertakes a multi-pronged effort to identify
mined areas. It also launches extensive mine awareness programs at
all levels.
</P>
<P>
According to CMAC, more than two decades of civil war and
strife in Cambodia has caused more than 13,000 deaths and up to
100,000 people amputees in mine-related incidents.
</P>
<P>
Documents obtained here show that land mines were first laid in
1967 and the number of land mines increased drastically during the
bloody civil war between four armed factions since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia and Thailand signed a joint press statement Monday to
commit to freeing the border areas of mines within three years.

BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea rallied strongly from 2-0 down in the second
half and drew a 2-2 tie with the hosts Thailand in the King's Cup
soccer tournament here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's favored Under-20 side faced Hungary in the day's
second match in the four-nation, week-long event.
</P>
<P>
Thailand jumped to a 1-0 lead when captain Kiatisuk Senamuang
scored in the 34th minute, taking a cross past the goal-mouth from
Thawatchai Damrong-Ongtrakul that slipped past three defenders and
tapping it in.
</P>
<P>
Chaichan Keawsen lifted the hosts to 2-0 with a long shot in
the 68th minute. The Thais, who lost 1-4 in Sunday's opener to
Brazil, appeared to have the contest locked up.
</P>
<P>
But a free kick awarded to the DPR Koreans gave Kang Sun-il a
chance to narrow the margin and he shaved the left post to make it
2-1. Four minutes later, Lee Hyok-chol drove past two Thais for
the final goal.
</P>
<P>
It was the second King's Cup draw for the DPR Koreans, who went
also 2-2 Sunday against Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Brazil faces DPR Korea and Thailand takes on Hungary in the
final round-robin play Thursday. The finals and third-place

<HEADLINE> Six Wounded in Fresh Clash in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Six people were wounded
Tuesday when Serb police and ethnic Albanians clashed with
automatic weapons and mortars in the troubled Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out when Serb police officers entered the
village of Bukos to investigate an attack the night before in
which a Serb civilian was killed and two others injured, the
Yugoslav Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Five Serb police officers and a Yugoslav photographer for the
Associated Press were injured when Serb police and the separatist
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) exchanged fire in Bukos, some 25
kilometers northwest of Pristina, according to Tanjug.
</P>
<P>
Zoran Andjelkovic, the Serbian president of Kosovo's interim
government, accused "Albanian terrorists" of launching the "
terrorist attack" as the peace talks in Rambouillet, France, were
approaching the end.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from Rambouillet, France, said that the Kosovo
peace talks deadline of 1400 GMT Tuesday passed with the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians appearing deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
While the talks were going on, "Albanian terrorists" have
repeatedly attacked civilians, policemen and service men to
provoke Serb Police to counterattack to give foreign forces
excuses to intervene in the Kosovo matter, Andjelkovic said in a
statement released to the press in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The Tuesday attack was an "additional attempt by the Albanian
terrorists and separatists to increase media pressure on the
decision-making day at Rambouillet," he said.

<HEADLINE> EDS- Tianjin-Jixian-Greening Tianjin's Back Garden Woos Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The nurturing of scenic
forests and a major "greening" program over the last decade has
transformed Jixian County, to the northwest of Tianjin, into a
tourist haven which is now hailed as the back garden of north
China's largest port city.
</P>
<P>
More than 92 million yuan (about 11 million U.S. dollars) have
been spent on forestry projects resulting in some 12 million trees
being planted covering more than one third of the county, which is
also Tianjin's primary water resource.
</P>
<P>
Successful in both ecological and economic terms, Jixian region
also acts as a green belt between Tianjin and Beijing and villages
throughout the county are enjoying the benefits of the
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the project, water and soil erosion are now under
control in 80 percent of the county's areas and mud silting in the
Yuqiao Reservoir has been reduced by more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Part of the program has also involved planting trees along 112
kilometers of railway embankments, 323 kilometers of roads, and
200 kilometers of irrigation ditches within the county boundaries.
</P>
<P>
Over one million tourists from home and abroad visited Jixian
Country last year bringing in 31.5 million yuan (about 3.8 million
U.S. dollars) of income.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Commander Calls for Defending Motherland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Yugoslav general on Tuesday
urged officers and men to fulfill the sacred task of defending
their motherland at the current critical moment, the Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to officers and soldiers stationed at
Pristina, capital of the Kosovo Province, Third Corps Commander
Webojsa Pavkovic said Western powers now attempt to occupy Kosovo,
the cradle of Serbian civilization, while ethnic Albanian
separatists plot to separate Kosovo from Serbia and merge into
Albania.
</P>
<P>
In the past, "many foreign invaders occupied Kosovo and
enslaved our ancestors, but they eventually left defeated," he
recalled. "Now, some people again are trying to impose war on us."
</P>
<P>
Pavkovic called on the soldiers to defend the glory and dignity
of Serbia and keep on fighting till victory.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Dragoljub Djdanic, chief of the General Staff of the
Yugoslav armed forces, told the Third Corps that the defense of
Kosovo is "of utmost national interest to Yugoslavia" and the
Yugoslav armed forces stand ready to defend the Serbian province "
at all costs."
</P>
<P>
"If we lose Kosovo, we lose Serbia, the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia and the most sacred thing cherished in the hearts of
the Yugoslav people -- freedom," Djdanic said.
</P>
<P>
The international community is pressing Serbia and the ethnic
Albanians to agree to an interim autonomy deal by Tuesday
afternoon to end a year of conflict in the southern Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
NATO is threatening air strikes against Yugoslav military
targets if the Serbs, who are resisting the deployment of NATO
troops, which the West deems essential to implement a deal, do not
back down.

<HEADLINE> HK Customs Officers Seize Pirated Discs at Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Customs and
Excise Department announced here Tuesday that Customs officers at
the airport last Monday seized a large quantity of pirated optical
discs worth about 2 million HK dollars (256,410 U.S. dollars) from
a cargo arriving from Malaysia via Singapore,
</P>
<P>
The case came to light in the afternoon last Monday when
Customs officers examined the cargo declared to have contained
blank recordable discs.
</P>
<P>
The officers, however, found 86,000 pirated VCDs of Japanese
drama series, 19,000 pirated MP3 discs and television game discs
as well as 57 disc replication stampers.
</P>
<P>
"No arrest has so far been made and inquiries by Customs
Intellectual Property Investigation Bureau (IPIB) are continuing,"
said a spokesman for the Customs and Excise Department (CED).
</P>
<P>
In another anti-piracy operation on Monday, the IPIB officers
raided five shops selling pirated optical discs on Hong Kong
Island. As a result, they seized more than 540,000 HK dollars
(69,231 U.S. dollars) worth of pirated optical discs and arrested
five people in connection with the seizure.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that Customs officers last year seized 39
million pirated optical discs worth 1 billion HK dollars (128
million U.S. dollars) and arrested 1,561 suspects.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the officers seized 1.16 million pirated
optical discs with a market value of 21 million HK dollars (2.69
million U.S. dollars) and arrested 162 suspects, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Copyright Ordinance, anyone who is found
importing or selling any pirated articles is liable to prosecution
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for the offense is a fine of 50,000 HK
dollars (6,410 U.S. dollars) per disc and four years'
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The on-going anti-piracy operations demonstrate the
government's determination and full commitment in combating piracy
activities and preserving the good image of Hong Kong, the
spokesman added.

WASHINGTON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in U.S. leading newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Kosovo peace talks were on the verge of breakdown Monday
night, as five delegates from the ethnic Albanian guerrillas
refused the exhortations of Secretary of State Albright to sign an
agreement and were not persuaded by a last-ditch visit from the
NATO Commander, Gen. Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Intelligence Agency began placing American spies
on teams of United Nations weapons inspectors in Iraq only a year
after the end of the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and worked closely
with the United Nations to organize the inspections, a former arms
inspector says.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- At least half the nation's Republican governors are ready to
endorse the presidential nomination of George W. Bush and, in a
preemptive show of force, may declare themselves in favor of the
Texas governor as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
-- Levi Strauss &AMP;Co. Monday succumbed to the pressure of
sagging sales and changing fashions by deciding to shutter half of
its U.S. plants, fine nearly 6,000 workers and transfer their jobs
overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- Russia agreed to voluntarily limit shipments of hot-rolled
steel to the U.S., avoiding antidumping duties.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Privatization in Winding-Up Stage: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's privatization program
is in its winding up stage after the successful sale of about 84
percent state-owned enterprises, a Zambian Privatization Agency
(ZPA) official has said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month, out of 280 state enterprises in the
working portfolio of the ZPA, 236 companies have been privatized
since the ZPA was established in 1992, Senior Public Relations
Officer at the agency, Jane Shamwana told Xinhua in a recent
interview here.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ZPA has realized 70 million U.S. Dollars from
the sale of companies while investors have assumed more than 45
million Dollars of liabilities and about the same amount was
committed by the investors in investment pledges.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the ZPA, the majority of
the companies privatized so far are performing well due to massive
investments poured into them by various new owners. Only three
percent of state-owned enterprises sold since the start of the
privatization program in July 1992 have not performed well.
</P>
<P>
The privatization program in Zambia records a low failure rate
compared with other countries, Shamwana asserted.
</P>
<P>
She noted that privatization remains one of the key elements of
the Zambian government's economic reform program, which is based
on a political decision with wide ranging economic consequences.
</P>
<P>
Under Zambia's 1999 budget, a key feature of the privatization
program will be the new policy guidelines on private sector
participation in strategic fields of the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government intends to offer a minority
share-holding of 20 percent in the Zambia Telecommunications
Company to a private strategic partner which will help revitalize
the company.
</P>
<P>
The government also intends to float some shares of the Zambia
National Commercial Bank on the Lusaka Stock Exchange as part of a
comprehensive policy to divest its share-holding in the bank.
</P>
<P>
Shamwana also explained how the privatization program was being
 implemented in line with the Privatization Act, saying that
transparency was paramount in the implementation of a successful
privatization program.
</P>
<P>
One of the ways in which transparency at the ZPA had been
achieved was through constant contact with the general public
which provided anyone with the opportunity to ask questions on any
issue they are not comfortable with or unclear about, she said.
</P>
<P>
The ZPA official said that through various fora held around the
country and press briefings addressed by the chief executives or
the technical directors, the public had been able to have direct
contact with those entrusted with the privatization program and
their suspicions and queries on certain transactions were cleared
and answered.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from fora and press briefings, we circulate extensively
monthly privatization reports to the general public while as a
matter of statutory requirement we publish a bi-annually progress
report which is sent to parliament. We have radio and television
programs and other information leaflets," she said.
</P>
<P>
The Privatization Act of 1992 was one of the innovations that
the government put into place to start the process of divestiture.
 The Act establishes the ZPA which, among other objectives, plans,
implements and controls the privatization program in the southern
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Act gives guidelines on the mode of sale of an enterprise
tranched for privatization.
</P>
<P>
Then comes the Companies Act which has been extremely useful in
the commercial transactions that the ZPA has done so far.

<HEADLINE> E. Africa Disaster '99 Conf Opens in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The first East Africa
Conference on Disaster Management opened here Tuesday, with the
aim of raising awareness and making practical recommendations to
improve disaster preparedness and coordination among the three
states -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the United Nations Center for Human Settlements
(Habitat) and the International Federation of the Red Cross, more
than 120 professionals will at the two-day meeting discuss local,
regional and global issues which affect the safety and
profitability of businesses.
</P>
<P>
Topics on the agenda include vulnerability analysis of
businesses, business lessons from the August 7, 1998 Nairobi bomb
blast, business preparedness for a disaster, protection of
logistics lifelines, and the role of emergency response service
and etc.
</P>
<P>
Participants noted that industry leaders needed practical
solutions to prevent, manage and recover from disasters, be they a
fire, flood, toxic leak, earthquake, gas explosion, bomb blast or
others.
</P>
<P>
Following the tragedy befalling Nairobi on August 7 last year,
much attention has been focused on the terrible loss of life and
the thousands injured. The bomb blast also caused other losses to
numerous businesses and their day-to-day operations, which need to
be addressed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, F. Lyons, resident
representative of the U.N. Development Program (UNDP) said that
being prepared is not only good for businesses but also benefits
all the people.
</P>
<P>
International studies indicate that on average only 30 percent
of companies are still in operations within three years of a major
disaster.

Taliban authorities, U.N. sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is scheduled to pay a one-day visit to Kandahar,

<HEADLINE> 5 Killed, 20 Injured in Riot in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Five people were killed and 20
others were injured in a fresh riot which erupted in Ambon,
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hospital sources told Antara News Agency that one of the dead
victims was hit by bullets of security officers.
</P>
<P>
The disturbance was preceded by powerful explosions and
followed by the burning of tens of houses in Batu Merah Dalam
village at about 11:30 a.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, the act of house-burning was
then spreading to other parts of the city. Three units of the fire
brigade could not enter the spot because of the dead-roads.
</P>
<P>
Ambon was rocked by clashes between Muslims and Christians on
January 19. The rioting claimed over 100 lives and damaged
thousands of buildings as well as scores of vehicles worth more
than 500 billion rupiah (58.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the latest outbreak of violence in Maluku, at least 11
people were killed and 43 others wounded on February 14. The
violence hit the two islands of Haruku and Saparua. It was
reported that the clash was between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a home-made bomb went off in southeastern Saparua
Island near Ambon Island, killing one person and injuring another.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Official Refutes Reported Riots in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the southern
Iraqi province of Dhi-Qar on Tuesday refuted news reports that
there were riots recently in the center and suburbs of the
province.
</P>
<P>
These reports were "hostile" and "bogus and brazen lies," said
Ahmed Abdullah, quoted by the Iraqi News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Reports of riots in the Iraqi province, 320 kilometers south of
Baghdad, came after Iraq's top Shiite cleric Mohammed Mohammed
Sadiq al-Sader and two of his sons were killed by unidentified
gunmen last Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sader, who was appointed the grand ayatollah by the
government to replace the late Abul Qassim al-Khoei in 1992,
enjoyed high respect among Shiites who comprise about 65 percent
of Iraq's 22 million population.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein and most of Iraqi senior officials
belong to the minority Sunni Muslims. Reports said many believed
Iraqi government was responsible for the killing because of
al-Sader's apparent break with Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The grand ayatollah had been outspoken over the past months and
tried to establish himself as an independent leader by calling on
Shiites to attend Friday prayers in mosques. Baghdad disapproves
of big crowd.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that angry Shiites turned violent in recent
days. However, Abdullah claimed that state offices and schools are
functioning as usual and people's daily life is very normal in
spite of the continued U.S.-British hostile shelling on civilian
and military targets in the province.
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S.-British air strikes, clashes
between the Iraqi air defense forces and U.S.-British warplanes
patrolling the no-fly zones have almost become daily occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The restricted zones were imposed by the U.S.-led allies
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Shiite Muslims in the south and the Kurds in the north from
Baghdad's suppression.

<HEADLINE> Knesset Approves New Israeli Financial Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset
(parliament) on Tuesday approved the nomination of the third
finance minister to the ruling Likud coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was passed by a vote of 57-11 in a special
session of the 120-seat Knesset.
</P>
<P>
Meir Shetreet, a popular member of the Likud party, was named
finance minister by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
Since Netanyahu came to power in 1996, two finance ministers in
his government have resigned over economic and political
differences with him.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who has been holding the finance portfolio since
former Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman resigned last December,
said he appointed Shetreet now because he is increasingly
occupied with his obligations as prime minister and candidate for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
Shetreet, who is now the whip of the coalition government,
will only serve three months as finance minister before national
elections are held on May 17.
</P>
<P>
Since Shetreet was an immigrant from Morocco, his appointment
may help Netanyahu win more support from Sephardic Jews in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Sephardic Jews, those with Middle Eastern or North African
roots, make up 50 percent of Israel's Jewish population and have
traditionally been Likud's supporters.
</P>
<P>
Since former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai left Likud last
month and became the first Sephardic Jew to run for the
premiership, Likud members have feared to lose the support of
Sephardic Jews to Mordechai's centrist party.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Not to Take Direct Part in NATO Air-strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Hungary will not directly
participate in threatened NATO air-strikes against Yugoslavia, the
Hungarian News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Foreign Minister Martonyi Janos told the newspaper
Monday that so far Hungary has not been approached to take part in
NATO's possible air-strikes.
</P>
<P>
However, the foreign minister said NATO can make use of the
country's territorial airspace according to a resolution adopted
by Hungary's parliament last year.
</P>
<P>
Certain technical requirements and regulations have to be met
for the use of Hungary's airspace, Martonyi stressed, adding that
NATO should notify the Hungarian government in advance if it has
such needs.
</P>
<P>
On NATO's peacekeeping activities in Kosovo, Martonyi said
there is a possibility for his country to send small medical and
technical teams to Macedonia, if parliament approves.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Urges Retaliatory Attack on Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani on Tuesday urged the Israeli Defense Force (IDF)
to strike Beirut in retaliation for the killing of Israeli
soldiers in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The minister said actions should be taken to avenge the deaths
of Israeli officers.
</P>
<P>
Three Israeli officers were killed and five others wounded by
Lebanese Hezbollah guerillas Monday night in the eastern sector of
the self-styled security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Among those killed was a 30-year-old Major Eitan Balahsan,
commander of the commando paratroop unit, which was operating
Monday night inside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas opened fire in a close range and their
attacks on the commando unit was apparently well prepared, an
Israeli military spokesman quoted IDF's north commanders as saying.
</P>
<P>
Four of the wounded were taken to Haifa's Rambam Hospital for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
The incident also fueled worries among Israeli politicians.
President Ezer Weizman and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are
scheduled to fly to Haifa to visit the wounded officers in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a border strip in south Lebanon as a security
zone in 1985 after two invasions, with a claimed aim of protecting
its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, military conflicts between Israeli troops and
Lebanese guerrillas have been going on in a "war of attrition."

<HEADLINE> EU Industrial Output Prices Down for 8 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The European Union industrial
output prices had been falling for eight months until the end of
1998, Eurostat reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
community said that the industrial output prices were down by 2.5
percent in the 11-nation euro zone and by 2.2 percent in the 15-
nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
The rate of decline had increased month by month, said Eurostat.
The industrial output prices are measured by their annual growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
The EU statistical bureau estimated that from December 1997 to
December 1998 the decline was to a large part due to a sharp fall
in prices in the manufacture of refined petroleum products, 18.7
percent in the euro zone and 19.2 percent in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Most other industrial activities also indicated falls in prices,
said Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
All EU member states except Luxembourg and Greece recorded
downward trends. Remarkable falls were recorded at 6.2 percent in
Portugal , 4.5 percent in Finland and 4.2 percent in France.

<P>
FUZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Work on repairing damaged water
conservation facilities in east China's Fujian Province, which has
included building new storm protection barriers, is almost
completed and officials say they are confident that they are
nearly ready to tackle any other floods this year.
</P>
<P>
The province suffered the most severe floods in almost one
hundred years in the summer of 1998, with many reservoirs, dams
and levees needing repair. This hilly province is also prone to
landslides as a result of flooding, which in the past have buried
residential areas and disrupted railway transport.
</P>
<P>
By February 15, the coastal province had invested 2.289 billion
yuan in rebuilding 13,663 water conservation facilities as well as
renovating 351 reservoirs and 154 sluice gates.
</P>
<P>
A total of 188 million work days have been spent on the
projects so far, another record for the province.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Offer Aid for Tanzania's Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government
will grant 20 million Canadian Dollars (about 13.4 million U.S.
Dollars) for the improvement of Tanzania's education level,
especially for that of girl students.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is to provide the aid in the coming
five years, a Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
official, Andrew McAlister, was quoted by Tuesday's Tanzanian
Daily News as saying.
</P>
<P>
McAlister, the Regional Director for Africa, the horn of Africa
and Middle East in CIDA, told the media in Ottawa recently ahead
of the state visit to Tanzania by Canada's Governor-General Romeo
LeBlanc, that Tanzania' s education has failed to keep with
changes brought about by economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The loss of student's potentials is being felt today as the
present curriculum is outdated, teaching materials are relatively
scarce, school buildings are in a generally unsatisfactory state
with most teachers' standard either substandard or outdated.
</P>
<P>
Adult literacy level in Tanzania, once considered an exemplary
model in Africa, has fallen back to 68 percent from almost 100
percent, and could continue to drop at a rate of some two percent
per annum, an economic advisor of European Union-delegation to
Tanzania, Alexander Baum, said in a report recently.
</P>
<P>
Teacher's morale is low and absenteeism is high among Tanzanian
teachers whose qualification and salary are poor, Baum noted.
</P>
<P>
McAlister said his agency is planning to commit similar amount
of funds to alleviate the micro-finances projects in Tanzania
which is key to reducing the level of unemployment.

SINGAPORE, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Share prices closed mixed on
 Singapore Stock Market Tuesday as some residual program-buying
pushed up the index-lined shares and the sharp overnight gains in
Wall Street buoyed the market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) hardly changed with a
marginal rise of 00.25 points to end at 1,400.43 points.
</P>
<P>
The total volume inched up to 154.27 million units valued at
406.82 million Singapore dollars (236.55 million U.S. dollars).
falls outnumbered rises by 1167 to 71 with 185 counters
unchanged.
</P>

SingTel remained at the top of the actives chart of the day
with a turnover of 16.49 million shares. ST Engg again was the

GES was next with 7.72 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Goodwood was the top mover of the day soaring up 220 cents to
finish at 21.00 Singapore dollars. It was followed by SIA F that
picked up 60 cents to close at 12.50 Singapore dollars. SP Bldg
edged up 34 cents to end at 1.25 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Thai pr led the losers of the day with a loss
of 24 cents to 3.76 U.S. dollars. UOB shed 15 cents to end at 7.05
Singapore dollars. KepCorp retreated 14 cents to end at 3.92
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers noted Wall Street's overnight strong rally helped
prompt shares up in the morning session but the STI trended
downward in the afternoon session.
</P>
<P>
But the last minute buying in selected index heavyweights
pulled up the index just before the close.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said, "It is all due to program buying of the big cap
stocks. There is no fundamental reason for these shares to be so
high."

<P>
LAGOS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The only panacea to reviving
Nigeria's flagging economy is through massive recapitalization and
injecting foreign investments, presidential flag bearer of the
People's Democratic Party (PDP) , Chief Lusegun Obasanjo, was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The PDP presidential candidate made the remarks in Minna of
Niger State on Monday, the second day of the last lap of his
electioneering campaigns all over the country before February 27
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He stated that part of his plans and programs if voted into

investments into the country, adding that "I have international
connection. I intend to use it."
</P>
<P>
To give the economy a much-needed vigor, he said, his
government will take as priority the creation of an enabling
environment for foreign investment.

What is required to revamp Nigeria's economy which has been in
the woods in the last decade is restructuring, rejuvenation and

<HEADLINE> Singapore Ministers Arrive in Yangon for Economic Cooperation Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Singapore ministerial
economic delegation, led by Minister of Trade and Industry Lee
Yock Suan, arrived here Tuesday to attend the third meeting of the
two countries' Joint Ministerial Working Committee (JMWC) on
promotion of economic cooperation, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore delegation also includes Minister of
Communication Mah Bow Tan and Minister of National Development
and Second Minister of Finance Lim Hng Kiang.
</P>
<P>
The JMWC meeting, to be chaired by Lee and Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council (SPDC), is expected to review the progress of
bilateral cooperation in tourism, agro-business and training since
the second JMWC meeting held in Singapore in October 1997, during
which two agreements -- a maritime transport agreement between the
two governments and an agreement between the two chambers of
commerce and industry of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Singapore formed the JMWC after Myanmar SPDC
Chairman Senior-General Than Shwe visited Singapore in June 1995,
laying down projects in the sectors of tourism, agriculture,
livestock and fisheries, and human resources development.
</P>
<P>
The first JMWC meeting was held in Yangon in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Singapore's investment in
Myanmar reached 1.484 billion U.S. dollars in 67 projects at the
end of October 1998, ranking first among the 23 countries and
regions which have a total investment of 7.089 billion dollars in
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The invested projects cover hotels and tourism, manufacturing,
real estate, industrial estate, construction and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also show that Myanmar and Singapore, one of the
country's major trading partners in Asia, have a bilateral trade
volume of 878 million dollars in 1997-98 fiscal year, in which
Singapore's exports to Myanmar made up for 84.2 percent. The
figure for the first 10 months of 1998 was registered at 809.8
million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Disaster Reduction Meeting Calls for Integration of Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Integration of countries in
the Asia and Pacific region is required to reduce natural
disasters, Philippe Boulle, director of International Decade for
Natural Disaster Reduction Secretariat (IDNDR), said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Natural disasters can no longer be considered as individual or
isolated emergency events to be addressed only after they occur in
terms of short term relief measures," he said at a meeting
organized by IDNDR and the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) and the Asian Disaster
Preparedness Center (ADPC).
</P>
<P>
"For the future, it is absolutely essential that we tap many of
the considerable abilities and resources available throughout Asia
to ensure that scientific and technical knowledge becomes
integrated into the decision-making process which leads to public
policies for sustained disaster prevention," Boulle said at the
four-day meeting which opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary of ESCAP Adrianus Mooy said that natural
hazards will continue to pose a major threat to the development of
this largest and most populated region of the world despite the
strenuous efforts made so far.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that six out of 10 major natural disasters which
occurred in 1998, have been in Asia, claiming 27,000 lives and
amounting to more than 38.2 billion U.S. dollars in economic
losses.
</P>
<P>
The regional meeting, Mooy said, is the most opportune time to
take stock of impacts from the increasing intensity of disasters
in the region and to learn from the achievements and progress in
the region towards natural disaster reduction.
</P>
<P>
Sukhumbhand Paribatra, deputy foreign minister of Thailand,
said in his opening speech that disasters, now measured in
billions of dollars annually, widely affect global and regional
issues such as trade, investment, environment, migration, public
health and sometimes even international relations, politics among
nations.
</P>
<P>
He praised the role of the IDNDR in enhancing public awareness
for disaster reduction and urged all people concerned to continue
their efforts to ensure effective integration of all disaster
reduction activities into the process of national economic and
social development, as well as to promote international
cooperation and exchange of experiences.
</P>
<P>
Government representatives, policy makers dealing with disaster
management at national level, and representatives of U.N.
agencies, non-government organizations as well as from the World
Bank and the Asian Development Bank are also present.

<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
continue to support China's efforts to gain entry in the World
Trade Organization (WTO), according to a visiting senior U.S.
official.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following an afternoon meeting

objective," said Summers.
</P>
<P>
He added that U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky is
scheduled to visit China in near future to participate in detailed
discussions concerning China's WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
Summers visited Singapore and Indonesia prior to arriving in
China and is also scheduled to visit the Republic of Korea and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The goal of his Asian visit is to join leaders in various
countries in discussions related to economic issues emerging from
the financial crisis sweeping Asia. Summers said that one purpose
of the China visit is to prepare for the forthcoming U.S. visit by
Premier Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Summers noted the importance of the WTO issue and said he and
Premier Zhu also exchanged views on global economic development.
He added that the two sides reaffirmed their common interests in
prosperity in Asia, and emphasized the importance of bilateral
trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and Summers discussed ongoing economic reform in China,
the reform of China's banking system and state-owned enterprises
in particular.
</P>
<P>
Summers said the U.S. will continue to offer technological
assistance to China's banking system reform.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. leader also met with Chinese Minister of Finance Xiang
Huaicheng and Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of
China.

<HEADLINE> South Africa in Economic Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was
technically in economic recession after posting negative growth
for the last two quarters of 1998, figures from Statistics South
Africa have showed.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted an
annualized 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter after declining 2.5
percent in the third, South African media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The last recession was almost seven years ago, when the country
posted negative growth of 2.2 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for last year was 0.1 percent, down from 1.7
percent growth in 1997 and 3.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the damage on economy was mainly caused by the
unexpected surge in interest rates in the middle of last year,
triggered by the currency's collapse.
</P>
<P>
South African banks raised their rates to the highest level in
a decade last August after the central bank hiked its rates to
save the nose-diving Rand. The currency started tumbling in late
May against the U.S. Dollar as speculative attacks on the local
financial market began.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed the main contributors to the slowdown were the
manufacturing sector, agriculture and mining. Manufacturing, which
makes up more than a quarter of total GDP, contracted 1.7 percent
during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, making up 5.3 percent of the country's GDP, slid
1.1 percent. Mining, responsible for 10 percent of the economy,
posted a 0.4 percent output decline in the year, largely due to
lower commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry was hard hit by high interest rates,
recording annualized quarterly declines of more than four percent
in the third and fourth quarters after posting positive growth in
the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the finance and real estate sectors grew in the
second half of the year, albeit at a much slower rate than in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect the recession to continue until the middle of
the year, and then the economy might pick up in the second half as
interest rates continued their downward trend. However, few
economists expect a growth of over 0.5 percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Offer Aid for Tanzania's Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government
will grant 20 million Canadian Dollars (about 13.4 million U.S.
Dollars) for the improvement of Tanzania's education level,
especially for that of girl students.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government is to provide the aid in the coming
five years, a Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA)
official, Andrew McAlister, was quoted by Tuesday's Tanzanian
Daily News as saying.
</P>
<P>
McAlister, the Regional Director for Africa, the horn of Africa
and Middle East in CIDA, told the media in Ottawa recently ahead
of the state visit to Tanzania by Canada's Governor-General Romeo
LeBlanc, that Tanzania' s education has failed to keep with
changes brought about by economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
The loss of student's potentials is being felt today as the
present curriculum is outdated, teaching materials are relatively
scarce, school buildings are in a generally unsatisfactory state
with most teachers' standard either substandard or outdated.
</P>
<P>
Adult literacy level in Tanzania, once considered an exemplary
model in Africa, has fallen back to 68 percent from almost 100
percent, and could continue to drop at a rate of some two percent
per annum, an economic advisor of European Union-delegation to
Tanzania, Alexander Baum, said in a report recently.
</P>
<P>
Teacher's morale is low and absenteeism is high among Tanzanian
teachers whose qualification and salary are poor, Baum noted.
</P>
<P>
McAlister said his agency is planning to commit similar amount
of funds to alleviate the micro-finances projects in Tanzania
which is key to reducing the level of unemployment.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Said to Be Base for Rwandan Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has become
the main base of drug and gun-running operations for Rwandan
genocide suspects due to the country's lax law enforcement,
Rwanda's ambassador has warned.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the weekend arrest and deportation of a suspect
wanted by the international genocide tribunal in Arusha, Tanzania,
ambassador Ben Karenzi said Monday: "This should be an eye-opener
for the South African government that 'genocidaires' are using
this country as a base."
</P>
<P>
"There is a continuous flow of criminal genocide elements in
this country. We have clear evidence they are involved with arms
and drugs trafficking in this country," The Star paper Tuesday
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Ignace Bagilishema, the former mayor of Mabanza, was arrested
in Pretoria with false travel documents and was reportedly flown
by United Nations officials to Arusha Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the government organized genocide against Tutsis in
April 1994, Bagilishema allegedly ordered the round-up and killing
of ethnic Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
A Rwandan government spokesperson in Pretoria said his
government would ask South Africa to go through the list of
refugees in this country "with a fine tooth comb" to weed out any
fugitives, and to discuss extradition.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan government suspected that about 300 Rwandans who
took part in the genocide were hiding in South Africa, and that
many had access to South African identity documents, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The South African Home Affairs Department declined to comment
on the arrest and the ambassador's assertion that South Africa is
being used for drug and gun-running against Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The South African Foreign Affairs Department denied that the
country was providing refuge to Rwandan genocide suspects. It said
the government was doing its best to assist the Rwandan
government.
</P>
<P>
Karenzi said Rwanda had expressed its concern to senior South
African government officials last year over the presence of
genocide suspects and supporters of the ongoing Hutu insurgency
against the present Tutsi- dominated government.
</P>
<P>
But South Africa had not taken any substantial action, he said.

of African Unity (OAU) and the European Union (EU) have commended
the peaceful manner in Nigeria's National Assembly election and
described the election as a qualified success, local press
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in capital Abuja Monday, OAU group leader
Daniel Antonio said that "the polling process has so far been
peaceful, open and enabled all eligible voters to exercise their
franchise."
</P>
<P>
While the OAU observers note that the turn-out was low, the
statement said, "we believe that Nigerians will turn out in
greater numbers to select their next president."
</P>
<P>
The 52-member observer group said that it was impressed with
the conduct of all the polling officials, emphasizing that the
democratic process was not only important for Nigeria but for
Africa as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The EU observer group issued a statement in Abuja on Monday,
saying that "the elections were peacefully conducted and can be
judged a qualified success," adding the problems noted did not mar
the credibility of the over- all result.
</P>
<P>
The group noted that it was impressed by the dedication of many
polling officials and the openness of the process.
</P>
<P>
Despite the low turnout in Saturday's National Assembly
election, the statement said that these elections marked "another
important step toward the establishment of democracy and the
transfer of power to a civilian government".
</P>
<P>
David Carroll, Carter Center's Associate Director of Democratic
Program, was quoted as saying before his departure for Nigeria
Monday that the upcoming presidential contest in Nigeria could be
one of the most important elections that President Jimmy Carter
has observed to date.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Carter regards the Nigerian election as the most
 important of the year "because if the transition to civilian rule
works in Nigeria, it could change the course of history in West
Africa."

<HEADLINE> Belgium Refutes Reports on Helping Rebels to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Belgium has
categorically denied press reports that the country has been
providing financial assistance to the rebels in the Democratic
Republic of Congo to topple the government of President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian Ambassador to Tanzania, Beatrix van Hemeldonck,
said in a statement to official Daily News that Belgium provides
non-structural aid to the DRC through Belgian NGOs for
humanitarian purposes only, the paper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is in this context that 30 million Belgian Francs and not
30 billion Francs as reported in a weekly English newspaper, has
been allocated for humanitarian aid in western Congo," Hemeldonck
said, adding that the same amount has been allocated for the same
purpose for the eastern part of that country.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said in the statement released Monday that the
aid was being provided with the full knowledge and consent of the
DRC government.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that Belgium has continuously insisted the need
to respect the principle of territorial integrity of the DRC and
denounced foreign interference.
</P>
<P>
Belgium decided to limit its development aid to non-structural
aid to the DRC following the deterioration of the relationship
between the two countries in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
The leader of rebels in the DRC, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, who is
the president of the Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD), said
last week in Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam that they have
received humanitarian aid from Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Cholera Situation Worsening in Somali Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The cholera situation in the
Southern Gedo region is further worsening despite serious efforts
by the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF) in supplying the
anti-dehydration solution and chlorine for purifying the water.
</P>
<P>
According to the health authorities in the region, the disease
has now spread to more towns, villages and communes.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports from the region indicate that the number of
cholera cases being reported now exceed 982 until Monday night,
while the death toll is more than 187 people of which 127 have
died in the past six days alone.
</P>
<P>
According to Qasim Aden Elmi, director of Bardera town
hospital, over 53 people have died in the hospital of the town,
of which seven died Monday.
</P>
<P>
Elmi said 70 percent of the dead are children under 14 years
old who were also suffering from malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
The local health authorities fighting against the spread of the
disease have reported that the disease is now rampant especially
in the four refugee camps surrounding the town where at least
five people die per day in each camp.
</P>
<P>
Over 40 people among the dead are the refugees in those camps
who had mainly arrived from the neighboring regions of Bay, Bak-ol
and northeastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The cholera killer disease has also spread into the towns of
Bur Dhubo, El-Waq and 12 new villages and communes including
Busar, Buto Weyn, Kngal and Yado all in Gedo region.

<HEADLINE> College Graduates Rush for High-Tech Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Working for high technology
enterprises has become the hottest choice for this year's college
graduates, according to surveys carried out by various Beijing-
based job markets.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 job hunters crowded into the '99 Beijing Job
Market which has just ended. As a result the Tongfang Company,
affiliated to Qinghua University, has received more than 200
college graduates' applications while Legend, China's prestigious
computer company, was handed 800 resumes in a single morning.
</P>
<P>
Student Lai Ning from the department of computer science at
Beijing University revealed that he has sent a dozen applications
to the big names in China's information technology such as Legend,
Tongfang and Stone.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that the ownership of enterprises doesn't seem
to matter a lot to these job seekers. Statistics show that 30
percent of the 1,200 participating companies at the '99 Beijing
Job Market are privately owned and involved with high-tech
activities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Beijing's municipal government has introduced a
series of strategies to boost high technology and encourage job-
seeking in high-tech companies, especially those in the private
sector as these booming enterprises are short of talent.

<HEADLINE> Sonia: India's Congress Party Ready to Rise to Its Responsibilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Sonia Gandhi, president of
the Congress party, the biggest opposition party in India, Tuesday
said that her party was "ready and able" to rise to its
responsibilities if the BJP-led coalition government collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the general body of the Congress Parliamentary
Party (CPP), Sonia, who is also chairperson of the CPP, said that
there were deep divisions between the government and its
ideological mentors as well as serious differences between senior
members of the government.
</P>
<P>
The people's mood in the country was one of "deep
disillusionment" with the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) government
and they expected the Congress party to rise to its
responsibilities if the ruling coalition "falters or if it cracks
and its contrived edifice renders it unable to fulfill its own
responsibility", she said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to reassure the nation that we are ready and able to
rise to our responsibilities and the nation's interests are
paramount," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to India's economic situation, Sonia Gandhi severely
criticized the government's handling of the economy and accused it
of lacking a viable policy in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"There was brave talk of reviving the economy... nothing of
this sort has happened," she said.
</P>
<P>
The country's fiscal and trade deficits were at their worst
since the 1991 crisis and there were no signs of industrial growth
picking up. Investors' confidence was at a low ebb and exports
have registered a negative growth, she further said.

<HEADLINE> APEC to Have Influence on WTO Negotiation Agenda: New Zealand Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) will have real influence on WTO (World Trade
Organization) agenda for trade negotiation at the end of this
year, New Zealand International Trade Minister Lockwood Smith said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EVSL (Early Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization) tariff
liberalization package issue APEC brought forward to the WTO
received some progress at the WTO level, he told a press
conference here Tuesday at the end of his three-day official visit
to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
While the EVSL may not be fully accepted at the WTO level, any
agreement reached by APEC will provide a great start to any
industrial negotiations to be carried out at both WTO and APEC
levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand, as the chair of 1999 APEC leaders' informal
meeting, is now handling the (EVSL) issue carefully at the WTO
level, with strong hopes that more progress on the EVSL issue can
be unlocked, he said.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand will try to advance APEC's ultimate objective which
is to achieve agreement on one of the critical mass of the eight
sectors under the fast-track EVSL tariff liberalization package,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his country will use the WTO meeting in Geneva next
week to present the benefits of the EVSL package to a key group of
WTO member economies.
</P>
<P>
Smith is departing for Thailand Tuesday night, as part of his
tour to a number of APEC members.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- North China's port city of
Tianjin attracted 281 million U.S. dollars in contractual overseas
investment in January, an increase of 3.3 percent over the same
month last year.
</P>
<P>
The funds are earmarked for 48 projects, according to the city'
statistics bureau.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin officials say that this year they aim to absorb 3.85
billion U.S. dollars in contractual overseas investment and make
actual use of 2.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said that despite the Asian financial crisis,
companies from the Republic of Korea and Japan invested more than
last year in Tianjin and foreign investment has begun to have an
impact in the agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, Tianjin approved the establishment of
over 12,000 foreign investment projects, attracting 24 billion U.S.
dollars in contractual investment, with nearly 10 billion U.S.
dollars of that actually used.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices in Hong Kong Down in January 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Consumer prices in Hong
Kong, as indicated by the Composite Consumer Price Index (CPI),
registered a year-on-year rate of decrease of 1.1 percent in
January 1999, the Census and Statistics Department (CSD) said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the 1.6 percent decline recorded in December
1998, the Composite CPI for January 1999 increased by 0.6 percent,
the department said.
</P>
<P>
For the 3 months to January 1999, the average Composite CPI
fell by 1.2 percent over the same period a year earlier, according
to the CPI figures released by the CSD Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 months to January 1999, the Composite CPI was on
average 2.3 percent higher than that in the preceding 12-month
period.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted average monthly rates of change in the
Composite CPI during the 3-month period to January 1999 were -0.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that the lower
year-on-year declines in the CPI recorded in January 1999 than in
December 1998 were mainly due to dissipation of the effect of the
rates rebate which took place in the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He added that the further decline in consumer prices in January
1999 reflected the continued cost and price adjustment in the
local economy.
</P>
<P>
The easing in price pressure was manifested in a wide range of
consumer goods and services, with the prevalence of price
discounts in retail business amidst the weak local consumer
demand.
</P>
<P>
Also relevant was the continued freeze in government fees and
in a number of public utility charges, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> South African Referee Shoots Player Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A South African soccer
referee shot and killed a player on Sunday night during a match in
a northern South African city, South Africa's daily The Citizen
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The player, Isaac Mkhwetha, 20, was shot in the center of his
chest after having allegedly lunged at the referee with a knife
during what was believed to be "a gambling match" at the Tigane
Sports Stadium in Hartbeesfontein, North-West Province.
</P>
<P>
The incident happened towards the end of the second half when
Mkhwetha's opposing side scored their first and only goal of the
match, the paper quoted local police as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mkhwetha died soon afterwards, and he had apparently been in
possession of a toy gun, police said.
</P>
<P>
The referee's licensed 9mm pistol had been confiscated and he
is expected to appear in court Tuesday on a charge of murder.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the South African Football Association (Safa)
North-West, Sam Masitenyane, said Monday he was very shocked by
the "most regrettable" incident.
</P>
<P>
He said neither team was affiliated to the association and the
match had been what is termed a "gambling game", in which the
official body's rules would not apply.
</P>
<P>
Masitenyane said the incident was proof of the high risks
involved in gambling matches, where teams played for high stakes
in what were usually "grudge games".
</P>
<P>
He and other Safa officials visited Tigane last year to try to
dissuade the local teams which shun Safa from continued
participation in the dangerous practice.
</P>
<P>
No Safa player would be allowed on a field with a knife, he
said. Even earrings were considered potentially hazardous to
fellow players,and had to be covered with tape.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, no referee would be allowed on the field with a
loaded firearm "because it is intimidation", Masitenyane said.

<HEADLINE> Official Says Escrow Agreement on Marcos Wealth Valid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The escrow agreement on the 580
million U.S. dollars of Marcos deposits is a "valid and binding
document," the presidential palace said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Presidential Spokesman jerry Barican said that
the Swiss Federal Supreme Court has approved the Philippine
government's request that the Marcos funds be transferred from
Swiss banks to the Philippine National Bank (PNB).
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to revamp the existing escrow agreement
regarding Marcos funds in the PNB," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Barican was reacting to reports that former senator Jovito
Salonga has asked the Presidential Commission on Good Government
(PCGG) to overhaul the escrow agreement governing the Marcos Swiss
bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
The presidential spokesman also allayed fears raised by the
former PCGG chairman that some 10,000 human rights victims will be
left out as claimants in the money held in escrow.
</P>
<P>
"The PCGG assures that with respect to senator Salonga's
concern about the claim of human rights victims, they will not be
left out," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government recovered the 580 million dollars
from Marcos' Swiss accounts and transferred the funds from Swiss
banks to the PNB last year under the escrow agreement.
</P>
<P>
Under the escrow agreement reached by parties concerned, the
funds must be held in escrow in a bank before the Philippine
congress and the Supreme Court decided how to handle the funds.

TOKYO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices rose sharply in

<P>
Foreign investors actively bought stocks at the end of Tuesday'

KATHMANDU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The German government agreed
Tuesday to provide a grant assistance of 87 million German marks
(48.6 million U.S. dollars) to Nepal for the year 1998/99.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed here Tuesday by the two

</P>
<P>
The grant assistance will be used for the implementation of a

(2 million marks) under the rural community infrastructure
project, the Nepali Finance Ministry said in a press release.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Plans to Introduce Furniture Export Levy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia plans to
introduce furniture export levy to raise funds needed to promote
the country's furniture industry, Primary Industries Minister Lim
Keng Yaik said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The levy will not be high, probably in the percentage of 0.01
percent of the total furniture export, Lim said at a Chinese Lunar
New Year gathering here organized by the Malaysian Furniture
Industry Council (MFIC).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's furniture industry was estimated to record 4.36
billion ringgit (1.147 billion U.S. dollars) in exports earnings
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the industry had to be strategized in order
to tap the up-market potential and to come out with solely
Malaysian designs.
</P>
<P>
He said that the furniture industry was getting ready for more
competition as it has started moving into new markets other than
the traditional markets of the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Malaysian furniture manufacturers to concentrate
on high quality, functional, innovative and attractively designed
furniture to capture a bigger share of the international market
estimated at 55 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Malaysian manufacturers are backed by quality
products, they would be able to rival their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
He also urged manufacturers to hire established foreign
designers who can design products of world standards and carry
products through established brandnames to tap the world market.

<HEADLINE> Economist Optimistic of Malaysia's Economic Recovery in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- There is a better macro-
economic outlook for 1999 where Malaysia's gross domestic product
(GDP) may possibly achieve a two percent real growth rate,
Malaysia Investors's Association President PHS Lim predicted.
</P>
<P>
Despite the prevalent challenging times and lower global
economic growth projected for this year, the rest of 1999 will be
a good year for the economy, Lim said in a statement issued here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we have peace and unity, Malaysia should be able to
pull out of the economic slumps ahead of other Asian countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Lim noted that 1999 has brought a new set of fundamentals in
the country which should help improve the capital market and the
macro-economy.
</P>
<P>
The new factors include declining interest rates over the past
six months from as high as 20 percent per annum to the current
level of 10 percent in terms of commercial bank loans, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lim said lower interest rates would certainly prompt some shift
in investments in time deposits to financial instruments like
stocks and shares.
</P>
<P>
Lim urged the financial sector, including bankers, brokers and
investors, to work collectively to overcome problems facing the
capital market.
</P>
<P>
He said that liquidity position in the country, which is
important for the capital market, had also improved with Bank
Negara (State Bank)'s Statutory Reserves Requirement cut to a low
of four percent against its high of 13.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that the increase of money in circulation in Malaysia's
financial system as seen over the past five months is a positive
sign that consumer spending is picking up slowly.

<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese farmer in
northeastern Liaoning Province recently developed an innovative
method to unravel the mystery of inscriptions on bones or tortoise
shells.
</P>
<P>
Li Yun, 50, counts the strokes of characters created by
primitive people living during the Shang Dynasty (16th century -
11th century B.C.) to deduce their meanings within context,
according to today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts from throughout the world were quite surprised to find
Li's translations coincide with research conclusions reached by
leading historians and linguists.
</P>
<P>
Li Xueqin, director of the Institute of History under the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, cited the uniqueness of the
Lianing farmer's method.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences has since engaged Li
Yun as a research fellow specializing in inscriptions on bones and
tortoise shells.
</P>
<P>
Wenhui Daily reported that Li exhibited great interest in the
mysterious inscriptions at a very young age. It also noted that Li
published his first academic work in 1995.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed
to provide a donation of 200,000 tons of wheat to Pakistan,
official sources said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An agreement to this effect was signed Tuesday by William B.
Milam, U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, and Zaheer Sajjad, secretary
of the Economic Affairs Division.
</P>
<P>
The sale proceeds of the wheat will be used to finance various
programs of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC).
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the PARC will establish an agriculture
linkage program to promote long-term scientific cooperation
between Pakistan and the United States in the field of agriculture
sciences.
</P>
<P>
These research and scientific exchange projects between the two
countries will supplement the efforts by the Pakistani government
to improve food security, alleviate poverty and promote
broad-based and sustainable agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the present donation, the United States had
earlier donated 100,000 tones of wheat to Pakistan in January,

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey conducted by
the Ministry of Personnel revealed that only 87.63 percent of
China's senior-level professionals have completed higher education,
compared with 93.88 percent in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that the average age for academicians
with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Chinese Academy of
Engineering is 65, with 41.38 percent of high-level scientists and
technologists over the age of 55.
</P>
<P>
The fact that a large number of senior scientists and
technicians will retire from their posts over the next two years
will affect the development of some academic fields and create
shortage in high-level human resources.
</P>
<P>
Survey results indicated that the majority of high-level
personnel work for various government and administrative
departments, with the rate increasing by 7.55 percent between 1989-
1994.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the rate for professional personnel working
for enterprises fell from 42 percent in 1990 to 39.7 percent in
1994, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
China's inputs in scientific research are significantly lower
than in many other countries and China is faced with the pressing
brain drain issue.
</P>
<P>
Experts stress that China should introduce effective and
feasible policies to attract the return of senior scientists in
order to meet domestic demand.

TEHRAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Iranian riot police have
succeeded in stopping the melee in front of the Iraqi embassy here
and driven Iraqi demonstrators about 100 meters away from the
embassy building.
</P>
<P>
Several dozen police were sent to the scene to bring the
situation under control. Equipped with riot gear and tear gas,
they ended the scuffles and pushed the angry Iraqis out of the
alleys leading to the embassy in northern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators are staging a sit-in instead.
</P>
<P>
Several protesters were seen injured during scuffles with
police as they tried to storm into the embassy. Police fired into
the air to daunt back the surging crowds.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi demonstrators were protesting the murder of Iraq's
most prominent Shiite cleric, for which they held the Baghdad
regime responsible.
</P>
<P>
They forced their way into the alleys leading to the embassy,
which police had closed off in anticipation of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
Riot police on alert had tried to keep the angry men and women
few meters away from the embassy building, at which the
demonstrators were hurling rocks, sticks, wastes and whatever they
could get.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators accused Iraqi government of killing Grand
Ayatollah Mohammed Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader and his two sons Friday
night because of his break with President Saddam Hussein. Baghdad
has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
A while ago they had rallqi people.
</P>
<P>
Chanting slogans such as "Down with the U.S., Down with
Saddam", the protesters had gathered in front of the U.N. office
in Tehran, urging international efforts to stop repressive Saddam
from continuing killing.
</P>
<P>
They burned a portrait of Saddam as four of their
representatives were allowed into the U.N. building to hand over a
letter of appeal.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the letter Xinhua obtained urged the international
community and organizations to take concrete measures to protect
the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sader had had been close to the Sunni-controlled government,
which appointed him the grand ayatollah in 1992 to head the Shiite
majority, who account for 65 percent of the country's 22 million
population.
</P>
<P>
The respected cleric had in the past six months tried to
establish himself as an independent leader by issuing an edict
calling on the Shiites to attend weekly Friday prayers in
mosques. Baghdad disapproves of big crowds.
</P>
<P>
The protest in Tehran was organized by the Iran-based Iraqi
opposition group, the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in
Iraq.

-- Nearly 40,000 farmers from across Europe demonstrated on
Monday in Brussels, where the ministers of agriculture of the 15
European Union countries were meeting to discuss the reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy. France and Germany are disputing over
a reduction of the EU aid to farmers, as Germany wants to cut its
contribution to the EU budget, half of which, or 40.5 billion
euros, go to agriculture.
</P>
<P>
-- The blockade remained complete in the talks on Kosovo in
Rambouillet, as the extension given to Serbs and Albanians for
concluding an agreement of ``substantial autonomy'' is due to
expire at 15:00 local time. The Albanians, who want independence,
are sticking to their dream by demanding a self-determination
referedum at the end of a three-year interim period.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- From 30,000 to 50,000 farmers from Europe, most of them
French, demonstrated on Monday in Brussels to protest the reform
project of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will reduce the
guaranteed prices for agricultural food byfrom 15 to 30 percent.
The EU commissioner in charge of agriculture Franz Fischler said
that the agriculture ministers of the 15 EU countries will not
make decisions under the pressure from the street.
</P>
<P>
-- The conference on Kosovo held in Rambouillet should end on
Tuesday at 15:00 local time. In case of a failure, NATO could
launch air strikes. The stands of both Serbs and Kosovo Albanians

<HEADLINE> 2 People Killed in Bomb Explosions in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Powerful explosions believed
to have come from 10 home-made bombs rocked the Ambonese district
of Batu Merah in Ambon, capital of Maluku province in Indonesia,
killing two people, damaging a number of houses and causing locals
to panic.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, the series of explosions which
occurred at about 11:30 a.m. local time on Tuesday, prompted
workers and students to flee their offices and schools.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 houses were burned by fire from the explosions.
</P>
<P>
No ranking official could be contacted for further information,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Ambon was rocked by days of clashes between Muslims and
Christians in January. The rioting claimed over 100 lives and
damaged thousands of buildings as well as scores of vehicles worth
more than 500 billion rupiah (58.8 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the latest outbreak of violence in Maluku, at least 11
people were killed and 43 others wounded on February 14. The
violence hit two islands of Haruku and Saparua. It was reported
that the clash was between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a homemade bomb blew off in southeastern Saparua
island near Ambon island, killing one person and injuring another
person.
</P>
<P>
Most of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim. Maluku is a
pre-dominantly Christian province.

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Protesters Scuffle with Police in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Angry Iraqi demonstrators in
front of the Iraqi embassy in northern Tehran scuffled with riot
police as they tried to storm into the embassy. Several protesters
were seen injuried.
</P>
<P>
About 20 riot police with handguns or sticks pushed back the
crowds rushing toward the gate of the embassy and this was when
the scuffles. Police fired into the air in an effort to stop the
melee.
</P>
<P>
There has been a reinforcement of about 30 policemen at the
scene and tension was heightened as police tried to disperse the
crowds and clear them out of the vicinities of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi demonstrators were protesting the murder of Iraq's
most prominent Shiite cleric, for which they held the Baghdad
regime responsible.
</P>
<P>
Previously they had rallied in front of the U.N. office here
appealing for international efforts to stop President Saddam
Hussein from killing the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators forced their way into the alleys leading to
the embassy, which police had closed off in anticipation of their
arrival.
</P>
<P>
Riot police on alert tried to keep the angry men and women few
meters away from the embassy building, at which the demonstrators
were hurling rocks, sticks, wastes and whatever they could get. So
far there has been no clashes.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators accused Iraqi government of killing Grand
Ayatollah Mohammed Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader and his two sons Friday
night because of his break with President Saddam Hussein. Baghdad
has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Chanting slogans such as "Down with the U.S., Down with
Saddam", the protesters had gathered in front of the U.N. office
in Tehran, urging international efforts to stop repressive Saddam
from continuing killing.
</P>
<P>
They burned a portrait of Saddam as four of their
representatives were allowed into the U.N. building to hand over a
letter of appeal.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the letter Xinhua obtained urged the international
community and organizations to take concrete measures to protect
the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sader had had been close to the Sunni-controlled government,
which appointed him the grand ayatollah in 1992 to head the Shiite
majority, who account for 65 percent of the country's 22 million
population.
</P>
<P>
The respected cleric had in the past six months tried to
establish himself as an independent leader by issuing an edict
calling on the Shiites to attend weekly Friday prayers in
mosques. Baghdad disapproves of big crowds.
</P>

The protest in Tehran was organized by the Iran-based Iraqi
opposition group, the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in

<HEADLINE> No Sign of Agreement on Kosovo in Rambouillet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Several hours from the final
ending of the talks on Kosovo in Rambouillet, southwest of Paris,
there is no sign of an agreement to be reached by the Serbs and
Kosovo Albanians Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
French officials close to the talks said there would be no more
extension of the talks after 15:00 local time (14:00 GMT), which
was the ultimate deadline given by the six-nation Contact Group to
the Serbs and Albanians to accept their peace proposal.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse quoted official sources as saying that the
most likely outcome is that neither of the two sides would accept
the text of a peace agreement proposed by the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Sunday that
if the Albanian side refuses to accept the peace proposal, NATO
would not launch air strikes against Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said that the talks
would go until its ultimate limit.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine and British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who are the
co-chairmen of the talks, are expected to summarize the two sides
the result of the talks after the deadline expires.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries have been pushing the Albanian side to
sign the peace proposal in order to pressure the Serbs to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Commander of the NATO Allied Forces, Wesley Clark,
met with a leader of the Kosovo Liberation Army outside Paris
Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Compensate for Wife of Libyan Dissident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 23 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court has ruled that
the Interior Ministry pay the wife of Mansour Kikhia, who was
Libya's former foreign minister and later became a dissident, a
compensation for his disappearance in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Court of Appeal Monday ordered the ministry to pay
Baha el-Emary 100,000 Egyptian pounds (29,400 U.S. dollars), the
Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The court maintained that Kikhia was a prominent figure and the
ministry was responsible for his security when he was in Egypt,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Kikhia, who was head of a Libyan opposition alliance, arrived
in Cairo in November, 1993 to attend a meeting of the Arab Human
Rights Organization.
</P>
<P>
He disappeared after the meeting and his whereabouts were not
known.
</P>
<P>
El-Emary, who is now living in Washington, has filed a suit
against the Egyptian Ministry of Interior before the South Cairo
Primary Court, which turned down the suit.
</P>
<P>
The court said that it could not prove there was negligence on
the part of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Later she appealed to the Cairo Court of Appeal and sought
damages of 500,000 pounds (147,000 dollars) from the ministry,
which she accused of failing to prevent the abduction of her
husband.

<HEADLINE> South Africa in Economic Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa was
technically in economic recession after posting negative growth
for the last two quarters of 1998, figures from Statistics South
Africa have showed.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted an
annualized 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter after declining 2.5
percent in the third, South African media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The last recession was almost seven years ago, when the country
posted negative growth of 2.2 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for last year was 0.1 percent, down from 1.7
percent growth in 1997 and 3.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Economists said the damage on economy was mainly caused by the
unexpected surge in interest rates in the middle of last year,
triggered by the currency's collapse.
</P>
<P>
South African banks raised their rates to the highest level in
a decade last August after the central bank hiked its rates to
save the nose-diving Rand. The currency started tumbling in late
May against the U.S. Dollar as speculative attacks on the local
financial market began.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed the main contributors to the slowdown were the
manufacturing sector, agriculture and mining. Manufacturing, which
makes up more than a quarter of total GDP, contracted 1.7 percent
during 1998.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, making up 5.3 percent of the country's GDP, slid
1.1 percent. Mining, responsible for 10 percent of the economy,
posted a 0.4 percent output decline in the year, largely due to
lower commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
The construction industry was hard hit by high interest rates,
recording annualized quarterly declines of more than four percent
in the third and fourth quarters after posting positive growth in
the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, the finance and real estate sectors grew in the
second half of the year, albeit at a much slower rate than in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
Economists expect the recession to continue until the middle of
the year, and then the economy might pick up in the second half as
interest rates continued their downward trend. However, few
economists expect a growth of over 0.5 percent this year.

"If anything, it has reaffirmed the important roles which
Japan, China and the United States continue to play in the
region," he added.
</P>
<P>
In his elaboration on the roles by Japan, China and the United
States, Downer said "China has played a prominent role in trying
to contain the contagion effects of the crisis, notably in its
decision not to devalue its currency."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Downer underlined that "the crisis will have an
impact on the relative power of the middle and smaller-sized
states in the region."
</P>
<P>
"Careful management will be required to ensure that such
disparities and any new relativities which emerge in the region do
not cause distrust or misunderstanding," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister warned regional countries against possible
internal stress and troubles, saying "While these internal strains
have not yet had a significant strategic impact beyond the borders
of the countries concerned, they clearly contribute to an
environment of uncertainty and instability."
</P>
<P>
While expressing welcome to the cautious optimism that the Asian
economic crisis is bottoming out and the worst is being over,
Downer said the East Asian economic crisis is "not out of woods
yet."
</P>
<P>
He said "even there is a return to growth in some East Asian
economies this year, it will be off the very low base of 1998
economic output."
</P>
<P>
Problems like over-capacity and banking system badly in need of
reform cannot be solved overnight and the expected economic
slowdown in the United States and Europe may delay the recovery
process in East Asia, he added.

<HEADLINE> 200,000 Kenyans to Die of AIDS in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- At least 200,000 Kenyans will
die of AIDS this year, according to estimates by Kenya's National
HIV/AIDS Surveillance Program available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An additional 100,000 Kenyans will die each year by 2005 if the
Kenyans continue to be slow in behavioral change, refuse to take
precautions against AIDS and fail to abandon cultural practices
which doctors believe aggravate the spread of the disease, said
the national body.
</P>
<P>
The increase of AIDS death is attributed to the growing number
of people already infected. Last year, about 250,000 people
died of AIDS- related complications in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Nyanza Province, southwest of Kenya, reported 17,300 new cases
of AIDS last year, about 20 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that more than 300,000 Kenyans have
died from AIDS since the first case was diagnosed in 1984, while
1.5 million others, of whom 70 percent are aged between 18 and 25
years old, are infected with the killer virus.

<HEADLINE> Iraqis Protest before U.N. Office in Tehran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Iraqis are
gathering in front of a United Nations office in northern Tehran
to protest the murder of Iraq's most prominent Shiite cleric.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators held the Baghdad regime responsible for the
killing of Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Mohammed Sadiq al-Sader and
his two sons Friday night because of his break with President
Saddam Hussein. Baghdad has denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Chanting slogans such as "Down with the U.S., Down with
Saddam", the protesters urged the U.N. and international community
to stop Saddam from continuing killing of Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
They burned a picture of Saddam and some began throwing rocks
at the U.N. office. Four of their representatives have been
allowed into the U.N. office to present a letter of appeal.
</P>
<P>
A copy of the letter Xinhua obtained urged the international
community and organizations to take concrete measure to protect
the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sader had had been close to the Sunni-controlled government,
which appointed him the grand ayatollah in 1992 to head the Shiite
majority, who account for 65 percent of the country's 22 million
population.
</P>
<P>
The respected cleric had in the past six months tried to
establish himself as an independent leader by issuing an edict
calling on the Shiites to attend weekly Friday prayers in
mosques. Baghdad disapproves of big crowds.
</P>
<P>
The protest in Tehran was organized by the Iran-based Iraqi
opposition group, the Supreme Council of the islamic Revolution
in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Emphasis on Social Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The emphasis for implementing
the strategy of "using science and education to invigorate the
nation" should also center the social science as well as natural
science and technology, according to a researcher from Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent seminar organized by Premier Zhu Rongji,
researcher Chen Gaohua said the concept of science should include
both the social and natural sciences. He noted that social science
will continue to play an irreplaceable role in China's overall
development.
</P>
<P>
The mutual involvement and promotion of the two fields of
science has emerged as an important trend in the modern world.
Promoting social science will have a far-reaching impact on our
technological, educational, environmental and cultural development,
Chen added.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu organized two seminars prior to the second sessions
of the Ninth National People's Congress and the Ninth Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee to

<P>
LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's import bill of
petroleum products last year declined from 79.5 million U.S.
Dollars to 71.5 million, Zambian newspaper Financial Mail reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 10 percent decrease in the oil import bill has mainly been
attributed to the low oil prices which obtained in the
international market during the year.
</P>
<P>
An analysis of sales of petroleum products contained in the
1998 Economic Report indicates an increase in domestic sales of
liquefied petroleum, gas and kerosene. However, sales of gasoline,
bitumen and gas oils declined during the period under review.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Continues to Climb in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment has continued to
climb in Vietnam, fueled by the spin-off from the regional
financial crisis, Vietnam's English daily "Vietnam News" reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The regional financial crisis will continue to adversely
affect Vietnam's economy this year. So if we do not have temporary
solutions, the unemployment rate will increase," the daily quoted
Nguyen Thi Hang, Vietnam's minister for labor, war invalids and
social affairs, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment figures have been increasing remarkably over
the past three years. The unemployment rate in urban areas in 1997
was 6.01 percent and last year was 6.85 percent. Only 70.8 percent
of laborers in the agricultural sector and rural areas had jobs
last year, Hang recently told local newspaper "Vietnam Economic
Times".
</P>
<P>
The rate of laborers out of work in state-run and foreign
invested enterprises was 10 percent last year, she said.
</P>
<P>
"The number of low skilled laborers from rural areas arriving
in cities and industrial zones seeking work is increasing. The
skills of our laborers remain low, and job training programs still
do not meet the demand of production and the labor market," Hang
said.
</P>
<P>
This year, Vietnamese government will spend 480 billion
Vietnamese dong (about 35 million U.S. dollars) on the national
job promotion program with the aim of assisting 240,000 unemployed
people gain suitable work.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's Ministry of Labor, War Invalids and Social Affairs
(MOLISA) will raise the number of job trained students from 96,000
in 1998 to 120,000 this year. Another 550,000 laborers will be
trained in short-term courses, an increase of 22 percent over last
year, Hang added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Tighten Money Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK) will this year implement a monetary policy geared toward
stabilizing the country's price level, according to the bank's
third monetary policy statement for December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that money supply by CBK is limited to
expand by no more than 10 percent consistent with the targeted
level of inflation, it was quoted by East African Standard
newspaper Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CBK will tighten banking regulation this year and new directors
will not be allowed to borrow from institutions they head, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, CBK pursued a tight monetary policy setting out to
reduce and confine underlying inflation to single digit, with a
target of below five percent.
</P>
<P>
The statement said, interest rates, especially the Treasury
bill rates, fell and the exchange rate stayed stable last year as
a result of the sustained monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
Inflationary pressures eased as the underlying month-on-month
inflation declined from 11.4 percent in July 1998 to 7.9 percent
in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, money supply will be kept at within
10 percent in the 12 months to December 1999, while commercial
banks are expected to increase lending to the private sector by
at least 17.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Government borrowing from the banking sector is expected to
fall by at least five percent by December 1999 and foreign
exchange reserves of CBK are projected to increase to 870
million U.S. Dollars, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement emphasized that the reserves net of Central Bank
foreign exchange liabilities should rise to 662 million Dollars
by the end of December this year from 536 million Dollars in June
1998.

<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and
several others were injured in a bomb blast in the Bangladeshi
capital during the opposition-called hartal (strike) Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
The bomb attack occurred during pro- and anti-hartal clashes at
central Dhaka's Motijheel area, in which an activist from the
ruling Awami League was killed, sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday is the first day of the three-day municipal elections
in 136 out of the 182 municipalities across Bangladesh, in which
about 3,098,000 voters will elect 136 chairmen, 1,305 ward
commissioners and 435 women commissioners.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance, comprising the major opposition - the
Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami, the Islami Oikya Jote and others, started their
three-day hartal Tuesday to resist the polls.
</P>
<P>
Calling on their members and leaders to refraining from
participating in the polls, the opposition alliance vowed to foil
the elections by staging hartal if their four-point demand,
including the resignation of the chief election commissioner, was
not met by the government.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Gold Output at 40-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- South African gold mines
posted their lowest output in four decades last year as the
industry restructured in the face of falling bullion prices, South
African media reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South African mines produced 473.7 tons of gold in 1998, down
from 492.5 tons in 1997 and 494 tons in 1996, the South African
Chamber of Mines said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest annual output since 1955 wen the mines
yielded 454 tons.
</P>
<P>
South African gold production peaked over 1,000 tons in 1970,
but has fallen along with a weakening gold price since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
When gold price plumbed record lows of around 274 U.S. Dollars
an ounce in late 1997, the South African gold industry embarked on
a radical restructuring, cutting tens of thousands of jobs and
closing or selling unprofitable shafts.
</P>
<P>
AngloGold, the Johannesburg-based company and the world's
biggest gold producer, sold 17 shafts last year. Many other mining
houses have reorganized or disappeared altogether in the face of
tough competition from companies in Canada, Australia and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber said total production in the fourth quarter to
December 31 fell to 119 tons from 126.5 tons in the same period in
1997. The figure was also lower than the 119.8 tons in the third
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the world's biggest gold producing country,
accounted for more than a fifth of the world's total gold
production in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Discover World's Oldest Rice Kernels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Four rice kernels recently
discovered in central China's Hunan Province predate the generally
accepted history of rice production by as much as 4,000 years.
</P>
<P>
The rice kernels were discovered in a collapsed cave dating
back to the period between Paleolithic and Neolithic ages (some 10,
000 years ago). The cave is located in a karst area in Daoxian
County, Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
"The average length of the kernels is nine millimeters. The
cultivated rice kernels combine the characteristics of wild, round-
grained and long-grained nonglutinous rice," according to
Professor Zhang Wenxu from the China Agricultural University.
</P>
<P>
One Chinese archeologist noted that the discovery will be not
only be highly significant for studies of the origin and history
of rice production, but also proves that China was the first
country in the world to grow paddy rice.
</P>
<P>
The earliest rice samples previously discovered were unearthed
in the Pengtou Mountains, Lixian County, Hunan Province, in the
late 1980s. The samples predated previous discoveries by some 2,
000 years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Xinshi, an academician
with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASS), has called for an
expanded talent search to form a highly competitive group of
professionals.
</P>
<P>
Zhang made remark at a seminar organized to solicit opinions
for the March annual sessions of the National People's Congress
and the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most Chinese enterprises lack the ability to
invest in the development of innovative high technology, with many
colleges and institutes lacking adequate funding to carry out
applied technology research. Zhang said special funding should be
allocated to promote scientific research and cooperation between
colleges and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The distribution of human resources is a key issue in the
institutional restructuring of colleges and research institutes.
Zhang pointed out that brain drain is an urgent issue calling for
close consideration of how to nurture and attract talented
individuals.
</P>
<P>
Forming a competent body of professionals requires an
appropriate talent flow, according to Zhang. He added that some
researchers should be encouraged to enter the enterprise sector or
other institutions in order to bring their expertise into full
play.

<HEADLINE> MANILA Calls for Immediate Release of Abducted General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Tuesday called on the New People's Army (NPA) to immediately
release unharmed an army general and an army captain so as not to
prejudice the peace negotiations with the government.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, Presidential Spokesman Jerry
Barican said that Gen. Victor Obillo and Capt. Eduardo Montealto
have dedicated their office to building roads and bridges in
support of the government's socio-economic program for the
development of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"In detaining the two officers, the NPA have allowed public
perception of banditry and kidnapping to permeate their ranks. Let
not the situation degenerate further into activities of blackmail
and extortion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The army officers were kidnapped by the NPA last Wednesday
while inspecting a government project in Davao City, Mindanao. The
NPA demanded a swap of prisoners with the government in exchange
for the release of the two officers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Joseph Estrada announced in a statement
that he has ordered the government army and the national police to
exert all efforts to rescue safely the two military officers and a
police officer, who was abducted by the rebel group last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said that he directed Tuesday the Cabinet Advisory
Committee for the peace process and the government peace panel for
the rebel group to jointly review the peace process vis-a-vis the
NPA.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Pursues Suspects for Fires on Mt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 23 (Xinhua) - Tanzanian police is
pursuing suspects blamed for setting fires on the slopes of Mount
Kilimanjaro, the highest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers Tuesday quoted a senior police officer as
saying that villagers have identified 22 suspects but they are
still at large at the foot of the snow-capped mountain which is
5,895 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The Rombo District Commissioner, Lieutenant Lepillal ole
Molloimet said Monday that legal measures would be taken against
suspects proven to have been involved in starting the inferno
whose damage was yet to be established.
</P>
<P>
The exercise to identify criminals who start fires in
surroundings of the mountain has come in the wake of recent
outbreak of fires which swept through some parts of the mountain.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports cited an example of a fire on February 6 which
destroyed tens of hundreds of hectares of forest on the slopes of
the giant mountain.
</P>
<P>
Molloimet mentioned illegal animal hunters and honey collectors
as prime suspects, adding that some officials with a game reserve
around the mountain could also be collaborators.
</P>
<P>
"Kamwanga villagers last week caught a man reportedly for
starting a fire in the village but he escaped shortly after his
capture," he said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Israeli Soldiers Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Three Israeli soldiers were
killed and four others wounded overnight in south Lebanon in the
clash with Lebanese guerrillas, the Voice of the People radio
reported Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the casualties were caused when an Israeli
commando which tried to penetrate the areas of Birk al-Jaboura and
Abu Rashid in the country's West Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon
met with Lebanese guerrillas' strong resistance.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, said in a
statement that their fighters dealt a heavy blow to the
occupation forces and killed or wounded at least 15 Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Following the clash, Israeli warplanes blasted nearby hills of
Aintinin and al-Zilaya, firing six air-to-earth rockets.
</P>
<P>
Israeli artillery forces also bombarded parts of the central
sector of the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The bloody clash brought to the first fatality of Israeli
soldiers since the start of this year and raised to 10 the number
of the Israelis wounded in south Lebanon over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, clashes between Israeli troops and Lebanese
guerrillas who trying to oust the occupation forces from the
country have never stopped.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Ends Visit to Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has called on the governments of Zambia and Angola to
diplomatically resolve their differences arising from allegations
that some Zambians are supporting Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, also vice chairman of Southern African Development
Community (SADC), praised the initiatives for peace in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) spearheaded by Zambia, after
one-day consultations with Zambian President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Times of Zambia newspaper quoted the Mozambican
leader, at the Lusaka International Airport before departure, as
saying Monday:"We only hope that the governments of Angola and
Zambia can clarify these allegations and find a peaceful solution
to their problems."
</P>
<P>
He said that would be desirable in a region that was already
grappling with the civil war in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in DRC has attracted the military might of at
least seven countries fighting for and against President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique was ready to support the SADC-sponsored DRC peace
initiative.
</P>
<P>
Chissano was impressed with the initiatives so far taken by
Chiluba and would help consolidate the search for peace by also
playing a role as SADC vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
"I think my role in this whole initiative is to try and
consolidate what Chiluba is doing. My role is not to take over
from Chiluba but to help him in mediation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Takes Measures to Curb Animal Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has launched an emergent
nationwide campaign against the often fatal foot-and-mouth disease
that has hit many cloven-footed livestock of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has ordered some one million
vaccination doses from Turkey after all local supplies were
consumed to cope with the sudden outbreak of the disease,
exacerbated by the lack of rainfalls this winter, the
semiofficial Jordan Times reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Scores of livestock have died of the disease, sparking fears
that the disease may soon reach an epidemic level among the
livestock across the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The disease, also called hoof-and-mouth disease and highly
contagious, seldom poses fatal threats to grown-up animals, but
might be fatal to the newborns as they have not developed a strong
immune system yet.
</P>
<P>
Sheep, goats and cattle that have contracted the disease often
show symptoms in their mouths and hooves, hence the name of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Blisters and ulcers will appear inside their mouth and also in
and between their hooves, and the horn material will split after a
cloven-footed animal contracted the disease.
</P>
<P>
Foot-and-mouth disease only affects human beings if they have a
wound or abrasion and are in direct and steady contacts with
infected animals.
</P>
<P>
However, the disease might affect milk and meat products from
the infected animals, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that this winter's drought, brought about by
scarce rainfalls, had eliminated vast pastures and with them vital
animal feed, which in turn weakened the animals' abilities to
fight the disease.
</P>
<P>
The disease is considered as enzootic, or constantly present in
a locality, in the Middle East and Syria was hit by an outbreak
of it last November.

<HEADLINE> Historic Changes in Lhasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Democratic reforms in the Tibet
Autonomous Region have not only emancipated millions of serfs but
have also speeded up economic growth in Lhasa, capital of Tibet,
the city's mayor, Qiangba Punco, said here recently.
</P>
<P>
Since the central government designated Lhasa as one of the
country's first group of historic and cultural cities in 1962, it
has spent huge sums to repair such ancient buildings as the Potala
Palace, Norbu Lingka Park, and the Johkang Temple in an effort to
preserve this 1,350-year-old city.
</P>
<P>
The urban district of Lhasa remained within three square
kilometers before the regional democratic reforms of 1959, even
though the city had served as the regional capital for more than 1,
000 years.
</P>
<P>
Five major construction campaigns have been launched in Lhasa
since 1959, and now many modern factories stand on former
wasteland in suburban areas and a network of roads has been build
in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
"The urban district has expanded from three square kilometers
to 51, and the urban population has increased to 200,000, almost
seven times the 1959 figure," Qiangba Punco said.
</P>
<P>
The 51-year-old mayor, a native of Tibet, has served as a
worker, workshop director, secretary of a county Party committee,
and deputy director of the science and technology department of
Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"Lhasa has experienced its fastest growth during the 20 years
since 1979, when late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping proposed
economic development as the central task of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the assistance of other parts of China, Lhasa has built a
number of high-rise buildings including a Holiday Inn Hotel and
the Tibet Library, Foreign Trade Building, Gymnasium and Telecom
Building.
</P>
<P>
The local government has invested 100 million yuan in the past
four years to build new residential housing with a total floor
space of 400,000 square meters. As a result, the per capita living
space of the residents of Lhasa has risen to nine square meters.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, the people of Lhasa, often called "The Roof of the
World," enjoy the pleasures and the comforts of modern life
similar to any other cities in China. They can watch TV programs
on 35 channels, they now have access to the Internet, and there is
now one telephone for every four people in the city.
</P>
<P>
The once-remote city is now lined with shops, theaters, museums,
banks, hospitals and universities. People no longer have to trek a
long way to carry water from the Lhasa River, as they did in the
past, since the completion of a waterworks project which provides
85 percent of the urban residents with clean running water.
</P>
<P>
An air and land communications network with Lhasa at the center
has been built, and it now takes only three hours to travel there
from Beijing. Other air routes link the regional capital with
Chongqing, Xi'an, Chengdu and Xining.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the development blueprint for the 21st century,
Qiangba Punco said his government will raise its gross domestic
product by 16 percent this year, complete construction of some key
projects, and expand the green areas in urban districts to make
Lhasa more beautiful and prosperous.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A beautiful winter cityscape
has replaced the once drab gray appearance of Shenyang, capital of
northeastern China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
"Gray is the predominant color in this seriously polluted city,
" according to one edition of a China investment guidebook
published in the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, great changes have taken place in the cityscape over
the past several years since the local government adopted a series
of concrete pollution control measures.
</P>
<P>
"Human beings react to different colors. Gray often evokes
depression and passiveness, while combinations of different colors
evoke happiness and excitement," according to Dr. Wang Shumao, a
well-known Chinese psychologist.
</P>
<P>
The city's new skyscrapers with silver, white and gold roofs,
residential areas with red walls and sculptures in various colors
have helped to overcome the former dullness experienced in winter.
</P>
<P>
"I was quite surprised to see the new beauty of the city. It's
vastly different from only a few years ago," according to Shen
Zhiqiang, a tourist from Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey of one million local citizens shows over 90
percent expressed satisfaction with the new look.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Makes Revenue for Australian Tourism Reduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Australian tourism operators
described 1998 as a tough year after figures released Tuesday
showed Asia's economic decline took a 412 million U.S. dollar
chunk out of the tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
The official Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said
preliminary figures showed there were 4.16 million short-term
visitors in the year, four percent less than the 4.32 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said there were declines of 17 percent from South-East
Asia and 16 percent from North-East Asia last year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Council Australia Managing Director Phil Young said the
overall decline equated to around 645 million Australian dollars
(412 million U.S. dollars) in lost revenue for Australian tourism.
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is the Australian tourism industry must
improve on these figures in 1999," and Australia could not rely
solely on the Sydney Olympics for tourism growth, Young warned.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Taskforce Chief Executive Christopher Brown said the
yearly results underlined the dangers to the industry from the
proposed tax reforms, which he warned recently could cost 60,000
jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, Federal Tourism Minister Jackie Kelly put a positive
spin on the annual figures, describing the drop as minuscule.
</P>
<P>
"Today's ABS data confirms Australia's position as the strong
man of the world in withstanding the economic storms that threaten
our well-being," she said.
</P>
<P>
While visitor numbers were down, there was an increase in the
number of Australians heading overseas. The ABS said in the 11
months to November last year 2.8 million Australian residents
departed overseas, up eight percent on the corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said the Asian financial crisis had not had a
significant impact on business visitor arrivals as the main source
of such visitors was New Zealand, the United States and Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- There will be an estimated 11
million personal computers in Australia - a country with a
population of 18.7 million - by the year 2001, new research has
revealed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to data compiled by the Australian Film Commission
(AFC), there were almost 6.8 million computers in 1998, a million
more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
A study found there was at least one computer in 2.9 million
Australian homes with 900,000 connected to the Internet and
another 500,000 expected to access the Net within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
And of the 3.9 million homes without a computer - 400,000
expected to buy one within the next 12 months and 3.5 million did
not.
</P>
<P>
Overall, there were 1.09 million Internet subscribers including
450,000 business customers.
</P>
<P>
The most common uses for household computers were playing
computer games (59 percent), learning or study activities (54
percent) and work-related activities (38 percent).
</P>
<P>
In February 1998, more than 20 percent of users had spent some
time on the Internet, compared with only seven percent in February
1996.
</P>
<P>
The research, released in the AFC's fifth edition of Get The
Picture, also found the top five activities nominated as the main
reason for Internet use were: e-mail (23.5 percent); business
(19.7 percent); entertainment (14.4 percent); research (11.4
percent); and news and reference (6.7 percent).

BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- A treasured bronze Buddha
missing for more than 50 years was recently returned to China and
has been on display in the Shanghai Museum since February 4.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, Febuary 23 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea said Ethiopian troops
launched a major ground offensive in the contested Badme area
Tuesday morning in what appeared to be the first significant
infantry attack for more than two weeks in their border war,
according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia has launched a large-scale offensive, the ground
attack started at 4:30 a.m. this morning," Eritrean presidential
advisor Yermane Gebremesekel was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ethiopian air force and heavy artillery units attacked
Eritrean positions on all three fronts Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the horn of Africa neighbors resumed on
February 6 in the Badme area after an eight-month lull and
subsequently spread to two other fronts.
</P>
<P>
After three days of infantry battles, the fighting subsided,
only to erupt again this week.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's Ethiopian attack was preceded by intensive shelling
and bombing of eritrean positions on all three fronts on Monday.
The infantry advance was backed by tanks, heavy artillery and air
power, Gebremeskel said.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to be on a bigger scale than February 6," he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Urged to Maintain Non-Interference Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Former ASEAN
secretary-general Ajit Singh Tuesday stressed the need for ASEAN
to maintain its founding principle of non-interference in members'
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Such an important principle, which formed the bedrock of ASEAN
cooperation, should be maintained and any move to set aside the
principle would be detrimental to the regional grouping, Ajit said
here after receiving Indonesia's "Bintang Jasa Utama" Award for
his contribution towards forging closer cooperation between
Indonesia and the other ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
Ajit, a Malaysian diplomat, who served as the first elected
secretary- general of ASEAN from 1993 to 1997, received the award
from Indonesian Ambassador in Malaysia Muhamad Jacob Dasto here.
</P>
<P>
Ajit told reporters that ASEAN's strength lay in the
non-interference policy and this was also part of its life and
culture but this did not mean that ASEAN was not open to changes
and new ideas.
</P>
<P>
"If we put this principle aside or allow it to be adulterated,
I think it will only be to the detriment of ASEAN," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ajit also said globalization and advances in information
technology would pose challenges to ASEAN in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Free movement of money, investment, services and people across
borders are phenomena which developing countries have not been
able to comprehend, he said, adding ASEAN countries aware of this
now were taking steps to face up the challenges as evident from
the commitment made at the Hanoi Summit last December by ASEAN
leaders determined to come out from the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Ajit also referred to the prospect of ASEAN having a single
currency as Europe now, saying that he could not see such
possibility at this stage, but the idea could not be dismissed
entirely as in Hanoi, the (ASEAN) leaders called for a study on
this.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Flags Burned by Kurds outside UN office in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish demonstrators burned
the flags of Turkey, the United States and Israel outside a United
Nations office in Australia's biggest city Sydney Tuesday, and
warned of further protest over the capture of their rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
The rally was peaceful, in stark contrast to last week's
violent demonstration, during which 65 Kurdish protesters were
arrested after storming Sydney's Greek Consulate.
</P>
<P>
This time, the Kurds alerted police in advance of a rally by
some 200 protesters, including women and children, the Australian
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
A large contingent of police was on stand-by, about 30 of them
lined up three-deep across the front of the United Nations
Information Office in York St, in central Sydney, as the
demonstrators chanted "Freedom for Ocalan" and "We will die for
Ocalan"
</P>
<P>
Speakers told the crowd that Israeli and U.S. intelligence
agencies had "aided and abetted" the "abduction" of Ocalan, who
was captured outside the Greek Embassy in Kenya last week and
returned to Turkey to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
Eziz Bawermand, a former member of the Kurdish parliament in
exile, later denied that comments in a letter headed: "To all
decent men and women" handed out to members of the media
constituted a threat of violence.
</P>
<P>
The letter, distributed to journalists, said, in part:
</P>
<P>
"We warn that if something happens to President Ocalan in
Turkish custody, Kurdish may well burst into highly destructive
violence involving people and property all over the world."
</P>
<P>
"This is not meant to be a threat but a considered warning," it
said.

<P>
HANGZHOU, February 23 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang
Province, a major economic powerhouse on the East China Sea, has
introduced a licensing system for the use of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
The first group of enterprises, including a number of ventures
from other provinces, were recently granted licenses to develop 62
hectares of coastal waters off Daishan County.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Zhejiang Provincial Oceanic Bureau said
introduction of the system represents a major step in efforts to
strengthen protection of the sea which has long been subject to
excess exploitation and pollution.
</P>
<P>
The province has targeted the development of sea areas as a new
growth area in recent years, with massive construction in progress
along the coast and around major islands.
</P>
<P>
The Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee adopted the
Regulations on the Use of Sea Waters in 1998 as part of an effort
to ensure the rational and efficient use of marine resources.
</P>
<P>
The regulations require licenses for enterprises planning to
use sea waters for more than three months for industrial, tourism,
waste discharge and pipeline projects.

<HEADLINE> Flood-hit Residents Move into New Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The relocation of flood-
affected residents and the reconstruction of their new homes in
Jiangxi Province have been progressing smoothly, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
More than 460,000 flood victims are now being resettled. About
120,000 households are expected move into newly built towns and
villages, a provincial council on assistance to the flood-hit
people indicated.
</P>
<P>
Total housing coverage will reach 10.5 million square meters to
meet the demands of the homeless people.
</P>
<P>
The relocation, the biggest in the province's history, has
posed great challenges for the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
China Daily quoted a local construction official as saying that
"it's nothing short of rebuilding a brand-new medium-sized city
and moving all new citizens into it."
</P>
<P>
The province was one of the worst hit regions in China during
last summer's floods.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure such as roads, power transmission lines and
wired communications were damaged.
</P>
<P>
Floods killed hundreds of people and brought heavy losses to
more than 50 counties and cities in the province.
</P>
<P>
Reacting with energy to the disaster, the government held
various meetings to boost the morale of grassroots cadres and
affected residents.
</P>
<P>
"It is still tough to persuade people to leave their homes or
the area they have inhabited for decades," the official was quoted
by the paper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has set up a Relocation and Reconstruction
Office managed by officials from 18 governmental departments to
facilitate the reconstruction work.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Sabah State to Hold Election Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Sabah state
will hold the ninth state election on March 12 and 13, the
Election Commission announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nomination date was fixed for March 2, commission chairman
Harun Din announced at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The 48-seat State Legislative Assembly, whose five-year mandate
ends on March 18, was dissolved Monday to pave way for the state
election.
</P>
<P>
The commission's latest electoral roll for Sabah, East
Malaysia, shows an electorate of 726,690, including 13,296 postal
voters.
</P>
<P>
In the just-dissolved assembly, the Barisan National (BN)
(National Front) held 43 seats while the opposition Parti Bersatu
Sabah (PBS) (Sabah Unity Party) had four and the remaining one
seat was held by an Independent.
</P>
<P>
Sabah BN comprises of nine component parties with six parties
having seats in the state legislature and three others no
representation in the assembly.
</P>
<P>
Besides the 48 elected seats, the state assembly also had six
nominated assemblymen, three each by BN and PBS.
</P>
<P>
The PBS won the last state election with 25 seats for a simple
majority in the previous state election held on February 18 and
19, 1994, but the state government collapsed after only three
weeks in power when most of its assemblymen defected to the BN
which then formed the state government.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Announces Top Name-Brand Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial and commercial city, has announced its top 50 name-
brand products, the first such announcement ever.
</P>
<P>
Steel products manufactured by the Baoshan Iron and Steel
Complex are at the top of the list, followed by Sanren industrial
chemicals from the Shanghai Petrochemical Co. Ltd. and Haipai
lubricating oil produced by the Shanghai Oil Refinery.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Shanghai Name-Brand Recommendation
Commission referred to this move as part of the city's ambitious
plan to promote three to five local products into the world's top
500 by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Listing top name-brand goods may guide consumers and prompt
manufacturers to improve the quality of their products, the
official explained.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai launched a campaign to promote name-brand products
several years ago, and has since approved 282 items.
</P>
<P>
The top 50 are based on assessment of sales, profits, market
shares and enterprise assets.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that these top 50 name-brand products achieved
more than 112.1 billion yuan in sales and 17.1 billion yuan in
profits in 1997, accounting for 74 percent of the sales and
profits of the 282 products.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's fight against
construction pollution has been going well over the past few years
as a result of stricter enforcement of anti-pollution regulations.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Environmental Protection
Administration show that 85 percent of the construction projects
in the country have been assessed to determine their effect on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The country promulgated a regulation on pollution control at
construction projects last year, which provides important legal
means for preventing new construction pollution, and many chemical
and pharmaceutical projects have since been canceled because of
inadequate pollution-control facilities.
</P>
<P>
The country's laws regarding environmental protection, water
and air pollution control, and land and ocean pollution control
also contain specific stipulations for environmental protection at
construction projects.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Export Earnings Fall Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh fetched 2.56 billion
U.S. dollars from its exports in the first half of the current
July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year, falling 11.7 percent short of
target and 1.5 percent lower than the same period of the previous
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in an export report prepared by the Export
Promotion Bureau (EPB), which was available here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Except for tea, export targets of major earning sectors
including ready-made garments, frozen food, leather, raw jute and
jute goods were not achieved during the period.
</P>
<P>
Exports by the garment sector, the biggest foreign exchange
earner of the country, earned about 1.49 billion dollars during
the July-December period, which is 4.9 percent less than the
target of 1.57 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Knitwear worth 454 million dollars was exported against the
target of 565 million dollars during the period, 19.6 percent
lower than the target and 9.2 percent higher than the same period
of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Frozen food worth over 154 million dollars was exported in the
period against the target of 160 million dollars. Earnings from
this sector was 3.6 percent less than the target and 19.6 percent
lower than the same period of the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from jute goods was 139.5 million dollars against the
target of 150 million dollars in the period, which fell short by
seven percent of the target. Raw jute worth 29.6 million dollars
was exported during the period against the target of 60 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tea worth 25.4 million dollars was exported in the period
against the target of 25 million, 1.4 percent higher than the
target.
</P>
<P>
The country earned 945.3 million dollars by exporting different
products to the United States during the period, which accounted
for 36.9 percent of its total export earnings.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the fall in the export earnings is the
worst flood the country experienced in a century during the
July-September period last year, the EPB report stated.

<HEADLINE> Albania Reiterates Support for Kosovo Albanian Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government on
Monday reiterated its support for the position of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanians in their ongoing peace talks with Serbs in Rambouillet,
France.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko said the government appreciated
and supported all efforts made by ethnic Albanian political
parties and military forces in seeking a solution to the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Rambouillet negotiations were a serious effort by the
international community to seek a peaceful settlement to the issue,
Majko said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Albania held that any agreement between the two sides must be
enforced by NATO troops in Kosovo and it must allow ethnic
Albanians to express their will for independence.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Albanian prime minister said that the
Albanian government would stand by any decision the ethnic
Albanians made.
</P>
<P>
But the Serbs have so far refused to allow the presence of
foreign troops in Kosovo as part of a peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks in Rambouillet have a deadline for an agreement on
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Municipal Polls Begin in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The three-day purashava
(municipal) elections in 136 out of the 182 municipalities across
Bangladesh started at 8:00 a.m. local time Tuesday despite strong
resistance from the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the elections, some 1,388,000 voters in 54
municipalities will cast their votes to elect the chairmen and
commissioners of their respective cities. Fifty-four chairmen and
522 ward commissioners would be elected Tuesday at 900 polling
centers.
</P>
<P>
Elections will be held in 32 municipalities on Wednesday, and
in the remaining 50 on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
About 3,098,000 voters will elect 136 chairmen, 1,305 ward
commissioners and 435 women commissioners in the municipal
elections. Forty-two candidates, including five chairmen, 26 ward
commissioners and 11 women commissioners from the reserved seats
have already been elected unopposed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 516 contestants are vying for 136 chairman posts,
5,925 for 1,295 ward commissioner posts and 1,678 women for 432
reserved seats. This is the first time that reserved seats for
women have been introduced in the country's city elections.
</P>
<P>
To maintain law and order and to hold the elections in a
peaceful atmosphere, the Election Commission has deployed some
56,000 security forces, including the armed forces, the Bangladesh
Rifles and the Armed Police Battalion in relevant municipal areas.
</P>
<P>
The Home Ministry has identified 28 districts as risky areas.
As extra precaution, one company of army comprising around five
platoon soldiers would be deployed in the 28 districts during the
polls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the opposition alliance, comprising the major
opposition -- the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party,
the Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote and others, started
their three-day hartal at 6:00 a.m. Tuesday to resist the polls.
</P>
<P>
The BNP-led alliance, calling on their members and leaders to
refrain from participating in the polls, vowed to foil the
elections if their four-point demand, including the resignation of
the chief election commissioner and distribution of voter identity
cards before the elections, was not met by the government.
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech on Monday night on the eve of the
elections, Chief Election Commissioner Mohammad Abu Hena sought
active cooperation from all irrespective of parties to make the
municipal elections "free and fair."
</P>
<P>
"The Election Commission has taken all possible effective steps
for holding the elections free and impartial," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Clash With Iraq at Security Council Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain on Monday clashed with Iraq at the end of the United
Nations Security Council's day-long debate on the topic of
protecting civilians in armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain told the Security Council that
they were patrolling the no-fly zones over Iraq to protect Iraqi
citizens from their own government while Iraq accused them of
killing Iraq's civilians.
</P>
<P>
Calling for lifting sanctions against his country, Iraq's
Ambassador to the United Nations, Saeed Hasan said they had
claimed the lives of a million and a half of Iraqi civilians,
devastated the country's infrastructure and killed 10 Iraqi
children every hour.
</P>
<P>
"The two states, permanent members of the Security Council,
consider themselves above the law," he said, referring to the
United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
On the air strikes by both countries against targets in the
north and south of Iraq, Hasan said the Security Council had a
good opportunity to protect the Iraqi civilians through preventing
the daily use of force by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Hasan said the United States and Britain were the last to
lecture people on respect for international law and the U.N.
Charter and the last entitled to shed crocodile tears over the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Peter Burleigh, American Representative to the United Nations,
said the use of force against Iraq resulted from its refusal to
fulfill its obligations under relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Burleigh said the no-fly zones were created "for the purpose of
protecting Iraqi civilians from the depredations of the Iraqi
regime."
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's Ambassador to the United Nations,
said the no-fly zones were established "to help protect the
civilian population in the north and south from repression by the
government of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Any actions taken by my government in the no-fly zones are
taken purely in self-defense and as a direct result of Iraqi
threats and attacks," Greenstock said.

<HEADLINE> Zhu's Visit to Promote Sino-Russian Relations (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China and Russia have established mechanisms for an exchange of
visits by heads of state, regular meetings between prime ministers
and regular talks between foreign ministers in order to ensure the
sustained, steady and healthy development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the two nations have met six times over the past
six years and more, with Chinese and Russian prime ministers
holding talks on three occasions since December 1996 following the
establishment of a regular meeting mechanism.
</P>
<P>
Related meetings have effectively promoted cooperation and
strengthened relations in every sphere.
</P>
<P>
However, observers have pointed out that some problems in
various fields, including economic cooperation and trade issues,
have aroused concern on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Last year's bilateral trade volume was merely over five billion
US dollars, a level which both sides considered far from
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will explore ways to open new areas of growth in
bilateral trade and economic cooperation during Premier Zhu's
visit.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, veteran experts hold that the sound foundation for
the further growth of trade and economic cooperation is based on
the fact that China and Russia have long been major long-term
trade partners.
</P>
<P>
"Sino-Russian trade relations will continue to grow as long as
the two sides engage in a concerted effort to diversify the mode
of related activities in accordance with international norms,
especially in terms of accelerating regional economic and trade
cooperation and refining the legal environment," according to one
expert.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Officially Recognizes Macedonian Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria and Macedonia reached
an agreement on Monday officially recognizing the Macedonian
language, ending a long-standing dispute which had soured
relations between the two countries since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which finally allows the two countries to sign joint
agreements, was signed here by Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan
Kostov and his Macedonian counterpart Ljubco Georgievski.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia held that the Macedonian language should be an

Macedonia when it broke away from the former Yugoslavia, had
insisted that it was only a dialect of western Bulgarian.
</P>
<P>
The countries have until now been unable to sign bilateral
accords because of the language problem. Therefore, the two
countries immediately signed seven accords on Monday.
</P>

visit, signed a joint statement with his Bulgarian counterpart on
Monday, agreeing to develop an all-around cooperative ties between

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian ruling Golkar
(Functional Group) Chairman Akbar Tanjung Monday vowed that the
party would support the House of Representatives' ratification of
a United Nations convention against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
The ratification itself has been on the list of bills to be
endorsed by the House before its present session ends next April
1.
</P>
<P>
In a party meeting in Pontianak, capital of West Kalimantan
province, Akbar said that Golkar wished to see all Indonesian
citizens free of discrimination, arguing that everybody is equal
before the law.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of their descent, Tionghoa (Chinese-Indonesian),
Arab-Indonesian or Indian-Indonesian, everyone is the same before
the law," Akbar was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Chinese-Indonesians comprise 14 percent of West Kalimantan's
four million population, the third largest number after the
indigenous Dayaks and the Malays.
</P>
<P>
Akbar, touring the region as part of the party's nationwide
consolidation, pointed out that Chinese-Indonesians would no
longer face discrimination, citing citizenship documents.
</P>

In a presidential instruction dated September 16, President
B.J. Habibie ordered ministers, heads of state agencies,
governors, mayors and regents to dispense with the terms pribumi
(indigenous) and nonpribumi (nonindigenous).

<HEADLINE> Tomb of Ancient Chinese Emperor Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- The exact burial site of
Chinese Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang, disputed among Chinese historians
for 600 years, was confirmed recently.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Yuanzhang, founder of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), his
wife and 46 concubines were buried in an underground tomb at
Wanzhu Peak near the Mingxiao Mausoleum in Nanjing, capital of
east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The location of the tomb was determined recently as a result of
precision magnetic tests conducted over an area of 20,000 square
meters near the Mingxiao Mausoleum, which was completed in 1381 as
the tomb of Zhu Yuanzhang after 32 years of construction.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the reason for the many years of mystery surrounding
the location of the emperor's tomb, one cultural-relics scholar
said, "Emperor Zhu ordered coffins carried out of 13 city gates
upon his death in an attempt to hide the exact coffin containing
his remains."
</P>
<P>
The recent tests also confirmed the layout of the tomb. "It is
large and has a complicated structure," said one archeologist. "
The passage leading to the tomb chamber is 120 meters, the longest
ever found in China."
</P>
<P>
Zhu's tomb was well preserved, with no signs of grave robbers
detected. Further investigation of the site is continuing.
</P>
<P>
Cultural-relics authorities have also discovered the ruins of a
side hall at the Mingxiao Mausoleum. It is 70 meters long and 10
meters wide, with a total area of 700 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Investigations revealed that the side hall was rebuilt twice in
the past 600 years.
</P>
<P>
Discovery of the side hall has filled a gap in the study of the
architectural style and building materials used in the Ming
Dynasty, according to one local archeologist.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China is seeking to develop
more arable plots from wastelands in face of overpopulated farming
areas, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The most remarkable significance in land rehabilitation is
that it can increase China's arable land by 13.33 million hectares,
by making better use of existing land and rehabilitating
wastelands," Gao Xiangjun, director of the National Land
Rehabilitation Center, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
He added that the campaign will also better local residents'
living standards and enhance ecology in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
China has only 0.106 hectares of arable land per capita, less
than half of world's average.
</P>
<P>
Gao said the new State Land Administration Law, which took
effect on January 1, adopts more effective measures to improve the
balance between land developed for non-agricultural purposes and
the rehabilitation of waste land.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that a new series of regulations will be worked
out and put into effect this year to strengthen the management of
land resources in accordance with the national comprehensive
planning on land use.
</P>
<P>
A group of land-rehabilitation projects and pilot zones will be
established across the country this year, according to Gao.

Culture Organization (UNESCO) were very impressed by the stone
sculptures in Dazu during their inspection last year.
</P>
<P>
The more than 50,000 stone sculptures in Dazu (which literally
means "Big Foot" in Chinese) in the northwest of Chongqing,
provide a faithful and complete record of how Buddhism gradually
gained popularity in southwest China more than 1,000 years ago,
said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The majority were carved during the late Tang Dynasty (618-907
AD) and the Song Dynasty (960-1279). And the Dazu sculptures
marked the second consummate level of carving arts in Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
The first pinnacle of carving arts was represented by
sculptures in Dunhuang, Gansu Province, which were created in the
Sui Dynasty (581-618 AD) and the early Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO experts were particularly interested in sculptures
portraying ordinary people in their daily life. They rejoiced at
seeing details of farmers' everyday lives and work, their farming
tools and household utensils as well as their dress habits,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chongqing municipal government has allocated 12
million yuan (1.45 million US dollars) to clear away buildings
that spoil the harmony of the relics site.

<HEADLINE> China to Make Big Investment to Expand Railways </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 23 (Xinhua) -- China's railway system will
get a major facelift this year to cope with both a growing
domestic demand and challenges from buses and airlines, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary investment was to hit 55 billion yuan (6.6 billion
US dollars) and the Ministry of Railway plans to provide 49
billion yuan (5.9 billion US dollars) of this amount, according
sources from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's blueprint, 1,320 kilometers of new
railway track would be laid, of which 1,000 kilometers would be
put into operation by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The 15 leading projects include the Southern Xinjiang Line,
Neijiang-Kunming Line and Shenfu-Yan'an Line, located in west
China.
</P>
<P>
Another top agenda project is the expansion of double-track
lines by 970 kilometers through 14 new projects, including the
Baoji-Chengdu Line , Baotou-Lanzhou Line, Xiaoshan-Ningbo Line,
the second bridge over the Qiantang River and the Wuhu Bridge over
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
In addition, four electrified lines, totaling 730 kilometers,
will be put into operation by this year. They are: the Harbin-
Dalian, Chengdu-Kunming, Wuhan-Guangzhou and Chongqing-Daxian
lines.
</P>
<P>
China's vast railway system carries about one billion people
annually traveling on the 66,000 kilometers of track.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Mulls over 2006 Asian Games Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Minister of Youth
Sports Affairs Agung Laksono has called for the national sports
convention, which began here Monday, to discuss further the bid
for the 2006 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"I want the plan to be discussed and studied in terms of its
chances and the requirements that need to be worked out for us to
become the hosts of this Asian sporting event," Agung said after
delivering his speech at the convention.
</P>
<P>
The convention, officially opened by President B.J. Habibie at
the Presidential Palace, is being attended by 400 participants,
including representatives from the 27 provincial sports boards in
Indonesia. They will continue to meet until Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said to stage the Asian Games was not an easy task
and would need an assessment of the technical requirements,
administrative performance, athlete availability, financial
support, as well as facilities.
</P>
<P>
The government would support the National Sports Council (KONI),
which mooted the idea, only after a study shows that chances of
winning the bid are strong and that it does not have the potential
to saddle the government with further obligations, Agung was
quoted by the Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia previously hosted the Asian Games in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the 1962 experience was not guaranteed to
impress the Olympic Council of Asia, which sanctioned the Asian
Games.
</P>
<P>
"Good organization of the games has yet to be proven," Agung
said, calling for the need to lobby other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
While being content with existing sports facilities in Jakarta,
the minister also warned against any outbursts from fans.
</P>
<P>
Should Indonesia proceed with the bid, it may face a tough
challenge from Malaysia along with United Arab Emirates and India.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had bidden for hosting the 1998 Asian Games but was
beaten by Thailand's Bangkok.

WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson will learn
Wednesday whether he will lose privileges and credit for good
behavior for throwing a TV last Friday during an outburst at
Montgomery County Correction Center.
</P>
<P>
Tyson faces a closed hearing at the center Wednesday and a
ruling will be announced after that.
</P>

Department spokesman Eric Seleznow said jail officials cited
Tyson for destruction of property, assault on correctional staff
and disorderly conduct. A disciplinary panel will measure Tyson's
level of responsibility. Penalties could include loss of
privileges and credit for good behavior in time served.
</P>
<P>
"Officials have three working days to have a hearing to
consider all the facts relevant to the incident," Seleznow said. "
At this point, we're not considering criminal charges."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Army in Montenegro Vows to Defend Territory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's army and navy
commands in Montenegro on Monday vowed to defend the territory in
case of conflict with NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
In meetings with the visiting federal Prime Minister Momir
Bulatovic and Defense Minister Pavel Bulatovic in the Montenegro
capital of Podgrica, the army and navy commanders said the forces
were on the alert against foreign military threats.
</P>
<P>
The forces' determination has been repeated despite Montenegro
government's decision last Friday to bar resistance to foreign
armed forces on its territory.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued on Sunday, the army and navy
commands in Montenegro, one of the two republics of Yugoslavia,
blasted the republic's anti-defense decision as running against
the constitution and affecting the defense ability of the country.
</P>
<P>
Various parties and non-governmental organizations in
Yugoslavia harshly criticized Montenegro's decision on Monday,
describing it as an act of treason.
</P>
<P>
About 400 NATO warplanes are reportedly ready to launch attacks
upon Yugoslavia if it does not allow foreign troops to enter
Kosovo and supervise a proposed peace agreement between ethnic
Albanians and the Serbs.

<P>
SOFIA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Bulgaria and
Romania said Monday they support the efforts of the six-nation
Contact Group for seeking peaceful solutions to the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
In a joint letter to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic,
Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov and his Romanian counterpart
Emil Constantinescu said a peaceful solution acceptable to all
concerned is the only way to stop the dangerous escalation of the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
But such a solution should guarantee the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, and safeguard the rights of
all nationalities in the Serbian province of Kosovo, they added.
</P>
<P>
With less than 24 hours to go before reaching the Tuesday
deadline, the Kosovo peace talks hung in the balance on Monday in
Rambouillet, France, with no apparent signs of a breakthrough from
the Serb and ethnic Albanian delegations.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the conflict in Kosovo has claimed roughly 2,
000 lives and displaced around 300,000 people.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Judge Holds Cabinet Secretaries in Contempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal judge held
two Cabinet secretaries in contempt Monday over the government's
delay in producing records of Indian trust funds.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth issued the contempt order,
saying Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt failed to produce documents related to a class-
action lawsuit over the mishandling of 300,000 Indian accounts
worth an estimated 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The secretaries and Assistant Interior Secretary Kevin Gover
were ordered to pay legal fees and other expenses that resulted
from their delay in complying with Lamberth's November 1996 order
to produce documents.
</P>
<P>
"I have never seen more egregious misconduct by the federal
government," Lamberth said in his order.
</P>
<P>
The judge's ruling followed a contempt hearing last month.
</P>
<P>
The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs was
ordered two years ago to turn over statements, checks and other
documents on accounts held by five Indians who are the lead
plaintiffs in the suit against the Interior and Treasury
departments.
</P>
<P>
So far, only a small number of the documents have been produced.
</P>
<P>
The Treasury Department had no immediate reaction to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Department issued a statement saying correcting
decades-long problems with the management of the Indian trust
funds remained one of Babbitt's "highest priorities".

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Architect to Design Roman Arts Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 22 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi architect won on Monday
the international competition to design a new contemporary arts
center for Rome.
</P>
<P>
Zaha Hadid's design, which won out over 15 other finalists,
stood out for its innovative use of textures and a spectacular use
of lateral light, the organizer of competition said.
</P>
<P>
The arts center is expected to take about three years to build.
It will cover 26,000 square meters in a former army barracks in
northern Rome and cost an estimated 140 billion lire (about 82
million U.S. dollars
</P>
<P>
"I tried to create not an object but an urban structure able to
unite external and internal spaces through new forms," said Hadid
after receiving the official award today from Italian Culture
Minister Giovanna Melandri.
</P>
<P>
"The basic idea was to set the artistic space in an open
complex, to use a horizontal arrangement to exploit natural light
and to use walls as an element of sinuosity," Hadid explained.
</P>
<P>
Reinforced concrete will be played off against glass and metal
panels so as to make the most of the different textures and colors
of the materials, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hadid, 49, a British-trained architect, has previously won a
competition to design the British town of Cardiff's opera house
and is currently working on an arts center in Cincinnati of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The international competition launched by the Italian public
works and cultures ministries in July marks the first time in
Italy to use this method to find a designer for a major Italian
public work.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Israel to Implement Mideast Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'
Alema on Monday urged Israel to implement the accords reached with
the Palestinians in the Wye Plantation talks in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
who arrived here Monday on a two-day official visit, D'Alema said
under the present situation major progress toward peace was
unlikely but steps backward should "absolutely be avoided."
</P>
<P>
"Italy asks that there be immediate implementation of the Wye
Plantation accords and that there be no provocative decisions on
such things as new Israeli settlements, which would push the peace
process back," D'Alema added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Palestinians to show restraint at this
difficult time for Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who discussed the Middle East peace process and other
international issues with D'Alema, said Egypt would continue to
push for progress towards peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini met
with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Mussa. The two ministers later
released a joint statement, urging Israel to fulfill its
commitments under the Wye Plantation accords.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat struck a breakthrough land-for-peace
agreement at the Wye Plantation in Maryland on October 23, 1998,
after nine days of intense negotiations mediated by U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement marked a critical step forward in
the Middle East peace process, but the implementation of the
agreement did not progress smoothly.

<HEADLINE> Copper Price Falls to Lowest in 50 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The international price of
copper, the principal Chilean export, continued to fall rapidly
and on Monday fell to 61.5 cents of the dollar, the lowest in
fifty years.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean Copper Commission (CCC) said that with the rate,
the monthly price of the red metal reached 64.4 cents of the
dollar, while the annual price was placed at 64.7 cents.
</P>
<P>
The organization explained that the fall was due to the fall in
demand of the metal on the international markets by Asian crisis
started in mid 1997.
</P>
<P>
Monday's copper price is the lowest in real terms of the last
50 years, and in nominal terms, the lowest since February 6, 1987,
while the international inventory continues rising and is placed
at 690,725 tons on the London stock exchange of metals.
</P>
<P>
Chile is the world's top producer of copper, the metal which
earns around 40 percent of hard currency for the country each year,
and its price is used as an annual reference to calculate the
national budget.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the price of copper on the international markets
closed with an average of 74.97 cents of the dollar, against an
average of 103.22 cents in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The actual price of copper is 12 cents below that contemplated
for this year in the Chilean national budget, although the
authorities say there will be a recuperation in the second half of
the year.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Says He Will Sign with Lakers Tonight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Rodman complained
about playing for the "minimum wage", broke into tears and
announced he will join the Los Angeles Lakers in a news conference
today at Planet Hollywood in California.
</P>
<P>
Rodman confirmed that he will sign with the Lakers tonight, and
the team also said it needs him very soon.
</P>
<P>
At first, Rodman played it coy and revealed only that he had
talks with the Lakers and might play for them. After an angry
reporter demanded that Rodman be more definitive regarding his
future plans, the seven-time rebounding king grew belligerent.
</P>
<P>
"You don't have to be here if you don't want to be here. You
can walk out that door," Rodman said. "OK, I do want to play for
the Lakers. Are you satisfied? Now you can go."
</P>
<P>
That set the tone for the bizarre news conference in which
Rodman complained about being paid the minimum, yet claimed he
plays for the "people" and not the money. He broke into tears when
a reporter branded him a selfish player.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever I do in the game of basketball, I will never win,"
Rodman said, taking time to compose himself after tears flowed
from beneath his sunglasses. "I'm playing for the minimum wage.
With my donation to charity, I'll only be making about $150,000,
yet I'm still not going to win with you guys. If that's selfish,
you let me know.
</P>
<P>
Rodman hopes to sign a contract with the Lakers tonight after
meeting with owner Jerry Buss and plans to play his first game
Thursday against the Los Angeles Clippers in Anaheim. The Lakers
said they will try to reach an agreement with Rodman.
</P>
<P>
The 37-year-old Rodman said he will receive $495,000, the pro-
rated total for a player signing for the 10-year veteran minimum
of $1 million. Taxes and charitable donations will reduce his
salary to $150,000, he said. Rodman made $9 million last season.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by his new wife, actress Carmen Electra, Rodman
took some shots at his prospective new teammates.
</P>
<P>
"Kobe (Bryant) and Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal) are trying to carry
the load and everybody else has their finger up their (butt)," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rodman said it would be good for the league to have him back.
</P>
<P>
"I see that the NBA right now is struggling to try to have some
kind of image," he said. "The NBA right now is not even the way it
should be this year because a lot of people are having career lows,
other people are having self-doubts about themselves, a lot of
people are out of shape, a lot of people are not even who they are.
And basically if I come back in the league I will give the league
something to write about, something to talk about, some excitement.
"
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were to play Denver tonight, but Rodman said he need
not to travel there.
</P>
<P>
"I think there's enough distraction as it is," he said. "I
think I'll wait till they come back and I can go to the practice
and meet with the guys, whatever, and hope that they accept me. If
I feel like I'm not being greeted to come on this team I'll step
away."
</P>
<P>
The former Bulls star said he is in good shape and would be
reliable, playing up to 35 minutes a game.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Import 2.5 Million Tons of Rice This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 23 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will import as much
as 2.5 million tons of rice this year to ensure sufficient
domestic supply, according to Minister of Trade and Industry
Rahardi Ramelan.
</P>
<P>
The minister told legislators during a hearing with House of
Representatives (DPR) Commission V dealing with manpower and trade
affairs here Monday that Indonesia would, wherever possible, seek
foreign assistance to help finance the planned imports.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had received pledges of assistance from a number of
countries such as Japan (which would give a grant and soft loans),
Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and the World Food Program (grants
and soft loans), Rahardi said.
</P>
<P>
The imports were also needed to stabilize the domestic price,
the minister was quoted by Antara News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although this year's harvest was expected to be better than
last year's, the volume of its yield would still be below the
level reached in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The government has predicted that the country's unhusked rice
production would not meet the set target of 52 million tons this
year. Heavy rains caused by the La Nina weather phenomenon and the
scarcity of fertilizers could cut the output of unhusked rice to
only 48 million tons or 29 million tons of milled rice.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has produced 46.44 million tons of unhusked rice last
year, lower than the 49.38 million tons recorded in 1997.

SANTIAGO, Chile, February 22 (Xinhua) -- President of the
Chilean Olympic Committee (COCh) Sergio Santander on Monday
resigned from the post following accusation of his involvement in
the Salt Lake City vote-for-cash bidding scandal.

<P>
GENEVA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The newly-formed Football
Committee of the Federation Internationale de Football Association
(FIFA) has made a unanimous call for a harmonized international
calendar but differences remained about the proposal that the
World Cup be held every two years.
</P>
<P>
At the committee's first meeting at the FIFA headquarters in
the Swiss city of Zurich, Chairman Angel Maria Villar of Spain
stressed the importance of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said the world was awaiting its conclusions with interest
for issues like the call for the creation of a mandatory unified
calendar worldwide by 2004 at the latest, and continued moves
towards the professionalization of refereeing.
</P>
<P>
In debating FIFA President Sepp Blatter's idea for the World Cup,
presently a quadrennial event, to be played on a two-year cycle,
committee members agreed that this would only be possible if the
international match calendar were synchronized.
</P>
<P>
The committee contains personalities such as Pele, Franz
Beckenbauer and Hugo Sanchez, as well as referees, coaches and
other officials.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Approve FA Cup Rematch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- World soccer governing body
FIFA have given the go-ahead for Arsenal to replay their FA Cup
round five tie with Sheffield United on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The organization had questioned the rematch, agreed by both
clubs and the FA after Arsenal's controversial "winner" in the
first meeting on 13 February.
</P>
<P>
But in another twist to the saga, FIFA have announced that they
consider the original result from the game as valid and shall be
entered in the record books.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA spokesman said that both teams needed to provide a
written document setting out their wish to accept the result of
the re-match.
</P>
<P>
"Both teams must provide a written declaration that they will
accept the outcome of Tuesday's re-match as decisive for
qualification for the next round."
</P>
<P>
"What we have here is a re-match by mutual consent .. we can't
say it didn't take place because it did. But Tuesday's match
counts for qualification. It's a weird situation," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The body also suggested some of the receipts from the game
should be donated to charity. Arsenal have already halved the
entry price to the sell-out match.

<HEADLINE> FA Rejects Carragher Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool defender Jamie
Carragher has lost his appeal against his controversial dismissal
in the Premiership match at Charlton.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association upheld referee Mike Reed's decision to
send off the England Under-21 star for raising his arm to Martin
Pringle, as Liverpool lost 1-0 at the Valley on February 13.
</P>
<P>
Carragher must now serve a three-match ban for violent conduct.
</P>
<P>
Anfield manager Gerard Houllier was so furious with the red
card that he launched a verbal attack on Reed and asked for a
video of the incident to be sent to the FA's headquarters at
Lancaster Gate with an official appeal.
</P>
<P>
Pringle fell to the floor holding his throat, but replays
seemed to show Carragher's arm actually hit him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
However, after viewing the incident, the FA's disciplinary
bosses decided the 21-year-old was guilty as charged because his
arm had been used illegally.

WASHINGTON -- A U.S. federal judge Monday refused to step
aside and let another judge decide whether to cite President Bill
Clinton for contempt over his testimony in the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright said a conservative
legal group did not provide sufficient grounds for why she should
remove herself.
</P>
<P>
Wright had offered to consider stepping aside because of her
contact with a House impeachment case prosecutor and because her
law clerk provided House managers with an affidavit.
</P>
<P>
The only request that Wright step aside came from Judicial
Watch, a legal group representing Dolly Kyle Browning, a witness
in Mrs. Jones' case who said she had an affair with Clinton before
he became president. (US-Judge-Clinton)

the dumping case against hot-rolled steel from Russia and set
preliminary duties ranging from 71 percent to 218 percent. Those
duties would be suspended when the deal becomes final. (US-Russia-

BERLIN, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
deflected questions Monday on Europe's position to the planned
declaration of Palestinian statehood by visiting Palestinian
chairman Yassir Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"There is a time for words and a time to remain silent. We will
remain silent for the time being and attempt to agree a common
position in Europe and... naturally with the U.S.," said Schroeder
at a joint news briefing with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Without using the term 'statehood,' Schroeder said Germany and
the European Union (E.U.) assumed the Palestinians would seek
self- determination under the terms of the Wye and Oslo peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said there would have to be close consulation on the
timing of any Palestinian moves with the E.U. and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Germany holds the rotating E.U. presidency for the first half
of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has said he will declare a Palestinian state sometime
after the May 4 date when the Oslo peace agreement expires. He has
not indicated if he plans to wait until after Israel's May 17
general election.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader, on the second visit to Bonn in three
weeks, earlier had talks with Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping
and Interior Minister Otto Schily.

<HEADLINE> World Seaborne Trade Slows Down in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- World seaborne trade
slowed down in 1998, growing at 2.2 percent, its lowest rate since
1987, according to preliminary estimates from United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).
</P>
<P>
The decrease from the 4.1 percent growth in 1997 was largely
due to sluggish trade in liquid bulk cargoes, UNCTAD said in a
press release on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown, the volume of world trade carried by sea
hit a new record of over five billion tons.
</P>
<P>
Trade contracted in several Asian countries and there was
fluctuating performance of African countries, but the overall
share of developing nations in world seaborne trade remained
virtually unchanged in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries share 51 percent of goods loaded,
compared with 51.2 percent in 1997, and 27.7 percent of goods
unloaded, the same as in 1997, UNCTAD said, adding that the goods
loaded figure reflected the heavy preponderance of these
countries' oil exports.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD figures indicated that the share of Asian developing
countries as a whole in goods loaded and unloaded fell marginally
last year to 26.2 percent and 18.7 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Libya Still Has Questions on Handover of Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Libya has raised
reservations about U.N. sanctions and prison arrangements in its
official response to a letter by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
on the surrender of two suspects involved in the Lockerbie case,
U.N. officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Spokesman Fred Eckhard told a press conference on Monday
that Libyan Foreign Minister Omar Mustafa al-Montasser had
responded over the weekend to "clarifications" Annan gave on a
trial of the two suspects before a Scottish court sitting in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"We did receive over the weekend a letter from the equivalent
of the foreign minister of Libya," Eckhard said. "There were still
some elements that he was requesting clarification on."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, without further elaboration, said, "We
are studying that letter."
</P>
<P>
Annan on Friday last week had been in touch with al-Montasser
and had given him explanations on the sanctions, diplomats here
said, adding that Tripoli feared that the U.N. sanctions might
remain unlifted.
</P>
<P>
A Pan Am airliner exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
December 1988, killing 270 people. Washington and London, which
dropped their insistence that the suspects be tried in either of the
country, accused the two Libyans of their involvement in blowing
up the jetliner and demand they be tried in the court based in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Currently at issue is the surrender of the two suspects. Libya
is against the U.S.-UK proposal that the two, if convicted, should
serve their sentences in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General would be reporting to the Security
Council, which is scheduled to review the sanctions against Libya,
this Friday," Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were first imposed in 1992 when Libya refused
to hand over the suspects for trial to either the United States
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
If Libya fails to surrender the two suspects by Friday, the
United States has said it would ask the 15-member Security
Council to tighten sanctions.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone has asked
the U.N. Security Council to intervene, by force if necessary, to
get rebels to negotiate an end to the West African country's civil
war.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a Sunday address to the nation by
Sierra Leonean President Ahmen Kabbah, whose speech text was
circulated here on Monday by the Sierra Leonean Mission to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the Security Council to consider the possibility of
taking further action, not excluding the threat of force, against
the rebels and their supporters, in order to give effect to the
Council's previous demands that they 'cease all violence and seek
gennuine dialogue for the restoration of lasting peace and stability

</P>

"The Security Council should act before it is too late," he
said, "The consequences of inaction or of continued lukewarm
responses, would be disastrous, not only for the people of Sierra
Leone, but also for millions of their neighbors in the entire West
African sub-region."
</P>
<P>
Kabbah's statement, delivered late on Sunday in the capital
Freetown, followed reports of fresh rebel attacks in eastern
diamond-mining areas of the country.

<P>
Fighting for the eastern diamond towns of Tongefield and
Segbwema continued over the weekend, reports said. The rebels
retook the two towns some 10 days ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S Farm Exports to Drop Sharply in Fiscal 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Farm exports in the fiscal
year 1999 are estimated to drop to 49 billion U.S. dollars, 4.6
billion dollars less than that in fiscal 1998, the Agriculture
Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The estimate of farm exports for the current fiscal year, which
started on October 1, was lowered by 1.5 billion dollars from
November's projection of 50.5 billion dollars as global demand
lags while farmers' supplies increase, the department said.
</P>
<P>
One commodity particularly vulnerable to the global slowdown is
cotton, said the department's chief economist Keith Collins. He
noted that the projected 1.4 billion dollars in cotton exports is
the second lowest level in 20 years. Cotton exports were at 2.5
billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Soybean exports are forecast to drop almost 3.5 billion dollars
from last year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
It would be three to five years before U.S. farm exports
recover to the peak level of 60 billion dollars in 1996, according
to Collins.
</P>
<P>
The department blamed the falling of farm exports on the Asian
economic crisis and strong competition from other countries. Since
August last year, Russia's economy -- a major customer of U.S.
poultry for instance -- has also joined the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The drop in exports will likely cause further financial strain
in the nation's farmland. Ever since the phasing out of government
payments to farmers in the 1996 farm law, exports have become
increasingly important for maintaining prices for U.S. producers.
</P>
<P>
This year, farmers saw their prices drop to extremely low
levels in both commodities and livestock. Congress late last year
passed a 6-billion-dollar bailout to help farmers. The government
also agreed last month to give 50 million dollars to hog farmers,
now getting their lowest prices in four decades.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman reiterated Monday a call for
Congress to help farmers, mainly by overhauling the crop insurance
program. "We've got to be creative in the way we help our
farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
One of the largest drops in exports is to Japan, where the
continued recession has dropped the export estimate to 8 billion
dollars, 15 percent below 1998.
</P>
<P>
Overall, exports to Asia are forecast at 16.8 billion dollars,
compared to 19.6 billion dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence On Neanderthal Speech Capacity Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A research team from the
University of California at Berkeley has found new evidence that
challenges a recent assertion that the heavy-browed Neanderthals
may have had the capacity for speech.
</P>
<P>
According to Monday's Washington Post, Duke University
researchers reported last April that a bony tunnel called the
hypoglassal canal in the fossilized skulls of Neanderthals was
big enough to hold the nerve fibers necessary to perform the
complex tongue movements needed to speak.
</P>
<P>
That would have meant speech evolved much earlier than had
been thought, they said.
</P>
<P>
However the California University team looked at the skulls
of a number of nonhuman primates and found that many also had
large hypoglassal canals, some twice as large as the average
human, but they do not have the capacity of speech.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Ships, Planes Poised for Attack on Yugoslav Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
deployed its warships and warplanes in battle formation in the
Adriatic Sea, ready for attacks against Yugoslav targets, U.S.
defense officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
They said Washington will make the deployment if the Serbs have
still refused to accept a NATO-imposed peace deal by the deadline
of Tuesday's 3:00 p.m. Paris time (1400 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Two Navy surface ships -- one cruiser and one destroyer -- and
two submarines are now in or near the Adriatic Sea. They would
launch missiles from long range at targets that have been
selected, one of the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The four warships would fire as many as 80 highly-accurate
Tomahawk cruise missiles at the initial strike against the
Yugoslav targets to send a quick message to Belgrade without
risking the lives of allied pilots, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The highly-accurate, 18-foot (6-mete) Tomahawks with a range of
700 to 1,000 miles (1,120 to 1,600 km) are guided by satellite and
could be launched by the two surface ships and two submarines in
the region.
</P>
<P>
A total of 260 U.S. warplanes, including eight B-52 bombers in
Britain and 12 F-117 stealth fighters in Italy, would begin a
"phased" bombing campaign after the missile strikes, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The officials stressed that no final-go ahead had been given by
NATO for trikes and that intense talks between Serbs and Kosovar
Albanians were continuing in Rambouillte, outside of Paris.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who has been taking
part in the Kosovo peace talks in Rambouillet since Friday,
stressed over the weekend that no NATO strikes would be launched
against Yugoslavia if the talks broke down because of refusal by
both sides to reach agreement.
</P>
<P>
But if any collapse in the talks could be laid at the feet of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and Serb negotiators as the
West wished, Yugoslav targets would be almost certain to be hit by
U.S. and its allies' missiles.
</P>
<P>
Besides the preparation of military action, U.S. troops that
would take part in NATO's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo once a
peace deal is reached, are moving towards the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
A force of about 1,500 U.S. marines is steaming north in the
Aegean Sea toward the port of Thessaloniki in northern Greece
where they would embark to move into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Marines would be the vanguard of an eventual force of some
4,000 U.S. troops who would take part in a NATO peacekeeping force
of about 28,000.

<HEADLINE> European Markets Gain In Volatile Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- A strong start for the Dow
Jones Industrial Average on Wall Street injected some much-needed
life and direction into London's blue chips.
</P>
<P>
Poor results from HSBC dragged the FTSE-100 Index down for much
of a volatile session as financial stocks wallowed in negative
territory.
</P>
<P>
But after a rally during early trading on Wall Street, the
Footsie closed up 38.7 points at 6069.9 after tailing off slightly
in the last half hour from nearly 50 points ahead.
</P>
<P>
Fresh merger activity involving deals worth over 10 billion
U.S. dollars in the energy sector spurred the Dow, one dealer
said, while investors were said to be squring positions ahead of
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony on the economy
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
German shares finish on a firmer track, helped by steady
trading on Wall Street. The Xetra Dax index earlier hit a 4904.30
high and closed at 4887 - up 64 points.
</P>
<P>
Traders attributed the early gains also to a positive finish on
the Tokyo stock exchange today, but said the German market lost
momentum in thin trade.
</P>
<P>
French stocks pushed into positive ground in late trading,
after Wall Street began to firm up. Earlier shares in Paris
consolidated following a robust rise on the benchmark index on
previous session.
</P>
<P>
The CAC-40 eased 0.19 percent to 4,122.69 in mid-morning trade
on the day and closed up 35 at 4,165 points.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Reports 19 Percent Drop In Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation (HSBC) announced a sharp fall in profits to
6.57 billion U.S. dollars, down 19 percent, and were below what
analysts had been predicting.
</P>
<P>
"In a number of our major markets, 1998 was the toughest
economic condition for many years," group chairman John Bond told
a press conference Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group's large exposure in the Far East, which has been in
the grip of an economic crisis, has cost the corporation dear.
</P>
<P>
Loans to businesses in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and
China's Hongkong proved particularly difficult for the bank to
recoup.
</P>
<P>
Bond said 1999 was shaping up to be "very challenging." "Much
will depend on the performance of the U.S. economy and its ability
to continue a remarkable record of sustained growth," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Some Asian economies are expected to begin to recover; others
are still experiencing a severe downturn.... We remain confident
in the region's long term prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
The group chairman also said that HSBC would seek a listing on
the New York Stock Exchange during 1999 to supplement the existing
dual listings in London and Hongkong.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Respond to EU Trade Decision on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will only
respond to a decision by the European Union (EU) to delay the
adoption of a key free trade accord on Wednesday, a Trade and
Industry Ministry spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of EU foreign ministers in Luxemburg on Monday was
supposed to assess the deal drafted three weeks ago in Davos,
Switzerland by South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec
Erwin and EU commissioner Joao de Deus Pinheiro.
</P>
<P>
It is reported, however, that the EU has delayed approval of
the draft deal as France, Italy, Portugal and Spain have objected
to it.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman for Erwin said that Erwin has scheduled a press
briefing in Cape Town on Wednesday morning, by which time it was
hoped that the EU would have given South Africa official
notification of its decision.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was still awaiting official notification from the
EU on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has refused to re-open negotiations on the draft
accord, which envisions 95 percent of South African exports
gaining duty-free access to the EU over a 10-year period. South
Africa is to remove barriers to 86 percent of EU export in 12
years.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Still Leading Producer of Cannabis in West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Ghana and Nigeria are the
leading producers of cannabis (Indian hemp) in west Africa
followed by Cote d'Ivoire and Senegal, said an International
Narcotics Control Board report for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Morocco, however, is the leading producer of cannabis in
Africa, with three record-breaking harvests since 1996, the Ghana
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Growth is estimated at 60,000 hectares and resin production
about 2,000 tons for 1998," it said.
</P>
<P>
Resin is a glue-like substance made from cannabis and sniffed.
</P>
<P>
The report presented by Margaret Novicki, director of the
United Nations Information Center (UNIC) in Accra, capital of
Ghana, said Africa continues to be a major supplier of cannabis
and cannabis resin for Europe.
</P>
<P>
"The cultivation of cannabis, its trafficking and abuse remain
major drug control issues throughout the region," it added.

<HEADLINE> IMF Praises Kuwait Coping Well with Oil Price Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 22 (Xinhua) -- the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said on Monday that Kuwait has achieved significant
progress in eliminating financial imbalances, rebuilding foreign
assets, resolving bad debt problems in the banking system, and
upgrading bank supervision and prudential regulation in the past
several years.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in its annual report of the Kuwait economy that
appropriate economic policies in recent years and the accumulated
cushion of oil-related assets had left Kuwait well placed to cope
with the impact of sharp oil price declines in 1998.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the macro-economic position of the oil-rich state
had been improving. Inflation fell to 0.5 percent in 1998 from 0.7
percent in 1997 and 3.6 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Executive Directors noted with satisfaction the improvement in
Kuwait's overall macroeconomic situation in 1997, particularly the
low inflation rate and the strengthening of fiscal and external
balances," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
"They commended the authorities for their prudent approach
toward the utilization of the country's oil wealth, which had
enabled the rebuilding of foreign assets for future generations."
</P>
<P>
The IMF also urged Kuwait to step up efforts to preserve labor
market flexibility and to keep the reform-related costs within the
overall budget constraint.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's economy grew by 2.2 percent in 1998, slightly lower
than the 2.5 percent recorded in 1997.

ABUJA, February 22 (Xinhua) -- Results from the Saturday polls
in Nigeria indicated that the People's Democratic Party (PDP) has
won a majority in the National Assembly which will take over
law-making from the military government.
</P>
<P>
With over three-quarters of the votes counted Monday, the PDP

The All People's Party (APP) and the Alliance for Democracy
(AD), bound by an electoral agreement, secured 127 House and 39
Senate seats altogether.
</P>
<P>
The PDP victory in the National Assembly election strengthened

trade committee of the parliament earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Talks in March were to cover the steel and motor vehicles
sectors. The agriculture sector would be dealt with in April, the
