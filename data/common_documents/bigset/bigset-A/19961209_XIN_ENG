JOHANNESBURG, December 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa backs
Organization of African Unity (OAU) chief Salim Ahmed Salim to be
the next U.N.'s Secretary General, despite indications of a
French veto, president Nelson Mandela said today.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question at a media briefing in Cape Town, he
said Salim is "very capable" and has done well as OAU secretary
general, as well as having been a leading figure in mobilizing
opposition to apartheid.
</P>
<P>
"On merit we think he's the best candidate for the job,"
Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa nominated Salim after the United States had
vetoed the reappointment of Boutros Boutros-ghali, who had
earlier been the favored candidate of both the OAU and the
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
Mandela revealed that he had spoken to French President
Jacques Chirac last night, who had indicated France would veto
Salim's appointment.
</P>
<P>
The French government believed any candidate for the U.N.
secretary generalship should be fluent both in French and
English.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said his government had spoken many times to the
United States government on its veto of Ghali, but the US "won't
budge".

LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The entrance charges at the
prestigious British Museum look inevitable but will not be
introduced for the time being, according to Museum's board of
trustees.
</P>
<P>
Although the trustees rejected a suggested five-pound (about 8
U.S. dollars) admission fee, which was expected to raise eight
million pounds (about 13 million dollars) each year, they agreed
that ending the 200-year-old free admission was inevitable to ease
the museum's financial problems in the future.
</P>
<P>
The central london museum, which attracts more than six million
visitors a year, suffered a 1.3 million pound (about two million
dollars) cut in this year's government grant.
</P>
<P>
A government report predicted that the museum, where many
researchers and writers including Karl Mark once wrote their
works, would shoulder a deficit of 25 million pounds (about 40
million dollars) by the turn of the century.

SINGAPORE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Trade Organization (WTO) Renato Ruggiero highlighted today the
political importance of the inaugural WTO Ministerial Conference
in Singapore, saying that it would send a strong political message
on world economic development.
</P>

Speaking at a conference organized by the International
Conference of Free Trade Unions, Ruggiero said the conference,
which will start on Monday and run through Friday, would send a
strong political message recalling what was at the heart of the

chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero also said that the issue of labor standards will be
raised at the five-day ministerial conference.
</P>

However, he added, the WTO has wider concerns, which included
the information technology and telecommunications issues.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers from the 128 members and another 30 countries

LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said on Sunday that Britain would stick to "wait-and-see"
policy on a European single currency which was approved by his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Major made clear in an interview with BBC TV that if other
European nations were "fudging" the economic condition for entry
into a single currency, then Britain would stay out.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is in the national interest for the British
government to be in there negotiating," Major said.
</P>

Major said Britain would remain part of the European Union but
would not be pulled along with it if he thought it were moving in
the wrong direction.
</P>

The prime minister refused to answer the question of whether or
not Britain would join the "first wave" of nations participating
in the single currency in 1999.

LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The British government is set
for a show-down with the United States over workers' rights at the
World Trade Organization (WTO) ministerial meeting to be held in
Singapore late this week.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the Financial Mail before flying
to Singapore to attend the meeting, British Industry and Trade
Secretary Ian Lang vowed to stand firm against any change,
although he expected Washington to insist on a link between trade
and labor rights at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lang dismissed opposition Labor party's appeals to accept an
agreement on the issue, saying such a deal would eventually
undermine free trade.
</P>
<P>
"America's views are no secret, but trade and labor standards
are not an issue for the WTO. The best way to help labor
conditions in poor countries is to trade more with them," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the British government "felt strongly" about the
issue, but it was a matter for the International Labor
Organization, not a trade body.

but the number of accidents and economic loss rose 20 percent and
12 percent over the same period last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has
appealed for more aid to Afghanistan where diseases and constant
threat of landmines have left the people struggling with abject
poverty.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Associated Press of Pakistan, the
United Nations wants to raise over 130 million US dollars simply
to provide basic relief for the Afghan capital of Kabul and the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted relief workers based in Kabul as saying that
the landmine problem in Afghanistan is probably the worst in the
world. There are about 10 million landmines scattered throughout
Afghanistan affecting all aspects of life in the country.
</P>
<P>
After 17 years of the armed conflict, the economy of rural
areas and the cities particularly Kabul and Kandhar has been
completely destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The relief workers said that about a quarter of million
children under five died every year from acute respiratory
infection, measles and diarrhea diseases.
</P>
<P>
Besides, about 20 percent of the children died from the
diseases which could be prevented by launching a vaccination
program.
</P>
<P>
The latest UN appeal is aimed to raise 133 million dollars for
emergency work throughout Afghanistan. The report quoted
organizers as saying that it is a minimum requirement and without
it, Afghanistan and its people will simply sink deeper into misery
and poverty.

<HEADLINE> Hebron Agreement Expected Before Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
officials indicated today that a deal on Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron could be clinched before the upcoming
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian senior negotiator Abu Mazen was quoted by Israel
Radio as saying that the Palestinian side is studying documents to
reach an agreement on the long-delayed Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Moshe Fogel, director of Israel's Government Press Office and
the spokesman on Hebron talks, also confirmed the possibility of
an agreement before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
"We would like (to reach the deal) even earlier. And we really
don't understand why it has not already been signed, because we
believe that the overwhelming amount of issues have already been
agreed to," Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
"The outstanding matters are really so minimal that it
doesn't justify not going forth with the redeployment," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Fogel blamed the Palestinian Authority (PA) for delaying the
signing of an agreement in belief that Israel would be
automatically blamed for the stalemate in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It's clear to us that the Palestinians are basically
dragging their feet. From our point of view, we are
interested in moving forward the redeployment in Hebron, and
they are taking their time," Fogel said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned again that if the PA President Yasser
Arafat continues to do so, he will pay a price. But Fogel
did not go into details.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the United States' intensive mediation, Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators have failed to reach a deal on Hebron
after two months of talks. The sticking point that blocks a deal
is Israel's demand for changing the security arrangements in
Hebron after its troop redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past weeks, Israel has retreated from his former
insistence on its troop's right of conducting hot pursuits of
suspected terrorists in whole Hebron. It said it was the
turn for the PA to come to ink the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. diplomats in Israel are making intensive
efforts to arrange a summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. On Friday and Saturday, U.S.
Ambassador Martin Indyk and Consul-General Ed Abington held
separate talks with Netanyahu and Arafat on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Arafat have expressed their willingness to
hold such a meeting to conclude the Hebron deal. U.S. officials
said they are now waiting a response from Arafat who has returned
from Egypt after holding consultations with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak.

(vat) since 1992 and lower prices for fuel and other supports.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from local provinces, starting from
tomorrow mainland farmers will be joined by members of 17
agricultural associations in the island of Crete. The farmers
there will close the highway between the island's two main cities
of Heraklio and Hania.
</P>
<P>
The road and rail blockades around the country have crippled
commercial and private transport, gradually strangling cities such
as major northern town of Salonika, central city of Larissa and
western port of Patras. Hundreds of truckers, many with perishable
cargoes have been stranded.
</P>
<P>
The government rejected many of the farmers' demands as being
"excessive".

<HEADLINE> Provisional Results in Ghana's Polls Trickle in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Results of Ghana's peaceful
presidential and parliamentary polls continue to trickle in
today, giving a slight lead to the incumbent Jerry Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was concern in some quarters over delays in
their release, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
By this morning, 18 hours after vote-counting began, the
National Electoral Commission had released official results from
five constituencies, while 32 constituencies from 200 across the
country had released provisional results.
</P>
<P>
These results give Rawlings 936,507 votes against 630,042 for
the most threatening challenger, John Kufuor of the New Patriotic
Party, and well under 100,000 for the third presidential runner
Edward Mahama.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted analysts as saying that the race will get
tighter as results from more marginal areas come in.
</P>
<P>
The parliamentary race, which has given the Rawlings-led
National Democratic Congress 20 seats so far, holds few surprises
and that it is too soon to draw conclusions, they said.
</P>
<P>
If no presidential candidate wins more than 50 percent of a
possible 9.2 million votes cast, a second round will be held
within 21 days.
</P>
<P>
Turnout on Saturday was estimated at between 60 and 65 percent
on the national level, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The figure for Ghana's 1992 presidential poll was 50 percent
and that for the subsequent parliamentary poll, boycotted by the
opposition in protest against alleged rigging of the first vote,
stood at 29 percent.

Woldzimierz Cimoszewicz and his Egyptian counterpart Kamal
El-Ganzouri today held talks to explore cultural and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Cimoszewicz told reporters that the talks
focused on the achievements made by Cairo and Warsaw in their
economic reforms and privatization drive.
</P>
<P>
Cimoszewicz praised the 70-year-old Egyptian-Polish diplomatic
ties and voiced his appreciation for Egypt's leading role at
international and regional levels.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the policies adopted by both countries to create
the appropriate atmosphere to enhance economic cooperation and
data exchange in various domains.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral cooperation on information, especially in antiquities
domain, are underway, said the Polish official. Some Polish
missions are working in Egypt for excavation of antiquities.
</P>
<P>
The Polish delegation will meet with Egyptian businessmen to
get acquainted with investment opportunities in the country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri said at the press conference that he briefed the
Polish premier on facilities offered to investors in Egypt. Poland
has great experience in food industries, tourism and ship
building, he added.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries totaled 66 million U.S. dollars
last year. Poland mainly exported steel and chemical products to
Egypt and imported Egyptian fruits.
</P>
<P>
The Polish prime minister, who arrived here Saturday afternoon
on a four-day visit to Egypt, also met with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak earlier today.
</P>
<P>
The trade turnover between Poland and the Arab world accounts
for only 1 percent of its foreign trade, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit to Egypt by a Polish prime minister in
10 years.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Cimoszewicz will also meet with Speaker
of the People's Assembly Ahmed Fathi Sorour, Chairman of the Shura
Council Moustafa Kamal Helmi and some Egyptian businessmen.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin
Mkapa today Called on Tanzanians to enhance unity and solidarity,
saying they are key factors for national peace calm and
development.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa, who doubles as national Chairman of the ruling
Revolutionary Party (CCM), said this here when he led jubilant
CCM members and supporters in an annual solidarity walk which was
maded country wide, according to the official Daily News paper.
</P>
<P>
The CCM chairman said unity and solidarity were of profound
importance under multiparty democracy to eliminate division among
the people and making Tanzania one country and one nation.
</P>
<P>
He said every political party was free to formulate its
policies and set plans on how best it can serve the people having
its own views and outlook on various issues but with an overall
objective to benefit the people.
</P>
<P>
"Despite political differencies, we are a single nation,
working for national interest and not a single person's or one
party's interest," said president Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania set itself free from the oppression and other
vices of colonial rulers through the same unity and solidarity
and afterwards became a sovereign state.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa condemned some people for misinterpreting
multiparty democracy as enmity and division among people.
</P>
<P>
"Over one million refugees from neighboring countries of
Rwanda and Burundi are in Tanzania, causing environmental
destruction because of hatred and lack of cooperation in their
own countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said his government will ensure lasting peace and unity
in the country, so that everyone participates freely in
development work.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Return Benin Artifacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The British parliament is
considering the possibility of entertaining a bill that will
facilitate the return of artifacts it looted from the the Benin
Kingdom in 1897, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Prince Edun Akenzua, Chairman of the Great
Benin Centenary Committee as saying this on Thursday in the Benin
state of Nigeria, part of the ancient Benin Kingdom, shortly
after his return from Europe.
</P>
<P>
The prince said he has held talks with members of the British
parliament and the head of African reparation during his trip to
Europe.
</P>
<P>
He explained that a private bill is already on its way to the
parliament for consideration, and that many parliamentarians are
sympathetic to the cause of the world's ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although Britain claimed that its holding of the
Benin artifacts is protected by an act of parliament in 1753, the
issue is more of moral than legal considerations.
</P>
<P>
The chairman pleaded with international community to prevail
on Britain to return the looted artifacts in line with the desire
of the people of the great Benin Kingdom.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 8 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa

terms of other prisoners by three quarters to commemorate 35
years of independence of the country.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs here today

include those suffering from AIDS, tuberculosis and cancer.
</P>
<P>

be set free with immediate effect tomorrow, the jail terms of
other prisoners will be reduced by three quarters of their normal
sentences under the prison act of 1967.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Weapons Inspector in Baghdad to Solve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Rolf Ekeus, chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) charged with scrapping Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction, arrived here today for a four-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. source said that Ekeus, leading a seven-member team,
will discuss with Iraqi side mainly on the issue of Iraq's
long-range missiles over 150 kilometers, which are banned by
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
During the visit to Iraq late last month by Charles Duelful,
deputy chairman of the UNSCOM, Iraq refused to permit the engines
of its long-range missiles to be taken out of the country for
analysis.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM blamed Iraq of violating relevant U.N. resolutions
by doing so.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the UNSCOM chief came two days before the
expected resumption of Iraqi oil export Tuesday after a
compromise was reached between Iraq and U.N. concerning the
oil-for-food deal signed by the two sides in May.
</P>
<P>
Iraq asserted that the implementation of the oil pact is the
first step toward a total lifting of U.N. embargo imposed on the
country after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. sanctions could be lifted only after the
UNSCOM convinces the U.N. Security Council that Iraq has
eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
But so far, none of Iraq's weapons files in the areas of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons as well as missiles has
been closed.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Dismisses Reports of Agreement on Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today dismissed Israeli
reports that peace is within reach and said that more work are
needed to strike a balanced agreement on the troops redeployment
in the last West Bank city of Hebron still occupied by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said that claims that an
agreement has already been reached were oversimplification of
matters, according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency. There
are still certain obstacles, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported this morning that an agreement on the
redeployment of Israeli forces in Hebron had been reached but its
signing has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side wants to pin down the dates for the
implementation of the next stages of the redeployment in line with
the Oslo agreements, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has turned down the request on the ground that it
might affect the permanent settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The agreement on Hebron is still facing several obstacles,"
the Egyptian top diplomat said when meeting with Saeb Erekat, head
of the Palestinian delegation to the peace negotiations with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Further efforts are needed to drum up a balanced stance
between Palestinian and Israeli interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank city
of Hebron was postponed following a series of suicide bombings in
Israel in February and March.
</P>
<P>
The hardline government of Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is
demanding better security arrangements for 450 Jewish settlers
living among some 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Meretz Party leader Yussi
Sarid said that he did not believe an agreement could be signed
shortly between the Palestinians and Israelis since several
obstacles still exist.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with Moussa on latest developments of the
Mideast peace process this evening, Sarid termed as "a major
obstacle" the Jewish settlements which could hinder the promotion
of the peace march.
</P>
<P>
His party is exerting its utmost to dissuade the Likud
government from setting up new settlements, said the Israeli
legislator, who arrived here earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Despite the U.S. intensive mediation, Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators have failed to clinch a deal on Hebron after two
months of talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. diplomats in Israel are making intensive
efforts to arrange a summit between Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Arafat have expressed their willingness to
hold a meeting to conclude the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said they are now waiting a response from Arafat
who has returned from Egypt, where he held consultations with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak Saturday.

relations to be based on respect for international law and

comprehensive negotiations between Athens and Ankara in order to
settle their differences without referring to a specific legal
framework".
</P>
<P>
"In addition, Greece has stated that negotiations on issues
concerning its sovereignty are inconceivable and a dialogue on
those issues is unacceptable," he said.

democracy, socio-economic upswing and the right to
self-determination.

The constitution has ensured the basic human rights of the
society as well as openess and accountability in government
working procedures, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the constitution does not create loopholes
for inhuman people to break the law with impunity.
</P>
<P>
A democratic system whereby courts are structured and judges
are appointed and administered without any forms of influence has
been established, he said.
</P>
<P>
President Negasso said the constitution has for the first time
ensured the freedom of speech as well as the right to assembly,
stage peaceful demonstrations, organize and move freely.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Envoy Urges UN to Grant Turkey Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has suffered most from
the U.N. embargo on Iraq and it should be given trade
privileges, Iraqi Ambassador to Turkey Rafi Al Tikriti said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Tikriti as
saying that as Turkey's losses from the embargo on Iraq had
reached 40 billion U.S. dollars, the United Nations should grant
special privileges to Turkey in its trade with Iraq. But he did
not elaborate on the privileges.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said it had suffered great losses from the six years'
U.N. embargo on Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War to drive Iraqi
troops out of the oil-rich Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Tikriti said that if Turkey gets the privileges, "we will buy
all our food needs from Turkey. All our revenue will flow to
Turkey."
</P>
<P>
He said that all the technical preparations for exporting
Iraqi oil were complete, adding that Iraq would give priority to
countries that supported Iraq against the embargo as Turkey had
done.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador pointed out that the Iraq National Oil Company
had signed agreements with 50 international firms, including
Turkish ones.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has permitted Iraq to sell 650,000 barrels of oil per
day, but its capacity was about 2 million barrels, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tikriti disclosed that Next year the Iraqi production capacity
would reach 3 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
There is the 986-kilometer-long Iraqi-Turkish twin oil
pipeline connecting the Kirkuk fields in Iraq with the Turkish
Mediterranean terminal of Ceyhan.

<HEADLINE> EC Adopts Proposal for Fishing Quotas for 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission(EC)
today has adopted its proposal for Total Allowable Catches(TAC's)
of fish and associated national quotas for 1997.
</P>
<P>
This proposal, which will be discussed by the EU's Fisheries
Council later this month, fixes TAC's, the EU's share of the
TAC's, the allocation of the EU's share among Member States as
well as certain conditions under which the national allocations
may be fished.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the EC has made an effort to establish the best
compromise between the imperatives of stock conservation and the
needs of the fishing industries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a number of important stocks in the North Sea(cod,
haddock, whiting, saithe, plaice, herring) are managed jointly by
the EU and Norway. Consultations are being held to agree on
appropriate catch limitations for 1996, but no result has been
obtained so far.
</P>
<P>
For the stocks, the Commission is awaiting the conclusion of
these consultations before proposing any figure to the EU Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, for the first time, tuna and swordfish are
included in the list of stocks subject to TAC, following the
recommendations of the International commission for the
Conservation of Atlantic Tunas(ICCAT).

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Program Successful in China's Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A program jointly carried out
by the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) and
UNICEF since the mid-1980s has proved to be a great success in
poverty-stricken areas in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of an appraisal released here today,
the "informal science and technology education in poor
communities" program has achieved a satisfactory ratio of benefits
to investment. Covering 16 million children aged between seven and
18 years in 200 underdeveloped counties in 25 provinces and
autonomous regions, the program spent less than three cents on
average on every child.
</P>
<P>
The results of the appraisal showed that the program has
improved the local people's ability of existence and understanding
of science through the dissemination of knowledge about life,
iodine deficiency diseases and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the appraisal, 92.5 of the children surveyed
learned that they should have the sanitary habit of washing their
hands both before dinner and after going to the toilet; 90 percent
of the children got to know that they should consult a doctor
instead of resorting to superstitious means when someone is ill;
77.5 percent of the children learned that iodine deficiency will
result in retarded intelligence.
</P>
<P>
After the program spread knowledge about environmental
protection, 90 percent of the children learned that they have the
responsibility to protect the environment. Moreover, 80 percent of
the children took part in afforestation.
</P>
<P>
The living standards in the areas covered by the program has
markedly improved, according to the program officers, and 76.5 percent
of the children surveyed said that their living standards have
improved in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, 70 percent of the children have passed on the
knowledge they learned to their parents and relatives.
</P>
<P>
The appraisal was made by Beijing University during 1995 and
1996. A total of 3,827 children were surveyed.
</P>
<P>
According to UNICEF and CAST officials, a new round of the
program began this year, which will cover 300 poverty-stricken
counties.

<HEADLINE> Arbitration For Brcko Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The fate of the Bosnian town
of Brcko will be decided two months later than expected following
an arbitration panel's announcement that the decision deadline
was postponed.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration tribunal said the Bosnian Serb side had
requested that the deadline, originally set for this December 14,
be extended to February 15, 1997. The Muslim side had agreed.
</P>
<P>
Brcko was a Muslim-majority town before the war, but was later
taken over by Serbs. Because of its strategic location, the
question of which side it belonged to could not be solved during
the Dayton negotiations last year and was handed over for
arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration tribunal on Brcko consists of two
representatives, one each from Muslim and Serb sides, and an
American lawyer, Roberts Owen, who has the decisive power in case
of a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Vitomir Popovic, the Serb representative, quit the arbitration
panel a few weeks ago in protest at what he called Owen's siding
with the Muslim side. He was not present at the panel meeting on
Sunday which decided to postpone the deadline.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration tribunal said it "has concluded that the
requested extension of the time to, and including February 15,
1997, has been agreed and should be granted."
</P>
<P>
Colum Murphy, the spokesman for the Office of High
Representatives, which is coordinating peace efforts in Bosnia,
said the reason for the postponement was because "this is an
extremely sensitive issue".
</P>
<P>
"Any decision handed down that would make one side or the other
deeply unhappy would not be good for the country or for the
region. So presumably they (the arbitrators) have decided to
extend this in order to search more thoroughly for a solution,"
Murphy said.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Opposition Leader in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan's opposition
leader Syed Abdullah Noori arrived in the northern Afghan province
of Kunduz today after an arduous three-day journey.
</P>
<P>
Noori is in Kunduz to meet Tajik President Emomali Rakhmonov,
with the aim of ending the three-year civil war in the Central
Asian state, according to U.N. sources here.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-chartered plane carrying Noori and several members of
his party was forced by the Afghan Taliban militia's jet fighters
to land at Shindand airbase in western Afghanistan Saturday on its
way from the Iranian city of Mashhad to Kunduz.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, which now occupy most of Afghan provinces, said
the plane had entered Afghan airspace without prior permission.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft was released on Sunday but had to land in
Taliban-controlled Kandahar Province in western Afghanistan after
developing technical problems.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Sunday sent another aircraft to Kandahar to
ferry Noori and other stranded passengers to Kunduz while the
damaged plane was flown to Pakistan for repair, the sources said.

<P>
ABU DHABI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) annouced on Monday that they had banned
helicopter flights over stadium during Asian Cup football
championship.
</P>
<P>
The decision was in response to complaints from Kuwait, which
went down to the host UAE 2-3.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait complained that helicopters hovering over the Zayed
stadium had distracted its players and was one of the reason for
their defeat.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had squandered a first half two-goal lead to lose the
dramatic match.
</P>
<P>
AFC secretary-general Datu Peter Vellapaan said in a letter to
the head of Kuwait's delegation that he had directed the higher
Organising Committee. The official said that there "should be no
any further helicopter flights directly over the stadium during
matches of the Asian Cup 96".
</P>
<P>
The AFC also dismissed a Kuwaiti protest against a referee's
decision not to send off a UAE player.

<P>
NANNING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Two banks respectively from
China and Vietnam have signed the Detailed Agreement on
Implementation of Border Trade Clearance Business in Dongxing
City, in southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The pact was signed between the Guangxi branch of the
Agricultural Bank of China and the Guang Ninh provincial branch of
the Agricultural Bank of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the headquarters of the two banks inked
agreements in July this year in Beijing on cooperation between the
two sides, and the new agreement marks a new stage in the
cooperation between the two countries in the banking field,
Chinese observers said.
</P>
<P>
According to bank sources, experiments in the bank clearance
will be first carried out in Dongxing City and in Hai Ninh
County in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Border trade totaled 12.4 billion yuan in the autonomous region
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), and in 1995
alone the figure was 2.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Outdated means of clearance, however, hampered the fledgling
trade in the Sino-Vietnamese border area as business had to be
carried out using cash or barter methods.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- World Bank Vice-president
Callisto Madavo has said Ethiopia's economic performance deserves
support as the reforms helped spur growth, creat jobs and
business opportunities for its citizens.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued today by the Africa
Regional Office of the World Bank, Madavo made the remarks when
he arrived here at the weekend to hold consultations with the
Ethiopian government officials and chair the Consultative Group
(CG) meeting on December 10-12 here.
</P>
<P>
He said the reform process which began in 1992 has contributed
to the growth of the Gross Domestic Product by over 7 percent on
average during 1993-1996, compared with 1.6 percent in the decade
of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
" This is an improvement which will need to be sustained to
have a positive impact on Ethiopia's citizens," he said.
</P>
<P>
Madavo said Ethiopia has made impressive progress with the
reform program, and helped by good rains and sound policies, the
country has achieved improved agricultural performance.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, has enabled Ethiopia to move in four years from
food deficit to a modest food-surplus.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank Vice-President said since the end of the war in
1991, investments in human resource development have consistently
improved and the government spending on education has risen to 13
percent in 1995, with more than half going to basic education.

work conference which opened here this morning that the government
will increase its input in the country's medical care sector in a
bid to ensure coordinated development between medical care and
overall economic and social progress.
</P>
<P>
This is the first such conference co-sponsored by the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council. Its main task is to sum
up achievements and experiences in medical care since the founding
of New China in 1949, particularly since the launching of the
policies of reform and opening-up 18 years ago, outline major
future targets and principles, discuss a Party and government
decision on reforming and developing medical services, and carry
out the medical tasks set in the Ninth Five-Year Plan and the
long-range objective for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Both President Jiang and Premier Li Peng spoke at today's
opening ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. Standing
Committee Members of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee Qiao Shi, Li Ruihuan, Zhu Rongji and Hu Jintao, and
Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren were present at the ceremony,
which was presided over by Zhu, who is also a vice-premier.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Peace Appears in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- After three weeks lull in
the fighting of South Mogadishu, some internally displaced people
have voluntarily returned to their houses and several schools
have reopened.
</P>
<P>
Even though there are wide spread robbery and stealing by
gangs armed with pistols, knives and hand grenades, the people of
Mogadishu talk about peace when they don't hear shelling and
heavy anti-aircraft machine guns being used bvy the warring sides
of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Despite the spontaneous cease-fire in South Mogadishu, there
are persisting underground peace negotiations among the clan
elders in Mogadishu for avoiding further blood letting in the
city and there are consecutive peace appeals by the traditional
elders towards the faction leaders of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
The main roads to and from Mogadishu to the central
and southern Somalia have been relatively peaceful for
the past the weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, North Mogadishu is calm now after it was
very tense three weeks ago following Ali Mahdi's reshuffle of
the two-year-old Islamic courts administration.
</P>
<P>
Traditional elders have managed to prevent armed clashes
within the community of north Mogadishu which could be very much
the same as that of South Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Jiang, Li Speak at National Public Health Work Conference (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his speech Jiang said that, under the leadership of the
Party and government, medical and health work started from a very
weak point when new China came into being in 1949. However,
China's shameful image of being the "sick man of East Asia" was
changed in a relatively short period of time.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the reform and open policy started 18 years
ago China's health work has scored great achievements, and made
important contributions to economic development and social
progress, and to the improvement of the people's overall health.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stated that socialist medical and health work with
Chinese characteristics should focus on the medical services in
the rural areas and that the prevention and health care services
should be the top priority.
</P>
<P>
He explained that both Western and traditional Chinese medicine
should be attached equal importance and the traditional Chinese
medicine should be given further impetus.
</P>
<P>
The medical sector should rely on scientific and technological
progress, while professional standards should be upgraded and the
patriotic hygienic campaign should be further promoted with the
whole of society taking part, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Premier Li affirmed in his speech the great medical
achievements made in China over the past 47 years. He said that
the next 15 years will be the crucial period for accomplishing
China's socialist modernization strategic goal and that the cause
of the medical services is an important part of this goal.
</P>
<P>
The development of the medical sector should keep pace with
social and economic development and the people's health conditions
should comply with the level of the country's economic progress,
Li said.

<HEADLINE> Zou Urges Efforts to Beat Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China should not drop its guard
against inflation, because the potential for a rebound in prices
exists, cautioned a senior Chinese official here.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiahua, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee and vice-premier, said that
China's overall economic situation is good, with the economy
maintaining a rapid growth and inflation substantially brought
down.
</P>
<P>
However, Zou told a national planning conference yesterday:
"We must be clearly aware of the fact that there are still strong
forces pushing up prices."
</P>
<P>
He listed increasing losses by state-owned enterprises,
mounting debts among them, relatively big fiscal deficits,
excessive fixed assets investment scale and weak agriculture as
causes of a severe inflationary resurge.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier told provincial planning officials to stop
approving new projects which have poor market prospects.
</P>
<P>
"If we can satisfy the market demand with the current
production capacity or can do so by raising the capacity, we
should not approve any more projects," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for more support for agriculture and water
conservancy.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the central government will approve more
key state construction projects and lend more money to the central
and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, China will offer preferential policies to
attract foreign investment to the central and western regions,
adding that the richer eastern part of China should also lend a
helping hand to these areas.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Acceleration of Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo today
called for the implementation of the guidelines of the
recently-held Central Economic Conference and for the dialectical
analysis of the situation faced by state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"While seeing the negative factors, we should also seek the
positive factors, so as to be more confident about re-activating
state enterprises and speeding up the reform and development of
these firms," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier was speaking at the National Economic and
Trade Conference in this capital of northeast China's Liaoning
Province December 6-8.
</P>
<P>
In his speech Wu said that the 18-year-old reform and opening
drive has brought vitality to state-owned firms as a
whole. Between 1990 and 1995 these firms experienced a yearly
growth of 13.8 in profits and an 11.4 percent annual increase in
net profits, according to the vice-premier.
</P>
<P>
Although the non-state sector has developed remarkably in the 18
years, the state economic sector has always remained in firm
control of the economic life of the country, and has borne huge
costs for the reform, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that this year the 300 major state enterprises have
realized a sales ratio of 99.33 percent of their production, and
their profits are equal to 4.63 times the net profits of all the
industrial firms with independent accountancy.
</P>
<P>
Strong leadership is of crucial importance to these
enterprises, he stressed. He urged the firms to be
market-oriented, restructure themselves and boost the development
of new technologies and new products.

<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President and Communist
Party of China (CPC) General Secretary Jiang Zemin today called on
leading cadres, especially those at high levels, to study
international law and improve their ability to use these rules.
</P>
<P>

China has been playing an increasingly important role in
various types of international and regional cooperation, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"While abiding by and safeguarding international law and
regulations, we should strive to further improve and develop the
international law together with people of other countries, so as
to make international progress favorable to building a peaceful,
stable, fair and reasonable, new international political and
economic order," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Charcoal-selling Booming in Kampala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Charcoal selling is booming in
Kampala, capital of Uganda, due largely to the increased
electricity price in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Charcoal seller David Mulondu told Xinhua today at his shop in
a charcoal market in eastern Kampala that his business is
prosperous. At present he can sell out about 10 bags of charcoal
per day while in the previous year, the figure was between 5 and
8.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he sold one bag for 4,000 Ugandan Shillings (about
four U.S. Dollars) while the price has risen to 7,000 Shillings
per bag this year.
</P>
<P>
Behind his shop, there is a charcoal market grouping 25
charcoal shops, and near his shop there are 5 shops selling all
kinds of charcoal stoves. A lorry parking in front of his shop is
unloading bags of charcoal.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics available, over 72 percent of
the households in Kampala cook with charcoal, 11.2 percent with
firewood, 9.9 percent with electricity and 4.9 percent with
paraffin.
</P>
<P>
Charcoal selling is booming in the city due to the increased
electricity price and a rapid population growth of 6-7 percent
per year. Kampala with a population of over 700,000 consumes more
than half of the charcoal used in the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, Uganda has only one hydropower station with an
installed capacity of 150 mw. Fast industrial development in last
10 years has led to the insufficient supply of electricity and
soaring electricity prices.
</P>
<P>
Half of Uganda Electricity Board's customers in the city
cann't afford to pay their electricity bills and some of them
have to switch from electricity to charcoal.
</P>
<P>
Cooking with electricity now in the city is twice as expensive
as cooking with charcoal.
</P>
<P>
Other reasons for the booming are restaurants, bakeries and
brick-makers in or around Kampala are consuming a large bulk of
charcoal daily, these activities have seen a tremendous growth
during the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
According to "Study of Woody Biomass Derived Energy Supplies
in Uganda" published recently, the main bulk of charcoal produced
in Uganda today is a by-product of agricultural expansion.
</P>
<P>
Now over one third of charcoals used in Kampala comes from
semi arid areas in Luweero about 90 kilometers north of Kampala.
Another third of the charcoal supplied to the city comes from
Mpigi, about 30 kilometers southwest of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Because of the said agricultural expansion caused by
population growth, Uganda's forest coverage has dwindled from 14
percent of its total land area in 1967 to 4 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
Reduction of forest has led to numerous environmental ills
such as land fragmentation, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity,
desertification and others.
</P>
<P>
In order to deal with the problem, the Ugandan government is
carrying out a project to build a large hydroelectric station
with an installed capacity of 200 MW. And another hydroelectric
station with an installed capacity of 300 MW will begin its
construction in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is endowed with rich water resources as the source of
River Nile is located in the country.

release. "It highlights Joran's status on the international stage
as viable convention and tourist destination and should encourage
other organizers of international events to take a serious look
at the country (and) its potential event resources."

<HEADLINE> President Talks About Public Health in Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here
today that it is the duty of Communist Party committees and the
government at all levels to improve public health for farmers in
China's rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"Public health work in rural areas has great significance in
increasing rural reforms and rural social and economic development
as a whole," Jiang told a national conference on public health.
</P>
<P>
"In poor areas especially, poverty relief should be combined
with public health work," Jiang noted, saying that cooperative
medical care in rural areas conforms with China's practical
conditions and is welcomed by local residents. Improving the
medical system is the key to improving public health in rural
areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rural people in China make up the vast majority of the
population, but the foundation of public health's is still weak,
he said, adding that "only when the work on public health in rural
areas is really well done, can the country's overall public health
conditions see a great change."
</P>
<P>
Over the last several decades, China has developed a health
care network throughout its rural areas, with a considerable
number of medical workers providing care in institutions at the
county, township, and village level.
</P>
<P>
However, the president pointed out that, on the whole, there
has been no fundamental change in regard to farmers' poor
health-care conditions, and farmers cannot afford to see doctors,
and disease is a major barrier that prevents farmers from
overcoming poverty and becoming wealthy.
</P>
<P>
The widening gap in public health conditions between urban and
rural residents calls for greater attention to be paid and should
be dealt with in a conscientious way, Jiang said.

ANKARA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi-Turkish petroleum
pipeline is expected to be reopened this week, a Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said at a weekly press conference that a
ceremony would be held for the celebration of the reopening of
the Kirkuk-Yumurtalik pipeline which was closed soon after the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
The 986-kilometer-long Iraqi-Turkish twin oil pipeline
connects the Kirkuk fields in Iraq with the Turkish
Mediterranean terminal of Ceylan.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency quoted Iraqi Ambassador
to Turkey Rafi Al Tikriti as saying that Turkey lost an estimated
amount of 30 billion U.S. dollars due to the U.N. embargo on Iraq
and it should be given trade privileges.
</P>
<P>
Tikriti said that all the technical preparations for exporting
Iraqi oil were complete, adding that Iraq would give priority to
the countries that supported Iraq against the embargo as Turkey
had done.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has permitted Iraq to sell 650,000 barrels of oil
per day, but its capacity is about 2 million barrels, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador disclosed that next year the Iraqi production
capacity would reach 3 million barrels.

</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the Damascus Declaration signatories
-- Egypt, Syria and the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation
Council which groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Bahrain -- will discuss the recent developments
of the Middle East peace process and the Arab-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
Their talks will also focus on ways of coordinating attitudes
in light of Israel's adherence to its intransigent position on the
peace process, the possibility of taking Arab political and
economic measures intended to suspend all forms of normalization
with Israel and working out a unified Arab security strategy to
cope with the developments taking place in the region, the sources
explained.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss a plan intended to merge the Israeli
entity into the Arab community with the aim of weakening the
latter. The participants will deal with means of forging a
mechanism for the execution of clauses laid out in the Damascus
Declaration and examining the possibility of an Arab economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
The Damascus Declaration, signed in March 1991 by the eight Arab
countries, was aimed at establishing a Gulf region security system

<HEADLINE> Disagreement Sees Navy Commander Go </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Georgian Defense Minister
Vardiko Nadibaidze has accepted the resignation of Navy Commander
Rear-Admiral Alexander Javakhishvili, and appointed Captain
Anatoly Krivun as acting commander.
</P>
<P>
Reports cited a release by the Georgian Defense Ministry. It
said Nadibaidze accepted the resignation submitted by
Javakhishvili, 64, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for a cited disagreement between the minister
and Javakhishvili was the latter's opinion that Georgia could not
afford to have its own navy at present.
</P>
<P>
Javakhishvili considered the maintenance of one combat ship was
much more expensive than a ground division, and Georgia could not
afford "such a luxury" today.
</P>
<P>
However, most Georgian leaders had different opinions, reports
said. They added that Georgian Foreign Minister Irakly
Menagarishvili had stated many times that his country would never
give up the intention of having its own navy, and had the economic
resources for that.
</P>
<P>
The newly-appointed acting navy commander, Krivun, 38, has been
chief of the navy staff.

<HEADLINE> President Asks Medical Personnel To Improve Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin asked
people in the medical profession to improve their ethics and
proficiency, at a four-day national conference on public health in
Beijing today, saying that "Medical personnel should work hard to
improve their quality."
</P>
<P>
He urged them to emulate Norman Bethune, a Canadian physician
who worked with the army led by the Communist Party of China
during the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, and who
died of blood poisoning contracted while operating on wounded
soldiers, nearly 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bethune has been long regarded as a model of internationalism
and professional conscientiousness in China, especially among
those in the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
In his opening remarks to the conference, Jiang noted that
China's medical personnel, who now number more than five million,
have made tremendous contributions to the improvement of public
health since new China was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, the general quality of medical personnel
still does not meet the requirements of the socialist
modernization drive, and the country's current bid to build a
socialist market economy will inevitably have some negative
effects on the field.
</P>
<P>
"Professional ethics of medical personnel face new tests, and
we must find a way to help them resist erosion of unhealth
tendencies, and increase their awareness of the need to serve the
people whole-heartedly," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that priority should be given to improving
ideology and the style of leadership in medical institutions, and
improving education of Party members in the medical profession.
</P>
<P>
"Medical personnel who are Party members should play a leading
role and set a good example for their colleagues in professional
ethics," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Medical departments must make an all-out effort to honor model
workers and make others aware of their noble and honest deeds, so
as to encourage more "good doctors of the Dr. Bethune's type,"
President Jiang said.

CAIRO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli government will offer 10 percent of Bank
Leumi's shares in European and American financial markets as part
of its privatization process.
</P>
<P>
MI Holdings, the government firm in charge of selling the
state's shares in the banks, initially planned to sell the
10 percent stake in 1995, but it has encountered difficulties due
of last year's capital-market slump and political instability.
</P>
<P>
Meir Yacobson, General Manager of MI Holdings, has just
returned from London over the weekend after meetings with
representatives of overseas investment banks that are likely to
take part in the planned offering.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- About 48 percent of firms in Israel's
construction sector are in high financial risk category, a rise of
5 percent over April, a survey published by Business Data Israel
said.
</P>
<P>
About 41.5 percent of all construction companies with an
annual sales turnover of more than 100 million shekels (33.3
million dollars) and 46.3 percent of all firms with sales of 50
to 100 million shekels are at high risk, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey is based on data from the first nine months
of 1996. The indicators included bounced checks, liquidity
problems and legal claims.
</P>
<P>
It said that commercial, industry and office sectors
registered the most significant price declines. It added that
the situation was influenced by the closure of the Palestinian
territories, unclear government policies and the expectations of
potential buyers that prices would fall in future because of
the slowdown in all economic activity.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Eleven senior executives from South Korea's
Hanwha Corporation are meeting with 150 Israeli company
representatives this week to seek potential partners.
</P>
<P>
Hanwha, South Korea's seventh largest conglomerate with 14
billion dollars of annual turnover, is looking for Israeli
partners in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, communications,
banking and venture capital.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerate comprises companies in the chemicals,
explosives, energy and machinery manufacturing sectors and is
key partner of the South Korean government in its
communications satellite program.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is reportedly interested in purchasing Israeli
satellite technology, with particular interest in Israel's first
satellite Amos I launched in May.
</P>
<P>
In the first nine months of the year, trade volume
between Israel and South Korean totaled 551 million dollars.
Israel expects South Korea to be the first Asian country to
invest on a large scale in Israel.

ANKARA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Six Turkish soldiers, who
were held by the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) as
hostages in northern Iraq for 18 months, returned to Turkey
this morning, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the six soldiers had entered Turkey
through Habur Border Gate in Sirnak province bordering northern
Iraq at 08:00 GMT with Turkish parliamentary Deputy Fetullah
Erbas, who secured the release Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
Erbas and other Turkish officials went to northern Iraq
Friday for the second time in a bid to secure the release

In August, a delegation headed by Erbas went to the
region and held negotiations with the PKK on the release of
the soldiers, but the move produced no result.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 12-year-old guerrilla war for
autonomy, which has claimed more than 21,000 lives in
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Another Yangtze River Port Open to Foreign Vessels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign sailing vessels can now
sail up the Yangtze River as far as 1,300 km, as China opened
Chenglingji Port today.
</P>
<P>
Chenglingji, located in Yueyang City of central China's Hunan
Province, on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has become
the 16th port to open to foreign vessels along the world's
third-longest river, according to the State Port Administration
Office.
</P>
<P>
The port's opening is a new step in China's efforts to speed up
development in the Yangtze River region and facilitate the
economic growth of the nation's central and western regions,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
China began to open ports along the river to foreign vessels in
1980. But before today's announcement foreign vessels were allowed
to navigate only as far as Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei
Province, a distance from the coast of less than 1,100 km.
</P>
<P>
Chenglingji was first opened to foreign vessels by the Qing
Dynasty in 1899, under pressure from Britain. The port received
930 foreign vessels from Britain, Japan, the US, Germany, France
and Portugal in its busiest year, with cargoes totaling 330,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991 China has spent some 100 million yuan on renovating
the port. It now has 84 berths, two of them able to host ships of
5,000 dwt, and an annual cargo-handling capacity of 600,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Wang Keying, deputy governor of Hunan, said that Chenglingji is
the only port in his province and a major distribution center
connecting China's southwestern, southern and eastern regions, and
its opening to foreign vessels is facilitate promoting the
resources development and foreign trade of both Hunan and adjacent
provinces.
</P>
<P>
With the Yangtze River region contributing 40 percent of
China's Gross Domestic Product, the number of foreign vessels
entering the river has been increasing by 15 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 30 shipping routes have been created from
ports along the river to Hong Kong, Japan, Europe and southeast
Asia. Some 15 million tons of goods are shipped via the river to
over 50 countries and regions every year.

<HEADLINE> GCC Summit Closes in Doha With Emphasis on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The 17th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) member states closed here today, with
their leaders emphasizing in the final communique the
determination to push the march of Gulf cooperation toward more
comprehensive horizons to consolidate security, stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa al Thani presided over
the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Established in May 1981, the GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait,
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Bahrain did not attend the summit because of a long-standing
dispute with host Qatar over the Hawar Islands and sandbanks in
the area.
</P>
<P>
Emir Sheikh Hamad said the GCC leaders believed it is
necessary to handle issues in a sincere and brotherly dialogue,
translate the resolutions into tangible and practical reality and
constantly follow the implementation of what they agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the GCC member states to enhance the
organization's effectiveness and ability to achieve the noble
goals.
</P>
<P>
The final communique of the summit gives much priority to
establishing relations on the basis of good neighborliness,
strict adherence to principles of mutual respect, non-interference
with the internal affairs of other countries, refraining from the
use or threat of use of force, settling differences through
peaceful channels and providing requirements for maintaining
security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The communique also gives attention to boosting cooperation
among the GCC members in various domains, particularly in
military cooperation, to achieve full scale GCC defense
integration.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Iraq, the final communique calls on Iraq
to implement all its international commitments, including the
scrapping of mass-destruction weapons and release of Kuwaiti and
other prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
On disputed territory between the UAE and Iran, the final
communique stresses anew "sovereignty of the UAE over the
Greater and Lesser Tunbs and Abu Musa islands" and full GCC
support for the all peaceful measures the UAE has taken "to
regain its sovereignty over the three islands."
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the communique expresses
the GCC's rejection of the procrastination policies adopted by
the Israeli government in implementing the accords already
reached with the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
The communique also demands that Israel resume peace
negotiations on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks and
abide by the relevant U.N. resolutions in this respect.
</P>
<P>
The final communique stresses that the current Israeli
measures constitute real hazards threatening the peace
opportunities, which herald a return to tension and acts of
violence.
</P>
<P>
The communique calls anew on the United States and Russia,
the co-sponsors of the peace process, to make strenuous and
faithful efforts to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The communique also says if Israel continues its hardline
policy toward the peace process, the GCC states will be
forced to reconsider their stances toward the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The three-day summit also approved a recommendation on
increasing customs tariffs on tobacco and its derivatives from
50 percent to 70 percent in all GCC members with effect
from July 1997, and on raising this percentage of tariffs on
tobacco to 100 percent by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The communique says the next summit will be held in
Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Developing Nations Oppose Bringing Labor Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries today
reiterated their strong opposition to the U.S. attempts to bring
the issue of labor standards into the scope of the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
In his speech delivered at the WTO first Ministerial Conference
which opened here today, Indian Minister of Commerce B. Ramaiah
said, "We do not see any purpose in bringing this subject into the
WTO except possibly to use trade measures to enforce labor
standards, if not now, then at a future date."
</P>
<P>
He also said that trade measures should not be used to address
non-trade objectives, however laudable they may be.
</P>
<P>
Indian Commerce Secretary Rajendra Khanna told reporters today
that India feels it "does not appear logical" for the WTO to make
rules on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Minister of Commerce Muhammad Zubair Khan said in a
statement that there is no proven relationship between trade and
observance of core labor standards.
</P>
<P>
"A discussion of this issue in the WTO will merely encourage
protectionist lobbies to resist the competitive advantage of low
wage countries through self-serving campaigns disguised as concern
for the promotion of labor standards in the developing countries,"
Khan said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay
Viravan said that there is no relevance to force linkages of this
issue with trade, unless otherwise there is an ulterior motive to
bring in the issue as disguised protectionism.
</P>
<P>
He said, "For the WTO, the immediate challenge is to build a
consensus in order to avoid this becoming a divisive issue."
</P>
<P>
India, Pakistan and Thailand believe that the International
Labor Organization (ILO) is the best forum to address the labor
standards issue.
</P>
<P>
They said that the ILO has the exclusive mandate, expertise and
tri-partite structure as well as responsibility to deal with the
subject.
</P>
<P>
Germany voiced its support for the stand taken by the
developing countries on the issue. German Minister of Economics
Gunter Rexrodt said that social issues cannot be dealt with by
trade policy measures which are precisely defined in a legal sense
but limited in scope.
</P>
<P>
Rexrodt said, "We must not bring into the WTO a confrontation
about cultural and social values. This would destroy the
credibility of the system including the highly valuable dispute
settlement instrument."
</P>
<P>
He said that the dispute settlement instrument has to be
applied to real trade disputes and not to foreign or social policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
Facing the strong and continuous objections from the developing
countries, the United States insisted today that labor standards
be included in the agenda of the on-going meeting.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a speech at the plenary session of the WTO
conference, U.S. acting Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky
said that "there is a mutually reinforcing relationship between an
open trading system and respect for core labor standards."

<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Hungary regards China as its
strategic cooperative partner, Hungarian Ambassador to China
Juhasz Otto said at a press cocktail party, which was held here
today for the coming China visit by Hungarian Foreign Minister
Kovacs Laszlo.
</P>
<P>
Juhasz cited the Asia-Pacific region as an important arena for
Hungary's diplomatic activities, and said that China is witnessing
the most rapid economic growth in the world.
</P>
<P>
The country has abundant natural resources, vast market,
splendid culture and stable domestic situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, he noted, Hungary pays great attention to it.
</P>
<P>
China has expressed its respect for the path of development
that the Hungarian people have chosen, he said, and the Hungarian
government has reiterated repeatedly that there is only one China,
namely the People's Republic of China, and that Taiwan is a
province of China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these principles have laid the foundation for
bilateral relations in politics, economy, culture and other areas.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming China trip by the Hungarian foreign
minister, the ambassador said that its significance lies in the
continuation of dialogue between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> WTO, IMF Sign Cooperation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization
(WTO) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) signed here today
an agreement for future cooperation and collaboration between the
two bodies.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by WTO Director-General Renato Ruggiero
and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus, focuses on three main
elements, a WTO Ministerial Conference statement said.
</P>
<P>
First of all, it said, the agreement lays the basis for
carrying forward the WTO's ministerial mandate to achieve greater
coherence in global economic policy by cooperating with the IMF as
well as with the World Bank, with whom, the WTO finalized a
cooperation agreement recently.
</P>
<P>
In addition, reflecting the synergy in the work and
responsibilities of the IMF and the WTO, the agreement provides
channels of communication to ensure that the rights and
obligations of the members are integral to the thinking of each
organization.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, in keeping with enhanced cooperation, the
agreement accords observer status to the IMF and WTO in certain of
each other's decision-making bodies, thus granting the WTO
observer status at appropriate meetings of the IMF's Executive
Board, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Now that the institutional footing has been put in place by the
agreement, the statement said that it is anticipated that work
will start soon to address issues related to achieving better
coherence in global economic policy making, and in areas where the
WTO, the IMF, and the World Bank each have distinctive roles.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China will, as all along, strive for the
realization of a comprehensive and just peace in the Middle East
together with the world community.
</P>
<P>
During talks with Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Al-Zouabi, who
is on his first visit to China, Li recalled his 1991 visit to Syria
and expressed the conviction that Al-Zouabi's current visit to
China would help promote bilateral co-operative ties.
</P>
<P>
Zouabi conveyed President Hafez Al-Assad's greetings to
President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng, heralding Li's 1991
trip to Syria as a success.
</P>
<P>
Zouabi agreed with Li on his evaluation of bilateral relations,
saying that the people of the two countries have always
sympathized with each other. While basing their bilateral ties on
mutual understanding and co-operation, the two nations hold
identical views on many international and regional issues, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of his current visit is to further promote
friendship between the two countries, especially their cooperation
in economic and trade sectors, the Syrian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Syria welcomes Chinese enterprises, which
enjoy advantages in experience and technology, to carry out
various kinds of co-operation with Syria, and the Syrian government
is willing to provide support and convenience for them.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that Syria consistently sticks to the "One China"
policy and considers Taiwan as an inalienable part of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
Li said that Syria, as an important country in the Middle East,
is playing a pivotal role in the peace process in the
region. China appreciates Syria's position on settling regional
issues through political consultations based on relevant UN
resolutions and the principle of "Land for Peace".
</P>
<P>
He added that the agreements which have been reached by the
relevant parties in the region should be adhered to.
</P>
<P>
Zouabi expressed his thanks for China's support for the just
cause of the Arab and Palestinian peoples, and expressed his hope
that China would continue to play an important role in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the smooth development of Sino-Syrian
friendly ties and effective cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He thanked Syria for its stand on the Taiwan issue, adding that
China will support Syria's just struggle to safeguard its
sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
China would like to further the bilateral political and trade
ties on the basis of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefit,
he noted, adding that the Chinese government will encourage
Chinese businesses to conduct economic and trade cooperation with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Li presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of Al-Zouabi, who arrived here this morning for a six-day
official visit.

will be the biggest ever following a decision Monday to add
kabaddi and squash to the program for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) decided to boost the sports
to 36. There were 33 sports at the 1994 Games in Hiroshima.

Thirty-four sports were agreed Sunday with kabaddi and squash
fighting for the final place. But after the OCA general assembly
failed to reach a decision the president, Sheikh Ahmad Al-Sabah of
Kuwait, included both.
</P>
<P>
The OCA general assembly heard that Thailand had agreed a
budget of more than 300 million dollars for building and upgrading
sports facilities, the athletes village and press centre.
</P>
<P>
Forty-three countries will compete in the Asian Games from
December 6-20, 1998 in 36 sports, an increase of three from the

<HEADLINE> Exports by South Korea's Smaller Firms Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Exports by South Korean small and
medium-sized companies are expected to experience a double-digit
growth this year amid the overall economic slowdown in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made today by the Federation of Korean Small
Industries (FKSI).
</P>
<P>
South Korea's small and medium-sized firms exported five
billion U.S. dollars worth of goods in October this year, a
14.4-percent increase over the same period last year, the highest
since February's 15.3 percent increase, and the fourth straight
month of double-digit growth since July.
</P>
<P>
Their cumulative exports during the January-October period this
year amounted to 44 billion dollars, up 10.2 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, exports by large companies rose by only
1.1 percent from a year ago, to 62 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Given year-end demand, the small and medium-sized companies
were expected to achieve a double-digit increased value in exports
without difficulty this year, the FKSI said.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of this year, South Korea ran a
trade deficit of 17 billion dollars, with 106 billion dollars in
exports and 123 billion dollars in imports.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's trade deficit totaled 10 billion
dollars, up 58.7 percent from the six billion dollars registered
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 30.3 percent from 1994 to 125 billion dollars
in 1995, the fastest yearly growth since 36.2 percent was recorded
in 1987. Imports grew even faster at 32 percent to 135 billion
dollars, the highest since they shot up 35.8 percent in 1979.

<HEADLINE> Developed Countries pledged to Reduce Greenhouse Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 150
countries began a week-long meeting here today to discuss the
problem of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
A news release said participants would draft a protocal, or
another legal instrument under the Climate Change Conventions, for
adoption at the December 1997 convention to be held in Kyoto,
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The Climate Change Conventions, ratified by more than 160
countries, was adopted at the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro,
Brazil, and came into effect in March 1994.
</P>
<P>
"It is time to start drafting the Kyoto accord, focusing on the
main ingredients of a package that will send strong economic
signals to investors and consumers", said Michael Zammit Cutajar,
the convention's executive secretary.
</P>
<P>
"Not all of the proposals on the table can be worked out in
detail in the remaining year, but some of them could lay the
foundation for continuing negotiations after Kyoto."
</P>
<P>
The meeting would discuss and set the standards of cutting gas
emissions, and the base and target years, said the news release.
</P>
<P>
Proposals submitted by participating countries include a
20-percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2005,
a 10-percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2005 and a
15-20 percent reduction by 2010, all against the base year of
1990, and a five to 10 percent reduction in all gases by 2010,
against the 1990 base.
</P>
<P>
At the gathering, developed countries are committed to taking
measures aimed at returning their greenhouse gas emissions to the
1990 levels by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics provided by the United Kingdom, UK
emissions of carbon dioxide have decreased from 664 million tons
in 1970 to 554 million tons in 1993, nearly 25 million tons below
its target of returning the gas emissions to the 1990 levels by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Figures of gas emissions from other developed countries are not
yet available.
</P>
<P>
Representatives would also discuss specific policies and
measures that could be included in the new commitments, said press
release.

BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin said here

system since the implementation of reforms and the opening-up
policy 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a National Conference of Public Health in Beijing,

disaster-stricken areas and have risked their lives in helping
prevent or treat diseases and have reduced the amount of human and
property losses.
</P>
<P>
Jiang praised Zhang Xiaoqian, Lin Qiaozhi, Zhu Futang, and
other outstanding members of the medical workers for devoting
their lives to improving the people's health.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) and the State Council on the reform and development of
medical care will be discussed at the conference, which is the
first of its kind since New China was founded in 1949.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Calls For Public Health Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
urged the whole of Chinese society today to play an active role in
the nation's patriotic public health campaign.
</P>
<P>
Jiang was speaking at a four-day national public health
conference which opened in Beijing this morning, where he said
that, with social and scientific progress, human beings have a
better understanding of things that harm their health and that the
public health cause has grown.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee, noted that there are many factors that
affect health, adding that living environment, public hygiene,
smoking, and excessive drinking have aroused a great deal of
concern.
</P>
<P>
Control of these factors should not depend just on public
health departments, Jiang said, but that all departments should
care more about public hygiene and health.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the patriotic public health campaign is a part of
the socialist public health cause and has played an important role
in improving the rural and urban environment and promoting people's
understanding of medical knowledge and health.
</P>
<P>
More hygienic cities, increased health education among the
country's 900 million farmers, and improved rural toilet
facilities should be the focus of future public health work. "This
work should be integrated with activities to create more
ethically and culturally developed cities and villages," Jiang
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that public health education be increased, and
that the sense of self-help and medical know-how be increased, and
that the people be taught healthy habits and a healthy lifestyle.
</P>

The government and all of society should join hands to do a
better job in public health work and improve people's health,

<HEADLINE> Submarine Cables Being Erected in Nigeria to Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The work will begin
today for the laying of an 800-kilometer-long submarine cable
linking Lagos, Port Harcourt and other major Nigerian
coastal cities.
</P>
<P>
The "Guardian" reported today that the project is being
handled by Siemens AG of Germany for the Nigerian
Telecommunications Ltd. at an estimated cost of 100 million
Deutchmark (about 154 US Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The project is also part of the Africa No. one project handled by
the American telecommunications giant, AT&AMP;T to link coastal
Africa via fibre optic technology, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On the south coast are a number of Nigeria's most important
cities and oil and other critical industries centers, including
Lagos, and Port Harcourt, the
oil industry center.
</P>
<P>
The current telecommunications conditions in the area are so
bad that companies there have to depend on the expensive very
small aperture terminal (VSAT) satellite communications. Oil
terminals have to link London to get to Lagos, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
The situation is set to be greatly improved by the planned
submarine cable, which will offer 26 fibre optics, each capable
of transmitting 7,680 telephone channels at the same time,
besides television signals and other digital data, the newspaper
added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Ruling Party Stays Away From Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' ruling
LAKAS-NUCD party said today that it is distancing itself from any
moves to amend the country's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Deputy party chief Gabriel Claudio, who is also the
Presidential Adviser for Political Affairs, said all members of
the ruling party are discouraged from having anything to do with
any efforts seeking changes to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the constitutional amendment is to lift
the term limits of all elected officials, including the president
who is allowed to serve only a single six-year term by the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
"All they need to do is to be consistent with the policy of the
party," Claudio said. "If they choose to express their opposition
to current suggestions and efforts to amend the constitution, I
think that would be consistent with the policy of the party."
</P>
<P>
He added that instead of sanctioning members who remain
committed to charter changes to seek another term, party leaders
are working on a scheme that would allow them to pick up their
successors for party endorsement in the 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Claudio called on leaders of the anti-Charter
amendment campaign to desist from using President Fidel Ramos in
their "gimmick" by seeking his signature on their campaign sheet.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has repeatedly said he is against charter changes and
that he will not seek a second term.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who took office in 1992, will reach the end of his
six-year term in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Exports by South Korea's Smaller Firms Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Exports by South Korean small and
medium-sized companies are expected to experience a double-digit
growth this year amid the overall economic slowdown in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The prediction was made today by the Federation of Korean Small
Industries (FKSI).
</P>
<P>
South Korea's small and medium-sized firms exported five
billion U.S. dollars worth of goods in October this year, a
14.4-percent increase over the same period last year, the highest
since February's 15.3 percent increase, and the fourth straight
month of double-digit growth since July.
</P>
<P>
Their cumulative exports during the January-October period this
year amounted to 44 billion dollars, up 10.2 percent from a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, exports by large companies rose by only
1.1 percent from a year ago, to 62 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Given year-end demand, the small and medium-sized companies
were expected to achieve a double-digit increased value in exports
without difficulty this year, the FKSI said.
</P>
<P>
During the first 10 months of this year, South Korea ran a
trade deficit of 17 billion dollars, with 106 billion dollars in
exports and 123 billion dollars in imports.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's trade deficit totaled 10 billion
dollars, up 58.7 percent from the six billion dollars registered
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports increased 30.3 percent from 1994 to 125 billion dollars
in 1995, the fastest yearly growth since 36.2 percent was recorded
in 1987. Imports grew even faster at 32 percent to 135 billion
dollars, the highest since they shot up 35.8 percent in 1979.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas today accused some circles outside the Islamic world of
tending to distort the truth of Islam by portraying it as the new
adversary of Western civilization.
</P>
<P>
"This dangerous concept makes no distinction between acts of
terrorism and the legitimate struggle of our Muslim brothers for
their inalienable political rights," Alatas told the 24th foreign
ministers' meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) here.
</P>
<P>
He said however that there have been occasions when acts of
senseless violence have been committed by unjustifiably invoking
the name of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Such acts have been condemned by the overwhelming majority of
Muslims as violations of the teachings of the Holy Koran and
tenets of Islam, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Muslim societies in various parts of the world are suffering
from aggression and foreign occupation, religious bigotry, racial
discrimination and other forms of oppression, he added.
</P>
<P>
The OIC meeting, attended by 53 member states and a number of
non-OIC nations and international organizations, was opened this
morning by Indonesian President Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the first one hosted by Indonesia since the
OIC was established in 1969, the ministers will discuss current
world problems, especially conflicts in the Middle East,
Afghanistan and Bosnia, and cooperation among member countries in
the economic, investment and trade fields.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting will also elect a new secretary general
for the organization.

JOHANNESBURG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain will maintain its
aid level to Botswana during the financial year 1997/98, the
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted a high-ranking
British diplomat as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
"In 1996/97 our assistance (to Botswana) totaled 3 million
Pounds. In 1997/98, we will provide the same amount," High
Commissioner of Britain David Beaumont said in Gaborone on

</P>
<P>
Beaumont said that of the money, 1.65 million Pounds will be spent
on the development of tourism and other natural resources. The
remainder will be equally divided between education and good
governance programs.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Botswana's ability to implement the aid and its
accountability, Beaumont said that based on previous performance,
the British government does not expect any problems in those
areas from Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Britain, a major creditor nation to Botswana, has supported
the development of natural resources in the country over the last
30 years, the SAPA said.

<HEADLINE> 134 People Apply For HKSAR Provisional Legislature Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 134 people have
completed their application forms for the Provisional Legislative
Council of the future Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR) as the three-week application period came to an end here
today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 218 application forms had been handed out over the
past three weeks, and 134 had been handed in by 5 p.m. today,
according to the Hong Kong Office of the Secretariat of the
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Applicants come from various sectors of the Hong Kong
community, including accountants, lawyers, bankers, teachers,
doctors, artists, entrepreneurs, businessmen and labor
representatives. Of the 60 members of the current Hong Kong
Legislative Council, 34 completed and handed in their application
forms.
</P>
<P>
Application for the 60-seat Provisional Legislative Council
started on November 18. Hong Kong people took an active part in
the nominations, said a spokesman of the Hong Kong Office of the
Secretariat of the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of the registration, 57 people came to pick up
application forms, and the first one was 83-year-old Elsie Tu, a
former political figure in Hong Kong. Legislative Council
President Andrew Wong Wang-fat handed in his application form last
weekend. He said the provisional legislature had become a reality
and as a responsible politician he must join the selection
process.
</P>
<P>
Many applicants expressed their wish to sit in the provisional
legislature so as to make contributions to the smooth transition
of Hong Kong and the establishment of the first government of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
China has made it clear that the current Legislative Council
cannot go on after June 30, 1997, since the arrangement for
"through train" failed due to the unilateral action taken by the
British side. Therefore, the formation of the Provisional
Legislative Council, which embodies the principles of "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy, is
essential to the smooth transition of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A key document on how to select the Provisional Legislative
Council of the HKSAR stipulates that applicants must be permanent
Hong Kong residents, who are at least 18 years old, and who are
supportive of the Basic Law of the HKSAR and willing to pledge
their loyalty to the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
A final list of candidates for membership of the provisional
legislature will be nailed down by Preparatory Committee on
December 12.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Provisional Legislative Council will be elected
on December 21 through secret ballot by the 400-strong Selection
Committee for the first government of the HKSAR.

<HEADLINE> Paradigm Shift Needed to Tap Hydrocarbon Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A paradigm shift is needed
in exploration efforts to tap the large potential of hydrocarbon
resources in Malaysia, Vice-President of the national petroleum
corporation Petronas Mohamad Idris Mansor said here today.
</P>
<P>
New and innovative ideas have recently resulted in some
hydrocarbon discoveries in the northern Malay Basin, he said at
the 19th Petroleum Geology Conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
"New ideas would tend to result in new discoveries if we were
to make a paradigm shift in our exploration efforts," Idris said.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that the remaining reserves in the country
could be comprehensively explored and effectively exploited
through constructive and innovative means utilizing the
state-of-the-art technology.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's remaining reserves, according to Idris, stand at
over four billion barrels of oil and 80 trillion standard cubic
feet of gas, ranking the country among the top 25 in world
reserves for both oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
He said domestic exploration efforts could be considered very
successful with an average success ratio of one in 4.5 for oil
exploration.
</P>
<P>
The total hydrocarbon reserves discovered to date in Malaysia
stood at over 7.4 billion barrels of oil and over 89 trillion
standard cubic feet of gas.
</P>
<P>
At present, Malaysia has 33 oil fields and nine gas fields
producing about 630,000 barrels of oil per day and 4.3 billion
standard cubic feet of gas per day.
</P>
<P>
Idris said the national demand for crude oil was at 61 percent
of daily production but the recent domestic supply and demand
balances showed that Malaysia would probably be a net importer of
oil by the middle of the next decade, assuming no new fields were
found and no new field development took place.
</P>
<P>
He said Petronas was looking at ways to improve the production
sharing contracts terms to encourage companies to do exploration
in Malaysia with reasonable returns on their investments.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing demand for gas in the region, coupled with
the advantage of being a more environment-friendly fuel, many oil
companies are now focusing on gas exploration in Malaysia, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Economy to Rebound Globally in 1997: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Global investors widely
believe that 1997 will herald a return to growth in most emerging
economies and an increase of assets allocated to emerging markets,
according to the latest Global Emerging Market Survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey published by Burson-Marsteller, one of the world's
leading communications consultancy pointed out that the Hong
Kong-China situation was widely held to be an important theme for
1997, with fund managers commenting on the extremely inexpensive
valuations available in China and the possibility of further
opening up of a potentially huge growth market.
</P>
<P>
It said that Britain's handover of Hong Kong was not held to be
of major concern for investors.
</P>
<P>
Asia-Pacific is still widely viewed as over-heated and
expensive with the last quarter of 1996 likely to be difficult.
The region is also viewed as the most susceptible to downturns in
economic cycles.
</P>
<P>
However, it noted, problems here were seen as cyclical and not
structural, and the general perception is that the region will see
 a return to growth in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Canada Sign Agreement on Aquiculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Canada today
signed an agreement under which the latter will train Malaysian
fishermen and research officers on sustainable aquiculture.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for 20 officers and supporting staff to
be trained by Canadian instructors in disease diagnosis and fish
health management using molecular techniques and histopathology at
the Fisheries Research Institute in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, six officers from Malaysia would also be
trained at the Canadian Aquiculture Institute for two months while
another three would study in Canada for their masters and Ph.D. in
fish health management.
</P>
<P>
The training would enhance the skills of the trainees to tackle
pressing problems arising from the rapid development and expansion
of the aquiculture industry, Malaysian Agriculture Minister
Sulaiman Daud said at the signing ceremony at his ministry.
</P>
<P>
"Disease outbreaks affecting fish and shrimp have severely
affected the industry and had cost the nation millions of
dollars," he said.
</P>
<P>
The project would be instrumental in realizing the Malaysian
Aquiculture Master Plan aimed at increasing the production of
aquiculture to 350,000 tons in the year 2010, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> China to Use "G-TELP" Test for English in Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The US's General Test of
English Language Proficiency (G-TELP) will be used in China to
test the proficiency level of people working in the tourism
business across the country in 1997, the China National Tourism
Administration announced here today.
</P>
<P>
After two years of review, Chinese experts who did a
comparitive study of English-language tests, decided that the
G-TELP, which was developed by San Diego State University, UCLA,
and Georgetown University, was best suited to the country's
tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on use of the test was signed today by Xiao
Qianhui, the director of the Department of Personnel, Labor, and
Education of the National Tourism Administration, Dr. William
P. Locke, dean of the College of Extended Studies of San Diego
State University, and Zhou Qixun, Chairman of the Shanghai Orient
Ladder Intellectual Development Co. Ltd., who is the Chinese agent
for San Diego State University's International Testing Service
Center.
</P>
<P>
Those involved say they believe this move is significant for
the development of China's tourism industry because the English
level of people in the industry is lagging behind that of people
in neighboring countries. A recent study showed that about 40
percent of the problems with service in Chinese hotels was due to
the low level of comprehension of foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
The tourism administration plans to introduce the G-TELP in
hotels and tourism colleges in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and
Dalian, and in Shaanxi, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Guangdong provinces
on a trial basis before applying it to the sector as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Teaching materials and exams will be chosen by Chinese and
American experts, and the adminstration will set up a G-TELP test
and training center to supervise the work, with offices to be set
up by tourism bureaus at the provincial level.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Turkish Military Agreement Not to Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Cyprus official said
Israel has given assurances to Cyprus that its military
cooperation with Turkey neither affects nor threatens Cyprus'
security, Cyprus News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is friendly disposed toward Cyprus and would never
enter into a military agreement with another country which would
entail terms affecting Cyprus in an adverse manner," Cyprus'
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides said Sunday on his return
from a one-day official visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Michaelides had a meeting with Israeli
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and held talks with his
Israeli counterpart David Levy.
</P>
<P>
The recent Israeli-Turkish defense agreement, the Cyprus
question, the Middle East peace process and other matters of
mutual concern were also dealt with in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said the agreement recently signed between Israel
and Turkey does not include any additional elements beyond the
terms of a previous defense agreement forged earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The latest accord concerns the implementation of the
provisions of the previous agreement. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Foreign Minister David Levy have assured us there
is nothing in this agreement that affects Cyprus directly or
indirectly," Michaelides added.
</P>
<P>
The minister expressed satisfaction with the outcome of his
visit and described it as "a visit with substance which conveyed
the message that Cyprus participates in regional developments."
</P>
<P>
He said Cyprus aims to become a bridge between Europe and the
Middle East and to achieve this, one has to be in close contact
with one's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cypriot-Israeli bilateral relations, the
minister said that "we have achieved a lot in the past three years,
signed five agreements on various fields and more are under
way."

<P>
During their talks, Michaelides briefed the Israeli prime
minister on the latest developments in Cyprus while Netanyahu

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Campaign Intensifies in Philippines for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The campaign for amending the
constitution of the Philippines is intensifying as the nation sees
battle lines drawn between the drive's advocates and opponents.
</P>
<P>
Both camps have launched nationwide signature-collecting
campaigns on the issue of the constitution's single-term limit on
the president.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a private group called the People's Initiative for
Reform, Modernization and Action (PIRMA), announced the start of
their drive for changing the term limit to allow President Fidel
Ramos and other elective officials to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA, led by former Philippine ambassador to Belgium
Alberto Pedrosa and his wife, asked the Commission on Elections to
declare a plebiscite period between January 11 and June 11 next
year to decide whether the constitution should be changed.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the Commission to set a date for it to begin
gathering signatures, saying that it will try to collect some 5
million signatures by January 15 next year.
</P>
<P>
One day later, another group -- the National Democratic and
Economic Growth for the Country -- declared its support for
changing the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Both groups said that Ramos' re-election could consolidate
economic gains achieved by his administration and avoid any
potential political instability in the future.
</P>
<P>
The constitution change campaign has met strong opposition from
congressmen from both the ruling party and the opposition parties,
who, crossing party lines, announced today that they will start a
rival signature-collecting campaign at the grassroots level to
oppose amendments to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Former President Corazon Aquino and her allies have also set up
a group to oppose any changes to the constitution, saying that
they are moving to oppose re-imposing martial law on the country.
</P>
<P>
The current constitution, drafted in 1987 after Aquino took
over from Ferdinand Marcos, prescribes a single-term limit on the
president to prevent recurrence of dictatorships in the country,
which had been under a 20-year rule by Marcos before 1986.
</P>
<P>
It also stipulates that senators may serve no more than two
six-year terms and members of the House of Representatives are not
allowed to serve more than three three-year terms.
</P>
<P>
The constitution permits amendments in one of the three ways:
by Congress as a constituent assembly, by Congress calling for a
Constitutional Convention, or through a people's initiative
supported by 12 percent of all voters nationwide with at least
three percent from each legislative district.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls showed that Ramos' performance rating
climbed to 21 percent last September from only one percent a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the president's rating was boosted by his
peace initiative in southern Mindanao which put an end to a
24-year-old war between government troops and the Moro National
Liberation Front, the former biggest rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The support for Ramos was also reinforced by the economic
growth of the Philippines, described as a new economic tiger this
year with a 7.1-percent projected growth, high export earnings, a

Responding to rumors that the administration and the ruling
party are behind the constitution change campaign, Ramos said
during a Sunday visit to Subic that he would find out the people
behind the drive and persuade them to drop their plans.
</P>
<P>
Ramos has repeatedly said that he would step down when his
six-year term ends in 1998 regardless of the proposed change in
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Most Filipinos seem dubious about the constitution change
campaign, which the Commission on Elections has also said would be
"futile."

<HEADLINE> China to Set up Panel for Electric Vehicle Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A panel that will coordinate
the research and development of electric vehicles to ensure the
effectiveness of electric vehicle projects will be set up in
China, Shi Dinghuan, director of the Industrial Department of the
State Science and Technology Commission (SSTC), said here recently.
</P>
<P>
The panel's major job will be to determine goals and amount of
investment, and help implement projects, according to Shi, who was
in Beijing Sunday for the International Presentation, Seminar and
Exhibition of Electric Vehicles and Alternative-Fuel Vehicles
Technology.
</P>
<P>
The panel will be made up of officials and experts from the
SSTC, the State Education Commission, the Ministries of Power
Industry and Public Security, the State Bureau of Environment
Protection, the State Administration of Customs, the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, the State Bureau of Technological
Supervision, the China Dongfeng Automobile Company, and the No.1
Automotive Group.
</P>
<P>
Electric vehicles have attracted a great deal of attention
because of their fuel economy and low level of pollution. China
has listed them as one of its key development projects for the
next five years, and produced its first electric car last March.
</P>
<P>
China plans to develop electric vehicles at international
standards, set up manufacturing bases that can produce 3,000 to
5,000 electric vehicles in 2000, and establish two to three
demonstration zones for electric vehicles.
</P>
<P>
"Although the automotive industry has made a great contribution
to China's economy, it is time for China to solve its energy
resource, environmental protection, and safety problems," Zhang
pointed out, adding that, to develop both the automotive industry
and the national economy as a whole, China should pay greater
attention to research and development in electric vehicles and
alternative-fuel vehicles.

QINGDAO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Tsingtao Beer, one of China's
famous beers, has boomed on overseas markets, selling in 48
countries and regions around the world.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Tsingtao Beer Group Company,

<HEADLINE> EU Outlines Chinese Membership As One Objective of WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union today
called for re-launching "in earnest" the negotiations towards the
Chinese membership of the World Trade Organization (WTO), as trade
ministers from its 128 members gathered here today for the first
WTO Ministerial Conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the Ministerial Conference,
Sir Leon Brittan, EU Commissioner for Trade Policy, underlined the
Chinese membership issue as one of the four European Commission's
key objectives for the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Noting the "remarkable changes going on in China" and a
continuing process of economic renewal elsewhere in Asia and in
Latin America, Brittan said, "this is fundamentally changing the
way the international economic system works but, most important,
it is spreading more broadly the responsibility for shaping that
system."
</P>
<P>
"Hence the urgent need for WTO enlargement," he said against
the background that there are 30 countries and regions, including
China and Russia, are in the process of joining the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Brittan also called for broadening the work program of the WTO
to cover new issues where future trade obstacles are likely to
arise, such as investment and competition policy.
</P>
<P>
The other two objectives highlighted by Brittan were building a
consensus on removing barriers to trade in information technology
products and preparing the ground for an ambitious world deal on
basic telecommunications services, and bringing the least
developed countries closer to the benefits of world trade
liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Reported HIV Carriers in Mideast Doubles over Past </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of reported
HIV carriers in the Middle East has doubled over the past
two years to 192,000, according to a regional conference on
fighting against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
More than 40 Israeli, Palestinian and Jordanian health
professionals and educators are holding a four-day meeting here
since last Friday to explore ways to forge a joint war against
the emerging common enemy: AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by the Jerusalem AIDS Project,
an international non-governmental organization, and financed by
Israeli Foreign Ministry, the Health Ministry of the Palestinian
Authority (PA) and the Canadian government.
</P>
<P>
The participants are discussing ways to better overcome
various AIDS education barriers in the conservative and
religious settings in the region.
</P>
<P>
AIDS has yet to become widespread in the Middle East, but
the pace of its transmission is alarming. U.N. AIDS official
Johannes Van Dam told the conference that the HIV carriers
in the region have doubled over the past two years to
192,000 and 10,000 people died from AIDS in 1995 only.
</P>
<P>
Improved reporting of the HIV cases was responsible for the
higher number of known HIV carriers, but this was also due
to the spread of the disease in the region, Dam said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics issued by the Israeli Health Ministry show that
there are only 1,425 known cases of AIDS in Israel, which has a
population of 5.7 million.
</P>
<P>
In the Palestinian self-rule areas, there have been only 28
reported cases of full-blown AIDS since 1981, according to
Eyad Arafe, an expert from the PA Health Ministry's Department
of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was no new report of AIDS cases in
1996, but added that AIDS education should improve as fewer
Palestinians were being tested due to fear of getting positive
results.
</P>
<P>
To wage a common war against AIDS, the conference has
approved the establishment of a new task force on AIDS
Prevention. Inon Schenker, a spokesman for the Jerusalem AIDS
Project, praised the participants' efforts to fight AIDS despite
of the current difficult political situation.

<HEADLINE> Zambia To Destroy Expired Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
finally secured 1.2 million U.S. Dollars to destroy an estimated
300 tons of expired pesticides which have been posing serious
environmental problems in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted Director James Phiri of the
Environmental Council of Zambia as saying that an European firm
has won a tender to export the pesticides for incineration abroad
at the cost of 1.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said the pesticides have been covered with tarpaulins to
avoid being washed into the soil by rain to mix with drinking
water.
</P>
<P>
The government has been trying to dispose the pesticides for
about two years now but did not have the resources until recently
when the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) stepped in to
assist, the local newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
It will be cheaper to export the pesticides abroad for
incineration than burn them in Zambia, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
In November last year, traces of toxic substances were
discovered in samples of water drawn from Lusaka water works and
it was feared that it would be hazardous to human life in the
long run if the pesticides were allowed to be in the open for too
long.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Negotiators Leave for WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Trade and Industry
Secretary Cesar Bautista left here today for the first ministerial
meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine delegation to the five-day conference that
opened today includes Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero and
experts from various departments of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
According to Bautista, the delegates will actively involve
themselves with working committees as WTO ministers review the
progress of global rules of trade aimed at facilitating and
enabling easier entry of export products on global markets.
</P>
<P>
Included in the agenda of the working committees are disputes
between the Philippines and Brazil and between the Philippines and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines has questioned a unilateral decision by Brazil
to impose an estimated duty of 100 U.S. dollars a ton on
desiccated coconut oil from the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines and other countries have also questioned a
unilateral decision by the U.S. subjecting garments made in
developing countries to higher import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Under the new U.S. rule, garments made of fabrics consigned to
manufacturers in developing countries are no longer to be
considered as being made in the developing countries and are,
therefore, subject to regular U.S. tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Both coconut oil and garments are major foreign exchange
earners of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The WTO is expected to review the progress of the first two
years of the WTO and chart the steps needed to further advance
trade liberalization and facilitation.
</P>
<P>
Among other issues to be taken up at the meeting are labor
standards, transparency in government purchasing, information
technology, and China's WTO membership.

<HEADLINE> Soeharto Urges OIC to Respond to New Developments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today called on the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC)
to respond in a timely and effective way to new developments in
the political, economic and socio-cultural areas.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 24th conference of OIC foreign ministers held
at the Jakarta Convention Center here, the Indonesian president
said that in order to maintain the relevance of the organization
in this world of rapid change, the OIC should adopt a set of
realistic and attainable objectives.
</P>
<P>
Although the global economy has brought about progress and
hopes, it still created some concerns, he told the opening
ceremony of the conference which is being attended by 53 OIC
members and a number of non-OIC states and representatives from
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of poverty, underdevelopment, economic
stagnation, high indebtedness and limited access to education
continue to saddle the majority of developing countries including
OIC member states," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In this world characterized by increasing globalization and
where major problems are increasingly interlinked, the solutions
to the above problems therefore should be comprehensive and
systematic, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said it is necessary to promote constructive dialogue, and
not confrontation, between developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the current international trends
have strengthened the rationale for South-South cooperation as a
credible and viable strategy.
</P>
<P>
He believed that if OIC countries could optimize the resources
and capabilities possessed by the member states, it could make a
major contribution to South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
OIC Secretary General Hamid Algabid also made a speech at the
opening ceremony. He recalled the achievements the organization
has made since it was formed in 1969.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general, who will end his term after this
meeting, called for further reforms to strengthen the OIC role and
promote cooperation among the members of the organization.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed the OIC's position on international issues,
especially the conflicts in Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which will last for five days, will discuss
current world problems, the cooperation among the OIC members and
other issues of common concern and will also elect a new secretary
general of the 27-year-old organization.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Spread Its Culture Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that the country is ready to further spread its culture
abroad in an effort to promote worldwide awareness of the Chinese
civilization.
</P>
<P>
Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and a State Councillor, told a
national meeting on promoting Chinese culture abroad that The
Chinese cultural workers must make more efforts to spread
information about China and create a good external environment for
the comprehensive rejuvenation of the Chinese nation and the
modernization process.
</P>
<P>
"The culture work must publicize the country's image and
safeguard the country's interests," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Li added that while actively importing fine-quality foreign
culture, China's culture watchdogs must beware of the infiltration
of unacceptable cultural beliefs and practices from the West.
</P>
<P>
Li suggested that the country should continue to send cultural
and artistic troupes abroad.
</P>
<P>
Culture authorities should improve macro control and
management, strengthen the building of a legal system, and
introduce new reforms when promoting culture abroad, the official
noted.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, the Ministry of Culture has launched
more than 4,000 cultural exchange programs, which were attended by
some 40,000 artists from both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has signed 137 cultural agreements with foreign
countries, according to Culture Minister Liu Zhongde.
</P>
<P>
Chinese culture can be spread in a number of ways, through
exhibitions, performances, broadcasting, providing cultural aid,
publishing books and distributing newspapers in foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Opera and acrobatics are the two most-frequently used
forms of communication about Chinese culture, according to sources
with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the efforts have increased foreigners'
understanding of China, and helped improve and develop relations
between China and foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that China will map out a plan to guide the
culture promotion work between 1997 and 2000 at the four-day
meeting.

<HEADLINE> China to Control Unchecked Transient Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Civil
Affairs has urged to control the unchecked flow of transient
workers during the upcoming peak period at the time of the Spring
Festival -- the Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry requires its departments and local authorities
around the country to improve relief efforts for people in the
disaster-hit areas, in order to put an end to their blind
job-searching outside the areas where they live, and to repatriate
them if they cannot find work.
</P>
<P>
China was hit by a number of natural disasters this year, and
the ministry has insisted that the disaster-relief money and
materials should be offered to the hard-hit areas to ensure the
people there food, housing and clothes, and to persuade them from
seeking jobs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
It asks all provinces, major cities in particular, to improve
the management of transients, to supply them with food and
clothing, and to organize immediate repatriation once they find no
jobs.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also calls for improved management in the rural
areas to effectively reduce the amount of blind job-hunting, and
to help improve the general living conditions of the transients.
</P>
<P>
The floating population at the time of China's traditional
Spring Festival, or the Lunar New Year, is expected to reach more
than one billion.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will host talks next
week on lifting of economic sanctions imposed on Burundi by its
neighboring countries, The East African reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Tanzanian government sources as saying in
Arusha last weekend that there was pressure from all over the
east and central African region to lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the sanctions "have totally failed to
bring about the designed goal and are not effective at all, while
pressure is mounting from every corner that they should be
lifted."
</P>
<P>
At a summit meeting held recently in Brazzavile, Congo,
central African leaders called for an end to the trade embargo
against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
At an extraordinary meeting, the U.N. Permanent Consultative
Committee on Security in Africa said that it has taken note of
the Burundi government measures to relaunch the democratic
process in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi government is committed to setting up democratic
institutions within a reasonable time and to pursuing dialogue
with all of the political and social groups in the country, the
U.N. consultative committee said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from east and central African countries decided, at a
meeting at Arusha on july 31, to impose economic sanctions on
Burundi to compel the military regime of Major Buyoya to restore
immediately the country's National Assembly and political parties
and to abide by the national peace process.

<HEADLINE> New Forces Driving World Economy Forward: WTO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- New forces such as
information are pushing the world economy forward,
Director-General of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Renato
Ruggiero told the WTO's inaugural Ministerial Conference here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Information, know-how, ideas -- these are the new forces that
are driving the global economy forward," Ruggiero said.
</P>
<P>
"Knowledge, like water, will be an essential resource" in the
economy of the next century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero called for a unity of the WTO members, which he said
is "the most valuable asset" of the world trading body.
</P>
<P>
He said that the unity can be attained "by reaching agreement
on the few issues."
</P>
<P>
"Consensus is the rule of this organization; but consensus
means first of all a shared responsibility," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are a few politically sensitive issues in the WTO, such
as labor standards, over which the developed and developing
nations remain at odds.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of labor standards, Ruggiero said that "since a
basic purpose of our efforts is to raise living standards
worldwide, trade liberalization helps create a more favorable
climate for the observance of core labor standards."
</P>
<P>
He said that the WTO's priorities for 1997 also include the
conclusion of the financial services talks and some of the major
accession negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Distance Education Programme Train One Million Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese college is probably
the most fruitful one in the world, for it has trained more than
one million students over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The students are actually those failing the national entrance
exams to universities. But the college, which broadcasts courses
through television and radio all over the country, provides
higher-education opportunities for them.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese television and broadcast colleges have trained 1.37
million students for various sectors since 1986, the year China
started a distance-education programme to give education chances
to people who can not go to universities.
</P>
<P>
The colleges have played a special role in boosting rural
productivity and enable farmers to get rich, said a report in
today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The colleges spread technical skills including soil science,
fertilizer science, agricultural energy, agro-machinery and tools,
mechanization of farm work, crop-growing skills, water
conservation, pest control, storing and processing methods of farm
products, and vegetable and fruit cultivation.

<HEADLINE> China's Achievements in Medical Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- In the past 47 years, since the
birth of the new China, the country has seen some major
achievements in the field of medicine, with the average life span
increasing dramatically from 35 to 70.
</P>
<P>
According to a recently released report on medical care from
the Ministry of Public Health, the infant mortality rate has
dropped significantly to 36 per thousand from as many as 200 per
thousand in 1949.
</P>
<P>
And the number of deaths of pregnant women has fallen from
1,500 per 100,000 to 62 per 100,000. Infectious, endemic, and
parasitic diseases have all been put under tight controls, the
report points out.
</P>
<P>
It notes that at present, China, which has 1.2 billion people,
has 5.37 million people working in medicine, and 1.3 million rural
doctors and nurses.
</P>
<P>
China has 190,000 medical institutions of different kinds,
nearly 70,000 of which are hospitals above the county level, with
100,000 outpatient clinics, 582 sanatoriums, and 800,000 rural
clinics.
</P>
<P>
The report states that the country has 8,700
preventive-medicine and health-care institutes, including 4,000
epidemic prevention and supervision institutions, 1,900
specialized-medicine institutes, and 2,800 for female and child
care.
</P>
<P>
There are also 427 medical research institutes, the report
says. The country's 126 medical universities have produced a
million graduates and the 551 special medical schools have 2.1
million graduates.
</P>
<P>
There are 3.14 million hospital beds in China, a figure that is
increasing by 60,000 each year, meaning 2.39 beds per thousand,
but the numbers of doctors, nurses, and hospital beds are growing
at a faster rate than the population.
</P>
<P>
The report also says that state expenditures on medical care
have grown annually, and stood at 14.6 billion yuan (about 1.76
billion US dollars) in 1994, accounting for 2.54 percent of state
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, more than 50 million people were hospitalized, and
hospitals had a cure rate of 95 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
called for full implementation of the achieved peace agreement
between Palestine and Israel when he opened the 24th foreign
ministers meeting of the Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC)
here today.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the Middle East accords are irrevocable and must
be respected, Soeharto reaffirmed support for the Palestinian
people in their quest for self-determination and a sovereign
independent state in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
He pledged support for Syria and Lebanon in their peace
negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"We will stand firmly on the side of the Arab nations in their
efforts and struggle to regain their territories which are
occupied by Israel," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel must unconditionally withdraw from the Syrian
Golan Heights and southern Lebanon for a just and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian president also expressed concern over continued
conflicts in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country backs the efforts taken by the U.N.
secretary general and the OIC in searching for a just, lasting and
comprehensive settlement in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto praised the achievements in the Bosnia-Herzegovina
peace process, particularly recent elections which led
Bosnia-Herzegovina closer to reconciliation and paved the way for
the creation of durable national institutions.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope for the peace in southern
Philippines, which was achieved in September this year, to last
for ever.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said that the end of the Cold War has revived new
hopes and expectations for a more secure, peaceful and prosperous
world.
</P>
<P>
"We presently live in a world which is undergoing rapid and
fundamental changes. New challenges and opportunities are
emerging. ... Every country and the world as a whole are in the
process of adjustment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The five-day meeting, the first of its kind hosted by
Indonesia, is attended by 53 OIC members and four observers as

problem for three million rural residents, according to the "China
Geology and Mineral Resources News."
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the State Council, China's highest administrative
body, and local governments have invested 600 million yuan (about
72 million US dollars) in drilling wells in more than 6,000 places
in the mountainous region in western Henan.
</P>
<P>
The wells project, undertaken with the help of the Ministry of

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Open "Window" for Earth Depth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have created
a simulation of the environment some 200 km under the earth's
mantle, calling it a "window" through which they can view the
planet's depth.
</P>
<P>
Scientists with the Institute of Geochemistry under the Chinese
Academy of Sciences have simulated the condition in which there
exists atmospheric pressure of 456,000 kilopascals, and
temperatures as high as 1,500 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
"All minerals are moving in the liquid form under such
conditions, so we feel like we have moved with the pulse of the
earth," said Xie Hongshen, head researcher of the project.
</P>
<P>
Modern exploration technology allows researchers to take rock
samples from a depth of only 13 km under the earth's surface,
which is equal to 0.002 of the earth's diameter.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Geochemistry will soon open its laboratory
to the public to attract more Sino-foreign scientists for
participation in this field.
</P>
<P>
"In just hundreds of years, the industrial revolution has
consumed the earth's mineral resources, which need at least
hundreds of thousands of geological years to form. Scientists in
many countries of the world have begun research on the depth of
the earth to search for new mineral resources," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
One research project that has captured the interest of many
scientists across the world is measuring the speed of sound waves
as they spread through rocks and minerals in high temperatures and
under high pressure. Such study enables scientists to understand
the theory of mutation of objects within the depths of the earth.
</P>
<P>
Xu Jian, a professor with the Taiwan Central Research Academy
who has studied the wave spreading from the earth's mantle to the
surface, approached a number of labs throughout the world and
asked for assistance, but was rejected. Eventually, the Institute
of Geochemistry in Guiyang satisfied his demand.
</P>
<P>
"Even gold can be melted in the conditions we created, which
has sufficiently supported the theory that fluid can become
mineral," Xie said. "I have a firm belief that with the deepening
of research, people can finally get a clear view of the earth's
depth."

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region has
established eight baby-friendly hospitals in a move to intensify
its protection of women's and children's health.
</P>
<P>
The first baby-friendly hospital was established in this
capital of Tibet in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the region's target to be met by the year 2000, 80
percent of newly-born babies will be fed with breast milk.
</P>
<P>
All baby-friendly hospitals have provided 24-hour
mother-and-baby accommodation services, to guarantee
breast-feeding for newly-born babies.
</P>
<P>
Many of them have also opened breast-feeding hotlines and
established health cards to monitor and guide breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
Now 97 percent of urban pregnant women in Tibet enjoy prenatal
and postpartum health care, and 97.37 percent of them give births
to babies with the help of medical workers using hygienic methods.
</P>
<P>
The two rates for rural areas stand at 90 percent and 54.28
percent, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Largest Skeleton Found in Dinosaur's Cemetery in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A 21 m long, six m high dinosaur
skeleton has been unearthed in a "dinosaur cemetery" in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists say that the dinosaur, which had lizard-like
feet and weighed nearly 100 tons, is the largest ever found in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
The "cemetery" in the western part of the Xilin Gol Grasslands,
was an expanse of lakes and tropical forests some 70-130 million
years ago when several species of dinosaurs dominated the area.
</P>
<P>
Complete skeletons of carnivorous dinosaurs and those with a
duckbill have been excavated since the discovery of the site in
the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
Also found at the site are fossilized dinosaur eggs and fossils
of other types of dinosaurs, including one with the facial
features of a bird.

<HEADLINE> US Delegate Outlines Objectives for WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Acting US Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky urged trade ministers of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) members to make progress in three
major areas at the inaugural WTO Ministerial Conference, which
opened here today.
</P>
<P>
In a formal statement before the opening session of the first
biennial WTO Ministerial Conference, Barshefsky identified
completion of the Information Technology Agreement (ITA), progress
in telecommunications negotiations, and a commitment to meet
financial services deregulation goals as key objectives for the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We must prove to the world that the WTO is a vibrant
institution laying the foundations for a new period of global
prosperity. We must seize new opportunities," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The global economy will not wait for us. Technological change
is advancing rapidly, all over the globe, in the West and in the
East," she added.
</P>
<P>
She urged the participating trade ministers to make progress
this week, saying, "If we can succeed in three important
negotiations -- information technology, basic telecommunications
services and financial services -- we can build the infrastructure
for a more interconnected global economy of the 21st century".
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky also stressed the importance of several other issues
for the WTO meeting, including advancing transparency in
government procurement, continuing reforms in agricultural trade
and defining a balanced approach to dealing with trade and
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in his opening
address that though it is clear that low labor costs are a
legitimate comparative advantage for developing countries, and
that labor standards should not be used as a disguised
protectionist measure, it is less clear if labor standards can be
properly and justifiably discussed in the WTO context.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that if the WTO is not to be unnecessarily
distracted from its central goal of promoting and safeguarding the
multilateral free trade regime, there should be early
clarification and agreement on whether these issues are directly
related to international trade, and whether the WTO would be the
most appropriate forum to discuss these issues meaningfully.

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM on Labor Standards at WTO Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said today that labor standards should not be used as a
"disguised protectionist measure".
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in an opening speech at the World Trade
Organization's (WTO) first Ministerial Conference, which opened
here today.
</P>
<P>
Goh said, "It is clear that low labor costs are a legitimate
comparative advantage for developing countries, and that labor
standards should not be used as a disguised protectionist
measure."
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister pointed out that it is still a question
whether the issue of labor standards should be discussed at the
WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
"It is less clear if labor standards can be properly and
justifiably discussed in the WTO context," he said.
</P>
<P>
Developed and developing countries remain widely divided on
such new issues as labor standards, competition policy and
investment rules.
</P>
<P>
To avoid the distraction from its central goal of promoting and
safeguarding the multilateral free trade regime, Goh said, WTO
members should clarify as soon as possible whether the issues are
directly related to trade and whether the WTO would be the most
appropriate forum to discuss them meaningfully.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been pushing hard for the inclusion of
the labor standards in the agenda of the Ministerial Conference, a
move that has met with strong objection from the developing
countries which argue that the West was attempting to undermine
their trading advantages.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Trade and Industry Minister Yeo Cheow Tong said in
September that before raising any issue, proponents should
consider if it is relevant to trade, if the WTO is the best forum
to deal with it and if the issue is ripe for discussion.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Sharp Improvement in Engineering, Housing Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China has greatly improved the
quality of various engineering and housing projects, as a result
of a nationwide engineering supervision and monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Minister of Construction Tan Qinglian said in an
interview with Xinhua today that large groups of China's key
projects and large-sized urban public facilities, as well as
nearly one billion sq m of newly-built housing residences, meet
the advanced world standards or reach the State-set targets in
terms of construction quality.
</P>
<P>
A national survey on construction quality shows that the
qualification rate of the country's engineering and housing
projects has increased by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, breakthroughs have been made in the planning,
designing and construction of the country's engineering and
housing projects, and great headway has been achieved in
protecting the environment and completing the infrastructural
facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the senior official, more than 90 percent of
 cities and counties throughout the country have set up
engineering quality supervision stations, which cover 88 percent
of the country's construction projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the country's 29 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions have introduced the engineering monitoring
system, establishing a total of 1,500 construction monitoring
institutes which have effectively handled or prevented some 60,000
hidden construction hazards or problems in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress made in improving construction quality,
many loopholes still exist, particularly in the construction of
residential housing, the vice-minister said, adding that much
still needs to be done in this respect.

<P>
HANGZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- A sacrificial altar made of
yellow, black and brown earth, which dates back 5,300-6,000 years,
has been discovered at a highway construction site in Jiaxing,
east China's Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the one-m-high altar, covering
an area of 100 sq m, is the first from that period ever found in
the area.
</P>
<P>
The altar was spotted in the construction area of an express
highway connecting Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang, and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Also found at the spot were remains of seven houses and 90
tombs from the same period. Precious jade and unique pottery have
been uncovered in the tombs.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the discovery will shed light on the study of
the period, when the society transformed from a matriarchy to a
patriarchy.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Step up Medical Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China will build a new medical
insurance system designed to cover all employees in cities and
towns by the year 2000, an official with the Ministry of Public
Health said today.
</P>
<P>
The system, which links social insurance funds and personal
accounts, has proved successful in some pilot cities, said Cai
Renhua, director of the ministry's Department of Policies and
Regulations.
</P>
<P>
Surveys show that the new medical system has raised the health
care standard for employees, curbed the rapid growth of medical
expenses and improved hospital management.
</P>
<P>
The government initiated a reform in 1989 to separate the
overall fund, jointly provided by the government and the
enterprises to offer free medical services and labor insurance to
employees, into two parts: a social insurance fund and personal
accounts.
</P>
<P>
Under the reform, medical expenses for minor illnesses were
paid out of the personal accounts, while the social insurance fund
took care of the major costs of serious ailments, Cai explained.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the State Council first implemented the measures in
Zhenjiang, in east China's Jiangsu Province and in Jiujiang, east
China's Jiangxi Province, and this year expanded the measures to
more than 50 medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
Cai, also the director of the National Administration Center of
Free Medical Services, said that the new system could make up for
the many disadvantages of its predecessor, including the lack of
steady financial sources and clear and effective restrictions, and
the limiting of coverage to only state employees and some of the
collective employees.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the new system, employees must pay part of
their medical bills. The amount of the insurance fee paid by an
employee has to pay is based on the total medical expenses
incurred in the previous year -- normally about ten percent of the
employee's salary.
</P>
<P>
Cai said he hopes that the central government will promote the
medical insurance system at the National Conference on Health
Care, which opens today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The existing health care system was formed in the early 1950s,
and is sponsored mainly by the government and enterprises, in part
from the state budget and also from welfare funds.
</P>
<P>
Some 154 million people in the country enjoy free medical
services and labor insurance, with 57.6 billion yuan of total
medical expenses recorded in 1995, or 21.3 times the figure of
1978.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Reports Another Harvest in Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural production in the
Tibet Autonomous Region hit a record high this year, thanks to an
improved infrastructure and better application of advanced
agro-techniques.
</P>
<P>
This is the ninth consecutive year that the region has reported
a good harvest. Production of grain and rapeseed are expected to
reach 770,000 tons and 37,000 tons, respectively, up by seven
percent and ten percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, the local governments have been organizing
farmers to construct and upgrade water ditches, ponds, wells and
other irrigation facilities.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 10,000 ha of dry lands have received access to
irrigation, the production of 20,000 ha of low-yielding farmland
has been raised, and another 6,700 ha have been turned into arable
land.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, a total of 304 million yuan (36.6 million
US dollars) has been pooled from various channels to supplement
the region's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local agricultural departments have been
helping farmers to obtain fine-quality seeds, chemical
fertilizers, pesticides and advanced agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the state's grain purchasing prices have been raised,
inspiring more enthusiasm among farmers for agriculture.

<P>
TOKYO, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada, Canada's national
carrier, will open non-stop flights from Osaka of Japan to Toronto
of Canada starting in June next year, the Kyodo News Service
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Three flights a week will operate between Kansai International
Airport, near Japan's western major commercial city of Osaka, R.
Lamar Durrett, president and chief executive officer of Air
Canada, said in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Durrett said that any flights beyond Japan to points in Asia
will be done in conjunction with All Nippon Airways, a major
Japanese airline company.
</P>
<P>
Air Canada began a code-sharing service with ANA between Osaka
and Vancouver of Canada last August, making a daily non-stop
flight between the two cities.
</P>
<P>
Durrett said Asia is an area where Air Canada would like to fly
to all major points in Asia, and he believes China will be an area
of big growth in air travel over the next decade.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Steel Output Rises to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's overall steel output
hit a record high of more than 1.6 million tons this year thanks
to a series of government efforts to increase investment and
upgrade technology, the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The booming of the steel industry is spurred by the growing
demand on the domestic market stimulated by the policy of
"renovation."
</P>
<P>
After years of construction, the steel industry, started almost
from scratch, has gradually taken shape. Vietnam now has four
major steel complexes each with an annual production capacity of
200,000 to 400,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Ho Nghia Dung, director of Vietnam Steel Corporation, said a
15-year master plan has already been drawn up to further increase
steel output.
</P>
<P>
The development plan will be carried out in two phases. By the
end of the first phase, from 1996 to 2000, the annual national
output of steel will reach 2.5-3.0 million tons, or an increase of
4.5-5.5 times over the output of 1995.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the second phase from 2000 to 2010, the industry
plans to raise its annual output to 7.5- 8.0 million tons and
increase investment to build a number of mills using new
technology to produce steel from iron instead of billets.
</P>
<P>
Dung also said a major project, with the involvement of Krupp
of Germany, Gencor of South Africa and Lonrho and Mitsubishi of
Japan, will be launched to exploit a large-scale iron ore deposit
at Thach Khe in central Vietnam.

DHAKA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank, the central bank
of Bangladesh, has decided to put in a fund amounting more than 1
billion taka (about 25 million US dollars) to revive this
country's malfunctioning capital market, official sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Investment Corporation of Bangladesh would be
provided with the fund for aggressive market operation to
stabilize the premier bourse Dhaka stock exchange (DSE), which has
witnessed a nose-dive of share prices over the past several weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a large number of agitated kerb market traders
Sunday laid a siege to the DSE building and stopped the trading on
the floor of the DSE.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Small Investors Federation (BSIF), an umbrella
organization of the kerb market operators, organized this action
and demanded restoration of normal trading and reversal of share
price index to over 3,000 points.
</P>
<P>
The all share price index of DSE plummeted from 3,648 points at
the highest to 2,616 last Saturday when trading was brief for
about 35 minutes on the DSE floor.
</P>
<P>
The BSIF leaders blamed the DSE members and big brokers for the
tragedy which they said "had occurred as part of a conspiracy to
grab the fund of small investors by way of price manipulation and
other unscrupulous practices."

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Ten local private entrepreneurs
have been authorized to open counters for sale and purchase of
Foreign Exchange Certificates (FECs) at the Yangon FEC Exchange
Center to nurture a foreign currency market, official paper The
New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
FEC, which is equivalent to the US dollar in value and lawfully
circulated on the Myanmar market, was introduced in February 1993
for the convenience of foreigners visiting and doing business in
Myanmar since hard currency is not allowed for circulation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since local Myanmar nationals are also allowed to hold FECs,
the use of them has become widespread following the opening of the
FEC Exchange Center in December last year.
</P>
<P>
The center was set up in Yangon to effect easy, legal
transactions of FECs and their use in the market, eliminate the
practice of offering lower prices to the buyers and sellers,
nurture a foreign currency market and do away with unsightly,
illegal transactions on roadsides, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The market exchange rate of the US dollar or FEC with the
Myanmar currency kyat is 1 to 160, while its official rate is
about 6, the paper added.

BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand is pushing
for amendments to several banking acts in a bid to strengthen its
control and reduce political interference in policy making, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The planned amendments, steered by Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Amnuay Virawan, concern acts including the Bank
of Thailand Act 1942 and the Commercial Banking Act.
</P>
<P>
The amendments, if completed, will give the central bank more
power in supervising commercial banks, including examining the
performances of bank presidents and executive chairmen, internal
controls, and loan extensions to guarantee the stability of the
banks, central bank sources said.
</P>
<P>
A cause in the Bank of Thailand Act concerning the central
bank's governor's term is expected to be amended to fix a definite
term for the post to diminish political intervention.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai Marakanond, incumbent governor of the central bank,
has made it clear that he would hold the post for four years,
while Amnuay said he favored a five-year term for the post.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy Expected to Grow Faster in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Strong export growth and solid
economic expansion are in store for Thailand next year, according
to the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) of
the Thai government.
</P>
<P>
Wirat Wattanasiritham, the newly appointed secretary-general of
NESDB, said that NESDB forecast calls for the gross domestic
product (GDP) to rise by about 7.2 percent in 1997 compared with
an estimated 6.8 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The NESDB projection puts total exports for 1997 at 1,500
billion baht (60 billion US dollars), a substantial improvement
over this year's lackluster performance.
</P>
<P>
"If exports next year can meet the projection, it will mean a
growth rate of 14 percent compared with no growth this year,"
Wirat was quoted today by local newspaper Business Day as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that the export performance will be as
projected because there is already substantial evidence of an
economic turnaround.
</P>
<P>
NESDB also forecasts an inflation rate of 5 percent for 1997
along with the current account deficit at approximately 370
billion baht (10.8 billion US dollars), or roughly 7.1 percent of
the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank of Thailand (BOT) Governor Rerngchai
Marakanonda said an economic turnaround can be expected next year,
and rising investment and production figures augur well for the
future of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
"I think the economic recession has hit bottom this year, and
the economy will improve next year," he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition MPs Urges PM to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition party
has urged Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to resign after the
withdrawal of a ruling partner from his three-party coalition
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
General Secretary of the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) Madhav Kumar Nepal said Sunday that the
prime minister should resign on moral grounds as "102 out of the
200 MPs in the Lower House" have withdrawn their support to the
government.
</P>
<P>
The 205-seat Lower House of Nepal currently has five vacant
seats.
</P>
<P>
A petition signed by 102 Lower House lawmakers was submitted to
King Birendra on Sunday afternoon claiming their withdrawal of
support for the Deuba government and asking the king to summon a
special Lower House session to discuss a no-confidence against
the government.
</P>
<P>
The petition was preceded a memorandum addressed to the king by
Lokendra Bahadur Chand, parliamentary leader of the National
Democratic Party (RPP), a ruling partner of the present
coalition, informing The King about his party's withdrawal from
the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Chand is expected to become the prime minister if the proposed
no-confidence motion against Deuba is passed in the house and a
new UML-RPP coalition formed.
</P>
<P>
A RPP spokesman later in the day said eight ministers, mostly
from the RPP, have handed over their resignations to the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
As the Royal Palace remained closed on Sunday, the king would
probably specify the date for the special house session within one
or two days, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali coalition government led by Deuba of the Nepali
Congress (NC) was formed in September last year when the NC and
The RPP jointly overthrew the CPN-UML minority government through
a no-confidence move.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in March this year, the main opposition CPN-UML tabled
a no- confidence motion against the Deuba government by alluring
the ruling partner RPP to withdraw from the coalition. However,
the motion failed at the last minute as the RPP chose to remain in
the coalition just before the no-confidence vote was held.
</P>
<P>
As the RPP, which has 19 seats in the Lower House while the UML
and NC hold 89 and 86 respectively, declared its withdrawal from
the coalition Sunday, the 15-month-old Deuba government would face
a genuine threat this time, political observers here said.

<HEADLINE> Pollution-control Along Yangtze River to Enhance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- China is to forbid any Chinese or
foreign ships to dump its domestic garbage or waste water into the
Yangtze River, China's longest, from the beginning of 1997.
</P>
<P>
This will be part of China's efforts to control floating
pollutants on the Yangtze. China will also strengthen its control
of shipyards and ship dissembling plants along the river.
</P>
<P>
Peng Biao, senior engineer at the Yangtze River Water Resources
Monitoring Center, said that floating pollutants have formed
"white strips" in some Yangtze water areas.
</P>
<P>
He said floating pollutants mainly include pollutants produced
by sailing vessels, ship yards and ship repairing and ship
dissembling plants.
</P>
<P>
A ship may discharge over 1,000 tons of waste water into the
river in one voyage.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River Bureau of Shipping Administration and Harbor
Superintendency is now in charge of monitoring environment
protection involving over 7,000 vessels sailing a distance of
2,386 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The bureau has asked some 50 ship dissembling plants along the
river to implement the anti-pollution security deposit regualtions.
</P>
<P>
The shipyards and ship repairing plants along the river are
also asked to be equipped with pollution-treating facilities.
</P>
<P>
China's departments concerned have been monitoring the
water-borne petro stations and liquid chemical products.
</P>
<P>
China has drafted regualtions and local rules on the prevention
of ship garbage dumping and many ports along the river have
allocated special ships for collecting ship garbage and waste
water.

21st century.
</P>
<P>
The five-day conference, presided over by Singapore Minister

</P>
<P>
He said, "We stand at the threshold of a golden age of global
economic growth, made possible by the high degree of multilateral
cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Goods, services and capital will be able to flow more

<HEADLINE> Singapore PM Calls for WTO Efforts Towards Cohesive, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong opened the inaugural World Trade Organization (WTO)
Ministerial Conference here today, calling for collective efforts
towards a cohesive and prosperous world.
</P>
<P>
"I urge all delegates to seize the moment and take a
significant collective step forward towards a cohesive and
prosperous world," Goh said in his address at the official opening
of the WTO Ministerial Conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference, scheduled to run through Friday, is being

</P>
<P>
Goh noted that the 128 WTO members will inevitably face
challenges in adjusting to the realities of a rapidly evolving and
more interdependent global economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that this Singapore meeting offers WTO members a chance
to renew their faith in global trade liberalization as the best
means to elevate the global standard of living, to consolidate the
significant achievements of the Uruguay Round, to reaffirm their
commitments to giving substance to the built-in agenda, and to
take bold decisions to ensure that the WTO remains relevant and
credible.
</P>
<P>
"The successful conclusion of this first Ministerial Conference
will thus be an invaluable building-block in paving the way ahead
for the two-year-old WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh stressed that it is critical that the WTO system is not
polarized by any "North-South divide" that pits developing and
developed members against each other.
</P>
<P>
"Rather, every effort should be made to ensure that there are
equal opportunities to benefit from the process of global trade
liberalization," he said.

<HEADLINE> Life Becomes Easier for Beijing's Disabled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Wu Wenying decided to take part
in a drawing competition held in downtown Capital Museum Tuesday,
the International Day for the Disabled.
</P>
<P>
Wu lives near the Fragrant Hill located in the western suburbs
of Beijing. Being blind, he easily made his way alone from home to
the museum by changing buses and subways.
</P>
<P>
"I have been taken good care by warm-hearted passers-by on my
way," said Wu, one of the 400,000 disabled people living in the
capital city. He concluded: "Life is becoming much easier to our
disabled people."
</P>
<P>
Beijing marked the International Disabled Day this year with
convenience, kindness and warmth.
</P>
<P>
The Fangzhuang community, one of the new and modernized
communities in the over 3,000-year-old city, has all its
impediments removed so that it becomes convenient for physically
disabled people to move around.
</P>
<P>
Over 4,000 disabled people live in and around this
community. The municipal government paid some 3.3 million yuan
(about 400,000 US dollars) for the renovation of the community.
</P>
<P>
Slopes have been made gentle alongside stairs to entries in
Fangqun and Fangxin blocks. Supplementary facilities were also
added for the disabled in the air bichket booking office, post
office, shopping mall and parks within the community.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1991 when the first non-impediment sidewalk was
built in Beijing, about 160 kilometers of non-impediment sidewalks
have been built along the main streets of Beijing. Wheelchair
passages were also built in the underpasses of Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1989, a regulation was adopted in the city to
make it a must that convenience for the disabled be taken into
consideration when constructing buildings and sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Lafayette department store initiated a plan of
"Shopping on Wheelchair" earlier this week. Handicapped people
easily wheeled in the store.
</P>
<P>
"The municipal government and people have done a lot for the
disabled," said an official from the China Disabled Persons'
Federation. Nevertheless, there were a lot more that can be
done. The common sense of helping the disabled still need to be
enhanced, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, it is not only a matter of money," he said, "many
people do not realize that they should be more considerate to the
disabled." The International Disabled Day will serve as a kind of
eduction for them, he said.

The industrial output value of the six high and new technology
development zones along the two sides of the 142-kilometer express
way is expected to reach over 8 billion yuan (about 1 billion
U.S. dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a symposium on the development of
Beijing-Tianjin-Tanggu high-tech industries, some 600 businesses,
including 210 foreign-funded ventures, have been established in
the six development zones.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the foreign-funded ventures in the

foreign-funded ventures with an average of 10 million dollars of
investment each.
</P>
<P>
The Langfang development zone of Hebei province has 116
ventures covering machinery, electronics, light industry and
textiles, building material, food and biological engineering.
</P>
<P>
The Beichen zone introduced foreign investment for
technological upgrading of state-owned factories.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin marine development zone, the country's only zone
focusing on marine high and new technology, has approved a number
of ventures producing marine chemicals, marine apparatus and
equipment, and facilities for sea water utilization.

<HEADLINE> Real Estate Recovering in South China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Real estate has been picking
up in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong Province, with commodity
housing becoming a focus for both investment and consumption.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, in the first ten months of this
year, investment in real estate of Guangzhou City was 11.6
billion yuan, an increase of 11.6 percent compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, deals in commodity houses have been brisk, and
commodities houses with a combined floor space of 1.32 million sq
m have been sold, up by 77 percent compared with the same period
last year, and sales volume amounts to 3.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The officials attributed the boom to the implementation of a
series of preferential policies by the Guangzhou city government
to advance the real estate sector.
</P>
<P>
Real estate had been sluggish since 1994 and many commodity
houses built had been remained idle due to high prices and supply
exceeding demand, causing stockpiling of a huge sum of money
invested.
</P>
<P>
It had been the same case with Guangzhou City.
</P>
<P>
While accelerating the construction of necessary municipal
works in residential quarters to enhance consumers' confidence,
the Guangzhou city government has tightened the control of land in
urban areas this year, and limited the number of newly-started
commodity housing projects, in hope of reducing the floor space of
idle commodity houses.

Under the plan, Shanghai will seek to restore its place as a
national financial hub before the end of this century, build
itself into a regional banking center by the year 2005, and move
further to become a world financial center by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the financial impact of Shanghai will extend to
nearby countries and regions in the Asia-Pacific region by the
year 2005," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
When the third phase ends in 2010, Wang said, Shanghai will be
able to provide various forms of financial services for customers
worldwide and therefore become a world financial center.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the move, Pieter Bottelier, chief of the World
Bank's resident mission in China, said Shanghai will become a
major financial center for the Yangtze River Delta, for China and
for Asia, and as such will be in competition with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"However, Chinese and Asian financial markets are expanding so
rapidly that there will be ample room for both. There is no basis
for concern that Shanghai may ultimately make Hong Kong
redundant," he added.
</P>
<P>
An immediate move toward the final goal will be allowing a
number of foreign banks in the Pudong New Area, an emerging
financial and trade district separated from downtown Shanghai by
the Huangpu River, to engage in business in the local currency,
from which foreign banks in China are presently barred.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shanghai will set up a development bank for the
Yangtze River Valley, increase the number of Chinese companies
that list B-class shares, allow foreign investment funds to enter
the B share market, and open trading of A shares to foreign-funded
firms.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include establishing an off-shore financial
market, attracting more foreign banking institutions, redoubling
effort to commercialize state-owned specialized banks, expanding
trust and investment businesses, and improving financial
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the growing number of multinational companies
in the metropolis will help Shanghai to evolve into a world
financial center.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that Shanghai has so far approved more
than 15,400 foreign-funded enterprises, with 46 of the world's top
100 industrial giants having invested in the city.
</P>
<P>
A total of 136 foreign financial institutions, including 35
branches, have landed in the city, which currently boasts 2,700
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that Shanghai's experience as a financial hub in
the Far East in the 1930s, its developed telecommunications system
and its unchallenged reputation as a driving force in the nation's
economic growth will also combine to further the bid of Shanghai
to become a world financial center.

<HEADLINE> Ramos to Find Out People Behind Charter Change Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said Sunday that he will try to find out and talk to those behind
the movement seeking to amend the 1987 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Ramos was replying to a question at a news conference about his
reaction to the move by a private group called the People's
Initiative for Reform, Modernization, Action (PIRMA), which seeks
to extend his term by amending the charter.
</P>
<P>
"I'll try to find out who is behind this and I'll talk to
them," Ramos told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA said it will try to gather five million signatures as
a prerequisite for calling an amendment to the Constitution and
allow Ramos to seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
The Ramos administration has repeatedly said it has nothing to
do with the PIRMA, contending that it is a people's initiative.
</P>
<P>
The PIRMA's initiative has gained an ally called Demokratikong
Pagsulong Ng Ekonomiya at Nasyonalismo para sa Sambayanan (The
National Democratic and Economic Growth for the Country)
(DEPENSA).
</P>
<P>
Both the PIRMA and the DEPENSA held their press conferences
last week calling for the amendments of the Charter, which
provides for a six-year single term fro the president.
</P>
<P>
The two self-styled private groups said that Ramos has done a
good job and there is a need to extend his term.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Economy Predicted to Grow Faster in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' economy will
grow at a higher speed of eight percent next year, compared with
7.5 percent targeted for this year, according to a study released
today by the Manila-based All Asia Capital and Trust Corp.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading investment company predicted that the
cost of doing business will be down, the peso will be stable and
prices will go up minimally in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It also forecast healthy growths for all sectors except mining,
large remittances, a higher payments surplus and
15-billion-US-dollar international reserves next year.
</P>
<P>
The study said that heightened liberalization can be expected
in foreign exchange, banking, oil and retail trade while the
inflationary pressure expected from the liberalization will be
short-lived.
</P>
<P>
The growth of the gross national product (GNP) of the
Philippines will continue to be led by exports and investments in
1997, the study said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the country can reasonably expect improved
external sectors by way of narrower trade and current account
deficits and bigger balance of payments surplus, to be supported
by increased foreign exchange inflows.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector is expected to sustain a steady growth
rate of 3.6 percent this year and well into 1997 in the light of
the recovery in rice production.
</P>
<P>
Industry accounted for 34.46 percent of the GNP in real terms
as of the first nine months of 1996 and is projected to post a
9.0-percent increase by 1997.
</P>
<P>
The service sector, which made the biggest contribution to the
GNP in real terms in the fist nine months of 1996, will also see
sustained growth in 1997, the study said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Arranged Harder Crackdown on Smugglers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 9 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong
Province has cracked down hard on smugglers and traffickers in
illegal goods by using effective measures and thorough
investigations this year, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
From January to September, 3,501 cases involving smuggled goods
worth 1.77 billion yuan (213 million US dollars), were recovered
-- representing a 21 percent rise in the number of cases pursued
and an increase of four percent in the value of goods recovered,
over last year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 149 trafficking suspects arrested, 103 -- up 47 percent
from the same period last year -- were found guilty.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases involved hiding smuggled goods or faking
certificates to avoid inspection or taxes.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wenlin, director of the Anti-Smuggling Office under the
Guangdong Provincial People's Government, attributed the success
to lightning strikes and concerted efforts by provincial
authorities.
</P>
<P>
In view of the rising number of smuggling cases along the
coastal areas last year, provincial authorities sent two
specialized teams, led by high officials, into the regions to
stage anti-smuggling drives. A number of known criminals and
local officials were prosecuted, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Figures show that marine smuggling and trafficking slumped
greatly since early this year, with drops of more than 70 percent
in some areas, after the teams went into action.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, three other teams have been dispatched to
dismantle the illegal assembling of cars and motorcycles using
smuggled parts.
</P>
<P>
Assembled autos and motorcycles were confiscated and several
plants were closed in the crackdown, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Raw and processed steel products, plywood, oil, paper and
industrial chemicals topped the list of smuggled goods, amounting
to more than 30 percent of the value of all confiscated materials,
Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Automobiles, home appliances and cigarettes constituted another
27.8 percent of the total value.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that smuggling through land ports should be taken
more seriously because more illegal activities were taking place
in them, as smugglers were arrested or driven from sea ports by
the crackdown.

<HEADLINE> One Third of Czech Enterprises Lose Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Eight hundred and twenty-three
industrial firms in the Czech Republic, or about one third of the
country's total, were operating in the red during the first half
of this year, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Half of the country's construction firms were losing money
during the period.
</P>
<P>
The reports failed to give the exact figure for the accumulated
loss made by the unprofitable firms.
</P>
<P>
The debt owed by the country's industrial firms totaled 86.5
billion crowns (3.2 billion U.S. dollars), with those in the
construction sector accounting for 13.6 billion crowns (503
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The overstock of industrial products and a lack of
competitiveness are blamed for the growing losses and debt load,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the heavy losses, the industrial output went up by 8.4
percent in the first nine months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Makes Efforts In Improving Basic Education Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu
Province is speeding up its construction projects to improve
education facilities in primary and middle schools with the help
of World Bank loans, donations and government-allocated funds.
</P>
<P>
An 18-million US dollar World Bank loan will be used to improve
primary and middle school education in 23 counties in the province.
</P>
<P>
Programs carried out under the loan include rebuilding of
dangerous school houses, training courses for local primary and
middle school teachers, headmasters and administrative management
personnel from education departments.
</P>
<P>
Using a 9-million HK dollar (1.125 million US dollars)
donation, the province has planned to build 15 primary and middle
schools which are expected to be completed by the end of June next
year.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, HK resident Sir Run Run Shaw donated 9 million HK
dollars in building eight primary schools, five middle schools and
a school for training teachers in the province.
</P>
<P>
Local education authorities have invested more than 40 million
yuan in building 160 primary and middle schools, which are now all
operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the provincial education committee has used 1.5
million yuan, plus 2.5 million yuan allocated by local
governments, in improving drinking-water conditions for 130,000
teachers and students in dry mountainous areas in the province.

<HEADLINE> Elderly People in South China Take to Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Elderly people in the capital
of south China's Guangdong Province have taken up travel as a new
favored pastime.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the local tourism authorities show that this year,
elderly people accounted for 25 percent of the entire number of
the city's travelers, up from 5 percent in previous years. Sixty
percent of the elderly take tours with their spouses and 20
percent are accompanied by their children.
</P>
<P>
Consider Cheng Bin, who runs a restaurant in the city. To
celebrate his mother's recent 60th birthday, Cheng sent his
parents on a vacation to Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"My parents rarely had time for travel before their
retirement. Now they are glad to have the chance to see more of
the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arranging vacations for parents has become trendy among local
youngsters who want to show their gratitude to Mom and Dad. An
estimated 70 percent of the tours taken by the elderly are paid
for by their sons or daughters.
</P>
<P>
To accommodate the rising popularity of travel, local travel
agencies have introduced special tour groups for the elderly,
which were immediately successful.
</P>
<P>
Since it initiated one such program at the end of last year,
the Guangzhou Travel Company has organized over 30 sightseeing
groups for the elderly, attracting nearly 1,000 senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
Tourism services normally report a slump in business after the
Chinese New Year and around the end of a year. But these periods
have become prime travel times for the elderly, who often prefer
the smaller crowds and reasonable prices that have not been
boosted for the tourists.

XI'AN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of farmers at the
Third China Yanglin Agricultural Science Exhibition in Xi'an in
October was really up, as they came to see science and technology
as the best way to get rich quickly and their interest in science
grows.
</P>
<P>
One farmer who attended the science exhibition

<HEADLINE> Research on Relations across Taiwan Straits Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese readers have shown
interest in popular historical books, especially publications on
the ties across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The leading bestseller, overshadowing the competition in both
large bookstores and street corner stands, is the newly-published
"Mao Zedong and Chang Kai-shek: Half Century's Rivalry."
</P>
<P>
Included are many other biographical books, such as
"Introduction to the Relations between the Chinese Communist Party
and the Nationalist Party" and "Private Contacts between Chinese
Communists and Nationalists," which were published in this capital
of Hubei Province earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
Participants in a recent seminar in Wuhan on relations across
the Taiwan Straits and on the relationship between the two parties
attributed the increasing interest in the subject to fruitful
research over the past years by scholars across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
"More than 300 Chinese scholars have taken part in research
on the subject, with over 1,000 papers and 50 books published,"
said Wu Qiansheng, deputy director of the Research Office of
United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
The research began in the mid-1980s, when scholars in Wuhan
assumed the leadership with their first publication, "Relations
between the Chinese Communist Party and the Nationalist Party."
</P>
<P>
In 1990, China had set up a national liaison group of research
on relations across the Taiwan Straits and between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
During the Wuhan seminar, a preparatory committee of the
research group was set up to plan research projects, said Wang
Gong'an, deputy director of the preparatory committee.
</P>
<P>
Current research is underscoring concrete subjects, such as
those in economic, cultural and social fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese research institutes and academies have also
started the study on relations across the Straits. People's
University and Wuhan University have also offered courses on the
subject.

<HEADLINE> Central China Power Grid Sees Excessive Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 9 (Xinhua) -- Excessive rainfalls in central
China provinces since Autumn this year have pushed up hydro-power
production and resulted in an over-supply of electricity in the
region for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the country are still suffering from severe
shortages of electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
Hydro-power stations are the major electricity producers for
the region and major power stations in the region are able to
produce 10 percent more electricity last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local coal-fired power plants have also been
operating with full steam, according to sources with the Central
China Power Group which is headquartered in Wuhan, capital of
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, local industrial enterprises have reduced their
power consumption due to various reasons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the East China Power Grid has cut their demand for
power supply from the central grid.
</P>
<P>
The Central China Power Grid, covering Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi
and Henan provinces, is the largest of the country's six major
electricity-supply networks, currently with a total designed
capacity of 32.3 million kw and a total output of over 150 billion
kwh annually. Hydraulic stations make up more than two thirds of
the total number of power plants within the network.

ABU DHABI, December 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia became the first
team to enter the quarter-finals of the Asian Cup after grabbing a
1-0 victory over Iraq in a group B match on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Triple champions Iran kept their slender hopes of qualifying
for the knockout stage alive with a 3-1 win over Thailand in the
second group B match.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's second consecutive defeat means they are all but
out of the 12-nation championship.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, champions in 1984 and 1988 and beaten finalists
in 1992, justified their ranking as one of three favourites for
the title with a good performance against a strong Iraqi team.
</P>
<P>
They now top group B with six points from two wins out of two
games. Iran and Iraq have three points each and Thailand had
nothing.
</P>
<P>
The top two teams from the three groups qualify for the
knockout stage, with the best two teams in third place also going
through.
</P>

Saudi Arabia -- who crushed Thailand 6-0 -- will meet Iran,

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The season's opening World Cup
Alpine skiing men's super giant slalom was cancelled on Sunday due
to heavy overnight snowfall and poor visibility at Whistler
Mountain.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by the race organising committee and
International Ski Federation (FIS) officials.
</P>
<P>
Upwards of 20cm fell overnight, adding to the already extensive
snowfall which had wiped out Saturday's men's downhill and the
three training runs earlier in the week in preparation for the
season opening men's speed races.
</P>
<P>
There was some irony that excessive snowfall forced the
cancellation after officials had made a great deal of man-made
snow in preparation for the racing.
</P>
<P>
A total of 633 course workers spent over 30,000 man hours,
many in darkness, preparing the course.
</P>
<P>
The men's and women's Alpine Ski World Cup circuit now moves to
Val d'Isere, France, for men's and women's downhill and super
giant slalom races this week.

<HEADLINE> Major Says not to Accept Phony Ulster Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said here today that he was as keen as ever to see a
"genuine ceasefire" in Northern Ireland, but he would not accept a
phony one.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC television interview earlier today, Major
said that he was not prepared to accept a "phony ceasefire" in
order to "parachute Sinn Fein", the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), into the multi-party peace talks on the
future of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Major stressed that the last ceasefire was betrayed by Sinn
Fein who was building up weapons for a terrorist campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has been banned from the peace talks since the IRA
ended its 17-month ceasefire by launching a bombing campaign from
February.
</P>
<P>

<P>
DOHA, December 8 (Xinhua) -- The 17th summit of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) is expected to urge Israel to give up
its procrastination policies in the Middle East peace process at
its conclusion here tomorrow.

<P>
The Qatar News Agency (QNA) today said that a final communique
to be issued at the closure of the three-day summit will also give

adopted by the Israeli government in implementing the accords
already reached with the Palestinian side.

The communique would also express the GCC's opposition to the
Israel's attempts to strengthen its occupation of the Arab
territories.

The GCC would also denounce Israel's hampering of endeavors
made by the world community to achieve peace in a flagrant
violation of the related international legitimacy resolutions and
the confidence-building arrangements, QNA reported.

The Israeli measures are real hazards threatening the peace
opportunities, which herald a return to tension and acts of
violence, QNA quoted the sources as saying.

They said the summit would urge Israel to honor the accords
concluded with the Palestinian Authority, foremost of which is the
withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Hebron, release all the

self-rule areas.

the stepped-up efforts in strengthening the occupation in the Arab

sources said.

that Israel resume peace negotiations on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks, withdraw from Syria's Golan Heights and from south
Lebanon and the western Bekaa in accordance with the
international resolutions made in this respect.
