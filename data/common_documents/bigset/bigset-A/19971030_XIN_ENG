<P>
JAKARTA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
has accepted the pledges of Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto and Australian Prime Minister John Howard to help
Indonesia solve its monetary crisis, State Secretary Moerdiono
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Japan has expressed its readiness (to help Indonesia) under a
bilateral framework apart from the International Monetary Fund
assistance that we might receive," Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
The president and the Japanese prime minister had a telephone
conservation on the initiative this morning, according to
Moerdiono.
</P>
<P>
Moerdiono said the assistance aims to help recover domestic and
foreign market confidence in Indonesia's economy, notably in its
currency, the rupiah.
</P>
<P>
He said Hashimoto told Soeharto that the fundamentals of the
Indonesian economy are, in fact, good enough and that the
Indonesian government has taken the right steps on the first days
of the monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
After the telephone conversation, Soeharto received Howard at
the Merdeka Palace.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is ready to give assistance to Indonesia under the
IMF framework," Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
Howard arrived here on Tuesday afternoon and is scheduled to
return home this evening.
</P>
<P>
As for the details of the two countries' financial assistance,
namely the amount and its framework, Moerdiono said they will be
discussed later at the ministerial and senior official levels.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Soeharto disclosed that Singapore is ready to offer
10 billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia to help restore confidence in
the Indonesian economy. Earlier, Malaysia also pledged to provide
1 billion dollars to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent against
the U.S. dollar since the beginning of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 Far East and South
Pacific Table Tennis Championships (FESPIC) for the Disabled which
opened here Wednesday have drawn an impressive field of 105
players from 10 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The large and strong entry to the four-day championships held
in the Kowloon Park Indoor Games Hall is largely due to the fact
that the Olympic eligibility depends on the world rankings of
individual athletes and the current championships are the first
such event at which world rankings will be awarded.
</P>
<P>
In the field are China's women's TT 10 Class Olympic singles
champion in Atlanta Games last Luo Fuqun and Huang Dongsheng,
bronze-medalist for the TT 10 Class men's singles event at the
1994 FESPIC Games in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Luo from southeast China's Fujian Province was also a member of
the Chinese team which won the TT 6-10 Class team title at the
Atlanta Games. Huang was on the Chinese team which took the men's
team title at the Beijing FESPIC Games.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, Japan and Hong Kong, China, are strong in the
men's wheelchair individual event while the title race for the
women's wheelchair group is expected to take place between Hong
Kong and Chinese Taipei athletes. And the Chinese are hot
favorites for the women's standing event.
</P>
<P>
The championships are jointly organized by the Hong Kong Sports
Association for the Physically Disabled and the Provisional Urban
Council, with financial support from the Hong Kong Sports
Development Board.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's PM on Primakov's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul
Salam Majali said today that his Russian counterpart Yevgeny
Primakov did not present new initiatives for reviving the stalled
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
According to Radio Jordan, Majali said Primakov, nevertheless,
discussed with the Jordanian side various ways of advancing the
peace process during his just-ended two-day visit to Amman.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, arriving here Monday evening after a second visit to
Syria in his current Mideast tour, held separate talks today with
King Hussein, Crown Prince Hassan Ibn Talal, Majali and Foreign
Minister Fayez Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
Majali stressed the importance of Arab coordination "at this
critical moment to overcome obstacles to the peace process,"
according to the radio report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Jordanian official, who asked not to be named,
said Primakov and the Jordanian side expressed concern over the
deteriorating security situation in south Lebanon as a result of
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
But he denied the two sides discussed information about an
Israeli plan to launch wide-scale military operations in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During his talks here, Primakov briefed Jordanian officials on
his ongoing Middle East tour aimed to help overcome
the deadlock in peace making between the Arabs and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia, as a co-sponsor of the peace march, is pressing
for the resumption of peace talks on all tracks.
</P>
<P>
An expert on Arab affairs, Primakov had visited Lebanon, Syria,
Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas and will travel to
Egypt in an effort to boost Russia's profile in the Middle East
peace making.
</P>
<P>
Russia, together with the U.S., initiated the Madrid peace
conference in 1991 that set the peace wheel going. It was
Washington, however, that played a dominant role in mediating
Arab-Israeli peace talks over the past few years.

ROME, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy's national ice hockey coach
died in a car accident on Wednesday in Bolzano, Italy, police

<HEADLINE> US Factory Orders for Durable Goods Down in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. factory orders for
durable goods declined by 0.6 percent in September, the first drop
in four months, U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that orders for durable goods, items expected
to last more than three years, totaled a seasonally adjusted 185.7
billion dollars in the month, down from 186.8 billion in August.
</P>
<P>
The decline resulted mainly from fall in demand for airplanes
and motor vehicles and for electrical equipment.
</P>
<P>
It followed a revised 2.8 percent increase in August and was
the first drop since the orders edged down 0.4 percent last May.
</P>
<P>
Transportation orders were down by 3.3 percent in September
after rising 4 percent a month earlier. Excluding this category,
the orders edged up by 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment plunged
7.7 percent after soaring 29.4 percent in August, the largest
increase since the government began tracking orders in 1958.
</P>
<P>
The backlog of unfilled orders inched up 0.1 percent, much
slower than the 1.1 percent advance in August. A smaller backlog
often suggests businesses are able to meet demand with current
production facilities and manpower.
</P>
<P>
But shipments, a measure of current demand, rose by 2.1
percent, the third gain in four months.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expected the moderate decline to further calm markets
that had been roiled by financial turmoil overseas and domestic
fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve may boost interest rates at
home to ease inflation pressures.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Tanui to Return to Track Race for Avenging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's marathon winner Moses
Tanui is to resume track competition next year to avenge defeat by
Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie five years ago, according to AFP
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is unfinished business between Haile and I. He spiked me
in the 1993 Stuttgart world championships. I lost the race and a
shoe," Tanui was quoted by AFP as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Tanui said he was still bitter at Haile's
spiking him. "I ran for 300 meters without a shoe. I injured my
knee and tendon muscles and lost the 10,000m gold," he said.
</P>
<P>
The report said the recurring knee injury forced Tanui to quit
track running and concentrate on the marathon.
</P>
<P>
In between good spells, Tanui, the 1991 10,000m world champion,
managed to post impressive results in half and full marathon
races, placing 10th in his debut races in Boston Marathon in 1994,
maintained the same position the following year in the same event
and became champion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However he was forced to skip the Atlanta Olympics final trials
in Nairobi when he was injured in training.
</P>
<P>
He was on course for a successful title defence this year until
he got an injury half way the course and ended fifth.
</P>
<P>
Tanui said he felt fully recovered when he helped Kenya win the
world half marathon early this month.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Still Remains Option For UNITA, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Angolan Defence
Minister Pedro Sebastio today said that Angolan government is
ready to take military action against the former rebel UNITA to
wrest back the territory it still controls, but said dialogue
still remained an option.
</P>
<P>
Sebastio said, ''Our forces can be called to play their role,
but we are for dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he called on Zimbabwean
Vice-President Simon Muzenda to brief him about the situation in
Angola, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) still has 35,000 men under arms in violation of peace
accords signed in Lusaka in November 1994, said the report.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, which has waged a civil war against the Angolan
government since the country's independence from Portugal in
1975, faces tough sanctions from the U.N. Security Council for
its non-compliance with certain provisions of the Lusaka accords.
</P>
<P>
The proposed sanctions include a ban on air passage and
closure of UNITA offices abroad.

<HEADLINE> World Seaborne Trade Growth in 1997 to Be Highest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Overall world seaborne trade in
1997 is expected to register its fastest growth rate since 1990,
reaching 4.94 billion tons by 3.8 percent over the previous year,
according to a United Nations report issued here today.
</P>
<P>
In its Review of Maritime Transport, 1997, the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) predicts that the
overall figure for 1997 could mark the start of a period of steady
expansion in the years ahead as the medium-term forecast for the
coming decade is for an average annual growth of 3.9 percent in
the main sectors of world seaborne trade.
</P>
<P>
As for 1996, the Review says, the main driving forces behind
that year's performance were the shipment of growing volumes of
manufactured goods in containerized form (up 4.0 percent over
1995) and reasonably strong demand for tanker shipments (up by 3.8
percent).
</P>
<P>
However, the poor performance of dry bulk cargo shipments,
which rose by only 1.1 percent, dragged the year's figures down.
This was mainly due to declines in iron ore and grain shipments,
which fell by 3.1 percent and 4.1 percent respectively, according
to the UNCTAD, which publishes the Review annually.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, these trends are expected to reverse themselves, the
Review points out. While tanker demand is expected to weaken,
growing at only 2.4 percent, dry cargo looks set for its second
strongest performance in a decade; increasing overall by 5.1
percent, strong demand for main bulk commodities will be mainly
responsible.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Regional economic and social
development must be put on the top priority if the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) is to compete in world
markets.
</P>
<P>
But this can only be attained in a politically stable and
secure environment, South African Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister
Aziz Pahad said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants to a South Africa/Zimbabwe business
seminar on business opportunities of the small-and medium-scale
enterprises, Pahad said prosperity rests in the hands of the
people rapidly seeking ways of building complementary strengths
and economic interlinkages.
</P>
<P>
"Let us build on our strengths such as the already developed
infrastructure and develop further essential fields such as
communication, energy, transport and water resources management
in order to obtain a capacity to interact as a region competing
in the international arena," Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
He said SADC's financial markets might be small in comparison
with the rest of the developed world, but "collectively combined
capacity is enough to ensure that the region and its
international partners are serviced adequately".
</P>
<P>
He noted that building solid relations with the SADC
constitutes " one of the cornerstones of South Africa's foreign
policy".
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe is a crucial partner for South Africa in the region
and on the continent," the South African deputy minister said,
adding that "we need each each other."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Jury selection is nearly
complete in the second Oklahoma City bombing trial.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Richard Matsch has qualified 67 prospective
jurors since Terry Nichols' trial began September 29 in Denver,
Colorado, and planned to question a few more today before
finalizing the pool, The Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Nichols, 42, could be sentenced to die if convicted of murder
and conspiracy in the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building. The explosion killed 168 people and
injured more than 500.
</P>
<P>
The judge needed to qualify at least 64 so each side could
excuse 23 potential jurors on peremptory challenges, or those that
require no explanation. The process will leave the final 12 jurors
and six alternates.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for both sides expect the jury to be seated on
Thursday and opening statements to be delivered Monday, the
beginning of the trial's sixth week.
</P>
<P>
Matsch and attorneys have questioned nearly 125 prospective
jurors. As he did in Timothy McVeigh's trial, Matsch has qualified
extra prospective jurors in case something unexpected arises.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh was convicted of identical charges in June and
sentenced to die. His appeal is pending.

<HEADLINE> UN, OAU Drawn Into Lockerbie Affair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain, which wants the two
Lockerbie suspects tried in Scotland, said today it will take
measures to assure the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and
the United Nations that the Scottish judicial system is fair and
transparent.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commission in Zimbabwe said in a statement
that Britain had invited the secretaries general of the UN, OAU
and the Arab League to send high-level representatives to examine
the Scottish judicial system before the end of the year, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"This initiative will help those who have doubts about a trial
in Scotland to reassure themselves that it will be entirely
transparent and fair," said the statement quoting British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
Two Libyan nationals are suspected of carrying out the 1988
Pan Am airline bombing over Lockerbie, in Scotland, in which 270
people died.
</P>
<P>
Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has, however, refused to
extradite the two suspects, saying trial should be held in a
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the proposed visit by representatives of
the OAU and UN will discuss arrangements for a trial of the two
Lockerbie suspects in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said on Wednesday he would not extradite the two
suspects.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking soon after a meeting with South African
President Nelson Mandela who met Gaddafi twice this week, but has
denied he was seeking to mediate in the dispute over a Lockerbie
trial venue.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Capital Returns to Normal After Foiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Everything returned to normal
today in the Zambian capital after coup attempt to overthrow
the government was crushed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Following one day's suspension of business, all shops and
banks in the downtown re-opened and vendors began selling their
goods in the streets as usual today.
</P>
<P>
Government staff also returned to their work this morning
and the Zambia state radio station, which was
stormed by rebels and suffered serious damages during the coup,
began broadcasting its regular programs.
</P>
<P>
With vehicles and people coming and going in the streets, no
signs show any tension still lingers in Lusaka after an
unexpected coup.
</P>
<P>
However, the Mass Media Complex, which houses the Zambia
Broadcasting Corporation, the Zambia Information Services and the
Zambia News Agency and used to be guarded by paramilitary men,
now is heavily guarded by military police equipped with several
armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Early in the morning of Tuesday, a group of soldiers from the
army led by former captain Steven Mungu and incumbent captain
Jack Chiti, staged a military coup aiming to topple the elected
government led by President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
The coupists took the Mass Media Complex and declared on the
state radio that they have taken over the government.
</P>
<P>
The news of coup confused Lusaka residents and the streets
became empty without vehicles and pedestrians within working
hours. Shop owners and bankers suspended their business for fear
of their wealth being looted.
</P>
<P>
The four-hour coup was foiled by the army soldiers loyal to
the government and the coup leaders as well as their followers
were arrested one after another around noon.
</P>
<P>
The abortive coup left one rebel dead and 15 others injured.
The arrest is still underway in the country because some of the
coupists are on the run.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Hold Talks with Gaddafi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and
visiting South African President Nelson Mandela held their first
round of talks today at the town of Zowara, north-west of the the
capital city of Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
However, no details of their talks are available.
</P>
<P>
According to the Libyan News Agency, Mandela conferred on
Gaddafi the Order of the Cape of Good Hope, the highest South
African decoration to a foreigner, at an imposing ceremony after
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Mandela thanked Gaddafi for his role
in strengthening the bonds of friendship between the Libyan and
South African peoples and for Libya's role in supporting the
liberation of South Africa from apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also underscored the role of the United Nations in
consolidating world peace, calling upon world leaders to transcend
their differences in assisting the U.N. in its mission.
</P>
<P>
This was Mandela's second visit in a week to the northern
African country still under crippling U.N. sanctions, in an effort
to seek a just settlement of the Lockerbie crisis.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Libya in 1992 after it refused to
surrender two of its intelligence agents accused by U.S. and
British courts for bombing Pan Am flight 103 out of the sky above
the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 270
people.
</P>
<P>
Libya insisted that the two suspects be tried in a third,
neutral country, a proposal support by Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela left Zowara at the close of the ceremony, concluding
his brief visit to Libya. He arrived this morning by road to avoid
a U.N. air embargo.
</P>
<P>
Mandela visited Tripoli last Wednesday and Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Condemns Coup Attempt in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania on Tuesday
condemned a coup attempt by some dissident Zambian army
officers to topple the government of President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
A government statement released at the National Assembly by the
Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye last night paid tribute
to the senior Zambian army officers for defending their government,
local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye noted that the coup attempts being made against
the government on Tuesday were a result of economic hardships
facing the majority population but insisted that this was not
lasting solution to the problems.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said it was high time that African countries condemned
attempts by power hungry individuals to take over from popularly
elected governments.
</P>
<P>
A group of dissident soldiers seized Zambia
Radio at dawn on Tuesday and announced that
the government had been overthrown for criminal and corrupt actions
and a National Redemption Council had taken over the power.
</P>
<P>
But five hours later President Chiluba said on the same
radio that the attempted coup had been crushed and he was
firmly in control of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Global Sales of Robot to Reach One Million in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The total number of industrial
robots in the whole world will amount to nearly one million by the
end of 2000, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing a survey by the United Nations and International
Federation of Robotics, the newspaper said that worldwide sales of
industrial robots will rise by 15 percent over the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
The annual survey of world industrial robots said that global
sales grew 11 percent in 1996 to 80,500 units worth about 5.3
billion US dollars. But sales growth this year is forecast to slow
to only four percent, mainly as a result of sharp declines in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
However, during the next three years between 1998 and 2000,
world sales are predicted to increase to 15 percent on average to
about 131,000 units each year, boosted by strong demand in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The survey predicted that global robot population by the end of
2000 will reach 950,000, with more than half in Japan.
</P>
<P>
At present, the operational stock of robots is about 680,000
units, with Japan accounting for less than 400,000, followed by the
US which has the second highest stock at 71,000 units, then
Germany at 60,000, Italy at 25,000, France at 15,000 and Britain
at 9,000.

<HEADLINE> Suspension of Amendment Unconstitutional: Pak PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif today called the Supreme Court's suspension of the
14th Amendment "unconstitutional," saying the parliament would
solve the issue by "playing its constitutional role."
</P>
<P>
"Parliament is the custodian of the constitution and is
empowered to do whatever is in the larger interest of the nation,"
Sharif told a press briefing at the end of the ruling Pakistan
Muslim League (PML-N) and its allied parties' parliamentary
meeting which lasted three hours today.
</P>
<P>
Sharif made the remarks shortly before the National Assembly
session scheduled for this evening at which the government is
likely to pass a bill restricting the powers of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the suspension of the 14th Amendment,
which was enacted in line with the aspirations of the nation to
root out the curse of horse-trading, has again opened the way for
"politics of money."
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Pakistan today suspended the operation of
the 14th Amendment to the constitution (the Anti-Defection Law),
which was passed by both houses of the parliament unanimously in
early July this year.
</P>
<P>
The amendment restrains members of the parliament from
breaching party discipline, code of conduct and declared policies.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court took the decision at a crucial moment when
the government and the judiciary are trying to resolve a
two-month-old tussle over the elevation of judges.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the National Assembly session
began as scheduled and has lasted nearly four hours so far.

<HEADLINE> UNCTAD: Developing Countries' Share of World Seaborne </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Developing countries have
maintained a steady share of world seaborne trade since the 1990s
but their share is expected to decrease in 1997, according to a
United Nations report issued here today.
</P>
<P>
Over the period, the developing countries have maintained an
approximate 50-51 percent share of cargo loaded, and 26-27 percent
share of cargo unloaded, states the United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in its annually Review of Maritime
Transport, 1997. The heavy weight of the oil trade in the shipping
to and from developing countries is key to the statistical
stability.
</P>
<P>
However, UNCTAD notes, in 1997, developing countries' share of
seaborne cargo unloaded is expected to decrease from 51,3 percent
to 50.7 percent, and their share of cargo loaded is expected to
decline from 26.7 percent to 26.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Looking into the regional variations in 1996 among developing
countries, UNCTAD says that the share of Asian countries in both
goods loaded and unloaded decreased marginally, to 26.6 percent
and 17.7 percent respectively. In the Americas, goods loaded
showed a modest increase, from 13.1 to 13.5 percent, while in
Africa there was a significant jump, from 10.1 to 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for the fleet ownership, of the world merchant fleet of
758.2 million deadweight tons (dwt) by the end of 1996, developing
countries owned 147.5 million dwt, representing 19.5 percent of
the world fleet, up from their share of 18.7 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Regional ownership patterns, however, remain problematic and
unbalanced, UNCTAD points out. In particular, container tonnage is
concentrated in Asian developing countries, which owns 14.4
percent of the world container tonnage, or 80 percent of the
developing countries's fleet, while African developing countries
own virtually no container tonnage at all, it says.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Peace Talks Kick off After Three-Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The high-level Sudan peace
negotiations, the first since 1994, kicked off today with issues
on self-determination right for the south and a secular state
expected to be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo Musyoka presided over the
opening ceremony for the talks and the ministerial meeting of the
Inter-Governmental Authority of Development (IGAD), the broker of
the Sudan talks.
</P>
<P>
The discussions will actually start behind-the-door tomorrow
morning and so far there has been no fixed date to end them.
</P>
<P>
"The talks have reached an important stage and both parties
are now expected to demonstrate good will and agree on a
political settlement that will enable the people of Sudan to
re-direct their energies and resources towards economic
development," said Musyoka in his opening speech.
</P>
<P>
He urged parties involved "to put aside any issues that might
jeopardize the success of the negotiations and instead, focus on
resolving their differences through dialogue for the good of the
Sudanese people."
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese parties should "be flexible and demonstrate
understanding and tolerance in the spirit of give and take to
give peace a chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Foreign Minister Ali Osman Taha headed the Khartoum
delegation while Salva Kiir, Chief of Staff of Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA) led the seven-member rebel team. The two
sides have see-sawed in southern Sudan for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
A delegate for the Sudanese government told Xinhua today he is
not optimistic about the results from the talks but refused to
give more details.
</P>
<P>
The set talks on Sudan peace can be successful as long as it
starts rounds of talks constantly for finding solutions to the
14-year-old civil war in Sudan, said a Kenyan Foreign Ministry
official asking anonymity.
</P>
<P>
During an IGAD summit here in July, the Sudanese government
accepted the Declaration of Principles drafted by IGAD leaders in
1994 as the basis for peace talks, making it possible to re-start
the IGAD mediation for ending the 14-year war in Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The document recognizes the right of self-determination for
the southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's civil war has claimed more than 1.3 million lives and
made tens of thousands displaced since 1983 when the SPLA rose to
fight against Islamic-backed Khartoum power for a secular state
and more autonomy in the Christian-dominated south.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Share prices in Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange rebounded by 8 percent today, recovering by full
Tuesday's drastic losses.
</P>
<P>
The Mishtanim Index rose by 8 percent and the Moaf Index
climbed by nearly 7.5 percent when the trading was closed today.
The rally just offset the 8 percent fall Tuesday, which was the
biggest one-day drop since the 1994 crash when then government
planned to imposed a capital gains tax.
</P>
<P>
Share prices in Tel Aviv Stock Exchange had tumbled by 12
percent Tuesday in panic morning trading, forcing the trading to
suspend for 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Today's rally followed the rebound in worldwide markets,
especially the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street bounced back Tuesday from its worst drop since the
1987 crash on Monday, with the Dow Jones shares rising 333.98
points to 7,495.13. The Dow continued the trend of climbing today,
as the industrial averages rose by 50 points shortly after the
opening. This helped further restore the investors' confidence
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"New York fell Monday because Hong Kong fell, yesterday Hong
Kong rose because New York grew, and today everything else grows
because New York grows," said Israeli stock analyst Mark Miles.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the market volatility in recent days was
different from that 10 years ago: this time there is a decline in
the consumer and retail confidence as well as in the financial
system, while 10 years ago there was only decline in the consumer
and retail confidence.
</P>
<P>
Miles cautioned investors that the volatility of the stock
market remained and the fluctuation is expected to continue. "We
have a nasty, nasty shock system, it's not going away following
one or two day increase in the prices," he said.

<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov arrived here this evening to began his visit to Egypt for
discussions on ways to advance the Middle East peace process and
promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
and Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Maguid are
expected to hold separate talks with him Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is the last leg of Primakov's week-long Mideast tour
which has taken him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule area and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Russian minister is making efforts to help revive the
stalled Arab-Israeli talks on all tracks and boost its role as a
co-sponsor of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S. co-sponsored the Madrid conference in 1991
to set the Middle East peace wheel going. But Moscow's inactivity
over the past few years has left the U.S. dominate the scene in
brokering Arab-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Urged to Join Hands in War Against Drug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's drug control agency
chairman today appealed to Nigerians to join hands in its war
against drug abuses, saying that the youth in particular should
eschew the use of Indian hemp.
</P>
<P>
The campaign against narcotic drugs, especially Indian hemp,
should be directed at safeguarding the youth, said Musa Bamaiyi,
Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), in
the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
"If we play with the drug situation, it will eventually
destroy us," Bamaiyi warned.
</P>
<P>
The country could not afford to destroy its youth, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over recent years, Nigeria has been victim of drug trafficking
and the number of drug addicts is on the rise with many youths
involved in the abuse of Indian hemp.
</P>
<P>
The NDLEA has been working in cooperation with the National
Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control in the fight
to eradicate drug abuses in the country, and a lot of success has
been achieved, said Bamaiyi, quoted by the Nigeria News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago, people can walk into any ship and obtain any
drug but the situation has changed now," he said, adding that
some drugs could now be bought only on prescription.

ABU DHABI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Qatar today strongly blasted
Turkey's establishment of a security zone in northern Iraq,
warning it posed "an extreme danger to the stability of the
region."
</P>
<P>
In a weekly meeting today, Qatari Advisory Council
(parliament) reiterated the necessity of maintaining Iraq's

<P>
Qatar warned that "the establishment of Turkish security zone
at the Turkish-Iraqi border constituted an extreme danger to the

Turkey has said that its troops established a secure zone in
northern Iraq to facilitate the search of Kurdish rebels based
there.
</P>
<P>
The security zone was apparently set up following Turkey's
military operation in northern Iraq this month to crack down
the Kurdish rebels. The incursions have sparked Arab countries'
censure.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Creation of Islamic Common Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran today called on Islamic
countries to establish a common market to boost their economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sadeq Kharrazi, head of the headquarters in charge of holding
the 8th summit meet of the Organization of the Islamic Conference
(OIC) voiced the appeal in an interview with the official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that consolidation of economic ties among OIC
members is one of the most important goals of the summit meet to
be held here in December.
</P>
<P>
Since economic independence, and independence from domineering
powers are regarded as the beginning of the political independence
and real sovereignty of the Muslim nations, establishment of an
Islamic common market can herald materialization of this goal, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the OIC members would seriously support the idea of
establishing the Islamic common market, adding this would solve
many of the problems facing the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran, which strongly believes in economic
and technical capabilities of the Islamic countries, has decided
to open the first trade exhibition of the Islamic world
simultaneous with the opening of OIC summit in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fair is to show technical and engineering and
production capacities, and research in the areas of industry,
mining, agriculture, animal husbandry, economy and commerce.
</P>
<P>
The three-day OIC summit will start on December 9 and some 55
OIC member state will participate in the summit.

<HEADLINE> International Group Seeks UAE Funds for Anti-Mine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 29 (Xinhua) -- An international humanitarian
group is campaigning for funds today in the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) for its efforts to clear mines in the world, the WAM News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, which will be launched in three stages, is aimed
at rallying support from the Gulf country for the international
efforts to ban mines, Abdel Rahman Ghandour, representative of the
Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF), told the agency.
</P>
<P>
He said his group hopes to raise a fund of 1 million
U.S. dollars from the UAE to help rehabilitate the people who have
been wounded by mines.
</P>
<P>
The MSF campaign comes after the UAE issued a statement earlier
this month that it would extend support, likely including
financial help, to an agreement sponsored by the United Nations on
mine clearance.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report said that more than 110 million mines have been
sown in 60 countries, which will either kill or wound a person in
every 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Clearance of mines in various areas in the world has become one
of the most pressing problems facing the human being, the report
said. And ban on mines has recently become a hot international
issue.

</P>

At around 10:10 ET, national anthems of the two countries were

</P>
<P>
Under a clear and sunny sky, Jiang walked down from the

</P>
<P>
It is the first time since 1985 when late Chinese President Li
Xiannian visited the U.S. that a Chinese head of state is welcomed
at such a big ceremony in front of the White House.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, which was attended by some 3,000
people, Clinton welcomed Jiang and his wife Wang Yeping, and the
Chinese delegation to the White House.
</P>
<P>
"Your visit gives us both an opportunity and a responsibility

In reply, Jiang said he came to the U.S. to "enhance mutual

</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the shared interests between China and the U.S.
have increased and the potential for cooperation have expanded.
</P>
<P>
"Let us strengthen the bonds between us. Let us pursue common
causes. Let us address our differences openly and with respect.
Let us build a better world for our children," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton praised the progress China has made since the reform
began in the late 1970s. "Your reforms have lifted millions from
poverty, offering better housing and better schools," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people enjoy today a better standard of living
than at any time in China's history," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely clear that "China, with its ancient
civilization and renewed economic and political vigor, will have a
profound influence on the new world of the 21st century," said the
U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
"Mr President, together we can make this new era the brightest
chapter in China's long and rich history, the best days America
has ever known, and a new age of unprecedented peace and
prosperity for all the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of the three China-U.S. Joint
Communiques, Jiang also noted that the two countries should view
and handle relations "from a historical height and with a
strategic perspective."
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the development of China-U.S. relations can play a
positive role in promoting mutual respect, peaceful coexistence
and common development among countries around the world with
different histories, cultures, social systems and levels of
development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who started his nine-day trip on Sunday, arrived here on
Wednesday. The welcome ceremony was followed by a summit between

<P>
TEHRAN, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran today attacked the United
States for pursuing double-standard policies on nuclear issues,
contending that its nuclear activities are for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. efforts to block Iran's peaceful international nuclear
cooperation are contradictory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of waging a political and propaganda
campaign against Iran's nuclear cooperation with Russia and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Iran's nuclear activities are under the
supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
By spreading rumors against Iran, the U.S. and Israel are aimed
at diverting public opinion from realities in the Middle East and
covering up the repeated failures of their hegemonic policies, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at the U.S. conniving at Israel's occupation of
Arab lands and its keeping mum on Israel's proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Army Urged to Take Part in Immunization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health
Ministry today urged members of the defense force to participate
in the anti-polio immunization campaign to be launched next
month.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Vice Minister of Health Lemisso Hayisso
at a meeting to mark the national immunization drive.
</P>
<P>
He said, members of the defense force could play vital role in
bringing the campaign to fruition.
</P>
<P>
The participation of the army in sensitizing the public on the
need to immunize children against polio has been good, he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 children under five years of age experience
disability from polio every year, Lemisso noted.
</P>
<P>
The national campaign will be conducted at 25,000 vaccination
posts or by mobile teams across the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 25,000 health workers and volunteers will be deployed
while 20 million doses of polio vaccine have been imported,
according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Should Truly Act on Behalf of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council, a
major organ of the United Nations, should fully heed the views of
Member States so as to truly act on behalf of the entire
membership, Chinese delegate Liu Jieyi said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fifty-second session of the General Assembly on
the annual report of the Council to the General Assembly, Liu
Jieyi said the Security Council had done a lot of work and made
fresh efforts in maintaining international peace and security in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
Liu said in the wake of changes on the international scenes,
particularly at this turn of the century, the Security Council was
shouldering more important responsibilities entrusted by the
Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate noted there had been constant turbulence
and conflicts in some parts of Africa in the past year. The
council should attach importance to African issues, and in
handling these issues, fully respect the sovereignty, political
independence and territorial integrity of African countries,
carefully consider the reasonable proposals and demands of the
Organization of African Unity and African countries and support
and cooperate with African countries in their efforts to maintain
regional peace and security.
</P>
<P>
Liu said in recent years, there had been an obvious trend of
involvement by the Council in some countries's internal conflicts.
In handling these major and complicated issues, the Council should
observe the Purposes and Principles of the Charter, obtain the
request or consent of the countries and parties concerned, do its
utmost to help resolve the conflicts by peaceful means and
encourage a proper role by regional organizations according to
specific circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Liu said sanctions authorized by the Council had increased in
the past year. Sanctions, instead of rendering any help to the
settlement of disputes and conflicts, would only bring sufferings
to the people of target countries and cause economic losses and
damages to third countries implementing the sanctions. The
principles adopted by consensus at the 51st session of the General
Assembly should serve as guidelines in the decision-making.
</P>
<P>
Liu expressed the hope that with the joint efforts of the
general membership and the Council members, the council would live
up to the expectations of the world people and make further
progress on maintaining international peace and security.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Names African Envoy for Elimination of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) said today it has named a Somali model as special
ambassador to tour Africa for the elimination of female genital
mutilation.
</P>
<P>
The ugly practice, regarded as one of the harmful traditional
practice against female children in many African countries,
involves the partial or total removal of the external parts of
the female genital organ.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here today by UNFPA, the
Somali model, Waris Dirie, would tour African countries to speak
out against the practice and lend support to UNFPA and national
programs that seek to eradicate female genital mutilation.
</P>
<P>
Her work, the statement said, would be part of an
international campaign to stimulate awareness of and support for
the human rights of gender equality and reproductive choice,
especially for women in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, most of the girls who have
undergone the practice were living in 28 African countries,
including Nigeria, while it is estimated that 130 million girls
and women in Africa have undergone some form of genital
mutilation.
</P>
<P>
"At current rates of population increase and with slow decline
in these procedures, it is estimated that at least two million
girls are at risk of the practice yearly," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, sponsored by some organizations is aimed at
sensitizing the public to the need for a universal access to
reproductive health care, reproductive rights, the empowerment of
women and the end of gender discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Dirie, according to the statement, survived the ordeal but
lost a younger sister and two cousins during the process.
</P>
<P>
At age 13, just before she could be married off to an elderly
man, Dirie ran away from home and eventually found her way to
London where she decided to dedicate her life to ending the
practice and improving the status of women.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, EU to Resume Talks on Trade Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A new round of talks on a
future trade agreement between South Africa and the European
Union (EU) will resume in Pretoria Thursday, South African Press
Association (SAPA) reported today.
</P>
<P>
South African negotiators will present detailed proposals for
phasing out tariffs and trade barriers on a product-by-product
basis, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
During the previous round of talks held in June this year,
South African negotiators proposed that the EU should phase down
its tariffs faster than South Africa. They also called for
special trade agreements to cover certain sensitive products.
</P>
<P>
Bahle Sibisi, director of bilateral trade agreements at the
Trade and Industry Department, today outlined the proposed deal
to parliament committees of trade and industry, agriculture, and
foreign affairs in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, when the agreement comes into effect on
January 1, 1999, 90 percent of the EU's total trade should be
duty-free, he said. This figure should be increased to 94 percent
between 2000 and 2002, to 98 percent between 2003 and 2004, and
to 100 percent between 2005 and 2011.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa would have to ensure that 65 percent
of its total trade was duty free in 1999, and up this figure to
70 percent between 2003 and 2004, and to 85 percent between 2005
and 2011, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Goods covered by the proposed special trade agreements would
be restricted to 15 percent of total trade and reviewed every two
years.
</P>
<P>
Sibisi said South Africa proposed that the special trade
agreement should apply to various sensitive products, including
textiles, certain steel products, automobile and auto parts,
certain chemical and agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Major disputes between the two sides lie in fisheries and
agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Faizel Ismael, chief director of foreign trade relations in
the Trade and Industry Department, later told a news briefing
that it was hoped that trade aspects of the agreement would be
concluded early next year.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Collins, head of an EU parliamentary delegation now
visiting South Africa, said Tuesday that all the negotiations
could be concluded in mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
Trade negotiations between South Africa and the EU have been
under way since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The EU is South Africa's largest trading partner and investor,
with bilateral trade accounting for half of the African country's
total trade volume.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin, Klima Discuss Bilateral Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and visiting Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima signed
today an agreement on scientific and technical cooperation between
the two countries, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders had a two-hour closed door talks which focused
on projects of power engineering, metallurgy and machine-building,
as well as political, economic and interstate aspects of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Chernomyrdin said he was satisfied with the
talks and stressed that Russia and Austria will establish joint
ventures in areas of power engineering, metallurgy and
machine-building.
</P>
<P>
He underscored the need to "use the huge potential of Russia
and Austria to develop cooperation in the field of medicine, high
technologies and fundamental science."
</P>
<P>
Klima said that Russia has always been Austria's good and
reliable partner.
</P>
<P>
During the talks Klima said that Austria, that will become the
president of the European Union in the Summer of 1998, will try to
invigorate Russia's cooperation with the European Union within the
framework of their partnership agreement.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the European security, both premiers agree on the
need to build a Europe free of blocs or dividing lines.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin noted that NATO expansion to the East is the
"biggest historic mistake." The signing of the Russian-NATO
Founding Act earlier in the year does not imply that Russia agrees
to the expansion, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"This is the measure of openness that must be maintained in the
relations in Europe," Chernomyrdin said. On the other hand, he
added, Russia intends to cooperate actively with NATO on the
consolidation of the European security.
</P>
<P>
Russia will never agree that the expansion of NATO is needed
now, since its doctrine of confrontation with the Warsaw Pact, the
Soviet Union and, consequently, Russia has not essentially
changed, Chernomyrdin noted.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Chancellor arrived in Moscow on Wednesday for a
two-day official visit.

<P>
ATHENS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece today criticized a
letter sent by Turkey's Chief of Staff Ismail Karadayi to the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) claiming that Athens and
Moscow had formed an "axis" which threatened the alliance's
southeastern wing.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas today described
Karadayi's action in sending the letter as "a futile and hopeless
attempt by Turkey to divert the interest of international public
opinion."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Greece was not the only country to have
military cooperation with Russia. Russia also had a special
relationship with the European Union and NATO, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of the Greek National Defense General Staff
Athanasios Tzoganis today accused his Turkish counterpart of
breaching the military protocol by sending the letter to NATO
without giving a copy to the Greek chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
Tzoganis did not rule out the possibility of "a serious
incident" involving the two countries triggered by either a chance
or a "planned" event.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Denies Postponement of Planned Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will go ahead with its
military exercises scheduled for early next month, a senior
government official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing here, Turkish Defense Minister
Ismet Sezgin denied recent press reports that Turkey would
postpone its planned war games, saying that Turkey did not have
such an intention.
</P>
<P>
Greek media reports said earlier that Turkey is expected to
put off its exercises and to invite Greek Prime Minister
Constantinos Simitis to Ankara for a visit.
</P>
<P>
"Greeks have held a military exercise earlier this month in
Cyprus. Therefore, the postponement of Turkey's maneuvers is out
of the question," Sezgin said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish war games were apparently a response to the
three-day joint Greek and Greek Cypriots' military exercises,
code-named "Victory '97", in the Greek Cypriots-controlled area
on October 10-13.
</P>
<P>
Sezgin also confirmed that Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz will hold talks with Simitis in the Greek island of Crete
where the Southeastern European Countries Summit is to be held
on November 2-4.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish defense minister, however, did not clarify
whether Yilmaz had invited Simitis to Turkey for talks.
</P>
<P>
The Greek-Turkish tension intensified recently because of the
Cypriot government's insistence on buying anti-aircraft S-300
missiles from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military has repeatedly threatened that it will
destroy these missiles if they are finally deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Russia, however, has warned Turkey that Moscow will see it as
a declaration of war against the Russian Federation if Turkey
attacks vessels shipping missiles to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke visited Ankara on
October 13 in an effort to ease tensions between Greece and
Turkey, two member states of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey have long been at odds due to some
outstanding issues, including mineral resources under the Aegean,
airspace division as well as the Cyprus issue.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Agrees to Continue Interim Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government today
reaffirmed its position to continue the negotiations on executing
the interim agreements reached with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a press communique, the Committee on National Security of
the Israeli Cabinet, which met this morning for a lengthy
discussion on the issue, said it decided to advance the fulfillment
of the interim agreements.
</P>
<P>
A detailed report on the current situation in the negotiations
with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has been presented
to the Cabinet by heads of the Interim Agreement Committees.
</P>
<P>
These committees are in charge of negotiate the issues such as
building a sea port and air port in Gaza Strip, and opening a
safe-passage between the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
The communique noted that Israel will push forward the work of
the these committees, and appropriate instructions for future
talks have been given to their heads.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and other ministers also discussed the way to approach the final
status talks, which will tackle a permanent settlement of the
territories and East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu reportedly wanted to proceed with the talks on the
interim agreements and at the same time open the final status
negotiations in a bid to reach an agreement with PNA in the coming
year.
</P>
<P>
But today's session failed to offer Foreign Minister David Levy
the policy guidelines he wanted in negotiating with PNA deputy
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen) in Washington under the auspices of
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet's National Security Committee will meet again next
week to define the parameters for concessions Israel is expected
to make and the commitments to be undertaken by the PNA so that
Levy will be able to leave for Washington in early November.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Security Council of
the United Nations today unanimously voted to impose sanctions on
Angola's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) as a punishment for its failure to implement the peace
accords.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions include air and travel bans on UNITA and closure
of its offices abroad, which will go into force on October 30,
1997.
</P>
<P>
The sanction measures were adopted on August 28 and they should
have been in force a month ago. But the Security Council postponed
them while UNITA made efforts to fulfill the obligations under the
1994 peace accords.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the resolution decided to extend the mandate
of UN peacekeepers until January 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the Security Council expressed its firm
commitment to preserve the unity, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The council stressed the urgent need for the Angolan government
and in particular UNITA to complete without further delay the
implementation of their obligations under the Lusaka protocol and
relevant Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The council urged the international community to provide
assistance to facilitate the demobilization and social integration
of ex-combats, demining, the resettlement of displaced persons and
rehabilitation and reconstruction of the Agolan economy in order
to consolidate the gains in the peace process of the country.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says Stock Declines Have Long-run Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the U.S. Federal
Reserve (Fed) Alan Greenspan said today that the wild gyrations in
the stock market in recent days could have a long-run benefit for
the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the declines in the stock market is good for the
economy by slowing its growth to a sustainable pace and dampening
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
"Things are less out of line" in the aftermath of Monday's
market drop, Greenspan told the congressional Joint Economic
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan has expressed his worries of overheating in U.S.
stock market on several occasions and warned about a year ago
against "irrational exuberance" on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted a record 554 points
on Monday and regained a one-day record 337 points on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said if the markets now calm down, "It is quite conceivable
that a few years hence we will look back at this episode, as we
now look back at the 1987 crash, as a salutary event."
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said that even if turmoil in Southeast Asian markets
had not led to the big sell-off on Wall Street, some other event
eventually would have driven down a market that had climbed too
high.
</P>
<P>
Even with Tuesday's market rebound, he said, consumers feel
less wealthy than they did a week ago and this will dampen
spending.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan declared that the underlying U.S. economy remained
strong despite the market turbulence of the past week.
</P>
<P>
All the turmoil had to be viewed against the backdrop of a
"continuing impressive performance of the American economy in
recent months. Growth appears to have remained robust and
inflation low, and even falling, despite an ever-tightening labor
market," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan stressed the U.S. Fed must remain vigilant to insure
that tight labor markets do not cause inflation.
</P>
<P>
Many economists who had expected the Fed to begin raising
interest rates now believe the recent market sell-off was doing
the Fed's work for it.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has arrested
1,138 illegal foreign residents in a nationwide campaign,
according to a Kuwait News Agency report today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Saudi Director General of the Passport
Department Saad Abdul Karim as saying the arrests were made
between October 17 to 25 after a three-month grace period expired.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested were mainly from south Asian countries and some
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities said it would punish the illegal residents
with either a two-year imprisonment or a fine of 100,000 Saudi
riyals (about 27,000 U.S. dollars) or both of them.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia hosts foreigners, mostly from India, southeast
Asia and other poor Arab countries, who make up one third of its
18 million population. An estimated 500,000 illegal foreign
residents lived in the kingdom before the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities expelled 400,000 people of various
nationalities, mainly Asians and Arabs after discovering they have
no residence permits.
</P>
<P>
Saudi authorities agreed to pardon those illegal expatriates if
they handed themselves over voluntarily.

their ties back to normal.
</P>
<P>
"It is only natural that the two countries should seek to
remove the causes of differences between them in a bid to preserve
their special and historical links and also to maintain stability
in the whole region," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak held talks with
visiting Sudanese First Vice President el-Zubeir Mohammad Salih
who arrived here this morning on a brief visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Salih delivered a message to Mubaak from President
Omar al-Bashir on bilateral relations and the situation in south
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Moussa also referred to Sudan as a "sisterly country," a move
that is seen as an approval of the recent Sudanese overtures to
mend fence with its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Mustafa Othman
Ismail today also stressed the need of dialog with Cairo to solve
Egyptian-Sudanese problems and improve bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"President Mubarak has a marked understanding of Sudan's
issues...Our relationship is distinguished and time-honored," he
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Sudanese-Egyptian ties will be put back on track
for the good of the two peoples," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of Salih's visit, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir told
the parliament earlier this month that his government seeks
improving battered ties with neighboring countries, especially
"sister Egypt." His initiative drew support from the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries met late last month
on the fringe of the U.N. General Assembly meeting, signaling that
the two countries are working to move toward better ties.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt have contested ownership of Halaib, a triangle
of land located between the two countries, since Sudan's
independence in 1956.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Sudan have been strained since
al-Bashir took power in Sudan in 1989 and worsened in 1995 when
Cairo accused Khartoum of involvement in an assassination attempt
on Mubarak in Addis Ababa.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Deposits, Loans Rise in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total deposits
and loans rose in September this year, according to statistics
published today by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority.
</P>
<P>
Total deposits increased by 2 percent in the month after a fall
of 0.8 percent in August. Time deposits went up by 3.6 percent
partly because banks offered higher interest rates for such
deposits in response to higher interbank rates, but savings
deposits declined by 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong dollar deposits edged up 1.7 percent while foreign
currency deposits recorded a 2.5-percent increase in September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, total loans and advances went up by 0.8
percent. Hong Kong dollar loans expanded by 4.1 percent while
foreign currency loans fell by 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the third quarter, residential mortgage loans surged by
9 percent and loans to stock brokers rocketed by 106.2 percent,
partly because of new share subscriptions. Loans to manufacturing,
 wholesale, and retail trades fell slightly during the
season.

<HEADLINE> Oil-for-Food Deal Unaffected: UN Officials in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.N. officials said here today
that the oil-for-food deal between Iraq and the U.N. will continue
naturally despite Iraqi decision to exclude Americans from
inspectors' team.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference this morning, a U.N. Humanitarian Affairs
spokesman said it is impossible to allow the difficulties facing
the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on Iraq to
undermine the U.N. humanitarian assistance to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is in charge of disarming Iraq of weapons of mass
destruction in the aftermath of the Gulf War. The U.N. Security
Council passed a resolution last week threatening an air travel
ban if Baghdad refuses to cooperate with weapon inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the activities of the U.N. Humanitarian
Affairs Bureau in Iraq, as well as those of the other seven
U.N. agencies participating in the implementation of the
oil-for-food program in 18 Iraqi provinces are continuing.
</P>
<P>
The program allow Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil every six months for food and other humanitarian supplies
starting last December.
</P>
<P>
U.N. officials here said 13 U.N. observation teams have been
sent to northern Iraq, and 17 other ones will be sent to central
and southern Iraq, with the aim of monitoring the arrival of wheat
shipments and wheat processing next month.
</P>
<P>
They said the work of the World Food Program in Iraq is going
on normally and 18 U.N. and 160 local observers will be sent to 15
provinces in central and southern Iraq to monitor food
distribution.
</P>
<P>
However, they expressed deep concern about the expected delay
in dealing out flour rations to the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
They said the distribution of food supplies in northern Iraq,
except the areas where fighting between the warring Kurdish
factions is raging, is still continuing.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said any obstruction of the implementation of the
oil-for-food program in Iraq would prevent meeting the food and
health needs of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He declined to answer questions fielded by reporters about
UNSCOM's problems with Iraq, emphasizing that the work of the
U.N. Humanitarian Affairs Coordination Bureau is independent of
that of the UNSCOM.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Russia, US Voice Concern Over Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Top-ranking U.S. and Russian
diplomats today held talks with Egyptian leadership on ways to
break up the peace impasse, but a breakthrough seemed elusive.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and Russia are deeply concerned over the present
stalemate in the Mideast peace march which is currently facing a
crucial plight," said visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov following his meeting today with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"The peacemaking is taking a snail pace," said Primakov who
arrived here Wednesday on the last leg of his Mideast mission
that already took him to Lebanon, Syria, Israel, the Palestinian
self-rule areas and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
His three-day visit to Egypt coincided with the first tour of
newly-appointed U.S. Undersecretary of State for Mideast Affairs
Martin Indyk to the region that also includes Yemen, Saudi Arabia
and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Indyk, following talks with Mubarak today, said the United
States has managed to restart the Palestinian-Israeli talks and
is working to move it forward.
</P>
<P>
But he dismissed that a timetable should be defined for this
purpose.
</P>
<P>
However, he said there is no optimism regarding Tuesday's
policy address by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that
threatened to reject all signed agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa denied that Indyk's visit
signaled a breakthrough, adding that he is not taking any
proposals with him as he is not a U.S. envoy.
</P>
<P>
There won't be substantial progress "unless on those major
matters that will determine the fate of the Mideast peace," such
as settlement, redeployment, Jerusalem and final status talks,
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
As for Primakov, he is touring the region mainly to propel the
stalled Arab-Israeli talks on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks and
uplift the role of Moscow in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
Primakov told reporters that Russian President Boris Yeltsin
is due here in April next year and preparations are under way for
the Mubarak-Yeltsin summit, the second in seven months.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the U.S. co-sponsored the Madrid conference in 1991
to set the Middle East peace wheel going. But Moscow's inactivity
over the past few years has left the U.S. dominate the scene in
brokering Arab-Israeli negotiations.

<HEADLINE> All Archives Needed by Macao SAR to Stay on: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- All the archives that will be
useful for the operation of the future Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will remain in Macao, a senior
Portuguese official promised here today.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Santana Carlos, chief representative of the Portuguese
side of the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG), made these
remarks here today following a meeting with his Chinese
counterpart Han Zhaokang.
</P>
<P>
He said that at the request of Han, negotiations on the
transfer of archives started in August this year, and two such
meetings have been held in a good atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has urged the Portuguese side to start talks
on the transfer of archives and assets as time is drawing near to
the 1999 handover, and suggested that a proper treasury reserve
should be transferred to the future SAR.
</P>
<P>
"The stand of the Chinese side is that the negotiations on the
transfer of archives should be conducted within a specialized
panel," Han told reporters. "Besides, during the negotiations, the
archives should be kept complete and safe."
</P>
<P>
Han also urged the Portuguese side to start talks on the
transfer of assets immediately, adding "a proper amount of
treasury should be reserved for the use of the Macao SAR"
considering the specific conditions in the transition and
handover.
</P>
<P>
In response to the Portuguese side's demand for the use of
Portuguese as an official language, Han said that it is the use of
Chinese as an official language that should be stressed now.
</P>
<P>
"The Portuguese language still holds sway in Macao now, and its
official status is clearly confirmed in the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law of Macao," Han said. "The immediate
problem is the use of Chinese as an official language. Although
there was some progress, it is still one of the leading issues
that needs addressing urgently."

<HEADLINE> Sino-Portuguese Group Urged to Focus on Leading Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison
Group (JLG) should focus its work on leading issues concerning the
stable transition and a smooth handover of power in Macao in the
coming two years, a Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhaokang, chief representative of the Chinese side in the
Sino-Portuguese JLG, made these remarks today following a
closed-door meeting with his Portuguese counterpart, Antonio
Carlos. The meeting made preparations for the 30th plenary session

"With joint efforts of the two sides, we should push forward
the negotiations on issues concerning the stable transition and
the smooth handover of power (in Macao) to a new stage of profound
discussion," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I think the JLG should quicken its work pace in the remaining
two years (before the handover) so that those issues could be
resolved in time and properly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The issues include three leading issues -- the localization of
civil service, the localization of law, and the use of Chinese as
an official language -- and the transfer of archives, the transfer
of assets and the pension of retired civil servants, among others,
he said.
</P>
<P>

KUWAIT CITY, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Union of Saudi Chambers

Saudi businessmen took part in the former three MENA

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Hold International Conference on Acupuncture-Moxibustion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- An academic conference of the
Beijing-based World Federation of Acupuncture-Moxibustion
Societies (WFAS) is to be held on November 1-3 at the Beijing
International Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
Attending the event will be more than 1,000 experts from some
30 countries and regions displaying the progress they have made in
acupuncture-moxibustion treatment, and discussing ways to increase
use of the ancient therapy worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture-moxibustion therapy, used to treat disease and
relieve pain, is done by piercing parts of the body with needles
or burning "moxa," a soft material yielded from herbs, on the skin.
</P>
<P>
According to traditional Chinese medicine, the human body has a
network of passages known as "jingluo," through which "qi," or
vital energy, and blood can travel.
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, acupuncture-moxibustion effectively treats
disease by stimulating circulation of qi and blood along the
"jingluo".
</P>
<P>
China is believed to be the home of acupuncture-moxibustion;
historical records and unearthed relics prove that Chinese people
mastered the therapy more than 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
By using some high technology, such as lasers, the ancient
medicine is re-emerging as an important alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture-moxibustion has been used in treating more than 300
kinds of diseases, especially acute cerebral disease and pain.
</P>
<P>
Acupuncture-moxibustion has been introduced to some 140
countries and regions. WFAS has had 74 member societies that are
composed of more than 50,000 experts and doctors in some 40
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Next week's conference will include symposiums on acupuncture
anesthesia, analgesia, acupuncture mechanisms, meridian research,
clinical research and other subjects, according to the organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
WFAS has sponsored four international conferences and many
symposiums since it was founded in Beijing in November 1987. The
organizers of the conference said they hope the event will play a
significant role in promoting acupuncture-moxibustion more widely
across the world.

<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A psychological study has
revealed that memories of childhood trauma are often recalled
without the help of therapists.
</P>
<P>
The study, based on an analysis of case histories of 690
patients, found that a third of the patients could remember
previously forgotten childhood events before consulting a
therapist, and a further half recovered memories during unrelated
therapy.
</P>
<P>
Only a fifth of the patients recovered memories after
suggestive techniques were used, said a report on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Therapists reported that 41 percent of the patients' memories
had been corroborated by confessions, legal records or family
members.
</P>
<P>
Experts from London University's psychology department, say
that findings show that many recovered memories are real and can
be of value to psychologists and police.

<HEADLINE> Restoration of Chungshan Cruiser Well Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Restoration of the "Chungshan"
Cruiser, raised from its 59-year resting place on the Yangtze
River on January 28 this year, is well underway and the ship is
expected to be ready for public viewing by early next year.
</P>
<P>
The first stage of the work, involving removing rust from the
hull and applying anti-corrosive material, is coming to an end, Li
Daqiang, deputy governor of central China's Hubei Province, said
today at a ceremony to solicit donations for the project.
</P>
<P>
After the cruiser was lifted out of water at the salvage site
in Jinkou town, Hubei Province, more than 16,000 rounds of
ammunition and thousands of relics were recovered. The vessel has
been in the Hubei Shipyard since May 16.
</P>
<P>
In addition to an exhibition hall for the warship, a relics
museum, a hall for paintings of maritime battle and a monument for
martyrs against Japanese invaders will be set up at Jinkou Town,
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The entire restoration and exhibition program will cost more
than 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars). Donations so far
add up to 24 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The first three million yuan of donations in Shanghai was
delivered today to a special fund for the warship's restoration.
</P>
<P>
The Cruiser, named after Dr. Sun Yat-sen, father of the Chinese
Democratic Revolution, was sunk on October 24, 1938, after it shot
down three Japanese fighters in China's War of Resistance Against
Japan (1937-1945).

<HEADLINE> SAR Spokesman: Hong Kong Banks Remain Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The local banking sector is
well-capitalized and robust despite Moody's gloomy ratings for
Hong Kong banks, a Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ratings agency Moody's Investors Service today downgraded its
outlook for Hong Kong banks from stable to negative because of the
recent market volatility.
</P>
<P>
It would also review its assessments of the strength of Hong
Kong's two biggest banks, Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation and Hang Seng Bank, "for a possible downgrade."
</P>
<P>
The SAR spokesman said that Moody's comments reflect the more
difficult operating environment caused by the recent turmoil in
both regional and global financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"Despite this, the Hong Kong banking sector is well-capitalized
and robust," he said.
</P>
<P>
The official argued that good profitability in the first half
of this year provides the banks with a cushion in today's more
difficult conditions. Besides, bad debts are at low levels and
banks' asset quality is improving.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong banking system is highly exposed to real estate,
with property loans accounting for more than 50 percent of all
bank loans. The interest-rate sensitive property sector suffered
heavily in the recent financial turmoil, which resulted in
record-high primary interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Now the problem is whether banks can adjust themselves to a
possible downturn in property market, according to some securities
 analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong government spokesman expressed his confidence in
the banking system, saying: "Banks should be well placed to deal
with an adjustment in property prices, should the downturn occur."
</P>
<P>
Moody's downgrade Thursday added volatility to the Hong Kong
stock market, which has already been on a roller-coaster ride. The
 key Hang Seng Index today plunged 300 points in the first few
minutes of opening, then crashed below 10,000 points in the
afternoon session and finally slumped 3.74 percent, or 402 points
to close at 10,362.
</P>
<P>
Share prices achieved a spectacular rebound Wednesday, with the
biggest single-day gain both in points and percentage while on
Tuesday, the blue-chip index suffered the heaviest one-day loss
ever.

<P>
They agree that while China and the United States have areas of

interest and a firm common will to seize opportunities and meet
challenges cooperatively, with candor and determination to achieve
concrete progress. China and the United States have major
differences on the question of human rights. At the same time,

growth; preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction; advancing Asia-Pacific regional cooperation;
combating narcotics trafficking, international organized crime and
terrorism; strengthening bilateral exchanges and cooperation in
economic development, trade, law environmental protection, energy,
science and technology, and education and culture; as well as

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Destroys Last of Anti-Personnel Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa today destroyed
its remaining stockpile of anti-personnel landmines, the Department of
Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The destruction is in accordance with the cabinet decision on
February 19 to ban the use, development, production and stockpiling of
anti-personnel landmines, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
However, South Africa will retain 5,000 anti-personnel mines and
13,000 practice mines to maintain and further develop its de-mining
capability.
</P>
<P>
This would ensure that landmines were removed in the shortest
possible time and in the most cost-effective manner, the department
said.
</P>
<P>
The retention is permissible in terms of the recently concluded
global ban treaty adopted on September 18 this year in Oslo, Norway.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the convention, parties have to destroy their stockpile
of anti-personnel landmines no later than four years after the ban
came into force in their countries.
</P>
<P>
"With this final phase of the destruction, South Africa has
therefore fulfilled its obligation in terms of this convention even
before the convention is open for signature (in Canada in December),"
the department said.
</P>
<P>
The South African government would work to promote the convention
and to contribute to the complete removal of anti-personnel mines from
the world and to providing assistance for the care and rehabilitation
of mine victims, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The destruction of South Africa's stockpile of 26,1423
anti-personnel mines began on May 21.
</P>
<P>
Today's destruction took place at Alkantpan, Northern Cape, where
the first batch of mines were destroyed.

<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The 302-meter-long,
21-meter-wide Qingjiatuo Bridge spanning a shiplock at the Three
Gorges Dam has opened to traffic.
</P>
<P>
Located about 1,000 meters downstream from a temporary
shiplock, the bridge has the greatest carrying capacity per unit
area in China. The unique design of the bridge can guarantee the
easy passage of a 10,000-ton fleet across the shiplock as well as
electricity-generating equipment on the bridge.
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the bridge, the construction was concluded
for a group of transportation facilities in the area, including a
28-kilometer-long highway for special use that connects the city
of Yichang with the dam area, one cross-river bridge, and the
Yangtze Bridge at Xiling, which is the first suspension bridge on
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The highway involved five giant bridges, 29 standard bridges
and ten one-way channels. The length of the bridges and channels
constitutes 80 percent of the whole length of the highway.
</P>
<P>
The highway can handle an estimated 40 million tons of building
materials expected to be used throughout the course of the 17
years of the construction of the Three Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
It also connects the Yichang-Huangshi expressway, which will
become a hub of communication along the Yangtze Economic Belt and
serve as a component of the Shanghai-Chengdu expressway.

<HEADLINE> HK's Financial Business Benefits From China's Interior Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A noted Hong Kong banker said
here today that the economic reform and modernization drive in the
interior areas of China will create more opportunities for the
financial business in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Au Siu-kee, vice-chairman and chief executive of the
Hang Seng Bank, has just been appointed guest professor of
People's University of China in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's economy has been satisfactory since the region
returned to the motherland, he said. Though the Hong Kong dollar
was affected by some speculators over the past week, and there
were a runaway market money rate and plummeting stock prices, that
was "only a temporary phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
"What's more important is that the political and economic
relations between Hong Kong and the interior areas of China have
become closer," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the hard work of Hong Kong people, the current
achievements are to a great extent a result of Hong Kong's
geographical location and cultural identification with the
interior areas, the banker said, adding that Hong Kong surely
benefits from economic reforms in the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
After its return to the motherland, Hong Kong's status as an
international financial center has become even more solid, with 80
of the 100 biggest banks in the world having established branches
in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid development of the financial market in the
interior areas since the 1990s, and with increasing exchanges in
the financial circles between Hong Kong and the interior areas,
China will play a bigger role in the world's financial business,
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, October 30 (Xinhua)-- The military junta in Sierra
Leone today accused Nigerian troops in ECOMOG of violating the
peace agreement signed in Guinea about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman said that Nigerian troops based at the
recently reopened Jui Checkpoint, 13 miles east of the capital,
"are harassing, disarming and searching all Sierra Leonean
soldiers" passing through to the interior of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We would not stand for that, otherwise there will be renewed
fighting, " the spokesman threatened.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman cited the case of a senior army officer, Colonel
Yirrah, who was "harassed and searched" by Nigerian soldiers at
the checkpoint on Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
"When we got the news, some soldiers and the People's Army
personnel were so angry that they suggested military action to
redress the situation but we were able to calm them down," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Civilians who watched the incident said they were "angry and
disappointed" over the Nigerians action.

ransacked and offloaded from commercial vehicles."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Tensions With Bedouin Arabs Near </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Tensions between Israeli
authorities and the country's Bedouin Arabs could result in
violent confrontation due to the rising poverty and Palestinian
nationalism, a security report published today said.
</P>
<P>
The report, published in The Jerusalem Post, was compiled by
one of the Israeli security services after an in-depth study on
the situation of the country's 150,000 traditionally nomadic
Bedouins.
</P>
<P>
It warns of the threat of irredentism and an increasing force
of terrorism due to poverty and the growing influence by
anti-Israeli radicals.
</P>
<P>
"The processes of Palestinian nationalism, Islamization among
the Bedouin, and the continuation of the current ties with the
State of Israel means unavoidable clashes in the future between
the police and the Bedouin community, which is becoming
increasingly involved in criminality and terrorism that feed on
each other," the report said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the rising unemployment rate, now at 20 percent,
and the rapid urbanization of the life of Bedouins who
traditionally live a migrant life, many Bedouin youths tend to
move toward radicalism and disregarding the authorities, it added.
</P>
<P>
What disturbs Israeli government most is that many Bedouins are
adopting Islam and Palestinian nationalism, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that there is an increase in ties between
Beduins living in different parts of the country, leading them to
be increasingly closer to other Arabs, and the Palestinians under
the rule of the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
This provided an opportunity for the anti-Israeli Islamic
movement to capitalize on the poverty of the Bedouins to promote
its influence, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the report recommended the authorities settle the
nomadic Bedouins in permanent housing and work to reduce the
influence of the Palestinians on the community, in order to
prevent the possible widespread confrontation with the
Bedouins.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reiterates One China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Wednesday reiterated Washington's "one China" policy at talks here
with visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States would stick to the principles
enshrined in the three U.S.-China joint communiques and support
neither Taiwan's independence, nor its bid to enter the United
Nations, nor the proposal of "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Jiang is here on a nine-day state visit to the United States,
the first by a Chinese head of state in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Taiwan question has always been the single most
important and most sensitive issue at the heart of
China-U.S. relations. He said strictly abiding by the three joint
communiques and properly handling the Taiwan issue held key to the
healthy and steady development of China-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed China's bid to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Also on trade, Clinton said his administration has been trying
to end the annual deliberation of China's Most-Favored-Nation
trading status by the Congress, which he believed would be
conducive to accelerating U.S.-China trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said China is one of the biggest countries in the world
and has witnessed the most rapid economic growth, and the WTO
would become an ineffective trading organization without the
participation of China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton once again extended welcome to Jiang on his U.S. trip,
saying that he was happy to have the opportunity to meet President
Jiang in the White House. Jiang visited the White House Tuesday
night, shortly after his arrival from Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese and the American peoples as well as the
whole international community have all given much heed to the
visit and the meeting between the two presidents, considering its
immediate and historic significance.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, who had earlier visited Honolulu and
Williamsburg before arriving here, will also visit Philadelphia,
New York, Boston and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the current visit would be conducive to promoting
world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the world is undergoing deep
vicissitudes and the pursuit of peace, stability and cooperation
and the promotion of development have become an irresistible trend
of times, Jiang said. However, he added, there are many
instabilities and uncertainties in international relations.
</P>
<P>
China, as the biggest developing country, and the United
States, the world's most developed country, both members of the
U.N. Security Council, share broad common interests in many
fields, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The fields include the maintenance of global and regional peace
and stability, promotion of global economic growth,
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Asia-Pacific
cooperation and the fight against international crimes.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also have common interests in economic and
trade cooperation, environmental protection, energy, education,
and scientific and cultural exchanges, he added.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation is the common desire of the Chinese and
American peoples and all other peoples of the world devoted to
peace and development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton echoed Jiang's view, expressing the hope that
the two countries would further strengthen cooperation in
maintaining peace, stability and security, U.N. affairs, major
regional issues and in environmental protection, the fight against
drugs, international crimes and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation between the United States and China at
the U.N. is very important, and the two countries have had good
consultation and cooperation in many issues. He hoped such
cooperation would be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
China is playing a leading role in almost all major
international organizations, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang invited President Clinton to visit China next year, and
Clinton accepted the invitation with pleasure. Clinton expressed
the hope that he would be able to make the trip to China early
next year.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, U.S. Vice-President Al Gore held a luncheon in
honor of President Jiang.

accord on the joint adoption of measures for military training.
</P>
<P>
The two defense ministers also signed a draft agreement today
on the amount of Russia's compensation for its lease on the Kazakh
weapons' testing ground, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, who arrived here Tuesday for a three-day visit to
Kazakhstan, told reporters that the two sides agreed to further
strengthen military cooperation between Russia and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
He said although the two sides hold different opinions on
certain issues, it is believed that any problem can be solved on
the basis of mutual understanding and compromise.

<HEADLINE> Assailants, Accomplices in Cairo Bus Attack Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian military court today
sentenced to death by hanging Saber Mohamed Farahat and his
brother Mahmoud Mohamed Farahat who carried out an attack last
month on a tourist bus here, killing nine Germans and their
Egyptian driver.
</P>
<P>
The brothers had pleaded guilty to the firebomb and gun attack
upon the tourist bus on September 18.
</P>
<P>
The court in northern suburbs of Cairo also passed various
prison terms on six co-defendants in the attack, the Middle East
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-six other people were wounded in the fatal attack
outside the Egyptian Museum, which houses some of the world's
greatest Pharaonic treasures.
</P>
<P>
The six men were sentenced to between three to ten years with
hard labor on conviction of supplying the two brothers with
ammunition and weapons used in the attack, while a seventh was
acquited.
</P>
<P>
Death sentences passed by military court can only be appealed
to President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The verdicts came exactly two weeks after the first trial
opened. On the second trial on October 18, Saber and his brother
Mahmoud pleaded guilty to charges of premeditated murder and the
use of violence to harm the Egyptian economy.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian authorities have maintained the attack was not
linked to Islamic militants, who have been fighting Mubarak's
government since 1992, and described it as an isolated case
carried out by a lunatic.
</P>
<P>
At previous trials, Saber said he believes in the ideas of
Jihad (Holy War), but he was not associated with the group itself.
</P>
<P>
Saber was confined to Cairo's Khanka Asylum when he was proved
insane in the wake of the 1993 killings of three foreigners at
Cairo's Semiramis Hotel.
</P>
<P>
He has told reporters that his family bribed Sayed el-Qut, the
head of the mental hospital to set him free before last month's
attack on the German tourists.
</P>
<P>
In a separate case, El-Qut is on trial for bribery with 10
other doctors and orderlies from the asylum.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Red Deer Rediscovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan red deer, thought to
be extinct for over 50 years ago, has been rediscovered in Shannan
Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The local forestry bureau has applied for the establishment of
a state-level nature reserve to protect the natural habitat of the
rare species in Sangri County.
</P>
<P>
An international trade treaty lists the species, known by the
scientific designation of cervus elaphus wallichi, as an
endangered species, and China's state wildlife protection program
lists the red deer above the white-lipped deer.
</P>
<P>
The species was discovered 150 years ago in Bhutan, Sikkim and
areas south of China's Yarlung Zangbo River.
</P>
<P>
The beautiful deer was cruelly slaughtered for their valuable
pilose antlers which were considered to have a much higher value
than the antlers of other deer species. No reliable records
indicating the existence of the species have existed since the
1940s, with animal research experts classifying the red deer as an
extinct species.
</P>
<P>
However, in 1992, Liu Wulin, a wildlife expert in Tibet, found
the bodys of two deer killed by poachers. Liu was extremely
surprised to find that he had discovered the remains of red deer.
</P>
<P>
In October and November 1995, Liu and his team conducted a
40-day field investigation covering 40,000 sq.m. in Shannan
Prefecture together with George Schaller, a foreign wildlife
expert. As a result, they found several red deer groups in Sangri.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the investigation revealed that there are less than
200 red deers in Sangri, Nedong, Zhanang, Gonggar and Gyaca
counties.
</P>
<P>
The herd was found in alpine meadow areas at 4,000 meters above
sea level on the northern banks of the Yarlung Zangbo
River. Mature Tibet red deer weighs about 110 kg, and stands 1.2
meters in height.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the Tibetan red deer migrated from the southern banks
of the Yarlung Zangbo River to the northern banks due to
environmental changes, war and poachers which have devastated the
species since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Scientists previously thought the species might have survived
on the southern banks of the river, but all ensuing investigations
proved fruitless. In 1990, the scientists announced that the red
deer had been extinct for at least 50 years.

<HEADLINE> Manually Operated Boat Engine, Washing Machine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 30 (Xinhua)-- A Tanzanian carpenter has
invented a washing machine and a boat engine, both of which are
operated manually.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Ndokeji, 38, said that he has made the machines by
using simple technology and locally available spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Ndokeji told the local paper Express that he made the boat
engine using galvanized water pipes, bicycle pedals, chains,
bolts and nuts, a water pump and a pulley used in a milling
machine.
</P>
<P>
Other items used included iron plates and bicycle hubs.
</P>
<P>
Ndokeji, of Misungwi District in Mwanza Region, said that he
has made some experiments on Lake Victoria to prove the
suitability of his invention and the results were encouraging.
</P>
<P>
The engine could drive four-ton boat without any problems, he
alleged.
</P>
<P>
The invention cost him a lot of time and resources since 1995,
Ndokeji said.
</P>
<P>
As for the washing machine, Ndokeji said that he made it this
year using simple technology as well. The spare parts include
galvanized pipes, iron plates, a plastic basket as well as
bicycle parts like pedals and chains.
</P>
<P>
He said that the washing machine is economical for not using
electricity. "The machine can wash and rinse clothes of any kind
and is operated by legs like operating sewing machines," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
Ndokeji said that he could make many things like butter
extractor and a photocopier but lacked capital. He urged the
government to avail him with funds so that he could make more
inventions.

<HEADLINE> Britain To Cut Carbon Dioxide Emissions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain will cut its carbon
dioxide emissions 20 per cent by 2010, regardless of what other
countries agree to cut during talks on a climate treaty in Japan
in December, John Prescott, deputy prime minister, told a Commons
committee on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prescott told the Environment Select Committee that the target
was a personal commitment by Prime Minister Tony Blair and that
Britain intended to stick to it, even if the United States and
other developed countries agreed to do less, according to The
Daily Telegraph published here today.
</P>
<P>
It is "crunch time" for the developed nations, he said. "We
have contributed to the problem and we must make the first major
changes in our lifestyle to achieve our objective of reducing
greenhouse gases."
</P>
<P>
Prescott said he had been asked by Japan to chair a committee
of developed nations in Tokyo next month to broker an agreement
between Europe, which is committed to a 15 per cent reduction in
greenhouse gases by 2010, and other nations including the United
States, which say they cannot start cutting emissions until after
that time.

<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A national center for the
information exchanges between various banking cards was established
in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Similar centers had been put into operation by September in 12

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Construction Site Becomes Big Tourist Attraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- For the past several days,
thousands of tourists have flocked to Tanziling, a small hill
overlooking the Three Gorges on the Yangtze River, to get a better
view of construction activity on the world's biggest water control
project.
</P>
<P>
Various kinds of automobiles could be seen driving along a
28-km-long road from the river's edge to the top of the 260-m-high
hill, where visitors could view the big temporary ship lock and
the narrow gap between the two stone and earth walls in the river,
which is going to be dammed within nine days.
</P>
<P>
"The number of tourists began to increase this September and
the number grew more rapidly by October," said a source from
managing staff of the project.
</P>
<P>
"We may have more than 2,000 visitors a day in the
coming week, as November 8, the day for the damming of the Yangtze
River approaches," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Tourist agencies both in and outside Hubei Province, where the
project is located, vied with each other to sign a contract with
the tourist agency under the Three Gorges Development General
Cooperation to list the Three Gorges construction site as a key
spot for trips to the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
"It's worthwhile to be here," said a tourist from Beijing, who
was on a "farewell visit" to the Three Gorges. "I've not only seen
the beautiful scenery but also the great construction work of the
Three Gorges Project."
</P>
<P>
Several luxurious tourist yachts will anchor at the Three
Gorges on November 8, a tourist guide said, but tickets have
already been sold out.
</P>
<P>
"I hadn't expected so many visitors," she said, "but I do hope
that the Three Gorges will still be a big tourist attraction after
the damming."

<HEADLINE> Ancient Iron Implements Found in Northeast China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists working
in northeast China's Liaoning Province have discovered more than
50 ancient iron farm implements and carpentry and blacksmithing
tools dating to the Jin Dynasty (1115-1234 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
The find includes axes, shovels, sickles and ploughshares, as
well as daily-use pottery and bronze implements. Archeologists
discovered the relics in a stone quarry in Benxi Autonomous
County, home of the Manchu ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
They noted that related items were normally stored in cellars
during the Jin Dynasty, and surmise that carpentry and
blacksmithing workshops appeared in northeast China early in the
12th century.
</P>
<P>
They say the discovery is of great importance for further
research related to the production activities, trade, habits and
customs of the Nuzhen people, an ancient ethnic group in
China.

<HEADLINE> WTO Pleased to Hear China's Intention to Join ITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Li Jingchen
</P>
<P>
GENEVA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
is pleased to hear that China has indicated its intention to
participate as soon as possible in the Information Technology
Agreement (ITA), a WTO spokesman told Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are pleased to hear that China will enter into the ITA," said
Keith Rockwell, the chief WTO spokesman. "China is the largest
producer of information products but not a party to the accord up to
now. With China's decision to enter into the agreement, the ITA will
cover more than 95 percent of the world market in information
technology products."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China was the eighth biggest exporter of information
technology products with 14.51 billion US dollars and the
ninth importer with 14.35 billion US dollars, according to WTO
statistics.
</P>
<P>
"We are also pleased to hear from Washington that China and the
United States are making intensive efforts to bring China into the
WTO," he went on. "China's decision is absolutely a great step
forward, indicating that China is closer to its accession to WTO."
</P>
<P>
However, negotiations on China's accession to WTO are not only
bilateral but also multilateral, he stated, adding that "It's up to
the WTO's 132 members to decide."
</P>
<P>
There are now altogether 43 participants in the ITA, sharing
about 95 percent of the world trade in information technology
products, which stood at about 600 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the ITA, tarrifs on some 200 information technology products
will be reduced to zero no later than January 1, 2000 in a four-stage
equal reduction of 25 percent per stage by July 1, 1997, January 1,
1998 and January 1, 1999.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa May Release Minor Convicts for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Department
of Correctional Services is considering setting free 45,000
convicts with minor offenses to relieve prison overcrowding, a
department official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The release of prisoners is one of several options being
considered, Correctional Services Commissioner Khulekani Sitole
told the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Other options include building more prisons, using prison
ships and extending correctional supervision sentences.
</P>
<P>
Instead of prison terms, 46,000 people are serving
correctional supervision, and this requires the services of only
1,100 staff members, said Sitole.
</P>
<P>
Sitole said his department is still looking for empty
buildings to house awaiting-trial prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Existing prisons can hold 98,000 prisoners, but there are
currently 137,000 inmates and it is estimated that the prison
population will grow to 158,000 by end of the year.
</P>
<P>
"Petty" criminals and certain categories of women and youths
would be released if the latest plan is implemented.
</P>
<P>
First-time offenders, excluding those serving sentences for
serious crimes or those serving long sentences, would also be
considered.
</P>
<P>
Sitole admitted that a mass release would be unpopular with
the public and create friction between his department and other
departments within the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
During the previous mass release in 1995, 15,000 were set free
but more than half of them were re-arrested soon afterwards for
new crimes.
</P>
<P>
Police trade unions have said officers on the beat would be up
in arms if petty criminals were put back on the streets.
</P>
<P>
Gerhard van der Merwe, national organizer for the South
African Police Union, said that the proposed mass release could
have a very demoralizing effect on policemen.
</P>
<P>
"Those people weren't sent to jail for nothing, and in many
cases, police have worked very hard to arrest these people," he
said.
</P>
<P>
While they may have been petty offenders when they went into
prison, they would probably be hardened criminals when they came
out, he added.
</P>
<P>
Professor Charles Cilliers with University of South Africa
penology department said mass releases were unacceptable to the
public.
</P>
<P>
"If we release prisoners for economic purposes, we are going
to fail. They must be ready to leave their cells and resume
normal life. It is not easy for them to adjust outside," said the
professor.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, Cambodia to Restore Full Diplomatic Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea and Cambodia signed
today an agreement to establish full diplomatic relations, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung said here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed between head of the South Korean
mission in Cambodia Park Kyung-tai and Cambodian Vice Foreign
Minister Uch Kiman in Phnom Penh, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The elevation of diplomatic relations with Cambodia will pave
the way for further deepening of bilateral ties, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
South Korea and Cambodia exchanged diplomatic missions in May
last year in a prelude to full diplomatic links.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the two sides signed agreements on
investment protection and on economic, scientific and
technological cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is the 183rd country with which South Korea maintains
full diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
South Korea normalized relations with Cambodia in 1970 but
withdrew its mission five years later when the Southeast Asian
country was liberated.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has maintained full diplomatic relations with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) since 1964.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, South Korea exported 32.2 million U.S. dollars worth
of goods to Cambodia while importing 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of last year, South Korea's investment in
Cambodia has amounted to 3.8 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> WB Urges Nigeria to Reform for Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has listed
conditions to be met by Nigeria for it to qualify for debt relief
from creditor countries, urging the Nigerian government to take
substantial reform measures.
</P>
<P>
The bank Wednesday advised Nigerians to check how far the
country has gone with the fundamental reforms which would qualify
it for debt reliefs, rather than asking how soon the country
would get such reliefs.
</P>
<P>
According to the finance ministry, Nigeria's total foreign
debt stock stood at 27.012 billion U.S. Dollars at the end of
June this year, compared with 28.06 billion dollars on December
31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, about 19 billion dollars is owned to different
countries, most of which are members of the Paris Club, said
World Bank representative to Nigeria Trevour Byer at a two-day
seminar organized by the Central Bank of Nigeria which ended in
the capital Abuja Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Attempts at getting reliefs from these creditor nations have
continued to falter, largely because certain reforms which were
supposed to be put in place by Nigeria were yet to be initiated.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the first formal step toward debt relief is a set of
measures that show the government as being serious about reforms,
the World Bank official said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there are two major constraints in Nigeria's
quest for substantial debt relief.
</P>
<P>
The hindrances are its status as a major oil producer and the
fact that its debt to export ratio is less than 350 percent (a
threshold for Paris Club debt relief).
</P>
<P>
About 67 percent of Nigeria's external indebtedness is to the
Paris Club, a group of 10 developed countries contributing a
6-billion-dollar fund for member nations of the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Citing a World Bank report on Nigeria, Byer called on the
government to promote economic reforms in a view of reducing
poverty, protecting environment and developing non-oil sectors so
as to be less dependent on oil.

<HEADLINE> Waigel Orders Second Spending Freeze in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
today ordered the second public spending freeze of the year so as to
ensure Germany meeting the budget deficit limit required for the 1999
membership of European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Since Friday, all new spending by federal ministries must be
approved by Waigel, a ministry spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
The first freeze came in last June when Waigel ordered that all
federal institutions should get the approval of the finance ministry
for any spending over one million marks (575,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said the goal of the new freeze "is to hold down
new credit required in 1997 amids expected further tax shortfalls."
</P>
<P>
Germany's next tax revenue estimate will be released on November 11
and observers expect a multi-billion mark shortfall resulted from slow
economic growth and a huge unemployment benefits bill.
</P>
<P>
In order to take part in the 1999 launch of the single European
currency, the euro, European Union countries are required to keep
budget deficit under 3 percent of Gross domestic Product in 1997 and
1998.
</P>
<P>
Germany is expected to just meet the deficit limit this year.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Normalization of Sino-Japanese Ties Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese officials
and economists gathered here today to mark the 25th anniversary of
the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The gathering, sponsored by the China Council for the Promotion
of International Trade (CCPIT) and Japan-China Economic
Association (JCEA), provided a venue for discussing issues
regarding Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese trade volume grew from one billion US dollars
in 1972 when the two nations normalized diplomatic ties to over 60
billion US dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japan is China's largest trade partner, with the latter being
the second largest trade partner of Japan. Japan also ranks as the
leading investing country in China, with total allocated
investments of over 15 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan has gradually shifted investments from China's coastal
areas to inland regions, and from labor-intensive projects to

<HEADLINE> Assailants in Cairo Bus Bomb Sentenced to Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian military court today
sentenced to death by hanging two Egyptians who attacked a tourist
bus in downtown Cairo on September 18, killing nine German
tourists, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The trial was conducted in the State Military court on the
northern outskirts of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Saber Mohamed Farahat and his brother Mahmoud Mohamed Farahat,
had pleaded guilty to killing the Germans and their Egyptian
driver in the firebomb and gun attack outside the Egyptian Museum,
which houses some of the world's greatest Pharaonic
treasures. Twenty-six other people were also wounded in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Saber, who had been reportedly committed to a mental asylum
after a deadly attack on foreigners in 1993, and his brother are
charged with premeditated murder and the use of violence to harm
the Egyptian economy.
</P>
<P>
The death sentence passed in military courts can only be
appealed to the president.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have maintained the attack was not linked to
Islamic militants, who have waged a violent campaign since 1992 to
topple the government and replace it with strict religious rule.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Hosts State Banquet for Chinese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today that China has, as a globally responsible nation, made
great contribution to the development of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the remarks in his toast at a White House banquet
in honor of visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin and attributed
this great development to the reform and opening up policies of
China in the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Chinese people are much closer to the people
of the rest of the world, with improved living standards, more
education and the raising of the country's international status.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also highly valued the contribution of the American
Chinese and overseas Chinese to American social progress.
</P>
<P>
The American people have learned a lot from the Chinese and
"China has enriched the American history," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the Sino-U.S. relations in the past 25 years as
having, on the whole, moved forward despite twists and turns, and
said that the bilateral cooperation, which has expanded in scope
and become increasingly diversified, promises a huge potential and
good prospect.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the agreement reached between himself and
President Clinton on the goal of the future development of
China-U.S. relations marks an important step forward and a new
beginning in the development of Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two countries should strengthen
cooperation and endeavor to build a constructive strategic
partnership oriented towards the 21st century with a view to
promoting the lofty cause of world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Owing to different national conditions, President Jiang said,
it is natural that the two countries may not see eye to eye with
each other.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the differences in national conditions can become
precisely the driving force for better mutual understanding,
increased exchanges and greater efforts to draw on each other's
experience, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for differences in views and positions, President Jiang
said, they can well be resolved gradually through dialogue on the
basis of mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
"What we have in common has outweighed what we differ," as the
two countries share broad common interests in, among others, the
maintenance of world peace and security, the promotion of global
economic growth and prosperity and the protection of the living
environment of mankind, he added.
</P>
<P>
"But to act, that each to-morrow, Finds us farther than
to-day," President Jiang ended his speech with the verses of
American poet Henry Longfellow. "Act-act in the living Present!"
</P>
<P>
"We should go along with the trend of the times and respond to
the will of the people, and continue our march forward towards the
establishment and development of a constructive strategic
partnership between our two countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Stock Market Has Bright Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The plummet of the Hong Kong
Stock Market over the past few days is in no way indicative of the
economic and financial situation in either the region or inland
areas of China, but is instead the result of outside influences.
</P>
<P>
The said influences are simply a temporary phenomenon, and the
market will undoubtedly rebound, according to Xiao Zhuoji, a
professor at Beijing University,
</P>
<P>
Prof. Xiao made the remarks on Tuesday during an exclusive
interview with reporters from Xinhua News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The market enjoys brilliant prospects based on the region's
economic growth, close economic links to China's inland areas and
the performance of listed companies, including H shares companies
in Hong Kong, according to Xiao.
</P>
<P>
The market recorded sharp fluctuations in the week beginning
October 20. Hong Kong shares crashed with the benchmark Hang Seng
Index losing 1,438.31 points, or 13.7 percent, to close at
9,059.89 on Monday, the biggest point loss in its history. The
Hang Seng Index rocketed 1,705 points, or a record daily rise of
18.8 percent, on Tuesday to recoup devastating losses.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said the fluctuations are an inevitable phenomena on stock
markets. However, he noted the recent major fluctuation was both
abnormal and irrational.
</P>
<P>
Xiao cited a number of examples to support his viewpoint. He
said the Hong Kong economy has witnessed rising momentum since the
region returned to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Hong Kong enjoys active
foreign trade and reexports, and holds foreign exchange reserves
of 80 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said there was no reason for the nose dive on the stock
market, a barometer of economic development.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, a region with a complete financial supervision
system, has the ability to effectively reduce investment risks to
a minimum and to protect the interests of investors.
</P>
<P>
Xiao stressed the close links between the economies in Hong
Kong and inland areas of China. He said both areas enjoy high
economic growth and low inflation, a fact which offers a favorable
environment for stocks and economic development in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With 130 billion US dollars on hand in August this year,
China is the world's second largest holder of foreign exchange
reserves after Japan.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said the Renminbi is convertible under current accounts,
and noted that all of the aforementioned factors will have an
important bearing on the stability and development of Hong Kong's
financial market.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Criticized for Opposing Dual Nationality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish community leader in
Germany has criticized German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for his
rejecting dual nationality for children born in Germany of foreign
parents, said press reports today.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely incomprehensible, that our chancellor, of all
people, should be so intensely against dual nationality. With his
statements Kohl reinforces prejudice against Turks living in
Germany," the daily Berliner Zeitung quoted chairman of Turkish
community in Germany Hakki Keskin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all of Germany's neighbors allowed dual
nationality.
</P>
<P>
Keskin said: "It is without doubt discrimination towards
Turkish children born here, many of whom speak German, if they are
treated as foreigners. That hampers integration."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, prominent German writer Guenther Grass,
author of the bestseller "The Tin Drum," demanded that Bonn
"finally give millions of Turks and Kurds in our country citizens'
rights" and warned of Germany's "latent racism."
</P>
<P>
More than two million ethnic Turks are living in Germany,
accounting for about 2.4 percent of the German population.

LONDON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Conservative Party was again split down the middle
Wednesday night when a frontbench spokesman quit over Tory leader
William Hague's new hardline policy. Ian Taylor, the shadow
Northern Ireland Secretary, resigned, telling Hague that his
decision to shun a single currency for 10 years had marginalized
the party.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Londoners will be asked a single question in next May's
referendum on reforming the capital's administration: "Are you in
favor of the government's proposals for a Greater London
Authority, made up of an elected mayor and a separately elected
assembly?"
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The biggest shake-up of Britain's voting system for nearly
70 years was unveiled by ministers Wednesday. The Government
published a Bill proposing that the next elections for the
European Parliament in 1999 should be held under a system of
proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's Secret Service MI5's policy of keeping personal
records on hundreds of thousands of individuals, including leading
politicians, is to be investigated by Parliament's Intelligence
Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Smokers are more pessimistic about the health risks they run
by lighting up and overestimate their risks of contracting lung
cancer or heart disease. They are also more likely to think they
could be run over or murdered compared with their non-smoking
peers.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Passes First Reading of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
has passed the first reading of the controversial 1998 budget by a
vote of 48-44, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
After all-day marathon meetings, the Knesset approved the
207.4 billion shekels (59.2 billion U.S. dollars) budget in the
first reading late Wednesday night, which includes 2.3 billion
shekels (0.6 billion dollars) in cuts on health, education and
defense.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to the Knesset plenum, Israeli Finance Minister
Yaacov Neeman said that he is open to adjusting the budget prior
to its second and third readings, scheduled in November and
December.
</P>
<P>
"The framework will remain, (but) the Treasury and I will be
open to hearing alternatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
Neeman denied making any compromises in order to convince the
coalition parties to vote for the budget in the first reading,
saying that "there is no pre-arranged agreement, not one that I
made and not one that was made behind my back."
</P>
<P>
But Knesset member Roman Bronfman of the coalition party
Yisrael Baaliya said that his party had received a promise from
Neeman that its requests for increased mortgage benefits and
housing subsidies for new immigrants will be discussed prior to the
second reading.
</P>
<P>
The United Torah Judaism Party, that had previously opposed the
budget, also said that it declared support in the vote because it
received a promise from Neeman to renegotiate child benefits, a
longer school day, and more money for the weaker segment of
society.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who was not satisfied
with the budget cuts on society welfare, did not attend the vote,
since any minister who votes against the budget must resign
according to Israeli Basic Law.

<HEADLINE> Gold Sales Contribute to Australia's Trade Surplus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The sale of 1.8 billion
Australian dollars (1.2 billion U.S. dollars) in gold reserves by
the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) since July helped boost
Australia to its highest annual trade surplus on record.
</P>
<P>
The final stage of the central bank's bullion sell-off
contributed to putting Australia's balance of goods and services
285 million U.S. dollars in the black in September, the sixth
successive monthly trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) survey reported a 63
million U.S. dollar improvement on the 222 million U.S. dollar
seasonally adjusted trade surplus recorded in August.
</P>
<P>
Exports of goods and services rose 1.3 percent, seasonally
adjusted, last month compared with August, largely reflecting the
210 million U.S. dollar gold sale.
</P>
<P>
An 0.4 percent rise in the value of imports during the month
partially offset the increase in exports.
</P>
<P>
During the 12 months to the end of September, Australia's trade
surplus built up to 2.6 billion U.S. dollars, the highest on
record.
</P>
<P>
Today's release of the trade figures coincided with the best
monthly skilled job vacancies result in nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Department of Employment, Education, Training
and Youth Affairs' skilled vacancy index rose 3.9 percent in
October for the fourth consecutive monthly increase.
</P>
<P>
After declining throughout most of 1996 and early 1997, the
index was now 14.2 percent higher than in October last year.
</P>
<P>
Treasurer Peter Costello said the sixth successive monthly
trade surplus and the best skilled job vacancies result in almost
three years signaled a strengthening economy.
</P>
<P>
"These are welcoming signs of a strengthening in relation to
the Australian domestic economy," he told the Australian
parliament today.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Ban Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
will soon ratify Convention Number 138 of the International Labor
Organization as a way of hastening child labor abolition in the
country, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
A. R. M. Rajabu, the Principal Secretary in the Ministry of
Labor and Youth Development, said the government's move is
prompted by its acknowledgement of the reality of the child labor
problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
He did not say when the ratifying exercise will be undertaken,
only saying it would be done in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The official was opening a round table meeting Wednesday on
Tanzania's sustainable action against child labor in Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The government has acknowledged that child labor program
interventions ought to be integrated into a national and
institutional policy framework in order to ensure sustainable
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The government is keen to work closely with all concerned
parties in order to achieve this," he said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that the government has a commitment to adopt
and implement national legislations and policies on child labor
in conformity with international standards.
</P>
<P>
According to Andrea Singh, the ILO country representative, the
ratifying of the convention would entail the country to pursue a
national policy designed to ensure the effective abolition of
child labor.
</P>
<P>
She said that it would also raise progressively the minimum
age for admission to employment for work to a level consistent
with the fullest physical and mental development of young
persons.
</P>
<P>
ILO Convention Number 138 was conceived in 1973 and so far 55
countries have ratified it.
</P>
<P>
Singh said as part of the ILO commitment to fight child labor,
the organization intends to take measure that will create
facilitation of elimination of child labor in the world.
</P>
<P>
The ILO's governing board has decided to discuss and probably
adopt at the international labor conference in 1998 and 1999 a
new convention to supplement Convention Number 138, she said.
</P>
<P>
The focus on the supplement would be placed on the most
intolerable forms of child labor.
</P>
<P>
These include children in forced labor, bonded labor,
commercial sexual exploitation of children and the use of
children in drug trafficking, she said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a comprehensive child labor report was launched at
the round table meeting on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Presenting major findings of the report, Hosea Rwegashora, a
consultant in social issues said research has shown that about
80-90 percent of the residents in various regions are not aware
of child labor.
</P>
<P>
He called for a rigorous exchange of child labor information
as well as community-based strategies to abolish the evil.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Denies Its Territorial Ambition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria harbors no territorial
ambitions or any hidden agenda against its neighbors, Foreign
Minister Tom Ikimi said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Nigeria was pre-occupied with peace and stability for
development and growth in the west African sub-region, he stated.
</P>
<P>
This stemmed from self-interest as well as the country's
concern and interest in the well-being of the countries in the
sub-region, Ikimi told members of the diplomatic corps in the
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Unless the interest was properly understood, some might wonder
at Nigeria's persistent involvement in crisis resolution and
management within the sub-region, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has played a leading role in peacekeeping missions in
Liberia and Sierra Leone, by contributing the majority of human,
financial and material resources in the operations.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional collective efforts have put an end to the
seven-year civil war and led to the establishment of an elected
government in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The efforts have also brought about the signing of an
agreement on the peaceful resolution of the crisis in Sierra
Leone triggered off by the May 25 coup that toppled the
legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed a week ago, the military junta in
the tiny west African country will hand over power to ousted
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa-EU Resumes Free Trade Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The long stalled Free
Trade Area (FTA) negotiations between South Africa and the
European Union (EU) resumed today in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
South African trade officials said the two sides would take a
significant step forward today when they tabled proposals on how
to cut import duties between them to zero by year 2011.
</P>
<P>
According to a report issued to the parliament by the Ministry
of Trade and Industry, South Africa will propose that 65 percent
of its imports from the EU will attract no import duties when the
FTA goes into effect in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The South African side will also propose that the rest will be
phased out by 2011,with special "product protocols" for sensitive
imports such as textiles, steel, beef, sugar and maize.
</P>
<P>
In return, South Africa will expect the EU to increase the
duty free imports it accepts from this country from the current
84 percent to 90 percent, by cutting its tariffs by six percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 16 percent of South African exports now excluded
from duty free access are "sensitive" agricultural products.
South Africa wants all these products to be duty free by 2011.
</P>
<P>
South African officials were confident about the chances of
their offer receiving a favorable reception when they briefed a
joint sitting of the parliamentary trade and foreign affairs
committee yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian King, FM on Sino-Norwegian Ties in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- King Harald V of Norway said
here today that his visit to China and its special administrative
region of Hong Kong will help foster greater understanding of what
the respective peoples have to offer each other.
</P>
<P>
The king made the remarks at a luncheon hosted in honor of the
Norwegian delegation headed by the king and queen, who are on a
visit to Hong Kong following an official visit to China's
mainland, by the Asia Society Hong Kong Center in association with
the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce and the Norwegian
Consulate General in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Asia Society Hong Kong Center is a branch office of Asia
Society, America's leading non-profit, non-governmental
organization dedicated to fostering better understanding about the
countries and cultures of the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the luncheon, the king said: "Only through a
continual process of exchanging ideas and gaining new knowledge
can we realize the potential which I am confident exists for
increased cooperation between Hong Kong and Norway."
</P>
<P>
The newly appointed Norwegian Foreign Minister, Knut Vollebaek,
who is accompanying the king and queen on the visit, made a
keynote speech at the luncheon, highlighting Norway's relations
with Europe as a non-EU member, its trans-Atlantic ties as well as
those spanning the northern border to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek particularly placed the focus on the Norwegian
government's Strategic Plan for Asia as well as Norway's long
tradition of maintaining many-faceted relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Vollebaek said that despite the recent economic setbacks, the
dynamism of the Asian economy is expected to continue and to be
strengthened into the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
"We are presently witnessing Hong Kong trying to combat
financial speculators -- the most recent onslaught in a series of
attacks against economies in the region and it is positive to see
that a number of respected analysts believe that Hong Kong will
manage to withstand this turbulence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Norway's trade with Asia has increased significantly over the
last few years, with its exports to South East and East Asia
growing more than 50 percent from 1993 to 1996, the foreign
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Norway's relations with China have developed
into a multi-faceted framework spanning far beyond exclusively
trade-related matters.
</P>
<P>
Like other foreign companies, the majority of Norwegian
companies here use Hong Kong as a bridgehead to China and to the
region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
However, that does not keep Hong Kong from constituting a
market in its own right for a number of Norwegian companies.
Norway's trade with Hong Kong is healthy and thriving, Vollebaek
said.
</P>
<P>
It has been heartening for observers all over the world to note
the peaceful process under which Hong Kong has been returned to
China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I know that, according to opinion polls, local residents and
foreign business leaders have expressed considerable optimism
about Hong Kong's future," he added.
</P>
<P>
"It is my hope that the latest development has not changed this
optimism. It is in the interests not only of China and Hong Kong,
but also of the international community as a whole, that this
optimism be preserved," the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian delegation arrived in Hong Kong, the last leg of
their state visit to China, Wednesday and will stay for three days
in the special administrative region.

CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar has

<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Qinghai
Province has pledged to enhance efforts to protect natural
resources and the ecology over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The province also plans to engage in the extensive development
of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Tian Chengping, a senior official of the province, stressed
that protecting resources is as important as resources development.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai in the north section of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
known as the Roof of the World, covers 720,000 sq km. It is
blessed with abundant natural resources, including water,
potassium, sodium, magnesium, oil and natural gas. In addition,
extensive reserves of gold, nonferrous metals, nonmetals, land and
tourism resources are ripe for development.
</P>
<P>
The province must implement a sustainable development strategy
and use resources in a moderate and reasonable manner in
accordance with the long-term interests of the nation, according
to Tian.
</P>
<P>
Environmental protection must be stressed, said Tian, adding
that further deterioration of the environment will eventually
hinder economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources noted that the province will establish four
nature protection centers to conduct scientific research of
ecological environment in the areas where the Yellow and Yangtze
rivers, China's two longest, rise.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Egypt in Drive to Develop Wind, Solar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- There is a growing trend in Egypt
to take full advantage of the blessing of abundant sunshine and
swift wind to diversify the country's energy source, said a top
energy official.
</P>
<P>
The development of the two energy resources will add to the
traditional and predominant power generation means through oil
and hydro resources in meeting an ever-increasing energy need,
which is growing at 12 to 14 percent yearly, said Minister of
Electricity and Energy Osman Abaza.
</P>
<P>
Telling foreign reporters at a press conference here Wednesday
evening, the minister expected the share of the solar and wind
energy in the total will increase to five percent by the year 2005
from the current one percent.
</P>
<P>
He boasted his country's perpetual brilliant sunshine and
powerful wind, saying the potential for exploration is vast.
</P>
<P>
Study showed good wind potential along the coasts of the
Mediterranean, the Red Sea, the Gulf of Suez, South Sinai and the
Oweinat oasis area in the Western Desert.
</P>
<P>
Investors, both public and private, are vying to inject money
in renewable energy, the minister said, pointing to a national map
to illustrate where giant windmills will be seen over the coming
decades.
</P>
<P>
Research on wind energy started in Egypt in the 1980s, followed
by the establishment of wind farms in such coastal cities as
Hurghada, Ras Ghareb and Zafarana, according to Abaza.
</P>
<P>
The biggest wind project aided by German-Danish expertise is
under construction in Zafarana, almost 200 kilometers south of
Cairo. It will turn out half of the country's non-traditionally
generated energy when it is completed at the start of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
Solar energy, less exploited than the wind, is now used in the
newly developed areas along the Red Sea, the northern coast and
the areas where electricity is unavailable, he said.
</P>
<P>
But studies have found that the total annual solar radiation
ranges from 1,800-2,500 kilowatts hour (kwh) per square meter,
making Egypt one of the most suitable areas in the world for the
exploitation of solar energy.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Egypt generated around 54.4 billion kwh of electricity
and consumed 45.6 billion kwh. By the year 2000, it is estimated,
Egypt will need 101 billion kwh annually.

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A new crisis has risen between the United States and Iraq,
after President Saddam Hussein defied Washington by rejecting the
new United Nations Security Council resolution hardening the
sanctions against Iraq and ordering the expulsion of all American
experts working for the United Nations commission in charge of
Iraqi disarmament (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
-- The Minister of Justice Elisabeth Guigou presented to the
council of ministers Wednesday her draft law on reform of France's
judicial system, in order to build an "independent and impartial"
law authority for the service of liberty and citizens. She also
vowed to give magistrates more independence and to better respect
the right of presumption of innocence.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations has suspended all cooperation with Iraq
over the disarmament of the country, after Baghdad announced the
expulsion of all Americans working in the U.N. commission in
charge of supervising disarmament in Iraq. The U.S. State
Department described the Iraqi decision as "unacceptable," while
the U.N. Security Council sent a severe message of warning to
Iraq Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
-- International stock markets remained jittery on Wednesday,
as the appeasement in European and Asian markets was followed by
uncertainty in New York, which evolved jaggedly before closing out
with a timid rise.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Collective Islamic Front Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi called on the Islamic countries to form a collective
Islamic front to confront Israel as a "common enemy," today's
local daily "Iran News" reported.
</P>
<P>
Making the call at a meeting with Arab ambassadors here
Wednesday, Kharrazi said under the current circumstances, Muslim
unity and a correct reading of Israel's regional political,
economic and military policies are essential.
</P>
<P>
Because of Israel's failure in imposing its policies on the
whole region, Kharrazi said, Tel Aviv, with the full support of
Washington, is now trying to divert the attention of the world
from this failure by portraying Iran as a threat to the regional
security.
</P>
<P>
He blasted the United States for its double-standard diplomatic
policies, saying that Washington remains silent to Israel's
armament expansion.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi noted that the present Middle East situation
necessitates Arab's unity and alertness against Israel, adding
that "Iran is confident (about that) its Arab friends are aware of
the character of the Israeli policies and its poisonous propaganda
warfare."
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) will adopt appropriate measures in the
forthcoming summit to be held in Tehran in December to cope with
the afflictions of the Muslim world.

<HEADLINE> Chinese TV Manufacturer Raises Production Capacity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Changhong Electronics
Group, China's leading color TV producer, has raised its annual
production capacity to 6.5 million sets, and currently ranks
seventh in terms of total output.
</P>
<P>
Changhong General Manager Ni Runfeng said the company's annual
production capacity will increase to 8.5 million sets when its
"Red Sun No.1" project in Mianyang is completed in 1998. He
added that the increase will make the company the world's fifth
largest TV producer.
</P>
<P>
Changhong, based in Sichuan Province, produced over 4.1 million
sets during the first eight months of this year, up 41 percent on
last year's same period.
</P>
<P>
Ni said projections call for the company's 1997 sales volume to
top 20 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 11 years, the company has raised its annual
production capacity by 17-fold and the value of its assets from 68
million yuan to 11.9 billion yuan. Its success is cited by Chinese
economists as "Asian Miracle".

<HEADLINE> China Boosting Development of Large Enterprise Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Large enterprise groups are
being boosted in China to compete with giant overseas
multinationals and to lead the country's economy into the next
century, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said last month.
</P>
<P>
The groups are considered to have strategic importance in
China's economic growth and reforms, and dominance in the nation's
key industries.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the state sector still accounts for nearly
one-third of the country's total gross domestic product (GDP)
after years of rapid expansion of private and foreign-funded
businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Relying on the market forces, China will establish highly
competitive large enterprise groups with trans-regional,
inter-trade, cross-ownership and trans-national operations,"
Jiang said in his report to the 15th Congress of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
In response to Jiang's remarks, government departments at all
levels have been urged to create favorable conditions for
developing the 120 pilot enterprise groups selected by the Chinese
government to step up the reforms of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
These big firms will play a leading role in some key industries
of the national economy and help upgrade the performance of the
state sector, economists said.
</P>
<P>
But economists warned that China needs to speed up the use of
modern techniques in these large enterprise groups, and to promote
development of the groups in structural readjustment.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the reforms is to have the enterprise groups
become independent economic entities in the market without
lifelong government guarantees, economists said, adding that it is
a very complicated process.
</P>
<P>
The enterprise groups should have a chance to dance according
to the tempo of the market after the separation of power among
different localities and government departments are completed,
they said.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises used to be affiliated with executive
government departments under the previous planned economy.
</P>
<P>
"Once the large enterprise groups become revitalized, the state
sector and the entire national economy will be of a great
promise," one senior Chinese official said.
</P>
<P>
But economists are not so optimistic, and suggest that the
pilot large enterprise groups also need to introduce advanced
technology and modern management as well as resettling laid-off
workers to keep the reforms going smoothly.

<HEADLINE> HIV Rate Down in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- HIV rate has declined for five
consecutive years, a recent study from sex transmitted disease
(std)/sex program indicated.
</P>
<P>
Infection rate among pregnant women in Kampala decreased from
15 percent in 1996 to 14 this year. The corresponding percentage
in Mbale in the east are 8.5 and 6.9. in 1992, the corresponding
percentages in Kampala is 30 and in Mbale is 15, The New Vision
said today.
</P>
<P>
Infection rates among pregnant women are approximate those of
sexually active adults.
</P>
<P>
Infection has fallen in almost all of the 20 monitoring
clinics around the country, although the exact data yet to be
collected, said Alex Opio, an epidemiologist for the hiv/aids
surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The decline of the rates are witnessed both in urban and rural
areas, especially among the people of the age group from 15 to
19, said Joshua Musinguzi, another epidemiologist. The decline
has occurred due to change of sex behaviour, he noted with a
warning: from the view of an epidemiologist, anything over 10
percent is still a high rate.
</P>
<P>
A national hiv/aids study in 1989 indicated a high level of
multiple partner sex activity and low level of use of condom as a
preventive measure against hiv infection. A survey in 1966 among
5,808 people in Kampala, eastern Jinja, Soroti and northern Lira
found a significant increase in abstinence and condom use. The
study by Opio and Musinguzi this year showed adolescents are
delaying their sex and adults reducing their number of sex
partners.

<HEADLINE> Mechanized Agriculture Popular in Vietnamese Mekong Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- With nearly 40,000 small and
large tractors, cultivation in Vietnam's Cuu Long (MeKong) Delta
is becoming mechanized rapidly, Vietnam's English daily "Vietnam
News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
With mechanized cultivation, farmers in Cuu Long Delta can now
harvest two or three rice crops annually instead of just one, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the achievements to the Vietnamese
government's policy of encouraging industrialization and
modernization of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Being the largest commodity grain production base in Vietnam,
the delta currently has 1.2 million hectares of machine-cultivated
land, accounting for 64.2 percent of the region's total arable
land.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the number of cows and buffaloes used in
cultivation has dropped sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Herds of buffaloes and cows stood at 329,000 and 270,000 in
1985, but they dropped to 147,000 and 155,200 respectively by
1994.
</P>
<P>
Farmers now breed cows and buffaloes in the region chiefly for
food, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The delta continues to mobilize more machinery for farming,
especially in the preparation period of land.
</P>
<P>
Mechanized cultivation has also emerged in northern Vietnam's
Song Hong (Red River) Delta and other localities across the
country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reiterates One China Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
reiterated Washington's "one China" policy at talks here today
with visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin in the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the U.S. would continue to stick to the principles
enshrined in the three U.S.-China joint communiques and would
neither support Taiwan's independence, nor its bid to enter the
United Nations, nor the proposal of "two Chinas" or "one China,
one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Jiang is on a nine-day state visit to the United States, the
first by a Chinese head of state in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taiwan issue has always been the most sensitive and
most important issue, and that strictly abiding by the three joint
communiques and properly handling the Taiwan question held key to
the healthy and steady development of Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed China's bid to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Also on trade, Clinton said his administration has been trying
to end the annual deliberation of China's Most-Favored-Nation
trading status by the Congress, which he believed would be
conducive to accelerating U.S.-China trade and economic relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said China is one of the biggest countries in the world
and has witnessed the most rapid economic growth, and the WTO
would become an ineffective trading organization without the
participation of China.
</P>
<P>
Clinton once again extended welcome to Jiang on his U.S. trip,
saying that he was happy to have the opportunity to meet President
Jiang in the White House. Jiang visited the White House Tuesday
night, shortly after his arrival from Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said the Chinese and the American peoples as well as the
whole international community have all given much heed to the
visit and the meeting between the two presidents, considering its
immediate and historic significance.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang, who had earlier visited Honolulu and
Williamsburg before arriving here, will also visit Philadelphia,
New York, Boston and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the current visit would be conducive to promoting
world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, the world is undergoing deep
vicissitudes and the pursuit of peace, stability and cooperation
and the promotion of development have become an irresistable trend
of times, Jiang said. However, he added, there are many
instabilities and uncertainties in international relations.
</P>
<P>
China, as the biggest developing country, and the United
States, the world's most developed country, both members of the
U.N. Security Council, share broad common interests in many
fields, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The fields include the maintenance of global and regional peace
and stability, promotion of global economic growth,
non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, Asia-Pacific
cooperation and the fight against international crimes.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also have common interests in economic and
trade cooperation, environmental protection, energy, education,
and scientific and cultural exchanges, he added.
</P>
<P>
Such cooperation is the common desire of the Chinese and
American peoples and all other peoples of the world devoted to
peace and development, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton echoed Jiang's view, expressing the hope that
the two countries would further strengthen cooperation in
maintaining peace, stability and security, U.N. affairs, major
regional issues and in environmental protection, the fight against
drugs, international crimes and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
He said the cooperation between the U.S. and China at the
U.N. is very important, and the two countries have had good
consultation and cooperation in many issues. He hoped such
cooperation would be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
China is playing a leading role in almost all major
international organizations, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang invited President Clinton to visit China next year, an
invitation Clinton accepted with pleasure. Clinton expressed the
hope that he would be able to make the trip to China early next
year.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, U.S. Vice-President Al Gore held a luncheon in
honor of President Jiang.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda Condemns Military Coup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Former president Kenneth Kaunda
has condemned the irresponsibility and the political immaturity
of those responsible for attempting to overthrow the government
by staging a coup, according to an independent newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
The Post quoted Kaunda's press assistant Muhabi Lungu as
saying in a statement issued on Tuesday night on behalf of the
former president that Kaunda, who leads the United National
Independence Party (UNIP), a main opposition party, always stands
firm in his resolve against violence.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to urge all Zambians to resist from any form of
political indiscipline as once this begins--it never ends,"
Lunggu said. "Dr. Kaunda, without any reservations, condemns the
irresponsibility and political immaturity of those responsible
for attempting to stage a coup d'etat."
</P>
<P>
Lungu, on behalf of Kaunda who is currently in South Africa to
attend the coronation of the king of Lesotho schedualed for
Friday, urged Zambians to condemn violence in all of its
manifestations.
</P>
<P>
It seems that the attempted coup could possibly have been
staged by the govenment in order to find an excuse to clamp down
on opposition activity, Lunga noted.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday morning, a military coup was staged by some army
soldiers in an attempt to topple the elected government led by
president Frederick Chiluba. The coupists once took the state
radio and declared they have taken over the government.
</P>
<P>
However, the coup was quickly foild by government forces and
most of the coupists including coup leaders captain Steven Lungu
Alias, captain Solo and captian Jack Chiti have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Following the short-lived coup, the opposition is alleged by
Richard Sakala, president Chiluba's public relations and press
assistant, to have connection with the coup.
</P>
<P>
Sakala's allegations is apparantly regarded as a response to a
report published by the Post on Monday, in which Kaunda warned
that there will be explosion soon unless there is genuine
dialogue between the ruling movement for multi-party democracy
and opposition parties over political differences.

<HEADLINE> FIS Head Threatens Olympic Pullout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The head of International Ski
Federation (FIS) Thursday threatened to pull skiing out of
February's Winter Olympics if organisers of the Games go ahead
with a plan to ban skiing above a disputed downhill run, according
to reports from Nagano.
</P>
<P>
"We may pull out of the Games and have no skiing at all, not
even jumping, not even cross country -- nothing," the FIS
President Marc Hodler said after arriving in Nagano for a meeting
of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) Coordination Council.
</P>
<P>
Hodler was reacting after the Nagano Organising Committee
(NAOC) told IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch it was working to
ban skiing in the national park above the downhill run as a way to
end the dispute with FIS over the starting height of the course.
</P>
<P>
"If they want to kill skiing in Nagano, we will go away,"
Hodler said.
</P>
<P>
FIS says the current downhill course is too short to be a true
Olympic test, while NAOC says raising the start would break
Japanese environmental laws by putting it into a national park,
even though recreational skiers already use the park.

<TEXT>
<P>
Johannesburg, October 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will invest
three billion Rand (625 million U.S. Dollars) to build a toll
road that will create a direct link between the Indian and
Atlantic oceans, local daily the Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The project, designed to cut driving distance between Gauteng
Province, South Africa and Walvis Bay, Namibia by up to 500 km,
will stimulate trading opportunities, Department of Transport
Toll Road Director Neil Tolmie was quoted as reporting.
</P>
<P>
The road to the east will link up with the Maputo Corridor,
and to the west with the Trans Kalakari Route through Botswana,
creating an international highway linking Maputo harbor and
Walvis Bay.
</P>
<P>
The highway is expected to stimulate agriculture,
manufacturing, mining and tourist opportunities in the area, and
to be a catalyst in creating new growth potential outside urban
centers, Tomie said.
</P>
<P>
Transport Minister Mac Maharaj had handed over the tender
documents to three companies for construction of the toll road,
Tolmie said.
</P>
<P>
Tenders for the highway are expected to be approved in May
next year, with work starting immediately. Construction is
expected to take between three and five years.

<HEADLINE> Qian: Jiang's Visit to U.S. Achieves Significant Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to the United States has achieved "significant
results," Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following the meeting between
Jiang and U.S. President Bill Clinton, Qian said that Jiang's
current visit "will be a complete success."
</P>
<P>
"Through this visit, both sides have affirmed that to develop a
normal stable and healthy relationship between the two countries
is not only in the fundamental interests of the two countries, but
also conducive to world peace and stability, " Qian said.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued earlier today said that the United
States and China agreed to build a "constructive strategic
partnership."
</P>
<P>
The partnership is "a very important outcome in the joint
statement," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. side proposed a strategic partnership, Qian said,
adding China suggested a constructive partnership and the two
sides have a long discussion on this issue. "So in the end, we
agreed on the building of a constructive strategic partnership."
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to set up "direct communication
links" between the two heads of state, between Beijing and
Washington, according to the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Qian noted that such a partnership is "a target" and
has not been a reality at this moment, adding such a relationship
does not necessarily mean the two countries are "100 percent good
friends and allies that are free from any contradictions."

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Extends Amnesty Deadline for Illegal Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- To the relief of tens of
thousands of illegal foreign workers, Bahrain has extended by one
month an amnesty for them to leave the country with a nominal fine.
</P>
<P>
Some 25,000 workers, mostly from South Asia, may now
voluntarily leave by November 30 instead of Friday after paying a
fine of some 26 U.S. dollars for every year spent on the island
illegally, Khaleej Times said.
</P>
<P>
After the amnesty period, illegal workers will face expulsion
and a fine of more than 750 dollars for every year spent in the
country illegally, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Bahrain government said earlier last week that 2,441
workers have already been deported in the past weeks, bringing
the number to 9,000 since the amnesty was issued three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of skilled Asian workers have been drawn
to Bahrain and other Gulf states by money and plenty of jobs in
constructions site, factories, restaurants and households during
the 1980s' oil boom.
</P>
<P>
The foreign labours are mostly from India, Pakistan,
Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Writer And Hunter (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Computers may have changed life
in many ways, but one writer in north China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region still turns to the nomads and primitive hunters
of north China for inspiration.
</P>
<P>
Ureltu's mind is still fixed on the hunting tribes that inhabit
the woods of the Greater hinggan Mountains. He lives in Hailar,
close to the tribal areas and his thoughts drift back to ancient
Mongolian epics as he works with his Acer laptop, his close
companion for six years.
</P>
<P>
He explains his interest in the people there as a spiritual
closeness to those, because he himself was an Ewenki hunter years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The 20,000 Ewenki live mostly in border areas of northeast and
northwest China, and even though the majority live outside the
forest area, some still wander about hunting the animals of the
primeval forests. One group of about 220 has interested Ureltu for
a long time. He first came to the tribe in 1968 as a 17-year-old,
and after four years of hunting along with them, he even became a
local official.
</P>
<P>
"The Ewenki hunters raise reindeers although they've almost
disappeared in other parts of China, and have a tradition of
hunting and fishing, and also believe in an ancient religion,"
Ureltu, says, "They preserve a unique culture, and I'm just a
fortunate passer-by who happened to pick up a colorful pebble by
accident."

<TEXT>
<P>
Ureltu said goodbye to his hunting rifle in 1976, and took up
describing the experiences of the tribesmen. Three short stories
about a hunter's life and the inner world of an Ewenki helped win
him national literary awards. And although he employs both Chinese
and modern foreign literary devices and modes of expression, he
remains rooted among those tribesmen.
</P>
<P>
"It is very interesting to keep the culture of the hunters
alive through literature," he says, claiming that he's still a
hunter.
</P>
<P>
But, the former hunters have seen modern civilization come in
with its tractors, TV sets, telephones, and refrigerators, and the
younger generation can even get an education even while staying at
home. The local government has built schools, hospitals, banks,
post offices, and entertainment centers near their settlements.
</P>
<P>
"Actually, the hunting culture is fading away," Ureltu says
ruefully, "Any traditional culture faces challenges from more
civilized culture. There is an unavoidable conflict between ethnic
tradition and modern lives."
</P>
<P>
He says that he hopes for a smooth transition and,
"Fortunately, the government has always recognized the importance
of preserving the unique hunting traditions."
</P>
<P>
Now, there's a folk and hunting museum with official backing,
costing about a million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars), and
Ureltu, a keeper of the Ewenki hunting tradition, is working on
the plot of another novel. He says he will continue pondering the
fate of those tribesmen.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major news
items in leading Nigerian newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Daily Times
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi declared Wednesday that Nigeria
had no intention to expand is territories and the country's
interests in the west African sub-region bordered on sustainable
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
-- A major shake-up involving redeployment of seven national
commissioners was effected Wednesday by the National Electoral
Commission of Nigeria as part of efforts to knit all the loose
ends before the impending elections.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian
</P>
<P>
-- The Central Bank of Nigeria formally admitted Wednesday its
inability to ascertain the exact value of the federal
government's indebtedness to local contractors, thus questioning
its own figure of 343.7 billion Naira (about 4.14 billion U.S.
Dollars) internal debts.
</P>
<P>
This Day
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi blamed Wednesday the British
government for masterminding a series of unwholesome acts that
led the Commonwealth heads of government meeting to endorse a
one-year extension of Nigeria's suspension as well as approve a
list of eight sanctions to be imposed on Nigeria if the
transition program fails in October next year.
</P>
<P>
-- A panel of inquiry has been set up by the Nigerian

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Development, China's Long-Term Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The role of agriculture as the
foundation of the national economy will be strengthened in China,
a country with a population of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
This is a long-term strategy which will be implemented
unswervingly.
</P>
<P>
Giving priority to agriculture is reflected in the planning of
a rational development pace for both the industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made to enhance macro-economic control,
readjust investment structure, optimize the distribution pattern
of national income and give due preferential treatment to
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China should avoid stagnant
agricultural development in the process of industrialization. On
the contrary, it should maintain a coordinated development between
industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To enhance its comprehensive capacity, the country will build
more water control projects, speed up transformation of farmland
with medium and low yields, encourage development of ecological
agriculture and promote the application of agro-technique.
</P>
<P>
Government at all levels will increase the amount of funds and
loans for agriculture and call on farmers to invest more in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas should take the road of comprehensive development
which includes agriculture, animal husbandry, fisheries and
related fields. In addition, agriculture should be combined with
industry and commerce. Only in this way, can farmers improve their
living standards and change the face of China.
</P>
<P>
Township-run enterprises, an important pillar of China's rural
economy, will enhance cooperation with their partners in various
forms or forge enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
The rural policy based on the household contract responsibility
system with remuneration linked with output will continue to be
implemented. A principal task in deepening the rural reform is to
build a service system for agriculture and to straighten out the
price and farm produce circulation systems.

enterprises with a value of 20.2 billion yuan in combined stock
capital.
</P>

performance. Profits of the surveyed companies grew 14.92 percent
last year, higher than the average of all enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Hebei Electrical Machinery, for example, reaped 23.8 million
yuan in profit last year, more than five times its 1992 figure,

COLOMBO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A local press on Thursday
reported that Susanthika Jayasinghe, the silver winner in the 200
meters at the World Athletic Championships in Athens, had revealed
she was married at the age of 17.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Jayasinghe said she got married three years ago
to a man named Dhammika Nanda Kumara. But the marriage was a
secrete one for fearing that her fans would scold her of being a
child bride.
</P>
<P>
But Jayasinghe had to come out with the marriage now to stem
the malicious rumours about her private life.
</P>
<P>
Jayasinghe is believed to be Sri Lanka's best hope for a medal
at the next Olympics. Sri Lanka's first and only Olympic medal
was in the athletics in London in 1948.
</P>
<P>
She said shortly after winning the medal that she could promise
her country that she would win gold in two year time at the next

<HEADLINE> Philippines Tightens Watch on Auto, Credit Card Loans </HEADLINE>

<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Board of the
Philippine Central Bank today decided to require all banks and
non-banks with the quasi-banking license to submit a quarterly
report on their auto loans and credit card loans.
</P>
<P>
The board decided to take this action as part of its ongoing
efforts to strengthen the banking system in a bid to prevent
financial woes like the current one sweeping Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Although the situation remains far from being critical, the
board nevertheless noted a trend increase in the past due auto
loans and the past due credit card loans between 1994 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
During the period under review, the past due auto loans and the
past due credit card loans rose to 0.49 percent and 0.21 percent
of the total bank loans from 0.33 percent and 0.02 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The two loans have a very small share in the total bank loans,
but the monetary authorities believe that by strengthening the
information base at this time, they would be able to quickly
respond to potential problems should it become necessary.

<HEADLINE> Free College Entry Makes Model Workers' Dream True </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Li Liancai, a 45-year-old
worker at the Benxi Iron and Steel Company, is now a college
student at Liaoning Workers' Movement Institute.
</P>
<P>
Li and his 17 classmates are a special group of students. They
are national model workers from such industries as automotive,
steel, transportation, textile and mining. College entrance is
free for these model workers and they are not required to take an
entrance examination.
</P>
<P>
"I never dreamed of becoming a college student," Li said, "I
just cannot believe this is happening.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not only the first college student in my family for
generations, but also the first worker in the city of Benxi to get
this chance," he said.
</P>
<P>
The State Education Commission's approval of the enrollment of
these 18 model workers is a first in new China's 48-year
history. Model workers in China previously had to pass the unified
national college entrance exam.
</P>
<P>
The model workers chosen for college are all from northeastern
China's Liaoning Province, an industrial center with 10 million
workers. Five of the workers are female, and all are 45 or younger.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government will finance the model workers
through the three-year college program, said Zhang Zhenxi,
vice-president of the Liaoning Provincial Federation of Trade
Unions.
</P>
<P>
"It is not enough to reward model workers with flowers and
honorable titles," Zhang said, "What is more important is to
create favorable conditions for them to further improve their
quality."

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Defends Tight Credit Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Central Bank Governor
Gabriel Singson today defended the tight credit policy, dismissing
allegations that the policy is a major contributory factor to
current high bank lending rates.
</P>
<P>
To prove his point, Singson said the interbank call rate has
been steadily dropping in recent days and stood at just 12.1
percent for transactions valued October 28.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he reported that just for today, banks were able to
lend to the Central Bank an amount substantially in excess of 10
billion pesos (285 million U.S. dollars), unequivocally showing
the banks have ample investable funds.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly there are other more relevant reasons than tight
liquidity as to why bank lending rates are currently very high.
This is what we are trying to understand in our ongoing dialogue
with the banks," he said.
</P>
<P>
He announced that the rediscount rate applicable for the month
of November will be 16.2 percent, or an increase of 2.25 percent
compared with the prevailing rate of 13.95 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new rate is one percent below the average 91-day Treasury
bill rate of 17.2 percent for the last auction date of this month
(October 27) as authorized by the Monetary Board, the
policy-making body of the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank also announced that the total rediscounting
availabilities of commercial, thrift and rural banks from January
2 to October 24 this year amounted to 7 billion pesos (200 million
U.S. dollars), of which 52.5 percent went to export financing, 46
percent to agricultural credits and 1.5 percent to commercial and
industrial credits.

United Arab Emirates, the Palestinian National Authority and Saudi

Qatar had to downgraded the conference from a summit to the

Qatar said that so far, more than 40 countries from Asia,
America and Europe have signed up their participation. Only a few
Arab countries have announced their attendance at the conference,
while most others said their decisions depend on development of
the Mideast peace process, which has been stalled due to Israel's
hard-line policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Gold prices declined to touch
a four-and-a-half-year low of 4,250 rupees (about 118.1 U.S.
dollars) and silver dropped steeply by 220 rupees (6.111 dollars)
per kilogram on the bullion market in Bombay, India, on Wednesday,
the local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The sharp fall in prices of both precious metals was the result
of the formal notification of new import policy by the Indian
government earlier this week to relax control over import of
precious metals.
</P>
<P>
Standard gold started weak at 4,280 rupees (about 118.9
dollars) and fell further to close at 4,250 rupees, displaying a
fall of 35 rupees (about 97.22 U.S. cents) over the last close of
4,285 rupees (119.0 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two-carat gold was nominally quoted weak at 3,930 rupees
(109.2 dollars) from 3,960 (110.0 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ten-tola gold of 0.999 purity dropped steeply by 400 rupees
(11.11 dollars) to fall below the 50,000 mark and closed at 49,700
rupees (1,380.6 dollars) against Tuesday's close of 50,100 rupees
(1,391.7 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ready silver of 0.999 fineness opened subdued and declined

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Hospital Removes Huge Tumor from Woman's Womb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Maternity Hospital
doctors have removed a large tumor from the womb of a 25-year-old
woman while preserving her child-bearing capacity.
</P>
<P>
Doctors took 80 minutes to remove the hysteromyoma which was
larger than the head of a newborn.
</P>
<P>
The tumor had been located at the isthmus of the patient's
uterus near the uterine artery, which compounded the operation's
difficulty. Because of the tumor's location near a blood vessel,
doctors feared complications from hemorrhaging.
</P>
<P>
Womb tumors are relatively common, but doctors so far have found
no effective remedy short of surgery.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 percent of women who undergo surgery for womb
tumors in the Shanghai Maternity Hospital retain their
child-bearing capacity, officials said.

LHASA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Qomolangma Peak Nature
Reserve in the Tibet Autonomous Region is the world's cleanest and
best-preserved area next to the north and south poles because of
China's environmental protection efforts, scientists said after a
recent research trip here.
</P>
<P>
The 30,000 square kilometer reserve, established in 1988, is
located in the northwestern part of the Himalayas. It includes the
world's highest mountain peak, the 8,848-meter Qomolangma
Peak. The reserve's unusual geological features have led to
extensive scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The region, regarded by scientists as a "Species' Gene
Storehouse," has 47 types of animals and plants under state-level
protection.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the reserve is to coordinate relationship between
the protection of the environment and the development of the
economy, said the reserve's director.
</P>
<P>
The primeval forest, bushes and grasslands in the reserve are
generally well-developed, however, the ecological system in the
peak area is very vulnerable, scientists said, adding that
inefficient production methods have added pressure to the
environment.

NANCHANG, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Zhong Guohui, a 5-year old boy
in eastern China's Jiangxi Province, has received free plastic
surgery for his cleft palate by Operation Smile International
(OSI).
</P>
<P>
Zhong lives in Ruijin City, one of the most impoverished areas
in China. His father, Zhong Xianyou, a farmer in suburban Ruijin,
said that the successful surgery has helped him "regain confidence
for his son's future."
</P>
<P>
From Oct. 21 to 29, 70 children including Zhong in Jiangxi have
received free plastic surgery from Operation Smile China Medical
Mission (OSCMM).
</P>
<P>
Half a month ago, 130 children suffering from cleft lips or
palates and facial burns have been operated on by OSCMM in eastern
China's Nanjing city, said Han Kan, leader of the medical team.
</P>
<P>
Han is one of the original sponsors of OSCMM. Han, who is a
plastic surgeon at Eastern Virginia Medical School, said that
about 2,000 Chinese children have been helped by OSI since 1991.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that, affected by our action, the whole society will
pay more attention to those in misery and do what we can for those
in need," said Han.
</P>
<P>
Sources say OSI was founded in 1982 in Virginia, a state in the
eastern United States. Every year skilled surgeons are selected
from volunteers to perform free surgery in under-developed
countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that missions carried out by OSI have provided
free medical services for more than 50,000 children in 17
countries.
</P>
<P>
"I want to do something for others as long as I live. This is
the meaning of life, and also what makes me feel happy," said

Dr. Nelson, 60, has been on several such medical missions, but
he still regrets not being able to do more. "What we can do is
always too little. There are many people who need our help but
have no access to."

<HEADLINE> Pig Market Becoming Saturated in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of
Agriculture has forecast a declining price for pork in the
domestic market and cautioned farmers about blindly buying piglets.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said pig farming has grown so rapidly since the
beginning of the year that the pork market has become
saturated. Profits reportedly were 150 yuan per pig during the
January-June period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China produced 19.83 million tons of pork
during the first half of the year, 6.7 percent more than the
corresponding period last year. The pig population grew at a
yearly rate of 3.2 percent to 442 million during this period.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry warned, an over-supply of pigs is looming
as farmers have driven up prices for piglets.
</P>
<P>
Corn production also decreased this year, resulting in higher
prices for one of the major sources of pig feed.

URUMQI, October 30 (Xinhua) -- People in mental institutions,
orphanages, and nursing homes in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous
Region are expected to move into better housing by the end of this
year, according to a regional government official.
</P>
<P>
Yin Mingkui, director of the Fund-Raising Committee of the
Regional Department of Civil Affairs, says that the committee has
raised 91.86 million yuan (11.7 million US dollars) through
lottery tickets since 1991, and has spent the money on 609 social
welfare projects.
</P>
<P>
Most buildings and facilities for these purposes in Xinjiang
were built or requisitioned in the 1950s or 1960s and are now
run-down.
</P>
<P>
So, in the early 1990s the regional government decided to
renovate its 34,000 square meters of old social welfare buildings
within a three-year period, and twenty-one key renovation projects
have been finished with the welfare funds raised during that
period.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Speaker Initiates Govt-Opposition Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Speaker Humayun Rasheed Chowdhury
has initiated a meeting of government and opposition leaders on
November 1, in a bid to break the political stalemate aroused by
the abstention from the parliament of the main opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The speaker on Wednesday took this personal initiative so that
"lively and constructive" discussion could take place on some
important issues including the formation of parliamentary
committees and other issues for smooth functioning of the ensuing
session.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the Speaker's office,
the Speaker had got positive response from all sides and he hoped
the opposition would return to the forthcoming parliament session,
scheduled to commence on November 2.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker's bid to resolve a staggering standoff between the
two sides came after an effort by the ruling Awami (people's)
League (AL) to woo the BNP back to parliament fell flat as the BNP
gave a cold shoulder to the government's latest overture.
</P>
<P>
The BNP leadership on Saturday turned down the AL's initial
offer made by Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Nasim for
discussion to remove the impasse.
</P>
<P>
They said congenial atmosphere for such talks was missing
following aggressive attitude of police towards BNP rallies and
processions in Dhaka city.
</P>
<P>
The BNP lawmakers staged a walkout on the first day of the
Autumn session of parliament on August 30, alleging that they were
not allowed to speak in the House.
</P>
<P>
Later, Deputy Leader of Opposition Badruddoza Chowdhury put
forward a 14-point charter of demands as precondition to their
return.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Formulates Plan for Prevention of AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has recently
formulated a five-year strategic plan for prevention and control
of STD (Sexually Transmitted Disease), HIV and AIDS, the national
news agency BSS reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This statement was made by Bangladesh Health and Family Welfare
Minister Salahuddin Yusuf while addressing Wednesday the 4th
International Congress on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific held in
Manila.
</P>
<P>
In mid 1980s when AIDS was gradually appearing in the South
East Asia, the National AIDS was constituted in Bangladesh in
1985, the minister said, adding that the Bangladeshi Government
then formed the National AIDS Committee with a commitment to
preventing and controlling HIV infection in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has recently formulated the policy on HIV/AIDS and
STD related issues, and it has already been endorsed by the
Cabinet on My 5," the minister said, "we are currently carrying
out some actions and working out a one-year plan supported by the
UNDP".
</P>
<P>
Through this project, Bangladesh has formulated a five-year
strategic plan for prevention and control of STD, HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Under this project, a number of preventive measures are being
carried out all over the country through 28 non-government
organizations, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
"Realizing the urgency of the situation, we will soon undertake
a safe blood transfusing project with the help of the UNDP," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the minister said, the Bangladesh Government with the
support from UNAIDS is now establishing a sentinel surveillance
system for HIV and other STDs. This system will assist in the
development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the
program.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has 83 reported cases of HIV so far, and ten of them
developed full-blown AIDS and six have died.

<HEADLINE> Multi Drug Resistant TB Found in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Multi drug resistant
tuberculosis (MDRTB) has been found in Nepal, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Of 787 Nepalese tuberculosis (TB) patients who were tested for
resistance to the drugs commonly used to treat TB, 78 had a form
of the disease which was resistant to at least one drug, and nine
had the MDRTB.
</P>
<P>
The test on 50,000 TB patients from 35 countries was jointly
conducted by the World Health Organization (WHO), the
International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases and the
Center for Disease Control and Prevention, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"Drug resistance is a man-made problem," said Dr. Dirgh Singh
Bam, Director of Nepal's National Tuberculosis Program.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria become resistant when health workers and doctors
fail to prescribe the correct medicines, in the right doses and
for a sufficient period of time, Dr. Bam explained.
</P>
<P>
But a solution has been found, he said, adding that the WHO is
promoting a TB control strategy known as Directly Observed
Treatment Short Course (DOTS).
</P>
<P>
By ensuring that patients complete a full course of correct
treatment, DOTS prevents the development of drug resistance, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The DOTS is being applied in 17 of the 75 districts in Nepal,
but the National Tuberculosis Program, encouraged by its positive
results, is to extend the method to other districts, said Dr. Bam.
</P>
<P>
Treating a patient with TB costs less than 1,500 rupees (about
26 U.S. dollars), while treating one with the MDRTB costs more
than 150,000 rupees (about 2600 dollars), he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's largest
maker of computer chips, is cutting its chip prices up to 40
percent beginning Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the company said that Intel's markdowns range
from 13 percent to 40 percent, with most at about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cuts, they said, will likely bring holiday cheer to
personal computer shoppers because PC manufacturers usually pass
the reductions to consumers.
</P>
<P>
This is the second major drop in the year following the 30-50
percent of reduction in the summer.
</P>
<P>
"Intel is completing the trend toward cheaper and cheaper
machines," said Linley Gwennap, editor in chief of the newsletter
Microprocessor Report.
</P>
<P>
Industrial sources believe that chip makers are now pressured
by reducing PC prices, with a number of manufacturers offering
computers for 1,000 U.S. dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, October 29 (Xinhua) -- A military exercise jointly held
by the Ukrainian Navy and the Russian Black Sea Fleet opened
today, marking a major step in normalizing their relationship.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, code-named Fairway of Peace-97, is a mock
peacekeeping operation, Ukrainian Deputy Defense Minister Ivan
Bizhan, who is in command of the war games, told a press
conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise is scheduled for two stages. The first focuses on
mustering naval forces and setting up communications between the
two navies.
</P>
<P>
In the second stage, Ukrainian and Russian ships will plough
out a security zone in the Black Sea, where warships will escort
refugee boats.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, the first between the two countries since Kiev
and Moscow struck a deal in May on how to divide the Soviet Black
Sea Fleet, involves 11 ships, six planes and two shore-based
missile battalions from Ukraine, and 19 vessels and nine aircraft
from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors will also each send more than 100 marines to
participate in the war games.
</P>
<P>
Moscow and Kiev decided to hold the exercise in August when
Ukraine and the United States were performing the Sea Breeze-97
naval maneuvers, which Moscow refused to attend even as an
observer.

</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index fell 721.78 points to close at
10,043.52 at the finish of the morning session.

After yesterday's sharp rise, short-term investors jumped in to
take profits as sentiment is still nervous, said brokers, while
the expiry of Hang Seng October index futures later today added
volatility to the market.
</P>
<P>
The overnight lower close for Hong Kong stocks in London also
dragged the index down, they said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Hang Seng Index rocketed 1,705.41 points or 18.82

The two presidents are prepared to take positive and effective
measures to expand China-U.S. trade and economic ties. As both
economies move into the 21st century, information technology will
be critical to spurring technological innovation and improving
productivity. In this regard, China indicated its intention to
participate as soon as possible in the Information Technology
Agreement. In addition, in the context of WTO negotiations, China
will continue to make further substantial tariff reduction. China
and the United States agree that China's full participation in the
multilateral trading system is in their mutual interest. To this
end, they agree to intensify negotiations on market access,
including tariffs, non-tariff measures, services, standards and
agriculture and on implementation of WTO principles so that China
can accede to the WTO on a commercially meaningful basis at the
earliest possible date.
</P>
<P>
Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation
</P>
<P>
China and the United States agree that it is in their mutual
interest to cooperate in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy. To

on the Prohibition of the Production of Fissile Materials Used in
Nuclear Weapons and Other Nuclear Explosives Devices.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States reiterate their commitment not to
provide any assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities and
nuclear explosion programs. China has placed controls on exports
of nuclear and dual-use materials and related technology and will
take further measures to strengthen dual-use export controls by
mid-1998. The United States will continue to enforce firm
controls on the export of nuclear and dual-use materials and
related technology. As original parties to the Chemical Weapons
Convention, China and the United States agree to cooperate in
implementing the Convention within a multilateral framework. Both
countries agree on the importance of government oversight of
chemical-related exports. China and the United States agree to
build on the 1994 Joint Statement on Missile
Nonproliferation. They reaffirm their respective commitments to
the guidelines and parameters of the Missile Technology Control
Regime (MTCR).

China and the United States both recognize the positive role of
the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and other international
human rights instruments in promoting human rights. They reiterate

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Debt Ceiling for 1998 at 6.5 Bln Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has set the country's
debt ceiling for fiscal 1998 at 6.5 billion U.S. dollars,
including 2.5 billion dollars from the World Bank and Asian
Development Bank, the Nation Newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted new Finance Minister Kosit Panpiamrat as
saying on Wednesday that for the public sector, borrowing by state
enterprises will be suspended to allow the government to borrow 2
billion U.S. dollars to ease the liquidity crunch in the export
sector.
</P>
<P>
He noted that boosting exports is to add more value to Thai
goods and to satisfy customers, adding that drastic restructuring
and entry into hi-technology industries will not work at this
stage, as the country needs to survive the current difficulties
before industries can mount longer-term plans.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand plans to open negotiations with creditors
for new terms and conditions on the country's massive
private-sector debts of nearly 90 billion dollars, almost half of
which are short-term loans, the Nation today quoted a source from
the Finance Ministry as saying.

Renegotiations on repayment terms would pave the way for better
solutions to the country's economic woes, which are marked by the

<HEADLINE> Thai Deputy PM Urges G-7 to Help Restore Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Virabongse Ramangkura has urged the United States and the Group of
Seven Industrial Nations (G-7) to help restore financial stability
in Thailand and the rest of Southeast Asia, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Virabongse, who oversees the International Monetary Fund's
(IMF) program for the rescue of Thailand's economy, said on
Wednesday that if economic problems in Asia are left unsolved,
countries in the region will lose purchasing power, adversely
affecting the economies of the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States and the Group of Seven Nations could
protect themselves from economic and financial problems by
changing their stance towards the economies of the region.
</P>
<P>
Without a change of stance, he noted, those problems would
"spill over to affect the United States and Europe, and again the
Asian region."
</P>
<P>
In the end, Virabongse said, the global economy would be
affected, "which would not benefit any country."
</P>
<P>
His call came one day after the Wall Street stock market
tumbled 550 points, its worst single-day point drop, as a result
of the Southeast Asian economic and financial problems. The sharp
decline also caused stock markets elsewhere to plunge.
</P>
<P>
"The United States may look at Asia as just a region which
exports products to the U.S. market. But in fact, this region is
also a big importer of American goods and services. And many
American products are expensive, such as machinery and new
technology," the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
If regional economies go down, the United States would suffer
the consequences, he warned.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the United States to support Japan's plan to set
up a financial mechanism, the so-called "monetary fund", which
would work in tandem with the IMF.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports China's Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a 95 million U.S. dollar loan to China for an
environmental protection project in northern coastal province of
Shandong.
</P>
<P>
The project includes environmental improvement and treatments
of air and water pollution caused by rapid industrial growth.
</P>
<P>
The project will help Shandong Province use coal more
efficiently, reduce sulfur dioxide discharge, and promote the
viability of heating options using advanced designs, computerized
technologies, and improved management.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the project's wastewater management component will
greatly improve rivers, underground reservoirs and coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
To assist the pollution prevention and control, the project
will provide a revolving sub-loan credit facility to help the
heavily-polluting small-and-medium-sized enterprises make
cost-effective investments for pollution abatement.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 217.8 million
dollars. Apart from the World Bank loan, the rest will be financed
by the local governments of Shandong and industrial enterprises.

</P>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States has agreed
to expand import quotas on textiles and garments for Thailand, the
Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
As requested by Thai exporters, the United States will expand
import quotas for Thai synthetic fibbers by more than 30 percent
to 2.2 million kilograms until next September 30, a source at the
Thai Commerce Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The quotas will be expanded by a further 6 percent from
October 1998 until September 30, 1999, and by the same percentage
from October 1999 to September 2000. After that the quotas will be
lifted.
</P>
<P>
The United States also agreed to lift quotas imposed on
Thailand's women jackets and bedding on December 31, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit Nimla-or, president of the Thai Garment
Manufacturers' Association, said Thailand's textile and garment
exports this year are likely to rise by 25-30 percent compared
with last year, due partly to the cheaper baht. This will exceed
the 17 percent growth rate forecast earlier.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows 13 Percent Californians Are Food-Insecure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 29 (Xinhua) -- As a result of the
disappearance of supermarkets from poor neighborhoods, more than 4
million Californians do not have access to nutritious foods, an
ongoing conference in San Francisco was told.
</P>
<P>
Studies presented at the conference by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) indicated that about 13 percent of California
residents, who are living in poor neighborhoods, have to rely on
low nutrition quality foods from corner stores because of the lack
of money and access to supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Fred Collignon, an urban planner at the University of
California at Berkeley, said those areas with poor access to
better food are usually very poor with concentration of single
mothers and poor transportation.
</P>
<P>
The only alternative for residents there is neighborhood stores
selling food as well as alcohol, tobacco or pornographic magazines
to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, there are 35 million food-insecure people in the
United States, another report released last week by Tufts University
said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, an expert panel of the American Institute of
Nutrition defined food insecurity as "whether the availability of
nutritionally adequate and safe foods or the ability to acquire
acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways is limited or
uncertain."
</P>
<P>
A Cornell study showed that food insecurity in the United
States has been "seriously understated" and food-insecure women
are potentially at greater risk of developing chronic diseases
such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and hypertension.
</P>
<P>
"While starvation does not occur in this country to the extent
that it still does in developing countries, food insecurity and
hunger certainly do," the study said.

<HEADLINE> People With HIV/AIDS Reaches 22.6 Million Globally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 22.6 million people
have been estimated to be living with HIV/AIDS around the world as
of December 1996, with 3.1 million of them believed to be newly
infected in 1996 alone.
</P>
<P>
Among the 22.6 million victims, 21.8 million were adults, 12.6
million male and 9.2 million female, while the remaining 800,000
were children, according to a U.N. report published today.
</P>
<P>
AIDS (acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome), caused by HIV
(human immuno-deficiency virus), is the late-stage HIV infection,
characterized by a severely weakened immune system.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3.1 million infected in 1996, 400,000 were children,
said the report released here Wednesday by the Joint U.N. Program
Against AIDS (UNAIDS) at the end of the 4th International Congress
on AIDS in Asia and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
During 1996, HIV/AIDS-associated illness claimed the lives of
1.5 million people, including 350,000 children.
</P>
<P>
By December 1996, more than 29.4 million people, 26.8 million
adults and 2.6 Million children, have been infected with HIV since
the start of the global epidemic in 1981, according to the UNAIDS
estimates.
</P>
<P>
During the past 17 years, more than 8.4 million AIDS cases were
believed to have occurred. But owing to under-recognition,
under-reporting and reporting delays, only 1.5 million cumulative
cases of AIDS have been officially reported to WHO by countries.
</P>
<P>
Of the 29.4 million HIV-infected persons, an estimated 5
million adults and 1.4 million children have died.
</P>
<P>
The report listed unprotected sexual intercourse,
mother-to-child transmission, injecting drug use and transfusion
of HIV-infected blood or blood products as the main modes of
transmission.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Sub-Saharan Africa has the largest
population of 14 million living with HIV/AIDS by the end of 1996,
followed by South Asia and South East Asia with a combined total
of 5.2 million infected.
</P>
<P>
AIDS was first recognized in 1981 among homosexual men in the
United States, and HIV was identified in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Stock Markets Turmoil Not to Affect Honduran Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The current serious plunge
in the stock markets around the world will not affect the Honduran
economy, an economic expert said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We definitively rule out the possibility of a currency setback
like the one occurred in Mexico in 1994," Guillermo Bueso,
economic adviser to President Carlos Roberto Reina, said.
</P>
<P>
Bueso believed that money going away from the struck markets
may go to the United States and then investors may look for
low-revenue bonds like the ones being offered by Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The recent fall in international stock exchanges, with losses
of 600 billion U.S. dollars, has affected many countries, because
the slide caused interests rate to bounce, which has halted
investment projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Bueso warned that the Central American exports may be
affected if international devaluations occur, which will lower
prices of exported goods of those countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of Tegucigalpa's Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Rigoberto Stefan said the international stock turmoil
will be reflected in Honduran stock exchanges and its currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Central American Bank for Economic Integration
President to Honduras, Andy Matuty, said that all evaluations of
the current situation are hypothesis because the problems still
need to be studied.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction in Wall Street will not generate a devaluation
of the exchange between the Honduran currency lempira and
U.S. dollar, because we have strong international monetary
reserves and good prospects for coffee and non-coffee exports,"
Matuty stressed.

in the country.
</P>
<P>
Official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar today quoted the
Health Ministry's announcement as saying that the listed brands of

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Marine industrial output value
in east China's Zhejiang province was 30.5 billion yuan (about 3.8
billion US dollars) in 1996, according to the provincial marine
bureau.
</P>
<P>
The province's marine industry has been developing at an annual
growth rate of 34 percent since 1993, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
This ranged from traditional undertakings like fishing, marine
transport, ship manufacturing, and salt to newer ones like
tourism, marine energy, and medicines.
</P>
<P>
The province produced three million tons of marine aquatic
products last year.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang has about four million tourists each year, and in
addition to improving the scenic areas of Putuo Mountain and the
Shengsi Islands, it looked for others.
</P>
<P>
Companies were set up to process aquatic products and exploit
marine biological resources.
</P>
<P>
The province has made chemicals, power, and exports its main
industrial focus. Ningbo, the province's most important port, has
spent six billion yuan on energy and raw materials projects over
the past five years.
</P>

BELGRADE, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The Constitutional Court of
the Montenegro Republic in Yugoslavia today turned down
allegations by President Momir Bulatovic that malpractices existed
in the second round of presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The court concluded after open debates that Bulatovic's five
allegations were "groundless" and "unrealistic," the Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Bulatovic, who is running for the presidency, said that there
were malpractices in the second round of the presidential
elections on October 19 in such constituencies as Podgorica,
Budva, Bar and Nikssich.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, supporters of Bulatovic staged a protest for several
days last week, accusing followers of Prime Minister Milo
Djukanovic, the other presidential candidate, of wooing votes
through cheating, and demanded for a re-run of elections.
</P>
<P>
According to result from the national election committee,
Djukanovic won the elections with 50.26 percent of the votes,
while Bulatovic gained 48.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
Djukanovic and Bulatovic, who ranked first and second in the
first round of elections on October 5, had to go run in the second
round since none of the eight candidates pulled over 50 percent of

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Strengthen Security of Colombo Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A special unit made of elite
security personnel will be set up shortly to respond to any
emergencies at the Colombo Port, well-informed sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made by Minister of Port Development,
Rehabilitation and Reconstruction M.H.M. Ashraff at a security
meeting held recently, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some high-level officials of the military, police and customs
also participated in the meeting to review the current security
arrangement in and around the Port.
</P>
<P>
Members of the special unit will be chosen from the existing
1,500-strong security service of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority
(SLPA), the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They will be trained by the armed forces and be equipped with
advanced weapons.
</P>
<P>
The move to strengthen security in the Colombo Port, which is
widely regarded as the nerve center of Sri Lanka's economy, came
after a massive explosion rocked the downtown business area a few
blocks away from the Port on October 15.
</P>
<P>
In the incident, a total of 18 people were killed and more than
100 were injured. Several landmark buildings were severely
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Security in Colombo has already been beefed up following the
attack, which was blamed on the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
The organization has been fighting for a separate state of their

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Airport Renovation Under Way in NZ Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Renovation of three
international airport terminals in New Zealand is in full swing to
cope with the increasing passenger numbers.
</P>
<P>
Tourists coming to New Zealand have been rising at an average
rate of 8 percent a year in the past few years, higher than the
world average yearly growth rate.
</P>
<P>
The massive expansion and redevelopment will ease congestion
and allow more efficient passenger procession.
</P>
<P>
Auckland airport, the prime gateway to New Zealand, handles 80
percent of all tourists either arriving in or leaving the country.
It will host the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit
and the American's Cup yacht competition in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The airport has just completed major renovations to the ground
floor of the Jean Batten International Terminal and is due to
complete its 170 million-NZ dollar (105 million U.S. dollars)
upgrade in December.
</P>
<P>
The expansion includes a new 255-meter-long glass wall along
the front of the terminal, enlarged customs area and a
5-meter-long, high tech video wall, which features flight
information, national and international news, sports and weather
information, as well as showing live footage of passengers exiting
the customs hall.
</P>
<P>
"The video wall is a state-of-art world first. We have other
overseas airports who are interested in following us," says
Auckland International Airport Chief Executive John Goulter.
</P>
<P>
The expansion and refurbishment has seen the ground floor
double in size, making it larger than the entire original terminal
opened in 1977.
</P>
<P>
The airport has also added a fully operational media center for
international and local TV, radio and print journalists to use. It
is particularly important for the media to cover the 1999 big
events and the Year 2000 celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 80 million NZ dollars (50 million U.S. dollars)
have been invested in Christchurch International Airport to expand
its international terminal. The 28,000 square meters of new floor
space will enlarge the building by two and a half times.
</P>
<P>
After nine months of construction, the new terminal is starting
to take shape. Some of the new facilities will be completed by the
end of this month, and the entire construction is scheduled to
complete by September 1998.
</P>
<P>
One of the features of the new departure lounge is a
7-meter-high, 150-meter-long glass wall, from which tourists can
enjoy a breathtaking view of the airfield and the farther Southern
Alps.
</P>
<P>
Wellington International Airport is also redeveloping its
terminal to enhance its user-friendliness and meet an increased
demand. The airport witnessed a growth of 40 percent in passenger
number in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
Both international and domestic departures will be processed in
the new building, instead of being handled separately as at
present. The new terminal will have 34 check-in counters compared
with 22 in the three existing terminals.
</P>
<P>
A two-story car park has already been built, as well as new
roads around the airport.
</P>
<P>
The 85-million-dollar (53 million U.S. dollars) project is due
to complete in mid-1999.

<HEADLINE> Birds, Fish Return To Northern Chinese Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The birds and fish had been gone
from the Huangqihai, a lake in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region for 25 years, but flocks of wild ducks, red geese, and gray
swans can be seen once again on the lake.
</P>
<P>
These dramatic changes on the 7,300-hectare lake are the
result of the Chinese government placing emphasis on environmental
protection, according to Sun Changliang, a local environmental
protection official.
</P>
<P>
Gong Fengsheng, who has been the head of an environmental
protection station on the lake for years, recalls that, before
1970, the lake was full of black carp and silver carp and produced
about 800 tons of fish annually. Some carp were so good they were
used for state banquets.
</P>
<P>
After 1970, however, large amounts of industrial and human waste
were dumped into the lake, paper factories were built around it,
and farmers over-fertilized their fields. By 1973, there were
practically no fish in the lake and the birds had gone away.
</P>
<P>
To save the lake, the government sent scientists to study it
after 1976 and attempted to raise fish, but without pollution
controls, fish breeding was impossible, Gong explains.
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1989, with the help of environmental experts, the
local government spent 3.5 million yuan (437,000 US dollars) on a
waste treatment plant. And, in 1993, two paper plants and a
fertilizer factory near the lake were shut down, and the use of
fertilizer was banned within 10 kilometers of the lake.
</P>
<P>
Gong says that, since 1995, fish have been found again in the
lake, and the government regulates fishing there.

<HEADLINE> Relics Found at Three Gorges Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Important archaeological finds
have been made in the Three Gorges reservoir area prior to the
scheduled damming of the Yangtze River, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The river is one of the cradles of China's ancient civilization
along with the Yellow River. It holds many of the keys to
understanding some historical and cultural phenomena that still
baffle Chinese archaeologists and researchers.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing river damming has attracted many archaeologists to
dig in the Three Gorges area.
</P>
<P>
In Badong County in Hubei province, 6 kilometers upstream of
the dam site, five universities from all over China have gathered
to rescue their finds.
</P>
<P>
In Badong alone, 195 cultural relics were recorded in a
comprehensive survey conducted from 1992 to 1995 covering all the
area to be submerged by the dam.
</P>
<P>
"But 77 of them will be below the water line when the river is
dammed on November 8," said Li Qingrong, curator of the Badong
Museum. The water level will be more than 105 meters above sea
level in Badong.
</P>
<P>
Even though not all the 77 relic sites will be submerged
immediately, they will be under constant threat from the rising
water during the second phase of the dam project, especially in
the flood season.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today warned Iraq of "serious consequences" over
its decision to expel the Americans inspectors of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) within a week.
</P>
<P>
In a formal statement, the 15-member council also condemned the
decision of the Iraqi government and urged Iraq to cooperate fully
in accordance with the relevant resolutions, without conditions or
restrictions, with the Special Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council made the response after Iraq's U.N.
Ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, handed it a letter this morning from
Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz. It said Iraq made its decision
to ban all Americans on the U.N. weapons inspectors' team from
Iraq's territory and demand they leave within a week.
</P>
<P>
The Council said it was determined to "ensure rapid and full
Iraqi compliance" with the U.N. relevant resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations also temporarily suspended weapons
inspection in Iraq following the Iraqi government's decision.
</P>
<P>
Ten Americans are among the UNSCOM inspectors in Iraq.
</P>

Under the U.N. resolutions, the sanctions against Iraq imposed
following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, can only be lifted when
the UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has complied in dismantling all its
weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Australia Aids Indonesia in Fighting Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Amid the spreading of hazardous
haze throughout Indonesia, Australia pledged to offer 360,000 U.S.
dollars in funds for new project to provide ground fire-fighting
training and equipment to the country's fire services.
</P>
<P>
The offer was forwarded by Australian Prime Minister John
Howard when he met Indonesian President Soeharto here Wednesday,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Howard arrived here for a two-day working visit to discuss
various issues related to the bilateral relations between
Indonesia and Australia, State Secretary Moerdiono said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also expressed the readiness to give
assistance to Indonesia under IMF framework to help the country
overcome the current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer
announced Wednesday the provision of some 300,000 U.S. dollars for
drought relief in the country's mosteast province Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
Australia also reportedly intends to provide 44 million U.S.
dollars for a human resource development project to fund a short
term training program over the period of five years.
</P>
<P>
In regards to the ongoing Southeast Asian currency crisis,
Howard told Soeharto of his belief that "the fundamentals of the
Indonesian economy were sound."
</P>
<P>
According to the Indonesian Forum for Environment, 1.714
million hectares of forests have been damaged by fires in a period
from April to September this year. The forest fires, which
occurred in Sumatra, Kalimantan, Java and Irian Jaya islands, have
caused a total loss of 3.15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the monetary crisis in Indonesia has brought the
decline of the value of rupiah by about 50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Singapore and Malaysia have pledged respectively to offer 10
billion and one billion U.S. dollars to Indonesia to cope with the
crisis. Japan also pledged to aid Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has been negotiating with
Indonesia for a long-tern loan to the country since October 10.

<HEADLINE> Improved Lights to Help Save Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The State is planning to give
more attention to quality supervision of the production of
energy-saving lights to ensure the full success of the country's
"green-lighting project."
</P>
<P>
The project, which has experienced steady progress since its
introduction last year, aims at saving energy and protecting the
environment through promoting the use of high-efficiency
energy-saving lights.
</P>
<P>
"The green-lighting project is of great significance for China
in helping enhance its drive to save energy and protect the
environment," said Li Rongrong, vice-minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
He noted that efforts to seek high quality lanterns should be
of top concern for the future production of energy-saving lamps
and the implementation of the energy and environment friendly
project.
</P>
<P>
In China, a country suffering from a serious shortage of
electrical resources, the production and use of energy-saving
lanterns only makes up 10 percent of the annual production, which
reached 4.5 billion lanterns last year, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The result of a recent inspection of the country's 133 major
producers of energy-saving lanterns indicated unsatisfactory
quality. Only 73.8 percent of the lantern samples met the
standard," said Xuan Xiang, an official in charge of quality
inspection with the State Bureau of Technical Supervision (SBTS).
</P>
<P>
The organization conducted the inspection with the China
National Council of Light Industry.
</P>
<P>
"Energy-saving lanterns and lamps are the basis for the
implementation of the green-lighting project and key to the
success of the project to some extent. But the current production
of energy-saving lights is still in disorder," said Li Zhonghai,
deputy director of SBTS.
</P>
<P>
"The State has approved two sets of standards for lantern
production which will become effective next May," Li said, adding
that another two sets are being drafted and a conformity committee
has been established to promote production of quality
energy-saving lamps.

<HEADLINE> Honduras, El Salvador To Sign Border Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Honduras and El Salvador
will sign a agreement to regulate the situation of 12,000
Salvadorans now living on what is designated as the Honduran side
of the border, Honduran Foreign Minister Delmer Urbizo Painting
said today.
</P>
<P>
The document is expected to be signed before November 30, the
date for presidential elections in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
Urbizo Painting said the agreement will clarify the situation
of people living in areas that were recovered by Honduras
following the findings over a territorial dispute by the
International Justice Court in The Hague, Holland on September 12,
1992.
</P>
<P>
At least 12,000 Salvadorans claim ownership of their lands in
the now Honduran zone. They argue that they have property rights
since their ancestors lived on the lands more than 100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran constitution prohibits foreigners owning lands
within 40 kilometers of its borders, and it does not permit dual
nationality.
</P>
<P>
The Honduran government said it will ask Salvadorans living in
the recovered lands to take Honduran nationality. It predicted
most Salvadorans in border areas would be willing to become
Hondurans by law.

<HEADLINE> Current Stock Markets Turmoil Not to Affect Honduran Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The current serious plunge
in the stock markets around the world will not affect the Honduran
economy, suggested an economic expert here today.
</P>
<P>
"We definitively rule out the possibility of a currency setback
like the one occurred in Mexico in 1994," Guillermo Bueso,
economic adviser to President Carlos Roberto Reina, said.
</P>
<P>
Bueso believed that money going away from the stock markets
may go to the United States and then investors may look for
low-revenue bonds like the ones being offered by Honduras.
</P>
<P>
The recent fall in international stock exchanges, with losses
of 600 billion U.S. dollars, has affected many countries, because
the slide caused interests rate to bounce, which has halted
investment projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Bueso warned that the Central American exports may be
affected if international devaluations occur, which will lower
prices of exported goods of those countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Chairman of Tegucigalpa's Chamber of Commerce and
Industry Rigoberto Stefan said the international stock turmoil
will be reflected in Honduran stock exchanges and its currency.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Central American Bank for Economic Integration
President to Honduras, Andy Matuty, said that all evaluations of
the current situation are hypothesis because the problems still
need to be studied.
</P>
<P>
"The reduction in Wall Street will not generate a devaluation
of the exchange between the Honduran currency lempira and the
U.S. dollar, because we have strong international monetary
reserves and good prospects for coffee and non-coffee exports,"
Matuty stressed.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Appeals Filipino Investors to Stay Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
has appealed to Filipino investors to stay calm despite the crash
of stock markets worldwide, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held on October 29, Ramos reiterated that
the country's macro-economic fundamentals remains strong.
</P>
<P>
"I wish to appeal to our people, particularly the investing
public, to remain calm and avoid overreaction in the light of the
ongoing turbulence in major financial and stock markets around the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that key economic indicators like the growth of
exports, the increase in remittances of Filipino overseas contract
workers and the narrowing of the current account deficit have
shielded the country from an economic downfall.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said the country's economy has slowed down in
the first half of the year. Being hit by the currency crisis in
the second half, the economy would further slide. The government
has lowered its target for the gross national product (GNP) to
6-6.5 percent from 7-8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos emphasised that the country's financial system
remains sound and it is "underscored by the high capitalization
ratio, the low past-due-loan portfolio, the avoidance of
overexposure to real estate and manageable foreign exchange
exposures".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the banking system is also stable because of
the Central Bank's enforcement of anticipatory regulations such as
curbs on real estate lending, foreign borrowings, tighter credit
monitoring and higher minimum capitalization requirements.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, the Philippines will proceed with its exit program
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as scheduled next month
with the signing into law of the third and last component of the
Comprehensive Tax Reform Program," he said.
</P>
<P>
The two chambers of Congress Monday night reached a compromise
on the third component of the tax reform program, paving the way
for the country's graduation from the IMF.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Williams team boss Frank Williams
said on Wednesday that he believed the steering column did not
break when Brazilian driver Ayrton Senna suffered a fatal crash
three years ago in the Italian Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
The Formula One chief told reporters after giving evidence to a
court in Imola where he faces manslaughter charges over Senna's
death in 1994 that what had happened during the accident might
never be known.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors allege the crash during the San Marino Grand Prix
was caused when Senna's steering column snapped after it had been
cut and re-welded at his request.
</P>
<P>
Williams responded by saying extensive tests were done
afterwards and the steering columns on other Williams cars were
"all okay".
</P>
<P>
The final session in the lengthy trial has been set for the end
of November with a verdict due in December.

GUANGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of China's
Guangdong province, has been making an effort to promote different
economies in both the state-owned and private sector.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, Guangzhou still had 110,000 state
enterprises with nearly 76 billion yuan in capital, and the
publically-owned economy still was the backbone of industrial
production, retail sales, and fixed asset investment, Deputy-mayor
Shen Bonian says.
</P>
<P>
These figures don't necessarily include the state's stock
shares or stake in co-operative companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
In China, the public economy mainly refers to state
enterprises, collective enterprises, and state-held stock or
co-operative companies.
</P>
<P>
However, the private sector and joint ventures have seen great
growth and their number had grown to more than 250,000, with a
hundred billion yuan in registered capital, by the end of 1996,
making it the most important economic growth area.

<HEADLINE> China to Rely on Domestic Oil Refineries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China expects to be
self-sufficient in supplying its oil needs by 2000, according to a
Chinese petroleum expert.
</P>
<P>
"We will rely on domestic refineries and will basically not buy
any refined oil from abroad except heavy oil," said Liu Wenlong, a
senior economist with the China Petrochemical Corp. (SINOPEC) at
an economic forum here.
</P>
<P>
With the expected increases in oil production, Liu said,
China's refineries will be able to handle future domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, SINOPEC had an annual refining capacity of
173 million tons of crude a year, 80 percent of the nation's total.
</P>
<P>
"If all the refineries can operate at 85 percent of capacity,
domestic demand for gasoline, kerosene, diesel and lubricating oil
will be more than adequately met," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Because of limits on technology and the supply of crude oil,
Liu said, the refineries currently operate at 70 percent of
capacity. To become self-sufficient, most refineries need to
update their equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
China plans to increase its crude oil refining capacity to 300
million tons annually by 2010 through renovation of existing
plants.
</P>
<P>
Some of China's biggest refineries include Zhenghai
Petrochemical Co. Ltd., Maoming Petrochemical Corp., Qilu
Petrochemical Corp. and Shanghai Gaoqiao Petrochemical Corp.
</P>
<P>
China has imported more than 10 million tons of refined oil
annually since 1993. Last year, imported oil products reached
15.82 million tons.

Overseas-funded firms have played an increasingly important role
in Tianjin's economy, with their respective industrial output,
profits and export volumes accounting for 43.2 percent, 71.4
percent and 51.9 percent of the city's total, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-funded enterprises employ 340,000 local residents,

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Not Afraid Of Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 30 (Xinhua) -- At a time when many Chinese
cities are plagued with increasing unemployment problems, Wenzhou,
in Zhejiang province, east China, has few people complaining about
being laid off or about having difficulty finding a job.
</P>
<P>
The city is a pioneer in China's market reforms and has become
known as the "capital of private economy" since 60 percent of its
factory workers who were laid off have joined a 300,000-strong
army of local businessmen.
</P>
<P>
"I'm jobless now," joked He Sufeng, director of Wenzhou's Labor
Bureau. Unlike her counterparts in other towns who are busy with
various problems and complaints caused by unemployment, this female
official is currently engaged in running the local labor market
and the labor information center.
</P>
<P>
According to He, the number of state-run enterprises has fallen
from 170 in the early '80s, to 120, and one-third of the people
working in state companies were laid off. But, unlike other cities,
Wenzhou does not have institutions like a 'reemployment agency',
she says, and all of those laid off can find a new job in the
local labor market.
</P>
<P>
Only a developed market could provide enough employment
opportunities like this, she notes, because, in addition to the
local workers, some 800,000 farmers from other places have come to
Wenzhou to work.
</P>
<P>
The small number of former factory workers who were laid off
but couldn't find jobs because of health or age problems, the
labor bureau provides unemployment funds and pensions, but
strangely enough, she says, few people have applied for financial
assistance.
</P>
<P>
"People in Wenzhou like to be independent and feel ashamed of
being dependent," explains Ma Yongzhen, who used to be the head of
a factory but who is now running a small outdoor noodle stall with
his wife who is also a former factory employee.

CANBERRA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Australia stood ready to pledge financial aid to Indonesia
to help restore confidence in the country's troubled economy,
Prime minister John Howard said yesterday as he emerged from two
hours of discussions with President Suharto in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Hada Comes from Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 30 (Xinhua) -- A folk song popular among
Tibetans provides new evidence that the hada, a piece of silk
traditionally given as a gift by the Tibetan and Mongol
nationalities, originated in central China during the Tang Dynasty
(618-907).
</P>
<P>
The song lyrics describe a kind of elegant hada, named Asi,
which came from the east and was woven by Chinese women, featuring
design of the Great Wall on the edges of the silk.
</P>
<P>
Arnan, a Tibetologist who has studied the region's customs for
years, said that hada, which has long been recognized as a
prominent symbol of the Tibetan nationality, and is now a common
article in Tibetan everyday life, has an indisputable connection
with central China.
</P>
<P>
Although the hada is popular in Tibet, Tibet is not the home of
silk. At markets in Lhasa, people can easily find hada which were
made in Beijing, Sichuan Province and Yunnan Province. Home-made
hada only accounted for a small proportion of the total made,
Arnan said.
</P>
<P>
Ancient China was famous for its silk. In those days, Chinese
had the custom of presenting a piece of silk as a greeting gift.
</P>
<P>
However, in ancient Tibet, people used sheep's wool to show
their respect to their friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
"Sheep's wool was available everywhere in Tibet," noted
Arnan. During festivals, he added, Tibetans used to stick one or
two pieces of sheep's wool on the food containers.
</P>
<P>
The popularity of the hada in Tibet began in the 13th century,
experts claim.
</P>
<P>
According to historical documents, in 1253, Tibetan Buddhist
leader Basba met in today's Gansu Province, northwest China, with
Kublai Khan, a Mongolian ruler who later founded the Yuan Dynasty
in 1271. In 1265 when Basba returned to Tibet, Kublai Khan gave
him many high-quality hada.
</P>
<P>
Basba later distributed the hada to the lamas in the temples
and local officials all over Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Ends Becker's Fourth Champion Dream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Pete Sampras of the United States
ousted German Boris Becker in three sets 7-6, 3-6, 6-3 in the
second round of the Paris Open tennis tournament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first two sets Becker played at a far higher level than
his current 38th place in the world rankings. He forced the world
number one to a tiebreak in the first set and took the second by a
trademark serve.
</P>
<P>
But the remarkable accuracy of Sampras' groundstroke put him
through to a third-round match against Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic, who beat Arnaud Clement of France 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
In another second round match Swede Magnus Gustafsson upset
second-seeded American Michael Chang, 6-3, 6-2. Chang's too many
unforced errors put him on the way of opening match loss of the
third consecutive tournament.
</P>
<P>
In other matches, Australian Pat Rafter rallied to beat Cedric
Pioline of France 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-3), 6-1 and fourth-seeded Greg
Rusedski of Britain downed Jan Siemerink of the Netherlands, 6-4,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
Rafter will meet Netherlands' Richard Krajicek who breezed
against Frenchman Fabrice Santoro 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Thomas Enqvist of Sweden, 15th seeded,
topped David Prinosil of Germany, 7-5, 6-1. Another French wild
card Guillaume Raoux topped 9th seed Marcelo Rios of Chile 7-6
(7-4), 3-6, 7-5.

Also, Todd Woodbridge of Australia eliminated sixth-seeded
Carlos Moya of Spain, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerating Reform of State Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 30 (Xinhua) -- China has strengthened efforts
to reform its state sector since the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) reaffirmed economic restructuring
and development strategies.
</P>
<P>
While a large number of state-owned enterprise, the lifeline of
the national economy, have achieved success in competition, many
others continue to face difficulties.
</P>
<P>
CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin told
delegates to the congress that promoting the reform of state-owned
enterprises is essential to establishing the socialist market
economic structure and consolidating the socialist system.
</P>
<P>
The reform of China's ailing state sector has created a modern
enterprise system characterized by "clearly defined ownership,
well defined power and responsibilities, the separation of
enterprises from administration, and scientific management".
</P>
<P>
Priority has been given to medium- and large-sized enterprises,
and diverse forms have been used to transform ownership
systems. The number of solely-funded state companies has been
reduced to a minimum, with related companies basically limited to
various key sectors and major projects vital for the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of state enterprises should be closely linked
to reorganization, transformation and management, and more freedom
should be granted to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The state sector currently accounts for the lion's share of
companies in the power generation, petroleum, natural gas, oil
refinery, metallurgy, communications, transportation and finance
industries.
</P>
<P>
China's 13,000 medium- to large-sized state enterprises
practicing independent accounting represent only 3.4 percent of
the total number of industrial businesses, but nonetheless
generate 66 percent of the country's profits
</P>
<P>
The State Council, China's highest administrative body, has
designated 1,000 large state enterprises for special efforts, with
plans calling for a number of the companies to enter the ranks of
the world's top 500 enterprise groups by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
Multiform measures for the reform of small state enterprises
include reorganization, acquisitions, leasing, contracted
management, stock issues and outright sales, with the number of
cooperative joint-stock companies on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Support for reform should go hand in hand with the state
sector, and special attention should be paid to establishing a
system for the management, supervision and operations of
state-owned assets. Related efforts should be placed on preserving
and increasing the value of state assets.
</P>
<P>
A sound social security system will be required to provide basic
guarantees for medicare, unemployment, old-age insurance and
social relief for China's 10 million low-income urbanites and 58
million poor people in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 million workers, or 73 percent of the total, have
purchased unemployment insurance, and over three million redundant
workers received relief funds in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A bottom-line system for living expenses has been introduced to
206 Chinese cities and 300 counties, and reform of the medicare
system reform has been tried out in 59 cities.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders have pledged to extricate most loss-making
state-owned enterprises from difficulties within three years, and
most enterprises will introduce the modern enterprise system by
the end of the century.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan to Purify Central China Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, October 30 (Xinhua) -- It is planned to build three
sewage treatment plants around Donghu Lake near Wuhan, capital of
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
World Bank loans of several hundred million yuan will fund the
projects to be constructed over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The lake, which covers 33 sq.km., is a famous scenic site in
Wuhan. The lake was crystal clear in the 1950s, but in recent
years has been subjected to serious pollution.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have attempted to control water contamination
by building water treatment facilities at 77 factories and 21
hospitals around the lake. They have also prohibited the
construction of new factories in the area.
</P>
<P>
Domestic sewage is currently the main source pollution in the
lake area, according to Wu Shirong, deputy-director of the Wuhan
Bureau of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
The one sewage plant in the lake area has a daily treatment
capacity of only 50,000 cu.m, and is unable to properly treat the
waste water created by some one million residents living around.
</P>
<P>
Completion of the three new sewage plants will raise the daily
capacity by 380,000 cu.m., according to Wu. "Our goal is to purify
the lake over the next five years."

today in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Both goals were scored in the first half. The tie will place
the Red Demons in a better position when the second leg plays in

The Belgians enjoyed home advantage as they won all but one of
their home games in the group seven of the European zone

Ireland was the first to get onto the scoreboard when defender
Denis Irwin scored a 25-meter freekick which beat Belgian
goalkeeper Filip de Wilde to his upper right-hand corner at the
ninth minute.
</P>
<P>
On the half-hour mark, Luc Nilis went it alone inside the Irish
box to score the equalizer. The Belgian striker dribbled past two
opposing guards before lobbing the ball into the far upper corner
of the goal.
</P>
<P>
The game ended up in another Irwin freekick in extra time. But
this time his shot from a similar spot 25 meters away went just
wild of the right post of the Belgian goal.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Russia managed a 1-1 draw with Italy amidst snowfall
in Moscow; Hungary suffered a stunning 7-1 home defeat to
Yugoslavia while Croatia entertained on home turf a 2-0 win over

<HEADLINE> Italy Grabs Precious away Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Italy grabbed a precious 1-1
draw in a heavy-snow Moscow with thanks to Christian Vieri's solo
effort in the 49th minute in a World Cup European Zone qualifying
play-off first leg match on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russia would have their defender Akhrik Tsveiba to blame, who
lost his footing and failed to cut out the pass from Demetrio
Albertini to Vieri four minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
The Athletic Madrid striker steered the ball past Benfica
goalkeeper Sergei Ovchinnikov to settle the Italian nerves.
</P>
<P>
However, the Italians only had their lead two minutes long when
Torpedo Moscow's 21-year-old winger Dmitry Kkokhlov outclassed the
Italian skipper Paolo Maldini to turn in a short cross that Sergie
Yuran netted for the equaliser.
</P>
<P>
The Russians failed to capitalised on the nasty weather which
saw the snow falling constantly for 90 minutes and turned the
Dynamo stadium pitch into all-white.
</P>
<P>
The return leg will be in two-week time in Naples on November
15.

<HEADLINE> Greece not to Raise Short-Term Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece would not raise
short-term interest rates to reduce pressure on the national
currency, drachma, which was hit mainly by speculators in London,
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas said today.
</P>
<P>
The Athens bourse's sharp fall today reflected a plunge in
stock markets abroad and did not signify flagging confidence in
the Greek economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that pressure on the drachma will be
short-lived as the Greek national currency enjoys confidence
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Greek equities came under heavy pressure today to end at their
lowest level since September 5 as the Athens general share index
closed at 1,604.98 points, losing 2.87 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, to keep the drachma steady against the Ecu, the
country's central bank, Bank of Greece, has since Monday
intervened the domestic foreign exchange market by spending around
1.5 billion Ecus (about 4.88 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> US Warns Iraq of Grave Consequences Over Banning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. State Department
said in a statement today that Iraq would bear "potentially grave
consequences" for its decision to ban Americans from U.N. weapon
inspection teams in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The State Department said U.S. officials were discussing the
Iraqi action with allies and with other members of the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said Iraq's ban was a
"blatant rejection" of Security Council calls for compliance with
its resolution.
</P>
<P>
He also said it was "an attack on the very fundamentals of the
U.N. system."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued hours after Iraq's Revolution Command
Council decided to ban Americans from U.N. weapon inspection teams
and gave them a week to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's U.N. Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon later formally notified
the Security Council of his government's decision by handing over
a letter from Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's permanent members -- China, Russia,
France, Britain and the United States -- will meet privately on
the issue later today.
</P>
<P>
Iraq took the decision after the Security Council adopted a
resolution -- with the abstention of Russia, France, China and
Egypt -- last week threatening a travel ban on Iraqi officials who
hindered the work of the U.N. weapon inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House rejected the Iraqi decision as
"unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
"Iraq cannot tell the U.N. who should participate in the
inspections team," White House spokeswoman Anne Luzzatto said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the Security Council will take firm action as
soon as possible against these unacceptable demands," she added.

China and the United States agree to regular visits by their
Presidents to each other's capitals.
</P>
<P>
They agree to a Beijing-Washington presidential communications
link to facilitate contact.
</P>
<P>
They also agree to regular exchanges of visits by cabinet and
sub-cabinet officials to consult on political, military, security
and arms control issues.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Environment Cooperation
</P>
<P>
China and the United States reaffirm the importance of
bilateral cooperation across the broad range of environmental
issues, as evidenced by the establishment of the China-U.S. Forum
on Environment and Development in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
They consider it a critical challenge to develop and
efficiently use energy sources, protect the global environment,
and promote environmentally sound growth and development.
Accordingly, they agree to strengthen their cooperation in energy
and environment through an initiative to accelerate clean energy
projects and the appropriate transfer of related technologies. The
principal areas of cooperation will be in clean energy, urban air
pollution control and rural electrification. This initiative also
will foster broader cooperation on global environment issues such
as climate change, desertification and bio-diversity. China's
State Planning Commission and the U.S. Energy Department have
signed the China-U.S. initiative on Energy and Environment
Cooperation to promote effective cooperation in these fields,
including the use of clear energy.

CAIRO, October 29 (Xinhua) -- Somali National Alliance leader
Hussein Farah Aideed said today that he will remain in Egypt till
a breakthrough is made regarding national reconciliation in
Somalia, the Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Aideed, Somali most powerful faction leader, said the Egyptian
government has invited Somali faction leaders to meet here in the
coming days to discuss means of realizing reconciliation under the
umbrella of the Cairo accord.
</P>
<P>
"We all like to give the opportunity to different parties, but
still no settlement would be accepted except on the basis of
Somalia's unity," Aideed said.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Egypt, Aideed and his archrival Ali Mahdi Mohamed,
leader of Somali Salvation Alliance, signed a reconciliation
agreement in Cairo on May 29 on holding peaceful talks to end the
six-year-old conflicts in Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Aideed will reportedly meet Mohamed this week to discuss ways
of solving their disputes.
</P>
<P>
Aideed appealed to Arab and African states, the United Nations
and other international organizations to make further efforts to
back Somalia as a whole and not a single group, noting that aid
should not be allocated to one group at the expense of others.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1991 ouster of the late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre,
Somalia has been fragmented into fiefdoms protected by faction
leaders, who continue to fight to expand their turfs despite peace
conferences.
</P>
<P>
The factional fighting, combined with a 1992 famine, has
claimed about 350,000 lives.
