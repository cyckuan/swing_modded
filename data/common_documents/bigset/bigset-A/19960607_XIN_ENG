<HEADLINE> China, Canada Ink Nuclear Cooperation Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China and Canada signed a protocol
for technical cooperation and exchange of information in nuclear
regulatory matters here today.
</P>
<P>
Huang Qitao, director general of China's National Nuclear
Safety Administration (NNSA), and Agnes Bishop, president of the
Atomic Energy Control Board (AECB) of Canada, put their signatures
on the agreement at the AECB's headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the AECB will provide for nuclear
regulatory training and assistance to the NNSA and to provide for
the exchange of personnel.
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement represents the tenth of its kind China has
ever forged with other countries. It is a follow-up to the
Agreement for Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy
between the two countries signed in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The protocol becomes all the more important since the two
countries have agreed to build Candu 6 nuclear reactors in China,
Huang said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the accord as "important," Bishop said the agreement
is going to "be where both share and learn from each other" in the
nuclear safety field.
</P>
<P>
It has also opened "a door for a greater and promising future"
of Sino-Canadian cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear
energy, added Chinese Ambassador to Canada Zhang Yijun, who
witnessed the signing.

<P>
BEIJING, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Four-time Olympic veteran Oscar
Schmidt hit a game-high 25 points to lead the Brazil national team
to a 88-76 win over its Chinese opponent at the opening day of the
Beijing International Basketball Challenge here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 38-year-old World and Olympic top scorer sank three
3-pointers to key a 15-4 run which helped the Brazilians cut a
20-8 slow start to 24-20 before rallying to build 49-45 lead at
the break.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilians used a breathless physical defense and poured in
13 unanswered points to jump to a 62-45 lead in five minutes into
the the second half. They also outrebounded the Chinese national
side 30-25.
</P>
<P>
"We made things work on our defense," said the Brazilian coach
Carlos Rodrigues at the post-game press conference. "My team is
well known for the offense but we improved our defensing skills a
lot against China tonight."
</P>
<P>
The Brazil's well known offense forced three Chinese stars to
foul out and their improved defense held opponents' shooting to a
disappointing 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
In their last meet, underdog China scored a surprising victory
of 97-93 over Brazil and finished an ever best eighth place at the
1994 world championships in Toronto of Canada.
</P>
<P>
Both Brazil and China have qualifyed for this summer's Atlanta
Olympic Games and they are playing this tournament as warm-up
games prior to the opening ceremony on July 19.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the afternoon, the Klim All-Stars U.S. Team beat a
555 Chinese union side 105-84. Marc Brown hit 20 points to lead
five former NBA and Americans collegiate players finishing in
doubles figures.

</P>
<P>
A provisional list of Olympic participants, released Thursday

</P>
<P>
The Olympic tennis competition, which runs from July 23 to
August 3, will lack such big names like Boris Becker and Michael
Stich.

<HEADLINE> Gasoline Prices Begin to Decline Across U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Gasoline prices in the U.S.,
which had increased quickly in the past several months, started
dropping recently at the pump stations, providing some relief for
U.S. consumers.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Energy Information Administration
(EIA), an agency of the U.S. Energy Department, the price for a
gallon of regular unleaded gasoline fell by about 2.3 cents from
May 17 to June 5, to a national average of 126.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
But the price drop varies considerably by regions. For example,
the average price in the East Coast regions has fallen only about
one cent, while it fell 3.5 cents in the West Coast regions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government analysts said that a buildup in conventional
gasoline supplies and declining crude oil prices are causing
prices to decline nationally.
</P>
<P>
They are expecting that the gasoline prices nationally will be
dropping much faster in the coming weeks because wholesale, spot
and future prices for gasoline have all plunged sharply.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report, the U.S. government said Wednesday that
U.S. firms are now free to buy crude oil that Iraq will be
permitted by the United Nations to sell over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices in the U.S. had increased sharply from February
to early May and pushed the consumer prices index in the first
four months this year to an annual rate of 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered on April 29 to sell about
12 million barrels of the nation's strategic oil reserves to
drive down the soaring gasoline prices.

<P>
DAMASCUS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
has extended invitations to King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz of Saudi
Arabia and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to hold the
mini-summit in Damascus Friday.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after Saudi Arabia denied that a
tripartite summit between King Fahd, Syrian President al-Assad and
Egyptian President Mubarak would be held in Riyadh Friday.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian official source has announced today that the
tripartite summit is scheduled to discuss the recommendations and
proposals submitted by the foreign ministers of the three
countries to their heads of states. They are related to the Arab
situation and the future of the peace process in light of the
latest developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers from the three countries held two
rounds of talks in Riyadh to work out the outlines and mechanisms
for future common Arab action and for strengthening the position
of Arab negotiators in view of the victory of right wing Likud
leader Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
The coming tripartite summit will be the latest of a flurry of
diplomatic activity aimed at coordinating Arab stances following
Netanyahu's election victory.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Postpones State Visit to Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela's
first state visit to Angola has been postponed, the South African
Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mandela was due to visit that country from June 11 to 13 at
the invitation of Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the President's Office in Cape Town,
Mandela demanded the visit be rescheduled and the Angolan
government was informed of the demand this morning.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo had been instructed by the
president to visit Angola on Monday to convey ''a personal
message'' to dos Santos, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana, Mandela
believed it would be inconsiderate to impose a state visit on his
Angolan counterpart, ''who was currently grappling with a transition
in government''.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said the president had also told dos Santos that he
would ''do all in his power to assist the peace process in Angola''.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, dos Santos dismissed his Prime Minister
Marcolinao Moco and suspended all foreign exchange operations in
response to the country's deep economic and social crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also appointed Fernando Franca van Dunem, President of the
National Assembly, as the new prime minister and gave him five days
to form a new government. enditem

<HEADLINE> Barkley Might Not Be Back With Suns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Charles Barkley said if he plays
basketball next season, it likely won't be in Phoenix, a report
from Phoenix said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Barkley told NBC in a halftime interview during the first game
of the NBA Finals that More than likely he has played his last
game for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
"I feel like I have earned a certain amount of respect and I
don't like the way they (the Suns) are doing it," he said. "I feel
like I've given them 110 percent for four years. I don't look at
myself like a piece of meat."
</P>
<P>
The Suns acquired Barkley in a trade with Philadelphia four
seasons ago. He won the American National Basketball Association's
Most Valuable Player Award in 1993, when Phoenix lost to Chicago
in the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
Barkley, who averaged 23.2 points and 11.6 rebounds in 71 games
last season, said he plans to continue playing basketball for
another year or two before retiring _ but only if the conditions
are right.
</P>
<P>
The Suns were 41-41 last season and then were eliminated in the
first round of the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: He Plans to Hold Peace Talks with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister-elect
Benjamin Netanyahu said today that he plans to hold peace
negotiations with Syria and to reduce tensions between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks to reporters during a visit to the
Haifa Municipality to thank the people of the city to vote for him
in the May 29 Israeli general elections.
</P>
<P>
He said he has new ideas to conduct peace talks with Syria and
to take steps to build mutual confidence, however, he refused to
go into any details.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian track, Netanyahu said his government will
enter permanent status talks in which Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) will clarify their positions.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was encouraged by what he called "the positive
reactions" he received from the Arab world following his victory
in the prime ministerial election.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, chairman of the Likud Party, defeated incumbent
Prime Minister Shimon Peres with a narrow lead of less than one
percent in last week's elections, and will become the first
directly elected Israeli premier.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after his victory, he received an invitation from
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to visit Cairo, capital of
Egypt after he forms his new government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, he also sent his top foreign policy aide
Dore Gold to Jordan to meet King Hussein, before Hussein, Mubarak
and PNA President Yasser Arafat met in Jordan's Red Sea resort of
Aqaba Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In his victory speech on Sunday, he said he was extending his
hand of conciliation to Arab leaders, calling on them to continue
to walk down the path of peace.
</P>
<P>
"We intend to further the process of dialogue with all of our
neighbors to reach a stable peace, a real peace, a peace with
security," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, it appears that Israel's Arab neighbors have been
concerned about Netanyahu's views on regional affairs and his hard
line policies which he had been stressing during his campaigns for
the elections.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad has
invited Egyptian President Mubarak and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia
to meet in Damascus Friday to discuss the future of the Middle
East peace process in the wake of Netanyahu's election victory.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- ValuJet Inc., a small domestic
airline runner which has suffered from a crash of one of its
planes last month that killed 110 people, said its planes flew
almost half empty in May.
</P>
<P>
The low-fare, no-frills airline reported that its load factor
-- or percentage of seats sold -- was 52.7 percent last month,
down from 71.5 percent for May 1995, according to the Investor's
Business Daily today. In April, ValuJet's load factor was 61.8
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The traffic rebuilding will be slow and arduous," said Samuel
Buttrick, an analyst at PaineWebber, a noted investment and
research company.
</P>
<P>
In May, ValuJet's passenger transport fell 7.4 percent to
378,600 from 409,130, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The plane crash of the Atlanta-based airline in May reignited
the nation-wide concern about the safety of small and medium-sized
airlines, who are competing for bigger market share by cutting air
fares. The crash has also brought losses to other similar
companies as more passengers are walking away from them.
</P>
<P>
People are paying greater attention to their safety record
and ages of the planes in service. And share prices of ValuJet
declined remarkably on Wall Street.

<HEADLINE> Press Freedom in HK Will Be Guaranteed: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Freedom of the press in Hong Kong
will be guaranteed by law after its return to Chinese rule in July
1997, a Chinese senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law on Hong Kong guarantees freedom of the press,
speech, assembly, association and religion," Lu Ping, director of
the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office under China's State
Council, told a press conference in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
But he said Beijing will not allow any actions that aim to
overthrow the Chinese government or to divide China.
</P>
<P>
Lu is on a week-long visit to Japan through Saturday at the
invitation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The purpose of his
trip is to explain China's policy on Hong Kong to Japanese
political and business leaders.
</P>
<P>
He criticized biased reports by some overseas news
organizations, saying, "if you want to quote me, please quote all
I have said instead of just some words or half a sentence."
</P>
<P>
Asked about democracy in Hong Kong, Lu said, "I believe July 1,
1997 will be the start of true democracy in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
During Britain's colonial rule of around 100 years, Hong Kong
has not enjoyed any form of real democracy because its governor is
appointed by the British Queen and its legislators are named by
the governor, he noted.
</P>
<P>
After the 1997 hand-over, all legislators and even the chief
secretary in Hong Kong will be elected, not appointed, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lu also expressed the hope that Beijing and London will
cooperate closely over Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese
sovereignty and urged foreign countries, especially Japan, to
continue investing in Hong Kong to keep it prosperous.

increase.
</P>
<P>
Nxumalo also stressed that an inquiry into the increase was to
be held and unless those responsible provided a satisfactory
explanation, they would face disciplinary action. enditem

<HEADLINE> Russia, Kenya to Boost Trade Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Russia will hold a trade exhibition
here in August to boost trade between the two countries, Russian
Ambassador Boris Maiorsk said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Maiorsk was speaking while meeting Nairobi
Provincial Commissioner Francis Lekolool.
</P>
<P>
The envoy said that the exhibition is aimed at increasing the
volume of trade between Russia and Kenya, which has gone down in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said the low trade between the two countries should be
reorganized by encouraging traders to make exchange visits and
stage trade exhibitions to promote their products.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Russia imports tea, coffee, sisal and others from
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Ambassador hailed the tempo of Kenya's economic
development and good infrastructure and an industrial area that is
ideal for industrial development through joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Russia gives Kenya 20 students scholarship every year and is
exploring possibilities of sending in doctors to ease local
shortages and starting a joint pharmaceutical plant in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
In reply, the Nairobi PC assured the Russian exhibitors a
peaceful stay in Nairobi, saying that the Kenyan government has
beefed up security in the city and its environs to contain the few
cases of thuggery.

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports Zimbabwe's Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain today pledged its continued
support for Zimbabwe's efforts to reform the economy and acquire
mainly white-owned commercial farms to resettle thousands of
landless peasants.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was given by visiting British Overseas
Development Minister Baroness Lynda Chalker after her talks with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Harare today.
</P>
<P>
She did not, however, say how much Londond was prepared to
provide for the reforms or the land acquisition program.
</P>
<P>
Chalker, who is also Minister of Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs, told journalists after a 90-minute meeting with Mugabe
that she was confident Zimbabwe could achieve real economic growth.
</P>
<P>
She said the British government would continue to discuss with
Zimbabwe the controversial land issue in the country with a view
to seeing how it could assist in redressing the land imbalances.
</P>
<P>
The Land Acquisition Act, enacted in 1992, provides for the
designation and compulsory acquisition of agricultural land for
resettlement of thousands of landless blacks.
</P>
<P>
On South Africa's relations with its neighbors, Chalker said:
"South Africa needs to work with its neighbors, otherwise there
will be no economic success. My government will do its best to
bring South Africa and Zimbabwe together," she said.

<HEADLINE> Namibia Calls for Help to AIDS Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Health and Social
Services Minister Nickey Iyambo has appealed for help to children
orphaned by AIDS, the South African Press Association reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Iyambo made the appeal in Windhoek on Wednesday at the
hand-over of a mobile clinic by the Norwegian embassy to the AIDS
Care Trust of the country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about children abandoned at a state hospital in
Windhoek after their mothers died from the diseases shortly after
giving birth, the minister said: "they are being cared for at the
hospital although they are not sick because their relatives do
not want them."
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial statistics, about 500 Namibians are
being infected with HIV that causes AIDS each day.
</P>
<P>
Iyambo said there are 20,177 reported cases of HIV infection
in the country, compared with only 1,000 three years ago.
</P>
<P>
"We must show these people love and encouragement so that they
feel they are not rejected by their fellow citizens," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Sam Nujoma also appealed to the nation not
to discriminate against AIDS sufferers and called on those
infected to come forward and warn others about the disease.
</P>
<P>
"The example set by some of our infected citizens is an act of
bravery," said the president.

<HEADLINE> Government Chooses Site for Third Paris Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paris, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The French government announced today
that Paris' third airport will be built at a site about 80
kilometers southwest of this capital.
</P>
<P>
The planned new airport, at Beauvilliers near the city of
Chartres, will supplement the existing facilities of
Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Orly.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Transport Minister Bernard Pons,
construction of the new facility is not expected to be completed
until the year 2015 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
Among other candidates, the chosen site would presumably cause
the least environmental and other problems.
</P>
<P>
About 50 million air passengers currently use the existing two
airports annually, making Paris the second largest hub in Europe
and the seventh in the world.
</P>
<P>
A Transport Ministry report issued in July said that the demand
would be between 76 and 96 million passengers by the year 2015,
and 90 to 124 million by 2030.
</P>
<P>
It warned that if without a new airport, Paris could lose the
additional passengers to other cities in Western Europe.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Devise Joint Defense Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 5 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany, both Europe's
powerhouses, today agreed to work out a joint strategic policy on
defense by this Autumn, in a bid to iron out their differences
over the issue.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac and Chancellor Helmut Kohl made the
decision at the 67th Franco-German summit held today in Dijon,
eastern France.
</P>
<P>
The joint framework for defense will set out their common
strategic interests as a basis for future cooperation, said a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Both Chirac and Kohl agreed that the two countries should
review their armament cooperation and military integration,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
They did not give details of the common strategic policy to
reporters. Kohl said that it needs "discussions."
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the two leaders will sign a final
document on military strategy, armed forces and armament policy at
their next summit scheduled in December.
</P>
<P>
Chirac told reporters that they had no "misunderstandings" that
were caused by the radical reforms on French defense policy he
declared in February, shifting to an all-professional army,
scrapping conscription and cutting the military budget.
</P>
<P>
France has announced it will give up developing a type of
military air-freighter worth 4.5 to 7 billion francs (about 0.9 to
1.4 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Germany, who had feared that Paris' defense reforms will do
harm to some jointly developed weapon systems, has agreed with
Chirac's move in the development of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, French Defense Minister Charles Millon and
his German counterpart Volker Ruehe signed an agreement,
instructing a Franco-German working group to examine the 27
existing joint armament programs.
</P>
<P>
Bonn has reiterated that Germany will press ahead with a
military intelligence satellite system to be jointly built with
France.
</P>
<P>
On the nuclear issue, Kohl said Germany has no intention to get
nuclear weapons through France.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. software makers are making a
big contribution to the economy, and they're out to make some
noise about it.
</P>
<P>
From 1987 through 1994, the industry grew by 117 percent, while
the rest of the economy grew 17 percent, according to a recent
report of the Business Software Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The industry's revenue reached 74 billion U.S. dollars, the
Washington-based trade group said.
</P>
<P>
Employment also climbed remarkably. American software companies
now employ well over half a million people. From 1992 to 1994
alone, employment rose 9 percent a year, much faster than the
average pace of the nation.
</P>
<P>
And American software publishers dominate their field. U.S.
firms now make three-quarters of the world's software. Nine of the
top 10 firms are American.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has launched a campaign
against HIV and AIDS which are spreading in the southeast Asian
country with a population of 72 million, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet issued a decree calling for
sharpening the awareness of the human immuniodeficiency virus
(HIV) that causes the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
among the people, especially youth.
</P>
<P>
Official figures showed 3,854 people, including 80 foreigners,
had been diagnosed as HIV positive in the country's 39 provinces
and cities by June 1.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, the Ministry of Public Health will provide
HIV carriers and AIDS sufferers with medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
The National Anti-AIDS Committee is required to formulate a
strategy, policies and plans for HIV and AIDS prevention and
elimination.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health will work out regulations on
epidemiology supervision, blood tests and transfusion, as well as
other medical services.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the World Health Organization in November
1995 said that about 1.2 million people had so far been registered
as AIDS patients in the world -- 442,000 in the United States,
419,000 in Africa and 24,000 in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The report said the number of AIDS cases was on the rise in

<HEADLINE> WWF Urges Effort to Save Marine Fishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF)
Thursday urged efforts to stop global overfishing in order to
reverse the crisis in marine fisheries and to restore abundant
seas.
</P>
<P>
It said it is planning to invest over 1 million dollars
annually to build the necessary political will globally to take
steps to save marine fishes, including halt to overfishing and
reduced use of destructive fishing practices.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) as reporting that 70 percent of the world's commercially
important marine fish stocks are either fully fished,
overexploited, depleted, or slowly recovering.
</P>
<P>
In addition, indiscriminate fishing practices kill and waste
fully one-third of world catch --between 18 and 40 million tons
of unwanted fish, seabirds, sea turtles, marine mammals and other
ocean life every year, threatening the marine biological diversity.
</P>
<P>
Overfishing has reduced spawning populations of many of the
large ocean-wandering predators such as tunas, swordfish, marlins
and sharks, by more than 80 percent in the past two decades, said
WWF, the formerly World Wildlife Fund based in Gland, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, staple species such as Atlantic cod and Atlantic
halibut have become commercially extinct. In 1993, the Canadian
cod fishery was shut down off the Grand Banks, resulting in the
losses of more than 40,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to WWF, about 1.2 million commercial vessels are
scouring the world's oceans today. Increasingly volatile "fish
wars" occurred due to disputes over the remnants of rapidly
declining stocks, the most notorious recently of them the
Canadian-Spanish "turbot war" in early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many fleets of developed countries are now plundering the
fishing grounds of developing countries after overfishing their
own waters. The European Union (EU) now gets more than 25 percent
of its catch from outside its home waters.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, EU spent more than one-third of its fisheries budget
to subsidize access to foreign fishing grounds. Globally, the
governments pay a total of 54 billion U.S. dollars a year in
subsidizing the 70 billion dollar-worth fishery industry.
</P>
<P>
WWF said fishing fleets should be cut to allow the recovery of
fish resources. The EU has about 40 percent more vessels than
necessary to catch fish on a sustainable basis, it added.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Attack Israel's Buffer Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, carried out today
operations inside the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" in
south Lebanon, drawing immediate counterattacks by Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
In a statement distributed here this afternoon, the Islamic
Resistance, the military wing of the Shiite Hezbollah, said that
one group of its fighters mounted a bomb attack at an Israeli
patrol comprising of two M113 armored vehicles this morning.
</P>
<P>
It said that the guerrillas detonated a "big mine" targeting
the patrol on the road between the villages of Al-Adiseh and Rub
Thalathin in the occupied border strip.
</P>
<P>
"All the Israeli soldiers in the patrol were killed and
wounded," said the Islamic Resistance, the main guerrilla force
engaged in the warfare in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, other Hezbollah guerrillas fired artilleries
at the Israeli post of Talleh Al-Aqaba.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance noted that some vehicles were parking
inside the post when the shelling started, which led to a serious
damage.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another group of the Hezbollah fighters launched an
attack at the Israeli position of Beit Yahoun with rockets and
machine guns, causing casualties and damages.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Radio confirmed the guerrilla attacks, but failed to
mention whether casualties were caused.
</P>
<P>
It accused Hezbollah of violating a cease-fire understanding
Israel reached with Lebanon on April 26, which ended a 16-day
Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The statement of the Islamic Resistance said that following
this morning's operations, Israeli helicopters hovered over Wadi
As-Selouki, tracing the guerrillas and firing intensive and
concentrated shots.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas "fired back with anti-air weapons and contained
the activities of the helicopters," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said that the Israeli
artillery shelled the vicinities of several villages opposite the
buffer zone, and the sporadic bombardments lasted until the
sunset.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-mediated cease-fire understanding in April bans
attacks at or from civilian areas, but it does not prohibit
Lebanese guerrillas from launching attacks at the Israeli
occupation forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
International efforts for the formation of a cease-fire
monitoring committee, provided for in the April understanding,
was cut off by the May 29 Israeli general elections.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks 43.6 Million Dollars in Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Thursday
appealed for over 43.6 million U.S. dollars in addressing the
humanitarian emergencies in the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) arising from the devastating floods last year.
</P>
<P>
The UN consolidated inter-agency appeal covers the period from
July 1 1996 to the end of March 1997, focusing on the three
priority sectors of food aid, the recovery of arable lands and
health.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 27 million dollars of the funds will address the food
crisis in the country, where flooding destroyed about 1.5 million
tons of grain harvest and stocks, and a shortfall of some 1.9
million tons of cereals is predicted by experts for the year
1996.
</P>
<P>
Some 10.3 million dollars are sought for the recovery of arable
lands in order to resume normal agricultural production and ease
the food shortages. Floods had damaged an estimated 360,000
hectares of arable lands in DPRK, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
It accounts for nearly 6 million dollars of the appealed money
to restore the DPRK's basic health services, which had been
severely disrupted by the floods.

<P>
NICOSIA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Spyros Kyprianou, former Cyprus
president and leader of the center-right Democratic Party (Diko),
was elected as the new president of the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He won the support of the ruling Democratic Rally Party (Disy)

and 26 against.
</P>
<P>
His opponent for the post, Socialist Edek Party leader Vassos

<HEADLINE> Swiss Banks Managed 2,340 Billion SFrs - Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A recent study showed that assets
managed by the banks in Switzerland totaled about 2,340 billion
Swiss francs (some 1,900 billion U.S. dollars) in 1994, local
press reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The study also noted that the assets management branch of Swiss
banking industry employed 50,000 out of the totled 140,000 bank
employees, providing more jobs than the watch-making and jewelery
industry.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted by the Basel-based Institute for Labour
Market and Industry Economics in order to assess the importance of
the assets management branch to the Swiss banking industry as well
as to the Swiss economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, it revealed, assets management accounted for about two
thirds of all Swiss banks' net profits, and for nearly a quarter
of the total export profits of Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland's three largest banks, namely the Union Bank,
Credit Suisse and Swiss Bank Corp., took the lion's share of all
the assets management business in 1994, followed by Swiss-based
foreign-controlled banks, trade banks and cantonal banks.
</P>
<P>
About 65 percent of the fortune managed by Swiss banks came
from private clients, and half of the total from foreign clients,
according to the study.

<P>
CAIRO, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Authority President
Yasser Arafat said today that the recent Cairo and Aqaba three-way
summits have provided a foundation for an enlarged Arab summit to
restore national unity, reconciliation and alliance, according to
reports reaching from Gaza.
</P>
<P>
At a session of the Palestinian legislative council in Gaza,
Arafat expressed the hope of convening an Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, King Hussein of Jordan, Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Arafat met in the Jordanian Red Sea resort of Aqaba to
coordinate their stance toward the Middle East peace process
following the right-wing Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu's victory
in the race for Israeli premiership.
</P>
<P>
The three Arab leaders also held a summit meeting in Cairo on
May 12.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said President Mubarak and King Hussein have expressed
their concern over the Palestinian, Syrian and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
The three tracks together will lead to a just, comprehensive
and lasting peace in the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Israeli Prime Minister-elect Netanyahu's reaction
to Arafat's statements concerning the establishment of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, Arafat said the
Palestinian stance vis-a-vis the holy city is clear -- "it is the
capital of our Palestinian independent state."
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Netanyahu said in a statement that he would not
agree to set up a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
capital.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Lashes Out at Racist Whites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today once again lashed out at racist white minorities, saying
they are ignoring an extended hand of friendship from the
government by holding to their discriminatory attitudes.
</P>
<P>
He said while the government had adopted the policy of
reconciliation with those who fought against the freedom of
blacks, the whites had never showed any remorse over their
colonial activities.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the burial of former freedom fighter
Stanford Tofa Shamu who died on June 2.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said while those who supported colonial rule had been
forgiven, they had not reciprocated but rather became more racial
in attitude.
</P>
<P>
"Racism in attitude and in its expression in economic and
other historical imbalances must go, and go now, now, now and
never to be found again," said Mugabe, adding only this could
lead to national oneness as both blacks and whites sought a
common destiny in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"The land they took from us by force, they refuse to give it
up," said Mugabe, referring to some white commercial farmers who
have challenged the government's compulsory acquisition of their
farms.
</P>
<P>
Through the Land Acquisition Act of 1992, the government has
given itself power to acquire land from some commercial farmers
so that it could be distributed to needy blacks.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe urged blacks and whites in the nation to come together
and ensure that racial division does not continue.

<HEADLINE> Energy Star Program Launched in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Energy Department and the
Environmental Protection Agency have jointly launched Energy Star
program to lower energy consumption, save money for consumers and
cut pollution, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, manufacturers of appliances and building
materials would be offered the right to use a government seal of
approval, the Energy Star, if their products meet federal
efficiency standards.
</P>
<P>
The program will focus on products used in buildings, which
account for one-third of the country's energy consumption and
two-thirds of its electricity use.
</P>
<P>
The logo, a green and blue globe, appears over the motto:
Saving the Earth. Saving Your Money.
</P>
<P>
"Within a year or two, the Energy Star label will be as
commonplace and sought-after as those other labels," said David
Nemtzow, the president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a
non-profit group that is working with the Federal agencies to
expand the Energy Star program beyond computers.
</P>
<P>
the agencies plan to begin the program in San Francisco, Tampa,
Milwakee and Washington and then have it spread nationwide.

<P>
NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Harnessing the sun and selling it
abroad, the u.s. solar industry is in export boom and u.s.-made
solar panels are becoming popular in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
New York Times Wednesday released a set of pictures which shows
a man from India in front of a solar-powered home, one of 50,000
to be converted; Tibetan herders using panels for electricity; and
in Somalia, a traveling medical clinic using solar energy to keep
vaccines cold in a refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
From India and Indonesia to Mexico and Brazil, solar panels
made in America are spouting on thousands of roof-tops, lighting
up jungles, deserts and other hard-to-wire areas of the developing
world that have never been connected to conventional power grids.
</P>
<P>
All this means big business for the companies that make solar
equipment in the United States. Statistics indicate that those
companies are taking in 300 million u.s. dollars, or 30 percent of
the worldwide market, making the United States the biggest center
of solar manufacturing in the world.
</P>

The u. s Energy Department predicts that global sales will jump
by 70 percent over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Iran Supports Oil Sales by Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government today once
again expressed its support for oil sales by Iraq at the OPEC's
ministerial meeting in Vienna, which started on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said: "Iraq should be
allowed to supply oil to the international market without
adversely affecting the market price."
</P>
<P>
"The situation would warrant cooperation among all OPEC
members," the Iranian oil minister was quoted by Iran's official
news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister also called on the member states of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to observe
their own assigned quotas in order to ensure a stable world market.
</P>
<P>
After months of negotiations, an agreement on limited sale of
Iraqi oil was signed by the Iraqi government and the United
Nations last month.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Iraq is allowed to export up to 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil for an initial six-month period to buy
food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that Iran, the second largest oil
exporting country in the world, supports Iraqi oil sales because
it maintains that the Iraqi oil sales would not affect its own oil
sales or cause reduction of Iran's oil revenues.
</P>
<P>
They said that the Iranian support for resumptions of Iraqi oil
sales might have positive impact upon the relations between
Tehran and Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Tehran holds that the resumption of Iraqi oil sales will help
the two neighboring countries thwart the dual-containment policy
by the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani has publicly expressed
sympathy with the oppressed people of Iraq without mentioning the
Iraqi government by name.
</P>
<P>
He said, "the situation of the Moslem people in Iraq is
completely undesirable. Although we believe that the international
regulations and resolutions should be implemented, yet attention
should be paid to saving the Iraqi nation from the present
condition and its plight."

<HEADLINE> Accelerated Reform Pace Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of a new indigenous
discount house today urged the Zambian government to take
decisive action to speed up economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In a statement critical of the government policies, the
Chairman of Kingdom Securities Holdings Ltd, Mandivamba Rukuni,
said the government should take measures to reduce spending,
reform the parastatal sector and liberalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said since 1991, when Zimbabwe introduced economic reforms,
the country had achieved considerable progress in the
deregulation of the domestic economy, liberalization of the trade
regime and the foreign exchange, improving the financial sector,
simplifying investment rules and procedures together with an
effective and tight monetary policy to restrain an inflationary
spiral.
</P>
<P>
"Sadly, these efforts, which in the process have cost some
250,000 jobs and several companies collapsing, have not been
satisfactory largely owing to the government not keeping on track
with its own budget consolidation and public sector reforms," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rukuni stressed the need for the government to accelerate the
pace of reform on fundamental strategies such as land reform,
tariff reform and reform on fiscal policy in order to achieve sound
economic growth.

Harrington said despite the fact that most people in the province
heavily depended on the exploitation of some renewable resources
such as fish, timber, cattle raising for their livelihood,
however, there was no co-oriented strategy in this domain to help
local communities and other resource users to adopt methods of
natural resource extraction which would allow for the
conservation as well as efficient utilization of the resources.
</P>

interventions to help the local communities exploit some

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Post-War Reconstruction Makes Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
KIGALI, June 5 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan national unity
government has made remarkable progress in promoting national
reconciliation and reconstruction since it came to power on July
19, 1994.
</P>
<P>
Former president Juvenal Habyarimana, a member of of the Hutu
ethnic majority, was killed in April 1994 when his plane was shot
down as it flew into Kigali. His death led to three months of
ethnic bloodletting, in which 500,000 people were killed and one
million displaced, before the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front
(RPF) seized power the following July.
</P>
<P>
Due to the catastrophe, the social order was destroyed, the
public activities disabled throughout the country, and its
national economy given a fatal strike.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, the newly-founded national unity
government, in which Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) plays a leading
role, was facing many a challenge to overcome in the small
mountainous country.
</P>
<P>
As soon as the new government was established, it embarked on
a reconstruction and development program and set out an overall
strategy to promote national unity and reconciliation, social
welfare and economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
To create and maintain peace and stability in the country, the
government has also taken some concrete measures, such as
suspension of political party's activities, rehabilitation and
strengthening judicial organizations, and proper settlement of
displaced people and returned refugees.
</P>
<P>
So far, government departments at all levels have been
re-established and strengthened. The state of security has been
greatly improved and peace basicly realized in the country,
although there are still some harassing and wrecking activities
conducted in the western area by former government armed elements
who infiltrated from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The comparative stability in the country has created good
conditions for returning of refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, since the end of the civil
war and genocide, 1.8 million Rwandese refugees have returned
home from neighboring Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
With assistance from U.N. and international organizations, the
government has established some refugee transit camps along
border areas and built houses, drinking water facilities, schools
and health centers in planned settlement areas.
</P>
<P>
In return, the proper settlement of displaced people and
refugees has played a positive role for social stability in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the economy, which was in ruins two years ago, now
has been recovering.
</P>
<P>
A senior official in the Planning Ministry said that Gross
Domestic Product in 1995 increased by 25 percent in comparison
with that of 1994, and reached 60 percent of that of 1990 when
the civil war first broke out.
</P>
<P>
Last year the agricultural production rose to 60 to 80 percent
of pre-war rates. Food production was recorded at 3.1 million
tonnes last year as against 5 million tonnes in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In the industrial sector, 54 of the total 88 enterprise
factories in the country have been re-operated, production of
which achieved 75 percent of the pre-war level.
</P>
<P>
Since last October, exchange rates of the Rwanda Franc against
foreign currencies have been stable, with the soaring trend of
the prices controlled and the annual inflation rate stablized at
about 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
The government has also attached much importance to
rehabilitation of basic infrastructure and social welfare
projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the Minister for Rehabilitation and Social
Integration Patrick Mazimhaka, all major roads and communications
in the country have been restored, and electricity and water
supplies are now available in all 13 urban centers and in 80
percent of rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The health sector is also recovering after the devastation of
the war and genocide. In 1994, there were 284 health centers in
the country, most of them were damaged, but two years later, 270
are now back in operation and 29 out of its 33 hospitals are
functioning again.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the determined effort and co-operation between
the government and the international community, schools now
function in all areas of the country and more than one million
Rwandan children attended school in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Achievements scored in the post-war reconstruction, of course,
have further consolidated political power of the new government.
</P>
<P>
However, it should be noted that such reconstruction and
rehabilitation in full scale is still facing a lot of
difficulties, such as lack of funds, technicians and skilled
manpower and harassing and subversion activities conducted by
former government armed elements in the western areas.
</P>
<P>
There is a lot to be done to realize final national
reconciliation, because about 1.5 million refugees are still in
neighboring countries, majority of whom are Hutus.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Prime Minister on Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Pei Shanqin)
</P>
<P>
KIGALI, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The foreign policy of the Rwandan
national unity government is door-open and friendly to all
peace-loving countries, especially to those which helped Rwandan
people during the civil war and their struggle agaisnt genocide.
</P>
<P>
The statements were made by Rwandan Prime Minister Pierre
Celestin Rwigyema here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told Xinhua that since the new government
was established on July 19, 1994, Rwanda has made a success on
the diplomatic front, with assistance from the international
community in its post-war reconstruction and rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Rwigema said that the number of diplomatic missions based in
Kigali is now increasing.
</P>
<P>
On ties between Rwanda and neighboring countries, the prime
minister said that Rwanda is practicing a good-neighborliness
policy, stressing that Rwanda wants to be a good friend to all
neighboring countries so as to have a good regional environment
for the post-war reconstruction of the country.
</P>
<P>
With Burundi, he said, there is no problem. Burundi is now
experiencing a difficult time of some internal problems. "Our
wishes are to see the international community to help the
Burundian people to avoid the tragedy occurred in Rwanda," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Rwanda and Tanzania, Rwigema said, the
relations between the two countries are good.
</P>
<P>
He said that the relations were strengthened after recent
visits to Tanzania by Rwandan foreign minister and himself. The
Tanzanian government has promised to co-operate with Rwanda to
help solving difficulties in road transportation and
communications it faces at present.
</P>
<P>
Rwigema said that Tanzania would also help repatriating
Rwandan refugees. Some Rwandan ministers will visit Rwandan
refugee camps in North-Western Tanzania to explain the government
policy, peaceful situation in the country and needs for their
returning back home for the post-war reconstruction, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that more and more refugees will come back
home.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, Uganda, as Tanzania, is a good friend
of Rwanda. "The relations between Rwanda and Uganda are
excellent," he said.
</P>
<P>
On relations between Rwanda and Zaire, Rwigema said, the
relations are "not so good, nor bad" , because there is some
misunderstandings about the Rwandan properties or equipments
looted to Zaire by the former Rwandan government and army, and a
large number of the former government officials and military
officers are genocide authors.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed the hope that one day the problem of
misunderstanding will be solved through friendly discussions
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I have invited my Zairean counterpart to visit Rwanda, and
even the Zairean prime minister himself has expressed his hope to
come to Rwanda last month when he visited Burundi," he added.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Homes Destroyed in Alaska Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The fire started over the weekend in the Big Lake areas, some
60 miles north of Anchorage, and as many as a third of the 2,000
homes in the area were damaged or destroyed, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Plumes of flame shot 200 feet high and the forest was shrouded
in thick smoke that drifted down to Anchorage, where officials
have issued an air quality alert.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the advancing blaze of the fire forced the state
Department of Corrections to evacuate the 74 inmates of the Point
MacKenzie prison farm and troops have closed periodically the
Parks Highway, the only highway between Anchorage and Fairbanks.
</P>
<P>
On the Alaska Railroad, southbound trains out of Fairbanks were
halted because the fire burned right up to the tracks.
</P>
<P>
Fanned by strong wind, the fire continued growing Thursday and
some 1,100 firefighters from other states were due to arrive
Thursday afternoon to reinforce the 500 crews, who have battled the
blaze for up to five days.
</P>
<P>
Airplanes and helicopters dropped water and fire retardant, but
the chemical has not been effective on the burning moss on the
forest floor.
</P>
<P>
With rain not expected before Sunday, there was no end in sight
to the blaze. Fire officials said more homes could be lost if the
fire jumps eastward across the Parks Highway and makes the 10-mile
trip to Wasilla, a town of 4,800.

<HEADLINE> 30-Year Mortgage Rates in U.S. Hit 13-Month High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-year, fixed-rate
mortgages in U.S. averaged 8.30 percent this week, the highest in
more than a year, according to a national survey released today by
the U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
They were up from 8.03 percent last week and the highest since
the average was 8.37 percent during the week ended April 13, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rates had been below 8 percent in the country for the first
three months of this year and dropped to 6.94 percent on February
15, the lowest point this year. But they remain around 8 percent
in the recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said recently that the higher long-term rate would
weaken the housing market.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 5.86 percent, up from 5.76 percent last
week.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian company Anzoil has
found a huge potential gas field in northern Vietnam's Red River
Delta.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam News reported today that the gas field's reserve is
estimated at more than 900 billion cubic feet. It is located in
Thai Binh province, 93 killometres southeast of Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
Test drilling began just three months ago in line with the
first product sharing contract between the National Oil and Gas
Corporation Petro Vietnam and a foreign partner, Anzoil (Asia) of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam News said northern Vietnam is to enter a new era of
cheaper and cleaner energy following an independent evaluation of
the 'commercially significant' gas find last week.
</P>
<P>
According to an Anzoil press release, the gas well has
completed production testing with early indications that the gas
find could be in excess of eight million cubic feet per day.
</P>
<P>
Anzoil has been examining the commercial options for gas
development, the Vietnam news said, adding that it could support a
world-scale power plant, a world-scale methanol export plant or
several other viable commercial possibilities.

CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo University Antiquities and

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Warns Against Use of Force by Liberians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- West Africa's sub-regional grouping,
ECOWAS, announced here today that it would not back any Liberian
government that comes into office through the use of force.
</P>
<P>
In a press release reaching here today, the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS) said any such act is in violation
of the peace accord signed in Abuja, capital of Nigeria last
August.
</P>
<P>
The proposed general elections on August 20 this year must be
held as scheduled, the release said, calling for the cooperation
of the factional leaders and people in liberia.
</P>
<P>
The west African heads of state have agreed that there is a
need to reinforce the regional peacepeeping forces, the ECOMOG,
in a bid to enhance its role in the west African country torn
apart by over six years of civil war, according to the ECOWAS
source.
</P>
<P>
On the alleged boycott by most of the west African leaders on
the failed heads of state and government summit meeting on
Liberia earlier in May, the ECOWAS said that was a false report.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders deliberately stayed away from the
proposed summit of May 8, having earlier decided that the issues
under deliberation were within the competence of their foreign
ministers, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS first intervened in the Liberian crisis in August 1990
when it started to send a sub-regional monitor mission to
Monrovia to enforce a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
However, it failed to stop the escalation of war which dragged
on for another six years.
</P>
<P>
Until August 20, 1995, when the warlords in Liberia signed the
Abuja peace accord which provides for the establishment of an
interim government and a ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
With the latest round of armed clashes in Monrovia, the
relevant sides began to search for new and more effective ways
which can lead the west African country to a permament peace.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Access to Reliable Health Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISTANBUL, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A World Health Organization (WHO)
official voiced here today the emphasis on access to reliable
health care for everyone, especially the most deprived.
</P>
<P>
"WHO's main concern is to help countries and cities to ensure
access to reliable health care and services of good quality for
every one, with special emphasis on meeting the needs of the most
deprived," said Hiroshi Nakajima, WHO's Director-General, at
today's session of the ongoing Second United Nations Conference
on Human Settlements (HABITAT II).
</P>
<P>
To achieve this goal in urban areas, Nakajima said, WHO
proposed efforts to focus particularly on creating a healthy
environment, responding to specific health emergencies and
promoting lifestyles that are conducive to health.
</P>
<P>
The WHO chief explained that inadequate housing and
infrastructure are major factors of disease and
ill-health. Meanwhile, unmanaged population growth and
industrialization are also causing climate changes and rising
levels of pollution.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima also underlined the importance of educating the youth
to adopt more healthy lifestyles, which can reduce disease and
disability later in life.
</P>
<P>
WHO urged health systems to be redesigned to ensure that
services can be brought to the people.
</P>
<P>
Nakajima said that the challenge for HABITAT II, also known as
"City Summit," is to find ways in which cities can be both
prosperous and environment-friendly and, at the same time, places
where the dignity, the health and the well-being of all people
can be protected and enhanced.
</P>
<P>
"This will be achieved through local effectiveness and global
solidarity," Nakajima concluded.
</P>
<P>
A dialogue called "Creating Healthy Cities in the 21st Century"
was also organized by WHO today.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Trade ties between Vietnam and the
United States have developed since the two countries established
diplomatic relations last July, but still face problems, official
Vietnam News Agency (VNA) said in report here today.
</P>
<P>
VNA said the U.S. now ranks sixth in terms of foreign
investment in Vietnam with 53 projects licensed with a combined
investment capital of 1,153 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's total export turnover to the U.S. reached 199 million
dollars in 1995, four times higher than the previous year, VNA
said. At present, 20 items from Vietnam are exported to the U.S.
market, including household utensils, handicrafts, art articles,
precious stones, food, toys and sports ware.
</P>
<P>
VNA noted that trade relations between the two countries also
saw limitations due to an absence of a trade accord which will
serve as the legal basis for bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
"Worse still", it stressed, " the U.S. has not yet granted most
favoured nation (mfn) status to Vietnam, which makes Vietnam's
exports to the U.S. less competitive due to high duties."
</P>
<P>
Vietnam is striving hard to improve the quality and diversity
of its export items in order to win a firm foothold in the
U.S. market.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Gets Less Shipbuilding Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean shipbuilders received
orders for 34 vessels weighing 1.47 million gross tons (GT) from
overseas in the first five months of this year, down 33 percent
from the same period last year, the Korea Shipbuilders'
Association (KSA) said here today.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was attributed to the 2-3 percent price advantage
of Japanese shipbuilders due to the weak Japanese yen, according
to the KSA.
</P>
<P>
"The trend is expected to continue as long as foreign shipping
firms are reluctant to build new vessels because of trends that
suggest a global economic slowdown. So we cannot rule out the
possibility that the total orders this year will decline compared
with that last year," a KSA official said.
</P>
<P>
South Korea received orders for 194 vessels weighing 7.13
million GT from overseas last year.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Indignant at Japanese Claim Over Comfort Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean Prime Minister Lee
Soo-sung today denounced Japan's wartime enslavement of "comfort
women," calling it "representative of past human rights atrocities
committed by imperial Japan."
</P>
<P>
In refuting the recent claim by senior Japanese lawmaker
Seisuke Okuno that the comfort women were engaging in "commercial
activities," Lee said, "these elderly women are not comfort women,
but are victims of violent rape."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South Korean Foreign Ministry expressed deep
regret over the Japanese lawmaker's remarks on comfort women.
</P>
<P>
"We are very sorry about the remarks denying and distorting
facts that even the Japanese government officially admitted in
August 1993," said a statement released by the ministry today.
</P>
<P>
Okuno, a former justice minister, claimed on June 4 that the
sex slaves were engaging in "commercial activities" and weren't
forced to serve in military brothels during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Historians say as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans, were
recruited as "comfort women" -- a euphemism for sex slaves -- for
the Japanese imperial army as it swept through east and southeast
Asia in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 until Japan's World War
II defeat in 1945.

<HEADLINE> "Serious" Ceasefire Violations Reported in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 "serious" ceasefire
violations in "all parts of the country" have been attributed to
the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) by the Sierra Leonean
security officials.
</P>
<P>
"We are being provoked and the aim is for us to violate the
ceasefire but we are holding back fire," a top security official
said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the government called on the RUF over the
state radio "not only to uphold the spirit of the (yamasoukro)
meeting relating to the ceasefire but also to demonstrate respect
for the lives and property of Sierra Leoneans."
</P>
<P>
The statement, a second in three weeks by the government,
appealed to the international community to prevail on the RUF "to
desist from acts of violence against the civilian population and
dedicate itself to the cause of peace through negotiation."
</P>
<P>
According to west African diplomats, "the violations were more
intense in the south and east."
</P>
<P>
The statement did not say how many civilians have died so far
but local journalists put the figure at over 200 people, mainly
women and children.
</P>
<P>
RUF rebels are massing around the villages Yondo, Kpepoh and
Yangaesia in the Moyamba District in the south and that "the
whole town of Moyamba is now under siege," a local witness said.
</P>
<P>
"People are fleeing the area," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago, the government and the RUF ended nearly three
weeks of talks in the Ivorian city of Yamoussoukro after failing
to agree on two out of 28 points in the proposed agreement for
permanent peace in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile health authorities on Friday reacted for the first
time to the outbreak of lassa fever in the east saying that
"there is no cause for alarm'' and that the outbreak has been
"checked".
</P>
<P>
An "isolation ward" has been set up at the Kenema government
hospital for "effective case management and barrier nursing with
the cooperation of local health related non governmental
organizations," the health authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Since the outbreak of the disease in some west African
countries in April this year, more than 100 people have died with
dozens more hospitalized.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Since Project Hope was
established here in 1993, residents in this industrial city have
donated 6 million yuan to build 11 primary schools and help more
than 20,000 children return to school.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope is a national program that collects donations to
help dropouts in poverty-stricken areas continue their studies.
</P>
<P>
Among the rural population of 11 million in Chongqing, in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, 580,000 still do not have
sufficient food and clothing. Each year, 10,000 children are not
able to enter schools or are forced to quit due to economic
factors.
</P>
<P>
Project Hope officials in Chongqing said that they focus their
attention on "one-to-one" assistance, meaning one donor supports
one poor child for the entire nine-year compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
"So far, our efforts have met with active response and enjoyed
wide support in the society," said a local Project Hope staff
member, who added that personalities in the city's Buddhist circle
donated more than one million yuan to the children's fund.

thursday that a national strategy for economic development has
been mapped out for the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
According to the local daily "The Egyptian Gazette" today,

The next few years will witness a considerable development in
the investment structure through implementing multifarious
scientific programs aiming to entice foreign investment, the

Future budgets would focus on further increasing private sector
investments, with which 34 new industrial zones and some oil

<HEADLINE> Hariri Urges Israel to Show Seriousness on Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
al-Hariri, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua here this
morning, urged the new Israeli government to show its seriousness
on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the recent Israeli elections, Hariri said that
the new Israeli government should start to make "big efforts" to
convince the Arab and other countries with its seriousness on
peace and to avert a "prevailing impression that it is not
working for peace."
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the rightwing Israeli Likud
bloc, won a narrow victory in the May 29 national elections over
Shimon Peres, the incumbent Israeli prime minister and head of the
Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's success has raised doubt of Arab countries about
the resumption of the Arab-Israeli peace talks and prompted a
series of high-level Arab meetings, including a
Jordanian-Egyptian-Palestinian summit in Aqaba, Jordan, Wednesday
and another summit of Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia in Damascus
today.
</P>
<P>
"Until now, all what has been uttered by the Israeli
government is not encouraging, and is characterized with
negativity more than with positivity," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the new Israeli government should start big efforts
to convince the public opinion, of both the Arabs and the world,
that it is serious on the subject of peace because there is a
prevailing impression that it is not working for peace," Hariri
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, being asked to form a new Israeli government in 45
days, is expected to seek participation of minor political and
religious parties since his Likud bloc won only 32 seats in the
120-seat parliament, two fewer than the Labor Party.
</P>
<P>
On the situations in the region in view of the results of the
Israeli elections, the Lebanese prime minister said, "Until now,
the things do not seem clear, and are overwhelmed by a negative
impression."
</P>
<P>
He clarified that the efforts which had been exerted by the
Lebanese government, particularly by the billionaire prime
minister himself, to attract more international contributions in a
proposed consultative committee was interrupted by the Israeli
elections, hoping that the efforts could be resumed soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are now waiting for the United States, the sponsor of the
peace process, to ask us to continue the negotiations regarding
the consultative committee and to set up the mechanism for its
execution," Hariri added.
</P>
<P>
The consultative committee, provided for in a cease-fire
understanding broked by the United States between Lebanon and
Israel in April, is aimed at drawing international aids for
repairing and rebuilding the infrastructure damaged in a 16-day
Israeli blitz in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the Israeli large-scale military strikes in April, some 200
Lebanese were killed and four hundreds wounded, in addition to
damages up to 500 million dollars,
</P>
<P>
The consultative committee is also aimed at bringing more
foreign capital into Lebanon's ambitious reconstruction,
masterminded by Hariri, who took office in October 1992.
</P>
<P>
Touring Europe last month, the Lebanese prime minister
announced that his country needs 1 billion dollars per year in
the next five years to continue the reconstruction projects.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Faces Funding Crisis in Caucasus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A funding crisis threatens to
disrupt UNHCR programs that directly assist some 250,000 refugees
and displaced people in Georgia and Azerbaijan and over 80,000
displaced people from Chechnya, the agency warned Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agency's Director for Europe John Horekens said that the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) now has financial reserves
of less than 10,000 U.S. dollars for its programs in Azerbaijan,
and less than 20,000 dollars for programs in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing UNHCR emergency operation for displaced people
fleeing from Chechnya to other Russian republics has uncommitted
reserves of only 252,000 dollars, enough to cover operations only
through July, said Horekens.
</P>
<P>
"Unless significant contributions are made in support of these
activities, UNHCR will very soon be unable to commit any further
funds," he said, adding that the implications for the people
relying on aid could be "enormous."
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR's programs in the southern Caucasus focus on helping
these often desperately poor people to become more
self-reliant. It is running projects to improve the shelters of
these families and to increase their capacity to earn a living, by
providing seeds, tools and means to create small businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to help will mean more uncertainty and despair, and
much less hope for the whole area," Horekens said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR has requested 16 million dollars to cover this year's
operations in Georgia and Azerbaijan. To date it has received only
5.3 million.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an appeal for 6.5 million dollars to cover the
UNHCR's 1996 programs to help people displaced from Chechnya has
so far yielded only 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
"Our need is urgent. We could see non-governmental
organizations leaving this zone, because of the security
difficulties and because we can't promise them resources. That
would be disastrous," Horekens said.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Sells National Telecom Stake in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government has decided
to sell 30 per cent of its stake in the National
Telecommunication Company, in a privatization bid aimed at
enhancing the service and improving the production of its
state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Transport and Communications Edward Salia told the
latest issue of the West African Magzine that the plan is soon to
be announced by President Jerry Rawings of Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Ghanaian government already sold 50 percent of
its stake in the national gold-mining company which is the
largest in Africa.
</P>
<P>
These privatization bids aroused controvercy in the west
African country where some prople are of the view that the acts
are "unpatriotic".
</P>
<P>
Others think more active measures should be taken by the
government instead of just selling its shares to foreigners.
</P>
<P>
However, government officials said the measures taken by the
government are "effective" in a way that they could both raise
funds for national revenue and lead to better administration of
the poorly-run enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Iran Thwarts US Embargo, Rafsanjani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani today claimed victory over the Unites States, saying
the one-year-old trade embargo against his Islamic Republic had
totally failed.
</P>
<P>
He told a Friday prayers session on Tehran University campus
that the fact was recognized by all economic and social analysts
even those inside the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States imposed sanctions against Iran a year ago to
punish it for alleged support for international terrorism and
efforts to produce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We are not under such conditions that the sanctions of the
U.S. and others could have considerable impact on us and we
ourselves can manage our life," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The president did not provide details to prove his claim but
it was clear that Washington eventually has been confronting
Tehran lonely since its such traditional allies like France,
Germany, Japan, Italy and even Britain are still buying Iranian
crude.
</P>
<P>
France's Total, ignoring US pressure to stay out of Iran,
signed a 600 million dollar agreement with Iran in last July,
thus replacing American company Conoco to develop the Sirri A and
E offshore oil fields in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Russia, Iran's neighbor in the north, has
made much progress in expanding its cooperative relations with the
Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has not only scratched an one-billion- dollar nuclear
project in Iran despite strong opposition from the Washington but
also turned itself to oil business with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran, a country with a population of 65 million, pumps out
3.65 million barrels of oil and exports about 2.5 million barrels
daily.
</P>
<P>
President Rafsanjani said:"Today the Islamic Republic of Iran
has gained dignity, respect and honor whereas the U.S. has been
humiliated and disgraced."

<HEADLINE> Public Discloses Misuse of Extra-budgetary Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 calls from the public
have been made to a special 'dial a cheat' telephone hotline in
its first month of operation.
</P>
<P>
A further 100 people have written letters reporting cheats
who have misused extra-budgetary funds.
</P>
<P>
The calls and letters follow the decision by China's Ministry
of Finance to set up a special telephone hot-line on May 6 to target
the misuse of extra-budgetary funds.
</P>
<P>
China launched a national campaign to clean up and tighten
supervision of extra-budgetary funds in May. The ministry has said
that the campaign would last through September.
</P>
<P>
The calls and letters disclosed that some administrative and
law enforcement bodies have charged fees arbitrarily and imposed
fines irregularly, established funds not in line with regulations,
misused administrative fees, fines and confiscated money, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The details provided by the public will enable the authorities
to track down cheats in the handling of extra-budgetary funds, the
ministry said, adding that the two provinces of Yunnan and
Heilongjiang have now opened telephone hot-lines of their own.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that extra-budgetary funds in China
have surged drastically since the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
Illegal and irregular activities have occurred in the use of
extra-budgetary funds partly due to lax management, said Jin
Lianshu, a senior official with the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Jin noted that some extra-budgetary funds have been used to buy
luxury cars and houses, or to speculate in real estate and stocks,
and some of the funds have been embezzled.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Ten Italian policemen were detained
Thursday in the southern port city of Naples, accused of
protecting organized crime and accepting bribes, local press
reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
An investigation showed that the policemen, including an
officer, have since 1994 put under their protection a local gang
engaged in highway robbery and theft. In return, the gang handed
over cash ranging from 320 to 2,000 U.S. dollars per week to the
policemen.
</P>
<P>
The case is the most serious incidence of police corruption in
Naples' history, said the reports, which also claimed that crimes
involving law enforcement officers were racking the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, the policemen will be subject to harsh penalties
and a ban for life from jobs in justice and security agencies.

<HEADLINE> Arms Talks for Former Yugoslavia Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from Bosnia, Croatia,
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Friday failed to finalize an
arms reduction accord due to political differences, bypassing the
June 6 deadline.
</P>
<P>
Most of the major issues had been resolved in the last few days
but a couple of items need to be cleared, said Vigleik Eide, an
official of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which is mediating the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The talks involve representatives from Croatia, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia comprising Serbia and Montenegro, the
Bosnian government, the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and the
Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The June 6 deadline is set down in Article IV of the Dayton
peace agreement, reached last October to end four years of civil
war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Vienna talks seek to establish forces and weapons limits
within the former Yugoslavia to reduce the risk of a fresh
outbreak of war in the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The differences focused on how the individual parties were to be
referred to in the text of an agreement, Eide, a former Norwegian
general, told reporters early this morning in Vienna's former
imperial Hofburg palace.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim-led Bosnian government opposed referring to
Bosnian Serb territory as "Republika Srpska" for fear that Serbs
may present their territory as a separate state instead of part of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Some negotiators insisted that Croatia, Bosnia and the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia initial the agreement as separate nations
while the Muslim-Croat Confederation and the Bosnian Serbs initial
the agreement as two regions of Bosnia.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Eight Chinese scientists who have
made significant contributions to the country's development in
science and technology received a top prize today.
</P>
<P>
As winners of the '95 Tan Kah Kee Prize, each of the scientists
received a medal and 100,000 yuan (over 12,000 U.S. dollars) at a
prize-rewarding ceremony held before the closing of the five-day
national academicians' conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Ye Duzheng, one of the winners, is the founder of China's
modern aerology. His discovery about the sudden changes of general
circulation, the first ever in the world, contributed much to
China's summer weather forecasting. Ye was also the first
scientist in the world who found out that Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau,
located in western part of China, influences the climate, weather
and environment of the northern hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jiachi, an expert of space automatic control, was one of
the heroes who developed China's guided missile and atomic bomb in
1960s, as well as launching recoverable satellites successfully
several times.
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth time that Tan Kah Kee Prize has been
granted. The Prize, regarded as one of the top awards for Chinese
scientists, was established in 1988 with donations from offspring
of Tan Kah Kee, an overseas Chinese who had built schools and
colleges in China during his life time.

itself.

<HEADLINE> Turkish RP Leader to Be Assigned to Form New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's pro-Islamic Welfare Party
(RP) leader Necmettin Erbakan is expected to be assigned this
evening by President Suleyman Demirel to form a new coalition
government, Turkish sources told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Demirel would meet with Erbakan at the
presidential palace at 15:00 GMT and give him the mandate to form
the government.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president will appoint Erbakan to form the
coalition after Motherland Party (ANAP) Chairman and Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz submitted his resignation to Demirel
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz stepped down as the Turkish Constitutional Court has
announced that the vote of confidence in March for the
center-right coalition government between the ANAP and True Path
Party (DYP) was unconstitutional and DYP Chairwoman Tansu Ciller
decided to withdraw her support for the government led by
Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
After the general elections in December, Demirel assigned
Erbakan, leader of the party that appeared at the top of the
elections, to form a coalition government in January. But Erbakan
did not succeed in his talks with four other political party
leaders to seek partnership for the coalition and returned the
mandate to Demirel.

MOSCOW, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Anatoly Karpov claimed the opening
game of the 20-game world chess series Friday against Gata Kamsky,
didn't resume the adjourned game in Elista, Russia.
</P>
<P>
Both players adjourned for the night late Thursday after 56
moves. Kamsky conceded defeat one hour before the scheduled
resumption of play Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Kamsky will play white in the second game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Karpov held the undisputed world crown for a decade
until Garry Kasparov replaced him in 1985. He now is defending his
World Chess Federation title in the capital of the southern
Russian republic of Kalmykia.
</P>
<P>
Kamsky, a Russian emigre who now lives in New York City, won
the U.S. title at age 16 and was raised by his iron-willed father.
</P>
<P>
Rustam Kamsky, his volatile father and coach, caused a stir on

The dispute ended Thursday in Karpov's favor, when chess
federation president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov agreed to allow play to be
adjourned after 56 moves. The previous agreement had limited play
to seven hours with no adjournment.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Business Confidence Shows Improvement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A Bank of Japan survey released today
showed that business confidence in the country improved
dramatically in May.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's quarterly survey of economic enterprises, or
"tankan," looks at business confidence and is considered a clue to
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that the diffusion index for large
manufacturers increased to minus three in May from minus 12 in
February when the bank released its previous survey.
</P>
<P>
The diffusion index measures the difference between the number
of companies with a positive outlook towards the economy and those
with negative projections. The lower the index, the less the
business confidence.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said it expects the diffusion index to be zero
when it conducts its next survey in September, the first time the
index will be out of negative territory in four-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
But analysts said the May survey result was not cheery enough
to prompt the central bank to raise interests rates soon from
their current rock-bottom levels.

<HEADLINE> A Hong Kong Man Convicted Forging Credit Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong resident, Xiao
Yaowen, was today sentenced to seven years in prison for forging
securities in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
province.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou Intermediate People's Court said that Xiao's
deeds had severely impaired the financial management and the order
of credit cards.
</P>
<P>
Xiao was once arrested in Hong Kong for defrauding property. In
August 1993, he fled to Shenzhen in Guangdong province while on
bail.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 he set up a workshop in his temporary apartment in
Shenzhen to produce forged credit cards with a Hong Kong resident
called "Allen".
</P>
<P>
Allen provided equipment and raw materials for him to forge
cards. From September to November 1994, Xiao forged more than 200
credit cards. Some of the cards were carried to Hong Kong by Allen.
</P>
<P>
Policemen arrested Xiao in Shenzhen on November 17, 1994, and
found 99 forged cards and a batch of equipment for forging cards
in his possession in his apartment.
</P>
<P>
After the pronouncement of judgement, Xiao said he will lodge
an appeal.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Mural Paintings Feature Nepali Petroleum Pools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have solved the
puzzle of flaming pools of water, found in ancient murals.
</P>
<P>
They have proved that the fire water was caused by burning
petrol.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ancient mural paintings show that Nepal had an
abundance of petroleum resources in ancient times, according to
the findings of a Chinese archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists discovered a long time ago that a dozen
of ancient mural paintings, which date back to the Tang (618-907)
and Song (960-1127) Dynasties, featured mysterious water pools in
flames.
</P>
<P>
The paintings were found in the Dunhuang and Yulin Grottos in
northwest China's Gansu and Shaanxi Provinces. Both are famous for
rich collections of ancient Buddhist arts.
</P>
<P>
However, it was always a riddle whether the "burning pools" in
the paintings were ancient realities or pure imagination of
religious people.
</P>
<P>
Sun Xiushen, a veteran researcher at the Dunhuang Institute of
Gansu, has now claimed that after years of studies on the
paintings and historical records, he has the answer.
</P>
<P>
"These mural paintings are scientific records of the discovery
of petroleum in ancient Nepal, though some mythical elements of
Buddhism were added," he said. "The 'burning pools' are in fact
the Nepali petroleum pools."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that according to historical books, China and
Nepal started political, economic, and cultural exchanges some
1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese travellers, including Xuan Zhuang, a Buddhist monk
in Tang Dynasty who went to India to study Buddhism by way of
Nepal, left records of the "burning pools" in Nepal in their
journals, he added.
</P>
<P>
One of them described: "the pools are tens of Zhang (some 3
meters) wide, and will catch fire if a single spark falls in; the
flames will not be extinguished, but only fuelled, by pouring
water..."
</P>
<P>
With these vivid accounts, he said, the Nepali petroleum pools
were gradually known to the ancient Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"When artists started to work on the Dunhuang Grottos in mid
Tang Dynasty, they featured these pools in their paintings as part
of the Buddhist arts," he speculated.

themselves to police voluntarily in east China's Shandong Province
since a national anti-crime campaign was launched on April 28.

To date various departments in the province have distributed

service, more criminals seem want to surrender, a senior official

<HEADLINE> South Korean Traverses Sahara Desert on Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- He conquered the 8,848-meter-high
Mount Qomolangma (Mt. Everest), the world's highest peak, in
1987. He reached the North Pole in 1991. Now he has become the
first person in the world to take a west-to-east route to traverse
the Sahara Desert on foot.
</P>
<P>
Choi Jong-Ryul, a 38-year-old adventurer from the Republic of
Korea, overcame a series of hellish challenges, including vast
stretches of sand with high dunes, scorching sunlight, quicksand,
blinding sandstorms, scorpions, poisonous insects and a lack of
water, to complete his seven-month trek in Suakin, Sudan, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Choi, who set out in Nouakchott, Mauritania, on November 11,
1995, was supported on the journey by three other South Koreans
who drove two jeeps provided by South Korea's Kia Motors Corp.,
one of the two sponsors of the expedition. But the vehicles were
not always with him, Choi said.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in Cairo Thursday, Choi, pointing to
a map, said that he and the vehicles actually took two different
routes, but at certain places they joined together with Choi
receiving supplies from his three compatriots traversing the
world's largest desert by car. They kept in contact through a
walkie-talkie, he said.
</P>
<P>
Oh Kang-Suk, a journalist of the South Korean leading newspaper
Dong-A llbo (East Asia Daily) which was the other sponsor of the
expedition, Lee Tae-Sun and Lee Jong-Lae were also considered
heros by finishing the journey from Nouakchott to Suakin, though
most of the time in vehicles. They occasionally accompanied Choi
to walk.
</P>
<P>
Choi, who covered some 7,400 kilometers, and the three arrived
on June 4 in Suakin, a Sudanese Red Sea port.
</P>
<P>
Choi told reporters that he suffered diarrhea twice on the
journey and wore through seven pairs of shoes.
</P>
<P>
"Every day I woke up at 4:30 in the morning, then had my
breakfast for 30 minutes and started walking at five o'clock," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He walked for 13 hours a day, stopping only for an hour to cook
and eat a simple meal of rice, dried beef and pork, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he covered five kilometers per hour on the average,
describing his journey in Mauritania as the most difficult part of
his trek.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning I walked about 40 kilometers per day, and
four months later I began to cover 60 kilometers a day," he said
through an interpreter from Kia Motors Corp..
</P>
<P>
Asked what motivated him to make such a feat, Choi said, "I
just wanted to know how a person reacted in extremely bad
conditions."
</P>
<P>
For such a rigorous journey, it took him two years to prepare,
including the eight months spent on looking for a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
"The (Sahara) desert is more beautiful than I expected," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the people he met on his journey were very
friendly to him, but he had to communicate with them by making
gestures because of language problems.
</P>
<P>
The trek had been scheduled to end on May 28, 1996 at el-Quesir
in Egypt. However, due to the closure of the border between Sudan
and Egypt, the destination was changed to Suakin.
</P>
<P>
Choi, who will return to Seoul, South Korea Sunday, said that
he would try some other adventures in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The guidelines of the soon-to-be-
formed new Israeli government have been formulated and the Hebrew
newspaper Maariv published a draft text today.

of Jerusalem, and no to concessions on the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also state, "The settlement operation in all
parts of the land is an expression of our right over the land,
and it constitutes an integral part of our national security. the
government will guarantee the continued existence and development
of the new settlement, and will allocate for this purpose the

<P>
The Oslo agreements are not mentioned in the draft, but one of
the clauses states that "the government will conduct negotiations
with the Palestinian Authority to achieve a permanent peace
agreement, while strictly maintaining Israel's security needs,
including a materializing of the Palestinian commitment to
prevent terror, to extradite murderers, and not to incite against
Israel."
</P>
<P>
The guidelines include furthering relations with Egypt and
Jordan and raising level of diplomatic relations with other Arab
countries.
</P>

funding for the city in order to expand housing and municipal
services.

<HEADLINE> Monks Win Lawsuit Against Ham Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A sausage ham manufacturer in
central China has lost a two-year lawsuit for misusing the image
of a monk in ham advertising.
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou Intermediate People's Court has announced that the
Luohe Canned Food Factory have to apologize and compensate 5,000
yuan to Shaolin Temple, located near Zhengzhou, capital of Henan
Province, the Guangzhou-based "Yangcheng Evening News" reported.
</P>
<P>
The factory asked an advertising company to produce a TV
commercial for its "Shaolin" brand sausage ham in September,
1993. The production showed images of Shaolin monks playing
martial arts and, then, different kinds of ham products, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The advertising also claimed that the products were as famous
as "Shaolin" kung fu, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Monks of Shaolin Temple showed strong resentment shortly after
the commercial was broadcast on China Central TV, which covers the
whole country, and local Henan TV.
</P>
<P>
They urged the TV stations to stop the broadcast and sued the
factory for violation of Shaolin's fame, because the advertising
related a meat product with the vegetarian Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
Shaolin Temple is one of the most famous Buddhist temples in
China for its martial arts, and is also a hot tourist
attraction.

<P>
TIANJIN, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China wastes more than 10 billion
cubic meters of water a year, a major conservancy conference was
told in Tianjin today.
</P>
<P>
Now top officials have called for more effort to be placed
into developing the country's comprehensive use of water
resources, lifting its utilization ratio and economic returns, to
combat the country's waste.
</P>
<P>
This was set forth at a five-day national economic working
conference on water conservancy which ended today in Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
An important resource for humans, water is closely linked with
the people's living standards, economic development and social
progress.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the meeting pointed out that China is short of
water, while facing serious water wastages. Recycled utilization
ratio of water for industrial use only reaches 30 percent or so,
and utilization coefficient of water for agricultural irrigation
works out at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop the country's water resources, China will
set up economic belts along seven valleys of the Yangtze River,
Yellow River, Pearl River, Haihe River and other rivers.
</P>
<P>
The country will also import more overseas investment to
further increase international co-operation to improve economic
returns in the sector.

<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China's highest governing body, the
State Council, has approved the setting aside of 86 million yuan
(about 10.4 million US dollars) to put out fires in two major coal
fields in the northwest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Fires in Xiaolongkou and Xiaohuangshan coal fields in Fukang
County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, are expected to be
extinguished by 1999, China Geology and Mineral Resources News has
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 432-square-meter fire area in the two fields burn 24.68
million tons of coal annually, equivalent to Xinjiang's total coal
output for one year. They are the last two major coal fields that
are still on fire in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
So far fires in six coal fields have been put out, three of
which are state-set major coal fields.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang's coal reserves rank first in China, but fire
disasters are also serious. At present a total of 102 square
kilometers in 42 coal fields are on fire in Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Fires have eaten up 100 million tons annually, the report said,
adding that up to now, 2.1 billion tons of quality coal have been
burned to ashes.
</P>
<P>
China has been busy with putting out fires in Xinjiang's coal
fields for 38 years, it said.

SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Booming economy and trade along
the Yangtze River has boosted container shipping along the longest
river in China.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 11 container transport routes in service

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Sets Up Fuel Storage Facilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Underground storage facilities
capable of holding a six-month supply of Zimbabwe's needs of
petrol, diesel and jet-a1 fuels were commissioned yesterday by
President Robert Mugabe in southeast Harare.
</P>
<P>
Built by the Swedish construction company Skanska, the Mabvuku
underground complex has cost at least 50 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The complex comprises a service area where non-flammable
substances and utility equipment is kept and a hazardous zone
where the fuel lines run through.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the official opening, President Mugabe said fuel
was an important resource in the development of the country and
it was vital for sound storage systems to be put in place taking
into consideration that Zimbabwe is landlocked.
</P>
<P>
He said the facility would also enhance regional cooperation
in that Zimbabwe would be able to come to the rescue of needy
states in southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has exported fuel products to Malawi, Zaire and
Botswana.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Desert locusts have invaded
Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, according to Kenya's
entomologists.
</P>
<P>
Some of the invading locusts are seen on parking metres, while
others on parked vehicles, the entomologists reported.
</P>
<P>
Street children in Nairobi said they are busy collecting the
rare insects for a feast.
</P>
<P>
An Entomologist of the Desert Control Organization of East

case reported to us in Nairobi and we are going to make
arrangements with the Ministry of Agriculture so that the insects
can be controlled."
</P>
<P>
"However, at the moment, I can just describe them as a
temporary disturbance in the city, but they can wreak havoc, if
they moved to upcountry farms, " warned the doctor.
</P>
<P>
The case is the second to be reported in the country this

<HEADLINE> Africa's Debt Unpayable, Says Mkapa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has said that Africa's debt was unpayable and appealed
creditor nations and institutions to write-off or reschedule it,
local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa was quoted as telling an international conference
of the congregation of missionary benedictine sisters of tutzig
here on Thursday that the debt burden was "a millstone around
the neck of Africa".
</P>
<P>
He told the conference sub-Saharan Africa's external debt rose
from 84.3 billion US dollars in 1980 to a staggering 313 billion
dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said Tanzania's debt stood at more than seven
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to apportion this debt to every man, woman and
child, each one of them would be indebted to the magnitude of
their total incomes for two and half years", he explained.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Tanzania spent 2,425 million dollars last financial
year to service the national debt, an amount he said was sufficient
to meet the budgeted expenditure of seven major government
ministries. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israeli Coalition Talks Stalled over Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Talks on forming Israel's new
coalition government have been stalled over tough demands of the
religious parties who want to reverse the religious status quo to
that before 1992.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the Likud bloc and the religious parties
adjourned their talks Thursday without reaching any
agreement. They only agreed to resume the talks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Their troubles include difference in coalition guidelines,
portfolio demands and the bickering among the religious parties
over the Religious Affairs portfolio, and increasing unrest within
Likud itself.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister-elect Benjamin Netanyahu was still
optimistic regarding his plan to form a coalition by June 17,
when the new Knesset (parliament) convenes for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu expected the religious parties to be more realistic
in making their demands, aides close to him said.
</P>
<P>
Likud sources said that Likud's negotiators were quite
stunned by the tough demands presented by the religious
parties which include Shas, The National Religious Party (NRP)
and United Torah Judaism (UTJ).
</P>
<P>
The religious parties' demands include:
</P>
<P>
-- Reversing the status quo on religious affairs to that before
Labor took over power in 1992;
</P>
<P>
-- Making recognition of all conversions conditional on
approval by the Chief Rabbinate;
</P>
<P>
-- Enacting a basic law guaranteeing the Jewish character of
the state; and
</P>
<P>
-- Ensuring there would be no legislative initiative or adding
new coalition partners without the consent of all members of the
original coalition.
</P>
<P>
They argued a reversal of the religious status quo is
necessary because the Labor-Meretz government has altered it
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The last demand is seen as an attempt by the religious parties
to win veto power on admitting Labor into the coalition, which
the Likud might consider in order to limit the power of its
smaller coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
Likud negotiators replied that the religious parties must
tone down their aspirations and refrain from pressing on with
unrealistic demands, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
As for the portfolio allocation, Likud and the religious camp
remain divided.
</P>
<P>
As both the NRP and Shas demanded to take the Religious Affairs
portfolio, Likud suggested a third choice. The NRP threatened not
to join the coalition if it is not awarded the post.
</P>
<P>
The Likud offered the NRP the Education and Communications
portfolios, but it wanted the Labor and Social Affairs posts,
which had been allocated to Shas together with the Interior
portfolio. The UTJ was offered the Housing post and the
chairmanship of Knesset's Finance Committee.
</P>
<P>
Likud sources said Netanyahu plans to keep many powerful
departments under his control, a move set to upset future
ministers. These include control over both TV channels and
cable TV, the Finance Ministry's budget division, and the
Israeli Lands Administration.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, tension is brewing within the Likud-Gesher-Tsomet
faction, as Netanyahu continues to fray the nerves of his
party colleagues and campaigning partners.
</P>
<P>
While Gesher's leader David Levy is expected to take over
the Foreign Affairs portfolio, Tsomet's head Rafael Eitan, who
eyes the Defense or Housing post, was unhappy with Netanyahu's
silence.
</P>
<P>
To ease the tension, Netanyahu decided to meet Likud's
veteran Ariel Sharon next week for the first time since the
elections to discuss the portfolio allocation. Sharon is aiming
for the Finance or Housing portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is heavily indebted to Sharon, hardline former
Defense Minister, for his role in forming the Likud-Gesher-Tsomet
faction.

LUSAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Food and Agriculture Organization

He called on the Zambian government to continue to be mindful

<HEADLINE> China Asks Schools to Stop Making Money from Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Schools should stop collecting
excessive fees from students and their families, urged a
government circular here today.
</P>
<P>
The notice, issued by the State Council's General Office, said
that some elementary and secondary schools are charging students a
large sum of "unreasonable money" and even are demanding expensive
gifts from them.
</P>
<P>
"That has added burden to the students and their families," the
notice said.
</P>
<P>
Some township and rural governments have solicited money from
farmers in the name of building schools, which has affected
farmers' living standards.
</P>
<P>
Some schools forced their students to buy insurance, the notice
added.
</P>
<P>
It urged governments at various levels to increase educational
investments, build enough schools, and gradually exempt childrens'
school fees.
</P>
<P>
China is adopting a nine-year-compulsory education system,
which means elementary and secondary school students need not pay
tuition fees, and the country's education law stipulates that any
school cannot pursue profit.
</P>
<P>
But some schools have been collecting excessive sums of money
from students due to a lack of educational funding.
</P>
<P>
China has nearly one million elementary and secondary schools
with about 200 million students.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Calls U.S. Reaction on OAS's Resolution "Hysterical" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today described as "hysterical"
the U.S.'s reaction to this week's resolution by the Organization
of American States (OAS) condemning the tightened U.S. economic
embargo against the Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso also accused
the U.S. administration of trying to ignore the 1964 U.S. Supreme
Court ruling which recognizes the right of the Cuban government to
nationalize foreigners' property.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has objected to a resolution passed on Tuesday at the
OAS annual meeting rejecting the so-called Helms-Burton law,
passed by Congress in March punishing U.S. and overseas companies
which do business in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The OAS general assembly asked the Interamerican Juridical
Committee to give its opinion on the validity of the Helms-Burton
Law.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns announced
that Washington does not recognize the jurisdiction of the IJC.
</P>
<P>
He also described as theft the nationalization of foreign
enterprises in Cuba after Fidel Castro seized power in 1958.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Further Control Illegal Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government will table a
bill before the new House of Representatives providing for
stricter measures against those who illegally employ foreign
workers.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 12,000 foreign workers are currently
employed on this East Mediterranean island without the necessary
permits, in addition to another 10,000 who are legally employed,
according to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Dinos Michaelides said this week that the
government will adopt a strong policy against those who illegally
employ foreign workers.
</P>
<P>
The three-year prison sentences provided for under the
proposed law are expected to act as a deterrent to employers
violating immigration and labor regulations, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Once this policy becomes known, foreign workers will not come
to Cyprus with the intention of illegally seeking employment," he
said, adding that he hoped the bill would be passed into law by
the new House in September when it reconvenes after the summer
recess.
</P>
<P>
There have been numerous complaints and demonstrations against
the employment of foreigners, with hotel workers in particular
claiming that many of them are jobless while foreign workers
without work permits are being employed on low wages, and thus
undermining the local labor market.

MOSCOW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chess world champion Anatoly Karpov
of Russia enjoyed the upperhands as the first of the 20-game

</P>
<P>
In Elista, Kalmyk Republic, Karpov, 45, opened the game with a

</P>
<P>
Under the rule, each player should make 40 moves in the first

</P>
<P>
And the game will be adjourned as neither of them conquers the
other after the first 56 moves.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the end of the game, both players were left with a
rook, a bishop, a knight and three pawns each, with Karpov in a
clear advantage as his pawns were spread in dangerous spots.

<P>
XINING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Xining Zoo has successfully bred
a variety of rare animals unique to the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
such as black-necked cranes and snow leopards.
</P>
<P>
The zoo, located in the capital city of northwest China's
Qinghai Province, is the largest of its kind on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
Due to the plateau's deteriorating natural conditions, the
population of many rare animals has dropped sharply, and some are
nearly extinct, prompting Xining Zoo to intensify the research and
breeding of the unusual species.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, zoo authorities have undertaken several
national breeding projects. Xining Zoo is the first in the world
to successfully artificially breed the black-necked crane, which
is under state protection. And it is the first in China to breed
the snow leopard, also state protected. Scientists there also have
artificially bred several wild donkeys and Siberian tigers.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Attract Foreign Investment to Tax-Free Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Cuba will set up tax-free industrial
parks and commercial areas to offer new opportunities to foreign
investment and generate more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Investment and Collaboration Minister Ibrahim
Ferradaz told a press conference today that the decision was made
by the Council of the State Monday.
</P>
<P>
In the tax-free zones, industrial, commercial, agricultural and
livestock, technological and service activities will be performed
under a special system.
</P>
<P>
The similarly arranged industrial parks will allow
predominantly industrial performances and supporting services.
</P>
<P>
Concessionaires and operators of these zones will enjoy more
generous privileges in customs, banking, labor, migration and
public order, which were offered as incentives for investment.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee of the Council of Ministers of Cuba
will take charge of granting concessions in the tax-free zones.
</P>
<P>
The validity of the concession, 50 years at most, can be
successively extended, but will not be longer than doubling the
period originally agreed up.
</P>
<P>
While the Cuban Foreign Investment and Collaboration Ministry
largely controls the establishment of operations within the
installations in the zones, concessionaires also have a say herein.
</P>
<P>
Total exemption of taxes on income and the use of labor will be
offered to concessionaires and operators engaged in production,
manufacturing, assembling, processing of finished and semifinished
products and livestock products, during the first 12 years and a
50 percent cut during the next five years.

URUMQI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Construction of a major oil field
with an anticipated annual output of 400,000 tons of crude has
started in the Junggar Basin of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Shixi Oilfield is the country's second largest in desert
area, following the Cainan Oilfield in the same basin, that has an
annual production capacity of one million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Xinjiang Petroleum
Administration, the first oil well of the Shixi Oilfield was sunk
last August, producing a daily output of 130 tons, representing
the highest yield in the entire whole basin area.
</P>
<P>
The Shixi Oilfield, discovered in the late 1980s, covers an
oil-bearing area of 37 sq km with oil deposits topping 34 million
tons, according to a geologist with the administration.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the oil field is rich in natural gas. A gas pipeline
extending from Shixi to Karamay is now under construction, and is
scheduled to be completed this October.

<HEADLINE> Health Care for Farmers Improving in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A large-scale project to build
hospitals in townships will provide health care for over 10
million farmers and herdsmen in west China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has invested 135 million yuan (16
million US dollars) to build 104 hospitals in townships and
reconstruct all the unsafe hospital buildings.
</P>
<P>
The government also provided training to 5,000 doctors, nurses
and managers, and purchased 4,000 medical instruments and 60
ambulances for the township hospitals.
</P>
<P>
About 75 percent of the region's 16 million residents are
living in farming or herding areas. In 1991, 104 out of 846
townships didn't have hospitals, and 45 percent of the hospital
buildings were in danger of collapsing.
</P>
<P>
Those hospitals were only equipped with simple medical
instruments, such as stethoscopes, sphygmomonameters and
thermometers.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the hospitals now have X-ray machines,
electrocardiographs and ultrasonic scanning machines.
</P>
<P>
Some hospitals can even perform complicated operations such as
a complete hysterectomy or cholecystomy.
</P>
<P>
The region currently has 12,000 township health workers, 8,000
village clinics and 3,500 midwives, which can provide the
preliminary health care for farmers and herdsmen.

<HEADLINE> UN Relief Reaches Kabul Through Salang Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The first UN convoy since
December 1993 to cross the Salang Pass arrived in Kabul Thursday,
a report from Kabul said today.
</P>
<P>
The convoy of nine heavy trucks, which was organized by the
World Food Program (WFP), brought food and other humanitarian
supplies to the war-weary inhabitants of the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
The cargo included 95 tons of pulses, 23 tons of sugar, and
hoes, shovels, pickaxes, irrigation pumps as well as medicines.
</P>
<P>
The Salang Highway runs from the northern Afghan city of
Mazar-i-Sharif, which is controlled by anti-government
Junbush-i-Melli led by Rashid Dostum, to Kabul, which is in the
hands of the government led by President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to use the Highway for humanitarian convoys, the UN
has tried hard to clear the mines on the road and to persuade the
commanders along the road to provide a safe access.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the setoff of the convoy, both Rabbani and Dostum
agreed to the opening of the road for humanitarian traffic.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the reopening of the Mazar-Samangan-Doshi-Kabul
Salang Highway will be conducive to the UN humanitarian aid to the
war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Young Monk Establishes Himself As Buddhist Singer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A newly-marketed cassette tape here
features 16 songs recorded by a 32-year-old Chinese monk who is
also a Buddhist MTV star.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of fans now can hear the works of Zhengxing, the
first monk to establish himself by singing songs rather than
chanting scriptures, today's overseas edition of the "People's
Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Zhengxing does not sing pop songs, but rather tunes with
Buddhist lyrics, previously performed only at temples. The young
monk believes high technology is a means to spread the religion's
popularity to more people, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, he was invited by the Xiamen Television Station
to film China's first Buddhist MTV video. The work caused a great
sensation and won a prize at a concert.
</P>
<P>
A local radio station aired a special program on Buddhist
music, using Zhengxing as the anchorman.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his monkhood, Zhengxing sang with a group in central
China. He quit the group in 1991 and became a Buddhist believer,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
"I have found my life's way after studying Buddhist theory. And I
think music can help promote the great religion," monk Zhengxing
explained.
</P>
<P>
He now leads a 100-member-chorus consisting of believers and
laymen, who meet every Saturday afternoon at the South Putuo
Temple in southeast China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Buddhist music originated in India. It found its way into China
during the first century and later merged with traditional Chinese
music. It was extremely popular about 900 years ago.
</P>
<P>
But the musical style has experienced ups and downs as the result of
the conflicts between Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism, as well
as wars and social chaos.
</P>
<P>
"Now, it is time to cherish the legacy," Zhengxing said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Taiwan businessmen have established
six seedling bases in southern China's Hainan province, which have
aided local agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 Taiwanese-funded agricultural enterprises have
successfully bred over 40 varieties of high-quality, high-yield
plant seedlings, and improved wildlife varieties.
</P>
<P>
Each year, Taiwanese-funded enterprises in Hainan breed more
than 1,000 kilograms of plant seedlings, 10 million saplings, 300
million fry and 20,000 head of domestic breeding livestock,
according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
The six seedling bases include a pig-breeding base with an
annual production of 15,000 head; a base for breeding 50 million
nile tilapia fish from Africa, whose annual output capacity is
designed to reach 170 million; a banana and cymbidium seedling
breeding base with an annual output of one million; a vegetable
seedling breeding base producing more than 200,000 seedlings each
breeding period, and a base for breeding watermelon and mango
seedlings.
</P>
<P>
A Taiwanese-funded agricultural development company, based in
Sanya city, breeds more than 600,000 fruit and flower seedlings in
test tubes for local farmers each year.
</P>

By the end of 1995, mango and banana seedlings provided by the
company had been planted in an area covering 11,000 mu (660
hectares).

<HEADLINE> Senior People Seek Help in "Conversation Rooms" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 7 (Xinhua) -- In a simply-furnitured room at a
neighborhood committee elderly people sit together, talking about
their troubles, and getting comfort and help from each other.
</P>
<P>
Granny Yang, an 84-year-old widow, has made the "conversation
room" her second home. She knows she can always get help from
friends and neighborhood committee members.
</P>
<P>
"The neighborhood committee members cooked three meals for me
every day while a heart disease made movement difficult for me,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the first city in China to face the problems of an
ageing population, now has 1,200 "conversation rooms" where senior
citizens can meet with new friends they have made.
</P>
<P>
Gong Nenghai was feeling low and depressed, when he came to the
room for "heart to heart talks". He was suffering with his
crippled leg.
</P>
<P>
A member of the neighborhood committee found through
conversation that he was not getting along well with his wife, and
helped him find ways to reconcile.
</P>
<P>
Gong bid farewell to the friends in the conversation room and
the neighborhood committee members reluctantly last year, and
moved to another district with his happy family.
</P>
<P>
Since Yanzhong neighborhood committee set up the first
"conversation room" in the city, which has 2.2 million people aged
60 and over, the number of such rooms surged to 1,200 and the ways
of conversation in those rooms multiplied.
</P>
<P>
Elderly people can have person to person chats, or group
conversations in the rooms, to help their feelings of loneliness
and receive advice and help for problems.
</P>
<P>
A service network for the senior people has taken shape in the
city, with a volunteers' service group for each social community,
and the activity halls, matrimonial agencies, health care clinics
and family wards for the elders.
</P>
<P>
Old people's universities and activity centers were also
established in the city to provide a happy and colorful life for
the residents in their later years.

<HEADLINE> Company Joins with Hilton to Build Luxury Hotels in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese real estate
developer will work together with British-based Hilton
International to establish 20 five-star hotels in China over the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
This marks the first large-scale joint effort between a Chinese
company and an overseas hotel group.
</P>
<P>
The China International Industry and Commerce Corporation Ltd.
(CIIC) has signed a contract with the British company, CIIC
vice-president Hu Jiafang revealed here today.
</P>
<P>
The two groups have plans for nearly 100 three-star hotels, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China now has only 40 five-star hotels; two of them, in Beijing
and Shanghai, belong to Hilton.
</P>
<P>
According to Hu, the new hotels will be located in central
cities, newly-opened areas, and new and well-known tourist
attractions.
</P>
<P>
The three domestic bases of CIIC -- Beijing, south China's
island of Hainan, and east China's coastal areas including
Shanghai -- will be given priority as building sites, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 123,000-square-meter State Guest Garden, which was
developed by the CIIC Beijing Branch, will convert half of its
acreage into a five-star hotel. This land was bought by Hilton
International with 228 million U.S. dollars last month, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the extensive funding necessary for the hotels will be
collected internationally by Hilton, which will manage the hotels,
according to the contract.
</P>
<P>
CIIC, Hilton's sole agent in China, will invest in the
preparatory work, including site construction, and will be in
charge of development of all projects.
</P>
<P>
With combined fixed assets of more than five billion yuan, CIIC
claims Class-A authority for real estate development,
architectural design, construction supervision, and import and
export trade.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Expects Surge in Real Estate Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A surge in real estate
development is expected to start here this year, according to
local sources.
</P>
<P>
Figures recorded for the first quarter of 1996 in real estate
construction volume, utilization of foreign investment and sales
of commercial housing, show a 62 percent rise over the same period
last year in this capital city of south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
The growth is attributed to the expansion of the State financial
reform and the designation of Guangzhou as one of the country's
center cities.
</P>
<P>
Real estate has proved to be one of the major economic
industries in Guangzhou. By the end of 1995, the city had
established over 1,100 real estate enterprises, including 280
foreign-funded enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative real estate construction volume topped nearly 58
billion yuan, with the completion of more than 17 million sq m of
housing.

<HEADLINE> More Cambodians Carry HIV Virus, WHO Estimates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 7 (Xinhua) -- About 100,000 to 150,000
Cambodians are estimated to be HIV virus carriers and the number
is still rising, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
The estimates mark a dramatic increase in numbers released by
the World Health Organization (WHO) and the national AIDS testing
program in November, when 50,000 to 90,000 Cambodians were said to
have been infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, WHO put the number at 30,000.
</P>
<P>
"From the data we have now, we project that by the year 2000
there will be 40,000 cumulative AIDS cases," Annie Macarry, a
medical officer with WHO, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Between 1,500 and 2,000 AIDS cases have been reported in
Cambodia. By the turn of the century, there will be 12,000 new
AIDS cases each year, she added.
</P>
<P>
WHO said the virus, which leads to AIDS, is spreading
faster in Cambodia than in any other Southeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
It surveyed "high risk" groups, such as prostitutes, military
police, pregnant women and tuberculosis patients, to find out the
scale of the HIV-carriers.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that a survey of 1,173 prostitutes in
1995 showed that an average of 38 percent of sex workers
nationwide were infected with the virus. In some provinces, the
rate was as high as 48 percent.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sri Lanka, South Africa Enhancing Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 7 (Xinhua)-- Sri Lanka and South Africa have
substantially enhanced their relations with the launching of
flights between Colombo and Johannesburg by Sri Lanka's flag
carrier Air Lanka and the presence of a powerful Sri Lankan
Ministerial team visiting the African country.
</P>
<P>
Air Lanka commenced a twice weekly flight to Durban and
Johannesburg on May 28 this year.
</P>
<P>
Air Lanka itself is confident of heavy passenger traffic
between Johannesburg and Colombo as there are more tourists
traveling to South Africa than a few years earlier and there is a
substantial population of Indian origin in South Africa who can be
expected to use these flights.
</P>
<P>
Besides, countries such as Maldives, India, Thailand, Malaysia
Singapore and Japan have been attracting tourists from South
Africa and the Air Lanka flights will be very convenient for them.
</P>
<P>
The visiting five member ministerial delegation included Sri
Lanka's ministers of Foreign Affairs, Industrial Development and
Trade.
</P>
<P>
The Ministerial delegation, having held fruitful talks with
their counterparts, also had discussions with the South African
Chamber of Business in Johannesburg and the two sides exchanged
views on the possibility of establishing joint ventures in both
Sri Lanka and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministers of the two countries also explored ways
and means of enhancing bilateral relations in the political and
economic fields.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Foreign Minister Kadirgamar indicated that his
country had it in mind to open a resident diplomatic mission in
South Africa at the earliest possible time.
</P>
<P>
For its part, South Africa intended to intensify its diplomatic
 contacts with Sri Lanka and proposed to change its pattern of
concurrent accreditation by having its High Commissioner in New
Delhi oversee Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The Ministers also discussed the Indian Ocean Rim Initiative,
The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, South Asian
Free Trade Area and the Southern African Development Community.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed that a Sri Lanka-South Africa Joint
Commission  at Foreign Ministerial level be set up as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Following discussions between the two country's Trade
Ministers, Kingsley Wickremaratne of Sri Lanka and his South
African counterpart Alec Irwin, it was agreed that there should be
an exchange of trade delegations between the two countries to
explore and identify areas for economic cooperation and trade.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's pivotal role as a springboard for penetrating the
vast and expanding South Asian market with around 450 million
middle class consumers was also seriously considered by the
Ministers.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Alliance Cancels Hekmatyar's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the four-party Afghan
opposition alliance Sibghatullah Mojaddedi has decided to
terminate the membership of Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group) from
the alliance, reports from Peshawar, Pakistan, said today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen in Peshawar after returning from Herat,
Afghanistan, Mojaddedi said that the decision was made in the wake
of Hekmatyar's re-entering into the Kabul regime led by
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Mojaddedi said that the opposition alliance had authorized all
its component parties for holding talks with other Afghan groups.
</P>
<P>
However, it was binding that any final agreement with other
parties should be signed with the approval of the whole alliance.
</P>
<P>
After several months' negotiations with the Kabul regime,
Hekmatyar signed a reconciliation agreement with Rabbani last
month, and a Rabbani-Hekmatyar coalition government was in the
offing.
</P>
<P>
Mojaddedi accused Hekmatyar of not taking other component
parties of the alliance into confidence before signing the
agreement with Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
He also ruled out the possibility of the cooperation between
the remaining parties of his alliance and the Rabbani's regime in
the future.
</P>
<P>
The four-party opposition alliance comprises Mojaddedi's
Nejat-i-Melli, Junbush-i-Melli led by Rashid Dostum, Hezb-i-Wahdat
(Khalili Group), and Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar Group).
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the alliance in Peshawar, Talib, said that
Mojaddedi, Dostum and Khalili had held a meeting in Dostum's
headquarters, Mazar-i-Sharif, in Afghanistan and decided to
suspend Hekmatyar's membership from the alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Hekmatyar's spokesman in Peshawar Rahman Saeed said
Thursday that his party had not been informed of the membership
suspension.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Mojaddedi for imposing his personal view on the
alliance.

<HEADLINE> London, Dublin Agree on Chairmanship of Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The British and Irish governments
agreed today to have former U.S. senator George Mitchell presiding
over the all-party talks in Northern Ireland next week.
</P>
<P>
The agreement to choose Mitchell as the overall chairman of the
peace talks followed 48 hours of intensive negotiations between
London and Dublin.
</P>
<P>
The former senator, who will also chair a committee dealing
with the arms decommissioning of the Irish Republican Army,
currently is leading an international panel.
</P>
<P>
The panel advised Britain earlier this year on the disposal of
the weapons used in the 25-year guerrilla war between pro-British
Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics.
</P>
<P>
However, Mitchell's appointment was opposed by pro-British
unionists, whose voice was made clear by David Trimble, leader of
the Ulster Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
"I could not and I do not agree to him having a role in these
discussions until I have been able to satisfy myself that he will
be acting in a purely independent manner," Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
Also as a result of today's London-Dublin negotiations, former
Finnish prime minister Harri Holkeri was asked to act as alternate
chairman of the committees set up for the talks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, retired Canadian General John de Chastelain was
chosen to preside over the "second strand" of the talks, which
will cover political relations between British-ruled Northern
Ireland and the Irish Republic to the south.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Blackout Costs Industry Dearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 7 (Xinhua)-- The 4-day power cut in Sri Lanka
last week due to a strike by electricity workers cost the
country's industrial sector a loss of 56 million US dollars,
according to the Industrial Development Ministry sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said this excludes the export orders the country
may have lost.
</P>
<P>
Industry had appealed for assistance to get over the power
crisis and the government has appointed a ministerial committee to
look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
The sources quoted Industrial Development Minister Gooenratne
as saying that the committee will assess the impact of the power
crisis on various sectors of the economy and study how best the
blow to the industrial sector could be cushioned.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been troubled by power blackouts and water supply
cutoffs from May 29 to June 1 when employees of the electricity
board went on strike to protest the government's decision to
privatize the Ceylon Electricity Board.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 7 (Xinhua) --A sample survey by the Asian
Development Bank (ADB) has revealed an escalation of bangladesh's
urban poverty by 14.6 percent over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The study on urban poverty in Bangladesh showed that 61.30
percent of the urban population were below the "absolute" poverty
line while 40.20 percent fell below the "hard-core" poverty line,
as compared to the corresponding figures of 46.70 percent and 26.2
percent respectively in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The questionnaire was administered to a "nationally
representative" sample of 3,000 households from Dhaka and three
other metropolitan cities as well as four secondary towns.
</P>
<P>
The study measured poverty line based on income/expenditure
related to daily normative calorie intake plus 25 percent
adjustment for non-food items. The absolute poverty line was
determined at tk 3,500 (87.5 US dollars) per household per month,
with tk 2,500 (62.5 dollars) as the poverty line for the hard-core

<HEADLINE> WEU Welcomes NATO's Plan to Boost Its Military Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- President of the Assembly of the
Western European Union (WEU) Dudley Smith today welcomed NATO's
agreement to boost Europe's role within NATO.
</P>
<P>
The WEU, the 10-member European defense organization, should
not be only satisfied with its political role, he told the 41st
meeting of the WEU assembly, which was opened here Monday.
</P>
<P>
It should hold practical means to carry out various missions,
Smith asserted.
</P>
<P>
NATO reached a landmark agreement Monday in Berlin to allow the
setting up of a military component under WEU's control to
undertake European nations' own peacekeeping or relief missions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is widely seen as the first major step by the
U.S.-led western military alliance, set up in 1949 during the Cold
War, to adapt to the new post-Cold War challenges.
</P>
<P>
Belgian Prime Minister Jean-luc Dehaene told the WEU meeting
Tuesday that securing NATO resources for WEU operations would be
among his country's main tasks when it takes over the WEU
presidency from Britain next month.
</P>
<P>
The WEU had so far concentrated on humanitarian operations, but
Belgium wanted it to raise its ambitions to peacekeeping and even
more, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dehaene pleaded again for a rapid reapproachment between the
WEU and the 15-member European Union, which was supported by
France and opposed by Britain.
</P>
<P>
"WEU must become the EU's military arm...our final objective is
a merger between the two organization, " he said. "only then will
the EU have the operational arm it need to make its policy
efficient."
</P>
<P>
The WEU, founded in March 1948 to promote European unity, now
includes Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Greece, Italy,
Luxembourg, Holland, Britain and Portugal -- all member states of
the EU.

<P>
MACAO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The number of taxis in Macao will
reach 715 in about four months time, according to a report in
today's Macao Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 686 taxis running through the streets in
Macao, but the number will increase to 715 as dozens of new taxi
licenses were given out earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The Macao City Government auctioned 30 taxi licenses in April
this year, and the licenses were sold out at prices as high as
some 1.7 million Patacas (about 215,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Macao's taxis are divided into two kinds, the black ones and
the yellow ones. The yellow taxis belong to a certain company, and
are available for service through telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
Macao's taxi drivers charge passengers nine Patacas (One US
dollar is equal to about 7.9 Patacas) for the first 1,500 meters,
and the fare increases by one Pataca for every 220 meters after
the first 1,500 meters. There are also extra fares for passengers
destined to islands or leaving the airport.

<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Associated British Foods (ABF)
announced today that it will launch two joint venture operations
in northern Chinese province of Henan.
</P>
<P>
With initial joint investments of about 10 million U.S. dollars

from native maize starch each year.
</P>
<P>
The facility will be operated by the Henan Lianhua BSO Glucose
Company Limited.
</P>
<P>
The second program, to be carried out by the Henan Lianhua BSO
Pharmaceutical Company Limited, will build up an annual production
capacity of 24,000 tons of dextrose.
</P>
<P>
Calling the programs "exciting ventures," Garry Weston, ABF's

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Renewed Sanctions Against Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States today voiced
disapproval of a request by the head of an international war
crimes tribunal to re-impose sanctions against Serbia for not
handing over the indicted Bosnian Serb war criminals.
</P>
<P>
"I think our present inclination is to give Mr. (Slobodan)
Milosevic some time to work through this problem," U.S. State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after Antonio Cassese, head of The Hague-based
war crimes tribunal, warned in Sarajevo that he would ask the
international mediator for Bosnia reconstruction, Carl Bildt, to
reimpose tough sanctions against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Cassese said that as one of the signatories to the Bosnian
peace agreement, Serbian President Milosevic had failed to hand
over the indicted Bosnian Serb war criminals.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 Bosnian Serb leaders and officials have been indicted
by the war criminals tribunal in The Hague, including Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic and military commander General Ratko
Mladic.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnian peace accord, all signatories must extradite
those accused of war crimes to The Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
Burns told the press briefing that U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher had urged Milosevic at a summit meeting of the
former Yugoslav republics in Geneva on Sunday to fully comply with
the commitment he had made in the Bosnian peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"We ought to give him (Milosevic) some time now that we've laid
down this public challenge to him," the spokesman said, adding
that it would not be helpful to re-impose the sanctions against
Serbia now.
</P>
<P>
Washington would support Cassese's request only "at some point
in the future" when it finds out that Milosevic's cooperation with
the war criminals tribunal was hopeless, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Homicides From Gunfire Up 18 Percent in 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Homicide cases from gunfire in
the United States increased by 18 percent in 10 years, making
firearms the cause of almost three-quarters of all homicides, the
government said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The data showed the need for more wide-ranging crime prevention
tactics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
</P>
<P>
The federal agency said 12,078 of the 19,893 homicides in the
U.S. in 1985 were committed with guns, accounting for about 61
percent of all homicides. In 1994, 17,190 of the 23,720 homicides
were pegged to gunfire, or about 72 percent of the total such
cases.
</P>
<P>
Young people fared worse. The number of murder victims aged
between 15 and 24 by guns rose by 30 percent over the last
decade. Of the 4,772 homicides in 1985 involving this age group,
3,194 were committed with guns. In 1994, 6,740 of the 7,770
homicides involved guns, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Likely to Delay Closure of Chernobyl Nuclear Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine may re-consider the timetable
for shutting down the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station because of
delays by the G-7 group of industrialized countries in providing
agreed-on funds of three billion U.S. dollars, a senior government
minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is to re-examine and approve the memorandums signed
with the G-7 and the European Union over the deadline of closing
down the Chernobyl station, site of the world's worst nuclear
accident, as the western nations have delayed their promised funds
for building new generators at two other nuclear power plants,
Ukraine's Minister for Environmental Protection and Nuclear
Security Yuri Kostenko said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of international pressure and continuing fears over
the Chernobyl disaster in 1986, Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
declared in early 1995 that his country would close down the
Chernobyl Nuclear Power Station completely by the year of 2000 in
exchange for four billion U.S. dollars in aid.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996, the Moscow summit of the G-7, including the
U.S., Britain, France and Japan, and Russia agreed to provide
Ukraine with at least three billion U.S. dollars to close the
Chernobyl station, of which 500 million was for the two new
generating units.
</P>
<P>
The generators, which are expected to replace the power
supplied by the Chernobyl station, are key to closing down the
station, said Kostenko,
</P>
<P>
However, the Ukrainian minister said that so far,
negotiations over the funds with delegates from the G-7 have been
fruitless.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's official statistics show, 4,300 people died as a
direct result of the nuclear disaster in 1986 and many of its
350,000 clean-up workers are now ill. Millions were affected,
mostly in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus and millions of acres of
land were polluted by a huge cloud of radioactive dust released
after an explosion in one of Chernobyl's nuclear reactors.

BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China is investigating the
implementation of the country's education law, according to a
report in the "People's Daily."
</P>
<P>
A group sent by the National People's Congress Standing
Committee, China's legislature, arrived in Guangzhou Wednesday to
start a nationwide check, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The new law requires local officials to view education as a
priority of the country's social and economic development plan.

<P>
According to the law, local governments should increase
educational investment and also teachers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
The deputy governor of Guangdong told the legislative group
that the law has not been challenged in the province since it was
issued last year.

The Chinese government's investment in education still is
relatively low compared that in developed countries, and even some
developing countries.

<P>
The investigation will target six provinces and
cities. Guangdong, the economically-prosperous southern province,
is the group's first stop, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> National Eye-Care Day with an Eye on Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A forum marking the country's first
"National Eye-care Day" opened yesterday to raise the public's
awareness of protecting children and teenagers' eyesight, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Improving the eyesight of China's children will require several
changes: less homework, safer toys, better home-study
environments, and earlier diagnosis and treatment for eye
problems, the forum was told.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 10 million of the Chinese children
are either weak-sighted or cross-eyed. Doctors Believe that about
75 percent of them can be cured if treated at an early age.
</P>
<P>
According to Liao Wenke, who is in charge of student health
care under the State Education Commission, short-sightedness has
become a common health problem for students of all ages.
</P>
<P>
The commission's lastest national survey indicated that about
25 percent of primary-school students are near-sighted, while the
rate soars to 60 percent for students in middle schools and to 74
percent for those in institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Many students are unable to enter college or cannot study the
subjects of their choice because of eye problems, Liao said.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 physicians and government officials attended the forum,
which was sponsored by 12 state departments, including the
Ministry of Public Health, the State Education Commission, and the
China National Council of Light Industry.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Vows to Develop Oceanic Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's Fujian Province
will accelerate the development of its oceanic industry, making
itself a leading oceanic province.
</P>
<P>
In an inevitable development trend, the coastal province has
acquired additional resources and space from the ocean, and now
must set goals for the development of its oceanic economy, said
Jia Qinglin, a leading official of the province.
</P>
<P>
With a coastline of more than 3,300 km, the province has five
fishing grounds and more than 3,000 species of marine organisms.
The province has 125 ports along its coast, and is rich in
minerals and tidal energy resources.
</P>
<P>
Bountiful oil reserves are found in the western part of the
Taiwan Strait, according to a preliminary survey. But with its
low-level technical abilities and small-scale industries, the
province's oceanic industry is still in an early stage of
development.
</P>
<P>
Jia said there will be two development phases of the province's
oceanic industry: establishing an industry system consisting of
marine aquatic production, maritime transportation, offshore
tourism, and offshore mining industry, and listing appreciable
results in these areas by the year 2,000. The province's output
value from the oceanic industry will account for 15 percent of the
provincial gross national product.
</P>
<P>
The second phase will center on encouraging the rapid
development of the oceanic industry through advanced technology,
so that its output value will account for 30 percent of the
provincial gross national product. A series of port cities,
industrial belts, tourist zones, and foreign trade zones will be
designated along the coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Jia attached great importance to the present development of
five areas: marine aquatic production, maritime transportation,
offshore tourism, offshore mining industry, and the utilization of
offshore islands.

<HEADLINE> HK, Macao, Guangdong Urged to Join Hands to Improve Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese expert has called on
the governments of south China's Guangdong Province, Hong Kong and
Macao to establish a special co-operation agency, in a move to
curb the deteriorating environment in the area.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xiaoling, an engineer with the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, said that the worsening environment in the area could
not be effectively controlled without the co-operation of the
three regions.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of township enterprises and the swelling
population lead to the deteriorating environment, Ma said, adding
that the mouth of the Pearl River suffers most in the pollution.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by related departments of Guangdong Province
shows that more than 20 percent of labor-intensive enterprises
introduced into the Pearl River Delta from Hong Kong and Macao
during the past a dozen years fell into the category of polluting
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The geographical position of the three -- each borders with the
other -- determines that the contamination of one region will
inevitably affect the other two.
</P>
<P>
"Without a unified discharge standard and a limit for the total
volume of discharged waste, the environment in the area cannot be
improved in the near future," said Ma, adding that she was not
optimistic about the issue.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that as the three regions are all planning to
set up a series of large-scale infrastructure construction
programs to meet the future needs of enlarged co-operation among
the three, especially around 1997, new pollution-related problems
are waiting ahead.

<P>
MANILA, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops will
counter any attacks by the MORO Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
and the MORO National Liberation Front (MNLF) if peace talks
between the government and the Muslim rebels fail, the Business
World newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a spokesman for the government troops as
saying that MILF forces are planning to stage bombings and retake
its former stronghold in Sultan Sa Barongis.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is also going to launch offensives on the
municipalities of Esperanza, Isulan and Tacurong in Sultan
Kudarat, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"If the dialogue between (the government) and the two groups
(MILF and MNLF) fail, we will be dealing with the secessionist
groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, the government hopes for peace in Mindanao rather
than war," he said. "We will follow the policy of restraint and we
have given instructions to our soldiers to hit the MILF hard if
they attack our camps and people."
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the government and the MNLF are
underway in the Indonesian capital of Jakarta. President Fidel
Ramos said on Wednesday that the impasse in the talks has been
broken.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the MNLF are demanding an autonomous region
covering 13 provinces in Mindanao, but the government says that
constitutionally the demand must be put to a plebiscite.
</P>
<P>
Christians are in a clear majority in the area and there is no
chance the autonomy plan by the Muslim rebels will be accepted,
analysts said.

YANGON, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A newly formed joint venture between
Myanmar and a Singaporean company will build two cargo handling
wharves in Yangon's Thilawa Port, the official paper The New Light

</P>
<P>
According to the joint venture agreement signed here Thursday

exports.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Yangon Port handles only about 7 million tons
of cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
To increase cargo handling efficiency, a container terminal
with a total quay length of 1,000 meters is under construction at

<HEADLINE> Conditions Ripe for East European Countries to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, June 6 (Xinhua) -- NATO's delay in allowing east
European countries to join because of fears that Russia will
renege on its disarmament obligations is ridiculous, a former
U.S. defense secretary said here today.
</P>
<P>
Caspar Weinberger, who is visiting Budapest as the director of
the U.S.-based Forbes magazine, accused NATO of soft-pedalling on
its enlargment plans as Russia has repeatedly opposed the western
military alliance's eastward expansion.
</P>
<P>
He said Russia should not be allowed to exert a right of veto
over which countries can join the U.S.-led trans-Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
Conditions are ripe for Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland
to join NATO and the three former Soviet bloc countries should
have been admitted two years ago, said Weinberger, U.S. Defense
Secretary between 1981 and 1987 under the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that it is still too early for other east
European countries such as Romania and Bulgaria to join the
alliance, which was set up after the Second World War to counter
the Warsaw Pact countries of eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
It was a pity that the United States offered political
concessions over the issue of eastward expansion because of
Russia's sensitivity, and it was wrong for Germany to always give
in to Russia's demands, said Weinberger.
</P>
<P>
Moscow softened its opposition last week, implying at a meeting
of NATO foreign ministers in Berlin that it could live with
enlargement, provided no troops were stationed in the territories
of new members bordering with Russia.

LIMA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Peru is gradually recovering its
economy with a 0.3 percent increase of the gross domestic product
(GDP) in January-April over the same period a year earlier, said a
report from the official National Institute of Statistics and
Informatics.
</P>
<P>
The recovery can be seen in several major sectors in the
country, which witnessed the economic slowdown at the beginning of
this year.

Also during the first four months of this year, the nation's

percent over the same period last year, mining 0.6 percent, and

<HEADLINE> Official: UK-EU Beef Debate at Turning Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Malcolm
Rifkind said today that Britain's beef war with the European Union
(EU) has reached a turning point and he hoped that further
progress will be made in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a BBC Radio interview, Rifkind said, "We reached a
turning point last night in this whole problem because the Italian
government, the current EU presidency, has publicly promised to
achieve an agreement on the beef debate."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said, "If we are making progress, then goodwill is very
much part of negotiation. If colleagues are beginning to be
helpful, it is important we should respond to that."
</P>
<P>
The EU Commission agreed on June 5 in Brussels to lift the ban
on exports of three British beef by-products -- gelatine, tallow
and bull semen as the first step to lift the ban on British beef
products exports.
</P>
<P>
As a positive response to the EU decision, Rifkind announced on
June 5 that Britain would show "good will" by not blocking the
signing of an EU association agreement with Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
However, Rifkind made it clear that "I have to emphasize that
the policy of non-cooperation with the EU can not be withdrawn
until we have that framework agreement. Nobody is going back on
that."
</P>
<P>
The British Foreign Secretary suggested that the framework for
the phased withdrawal of the total EU ban should be given before
the EU Summit due to be held in Florence, Italy, later this month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany, the main force against lifting the EU ban,
remained reluctant to drop its tough stance.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has reportedly said that
there was no way Germany could follow Brussels by easing or
lifting the embargo and public health took priority over the
economic consequences of the ban.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the worldwide ban on British beef products
exports on March 27 when the British government announced that
there were possible links between BSE, or mad cow disease, and its
human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.

WARSAW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Cooperation between Poland and China
has good prospects and their bilateral relations have entered a
new stage, said Polish Deputy Prime Minister Grzegorz Kovodko in
an article published today by the weekly magazine Politika.
</P>
<P>
Kovodko, also finance minister, said the Chinese government was
effectively implementing its plans to establish a market-oriented
economy, quicken economic development and integrate with the
global economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the world's future is increasingly dependent on that of
China's economy and its progress in integration with the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
He said a trade volume of less than 500 million U.S. dollars
between China and Poland indicated that their cooperation still
has great potential.
</P>
<P>
Kovodko also spoke highly of a visit last week by Chinese Vice
Premier Li Lanqing, saying his visit is bound to promote bilateral
trade.
</P>
<P>
After two years of talks, the two countries signed a loan
agreement during Li's visit under which the Polish Commercial Bank
will grant China 340 million U.S. dollars in loans.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also signed some letters of intention on
cooperation between their enterprises.

SINGAPORE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Singapore
(SES) will launch a new regional stock index in the second half of
this year, the local newspaper Business Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said the Singapore Finance Minister Richard Hu told an

benchmark to track and measure the performance of their portfolios
in regional stocks listed on the SES.
</P>
<P>
The regional index will be made up of foreign and Singapore
companies which are listed on the SES and have substantial
regional operations, and will serve as a proxy for investment in
the regional markets, Hu was reported as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Minister also said at the conference that the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange would consider trading a futures
contract on the new regional index at the appropriate time, if its

PRAGUE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of people with AIDS in
the Czech Republic could be at least 10 times greater than the
official statistics show because most sufferers are too ashamed to

Some 266 people have been found suffering from AIDS and 59 have

<HEADLINE> Rwandan President to Visit China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, Rwanda, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu today said that his scheduled China visit will further
enhance bilateral relations between Rwanda and China.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu, who is to pay an official visit to China between
June 10 and 14, told Kigali-based Chinese journalists that he will
extend gratitude to the Chinese leaders and people for their
support and aid in Rwanda's reconstruction after the civil war.
</P>
<P>
China supported Rwanda politically, morally and materially when
the country started reconstruction in 1994 after the civil war
ended, the president said.
</P>
<P>
China was one of the first foreign countries which had reopened
their embassies in Kigali immediately after the civil war ended,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan president said that his country is stable now since
security has greatly improved and the Rwandan people have made
decisive progress in developing economy and social welfare.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of agricultural output had been restored by the
beginning of this year while highways, water and electricity
supplies as well as telecommunication facilities, which were
severely damaged during the war, had been basically rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
The president said that though the country is resettling
upwards two million refugees, there are still 1.5 million Rwandan
refugees staying abroad.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu said that he wishes China would continue to support
and aid his country at a time when it braves various difficulties
to rehabilitate its economy and to reconstruct its infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Civil war broke out in Rwanda on April 6, 1994 when its
president was killed in a plane crash and the three-month civil
war forced millions of Rwandans to flee their homes and seek
refuge in neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> OPEC Adjourns Session for Differences Over Iraq, Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The OPEC ministers adjourned its
Vienna conference until Friday after four hours' discussions today
on how to cushion the return of Iraqi oil and realign its
"obsolete" quota distributions.
</P>
<P>
The 100th conference of the 36-year-old Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), a half-yearly regular event,
opened its first session today after a one-day delay.
</P>
<P>
OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman said today's session went
"fairly well," coming to deal with the adjustment of output levels
to manage Iraq's revived oil export under a United Nations accord
ending its 1990 Gulf War embargo.
</P>
<P>
Under the May 20 accord, Iraq will gain 2 billion U.S. dollars
by exporting an average of 0.7-0.8 million barrels a day (MBD) for
six months to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
This sum, coupled with the long-existing overproduction by some
OPEC members which have lifted their real output some 1.5 MBD
above the 24.52 MBD ceiling, is feared to deal a heavy blow to the
already vulnerable oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC's package of oil prices have already dropped below 19
dollars per barrel by now since April when it broke down the
designated reference 21 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some members suggested OPEC, now pumping 26 MBD, move up its
somewhat obsolete three-year-old ceiling, to about 25.5 MBD, while
several others demand bigger quotas.
</P>
<P>
In this case, a decision on reallocating quotas or raising the
ceiling is widely expected in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Gabon has reportedly threatened to withdraw from the oil cartel
in protest against its indiscriminate appropriation of yearly two
million U.S. dollar membership fees regardless of the countries'
different liabilities, as was yet to be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for 40 percent of the world's total oil output every
year, the OPEC's proven reserves amount to 70 percent.

KIGALI, Rwanda, June 6 (Xinhua) -- China today donated 625,000
U.S. dollars worth of farm machinery and pesticides to Rwanda to
help its reconstruction and develop agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Agriculture Minister Augustin Iyamuremye said at the
donation ceremony that his country is grateful to China for its
timely help and that the two countries can expand friendly
cooperation in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda, in central Africa, is an agricultural country and 70
percent of its agricultural production had been restored by the
beginning of this year after nearly two years of reconstruction
following the end of the three-month civil war in June 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese donation included rice mills, oil presses,
threshers, sieving machines, sprayers, spare parts and
pesticides.

<HEADLINE> Barings Futures' Auditors Face Billion-Dollar Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's largest law suit,
involving more than 1.43 billion US dollars, has been served on
the auditors of the Baring Futures Singapore Ltd. (BFS) for
negligence leading to last year's collapse of the Baring plc.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper Business Times today, lawyers from
Rajah &AMP; Tann served the papers Monday against external auditors
Cooper &AMP; Lybrand Singapore and Deloitte &AMP; Touch.
</P>
<P>
It said that Barings' administrators in England had earlier
also filed claims against the London offices of the two external
auditors.
</P>
<P>
Barings collapsed in late February last year after Nick Leeson,
BFS' general manager, racked up losses of more than 2.2 billion
Singapore dollars (about 1.57 billion US dollars) trading in
Nikkei and Japanese government bond futures and options.
</P>
<P>
The two auditors are being sued not just for negligence in
relation to the merchant bank's collapse but also for failing to
detect Leeson's secret account 88888.
</P>
<P>
Leeson is now serving a six-and-a-half-year jail term here
after being found guilty of fraud charges.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Suspend Tariff Cuts on Textiles </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Banharn
Silpa-archa has told the Finance Ministry to suspend import tariff
reductions within one week on textiles, garments, leather and
shoes, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's request came after the private sector
warned at a recent meeting between the public and private sectors
that the tariff cuts would hurt those industries.
</P>
<P>
The Finance and Industry Ministries were asked to work together
to seek ways to comply with the request. But Finance Minister
Bodi Chunnananda said more time was needed to reconsider effects
of tariff cuts on all 13 categories of luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
The Thai cabinet on May 7 approved a Finance Ministry proposal
to cut tariffs on the 13 categories of luxury goods, including
textiles, garments, leather bags and shoes, and cosmetics, which
triggered off a strong opposition from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that tariffs rates on textiles, garments, leather
and shoes might revert to old ones.
</P>
<P>
So far, of the 13 categories, only cosmetics have been imported
since the announcement of the tariff cuts.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Urged to Reinstate Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's new interior minister
today appealed to the country's National Assembly (parliament) to
reinstate death penalty to curb rampaging lethal crimes.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Nikolai Dobrev made a written appeal to
parliament speaker Blagovest Sendov and said that some 2,300
people were killed by criminals in the past five years during
which period a total of one million crimes were committed.
</P>
<P>
88 Innocent people fell victims to deadly criminals in the
first quarter of this year including five policemen who were
killed while trying to stop criminals.
</P>
<P>
On the rise in the past few years were crimes such as bomb
blasts, assassinations, kidnappings, rapes and armed robberies
which have reached an unprecedented level, the interior minister
stressed in his appeal.
</P>
<P>
Dobrev blamed the increase of crimes on the malfunction and
misfunction of government departments as well as on the abolition
of capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister urged the parliament to revise its 1990
law which abolished death penalty and reinstate it to tighten law
enforcement.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Soften Stance on Russian Troops' Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels today softened their
hardline stance on the withdrawal of Russian troops, saying they
were ready to conditionally accept Moscow's proposal to pull out
in exchange for simultaneous disarmament by the separatists.
</P>
<P>
Rebel delegates told Russian officials during peace talks that
as a precondition, an accord to this effect should be signed with
guarantees provided by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which is mediating in the talks, the
Itar-Tass news agency said.
</P>
<P>
But the agency did not report on Russian officials' reaction to
the offer by the rebels, who have insisted that they will lay down
arms only after an immediate pullout of the federal troops from
the breakaway republic of Chechnya. The rebels are also demanding
that Chechnya be demilitarized after their disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass said the two sides failed to make any progress during
their three-day tough talks which ended today in Nazran, capital
of the Ingushetia region bordering Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
But it added that the talks, aimed at discussing the details of
a broad peace deal struck in Moscow May 27, are due to reopen in
Nazran Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Russian officials refused to discuss rebel
demands to cancel the June 16 Chechen parliamentary election,
saying it is an internal affair of the Chechen government.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to sign accords on the exchange of
prisoners of war and a ceasefire as stipulated in the Moscow peace
deal signed by President Boris Yeltsin and rebel leader Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev last week. But a truce took effect in the region on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Chechen conflict flared up in December 1994 when Yeltsin
ordered troops and tanks into the republic to quash the
independence bid by Yandarbiyev's predecessor Dzhokhar Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
The 18-month war has killed about 30,000 people, including
civilians and fighters on both sides, and uprooted tens of
thousands of Chechen people.

belonging to the family. In China, there are more than 150 species
in 11 generas.
</P>
<P>
Most of the plants are 14 to 40 meters high, which constitute
the higher level plants in forests and play a vital role in
maintaining an ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
Their elegant canopies and beautiful flowers also make them
ornamental plants in gardens.
</P>
<P>
However, many species are endanged or even on the verge of
extinction.
</P>
<P>
Starting from 1950s, the Huanan Botanical Research Institute
has been engaged in collecting plants of lily magnolia family, and
has conducted investigations on the distribution and biological
features of such plants in 14 Chinese provinces and regions since
1977.
</P>
<P>
In 1981 the research institute set up a lily magnolia area
covering 12 hectares within the Hunan Botanical Garden, aiming to
introduce and multiply plants in the lily magnolia family.
</P>
<P>
The garden now boasts 6,700 plants belonging to 120 species in
11 generas of the family, including 38 rare or endangered
species.

<HEADLINE> Britain Cuts Interest Rates to 5.75 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England, the central
bank of Britain, took financial markets by surprise today by
cutting its interest rates by 0.25 percent to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
The cut, the fourth since last December, followed an unusually
long monthly meeting on Wednesday between Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George.
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who has the final say on the government's monetary
policy, said in a statement that the decision was justified by low
inflation and "below-trend" economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"I have decided another quarter percent cut in interest rates
is sensible. Cost pressures have eased further and the economy is
growing below trend," the Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
He is still confident of hitting the government's inflation
target of below 2.5 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
However, some economists said that the move by the Conservative
government was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Although industry is in the doldrums, they noted, the much
larger service sector is performing well and consumer spending is
picking up, so there is little need for the stimulus of a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
Facing a general election within a year and lagging badly in
opinion polls behind the opposition Labor Party, experts said, the
government is desperate to do all it can to win back voters.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the Bank of England's lower official interest
rates, Britain's commercial banks by cutting their base lending
rates by the same amount to 5.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Halifax Building Society, the country's biggest
home loan company, cut its key mortgage rate to 6.99 percent from
7.25 percent.

<HEADLINE> Phonetic Symbols Make Reading Easier for Blinds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Blind people in China are to drop
the braille they have used for over 40 years. It will be replaced
by a new kind of written language marked with the tones
of Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
The State Language Commission has approved to widespread use of
the new braille among 7.5 million blind people during the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
The current Chinese braille has contributed much to
communication for blind people since it was introduced in 1953.
</P>
<P>
However the braille does not indicate the tones of the Chinese
characters, and blind people have to figure out the pronunciation
and meaning of words through context, which makes it extremely
difficult for them to understand classical Chinese and scientific
articles.
</P>
<P>
The inventor of the present braille, Huang Nai, headed a group
of linguists and blind scholars, to carry out study on a new kind
of language.
</P>
<P>
After twenty years of hard work, they invented the new braille,
which has clearer shape and more accurate pronunciation than the
old one, and is more convenient for the automatic shift to the
normal Chinese characters and computer operations.
</P>
<P>
All new books for the blind will be published in the new braille
by the year 1998, and all the blind schools will use it by the
year 2000.

NINGBO, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Yinxian County in east China's
Zhejiang province has launched an action campaign to create the
country's first baby-friendly county.
</P>
<P>
The county plans to popularize knowledge on the irreplaceable
nutrition of mother's milk and the special significance of breast
feeding in maintaining love between mothers and babies.
</P>
<P>
The county has also asked relevant departments and local
hospitals to strictly implement breast feeding according to
international norms, and allow mothers and their newly-arrived
babies to stay in same rooms all day long.
</P>
<P>
As a result the ratio of four-month old babies who are breast
fed has increased by 25 percent compared with three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the incidence of baby diarrhea, pneumonia and breast
mastitis has dropped markedly.
</P>
<P>
Yinxian county, one of the richest in China, has set up a
leading group specially in charge of promotion of baby-friendly
action.
</P>
<P>
The county has developed a regulation stipulating that local
medical institutions will not be allowed to recommend or promote
the selling of baby milk substitutes.
</P>
<P>
All work units are being asked to guarantee maternity leave and
daily breast feeding times for new mothers.
</P>
<P>
Units with women accounting for the most part of labor force
must build baby-friendly rooms, and township and village level
clinics which have less than ten delivery beds are asked to
install more beds, according to the regulation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-American joint venture for
vision correction has performed operations to 30 near-sighted
people and sharply improved their eye-sight.
</P>
<P>
The vision correction center, which is jointly sponsored by
No.1 affiliated hospital of the Dalian Medical University and the
American E-TOOR Corporation, uses Photo Refractive Keratectomy
(PRK) machines and other instruments to treat near-sightedness,
far-sightedness, astigmia and keratopathy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that nearly 300 million people in China are
near-sighted, with the incidence rate of near-sightedness reaching
40 percent in some big cities.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that PRK, which uses an ultraviolet light to cut
the cornea surface to concave shape, is a safe and effective
method of improving eye sight.
</P>
<P>
PRK is currently used in over 50 countries around the world.
The Food and Medicine Bureau of the United States has approved the
clinical use of the PRK.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is one of the first cities in north China to open such a
vision correction center.
</P>
<P>
The center has invited American doctors to guarantee the
operation techniques and ensure the operations go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Many near-sighted people in China have expressed an interest in
the operation.

<HEADLINE> Perry: Brown Killed in Multi-Factor Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Commerce Secretary
Ron Brown was killed in an accident caused by a deadly combination
of factors including questionable pilot decisions, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry said today.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon chief made the remarks in an interview with
American reporters aboard his plane en route from Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It was not one single problem or mistake," Perry said. "There
was a string of events which led to the accident."
</P>
<P>
Brown was killed on April 3 when he was flying a U.S. Air Force
plane to visit Croatia with a group of leading American business
executives. The plane slammed into a rocky mountain peak near
Dubrovnik airport and no one survived.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Air Force has since been investigating the accident.
The finding will be made public Friday, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
Perry told the reporters that Beside doubtful decisions by the
pilot, contributing factors were Air Force leaders' failure to
certify the airport as safe in advance, insufficient navigational
guidance from the airport, and a wind that caused the plane to
drift off the regular course.
</P>
<P>
But Perry said that the full story may never be known as the
old-fashion military plane had no data or voice recorders.

<HEADLINE> China Invests More in Water Conservancy Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- China has invested over 29 billion
yuan on water conservancy projects since last winter, latest
statistics from the Ministry of Water Conservancy reveal.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the projects will provide favorable
conditions for this year's agriculture harvests and anti-flood
struggles in the flood season, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of March 660,000 hectares of land had been newly
provided with irrigation facilities, with irrigation facilities
across another four million hectares improved.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter 1.6 million hectares of middle and
low-yielding arable land have been transformed and soil erosion on
27,000 square kilometers has been curbed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile some 12.5 million more people have been provided with
clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The measure of water-saving irrigation has been spread all
across China, especially in the drought areas such as Shaanxi and
Gansu provinces, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Provinces suffering from floods last year, such as Liaoning,
Jilin, Hubei and Anhui provinces, have spared no efforts to
reconstruct the water-conservancy projects.
</P>
<P>
So far 80 percent of the projects demolished by last year's
floods have been reconstructed.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 7 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists in China have
discovered two 8,000-year-old dragon totems.
</P>
<P>
The totems, or statues of animals worshiped by primitive
tribes, were excavated at Yangjiawazi village in west Liaoning
province. They are obviously two dragons.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that one dragon is 1.2 meters long and the
other is 0.8 meters long. Both of them were made of yellow soil,
and their mouths look like those of ducks and with tails like
those of fish.
</P>
<P>
China is often called the country of dragons. But scholars have
been arguing over why the ancestors adored dragons so
much. Archeologists said the discovery, first of its kind in the
country, will help to study the origins of the mysterious
culture.

NEW YORK, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street moved lower
today as investors still worried that Friday's key employment
report will include inflationary trends.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial fell 30.29 points to close at
5,667.19.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indexes also turned lower after a strong opening.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of more than
4-to-3.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 463.13 million shares, up from 375.38
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 2.28 to 361.10 and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.41 to 673.03.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 14.48 to 1,234.67 and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index fell 5.43 to 602.84.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq market retreated from Wednesday's record close as
key technology issues such as Intel, Sun Microsystems and Cisco
Systems declined.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares were also weak on the NYSE. IBM was one of
the weakest Dow components.
</P>
<P>
The financial markets have plunged after recent strong
employment reports which could be understood as strong spending
and, consequently higher inflation. Friday's report would
reinforce fears the Federal Reserve will fight inflation by
raising short-term interest rates.

UNITED NATIONS, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 40,000 soldiers of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) have
been quartered so far, a U.N. spokeswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Sylvana Foa said at a news briefing that 1,261 UNITA soldiers

plagued by armed conflicts for three decades.
</P>
<P>
Both the Security Council and Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali have repeatedly urged the Angolan government and
the UNITA to implement the Lusaka Protocol, especially accelerating
the pace of quartering troops.

<HEADLINE> 60 Released Croatian Serbs Arrive in Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Sixty out of the 76 Serbs pardoned
by the Croatian government on May 30 arrived here today, after
spending nearly one year in Croatian prisons.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs were arrested in August 1995 when the government
troops launched a massive offensive against the self-styled Serb
Krajina Republic in Croatia and more than 250,000 Serbs fled the
northern and southern parts of Serb Krajina as a result of the
military operation.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian government issued an amnesty law last week
pardoning Serb soldiers who were arrested by the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
President of the Yugoslav Commission for Humanitarian Issues
and Missing Persons Pavle Todorovic, who welcomed the group, said
he was dissatisfied with the Croatian government because more than
250 Serbs were still held in Croatian prisons, according to the
Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian side constantly politicizes the problems of
prisoners and missing persons, Todorovic said. He urged the
international community to put pressure on the Croatian government
to fulfill basic humanitarian law obligations and release the
detained Serbs.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Serbs who arrived here did not speak to reporters
in fear of possible retaliation against the Serbs remaining in
Croatian prisons. But those who did speak said they had
experienced worst treatments in the prison in Karlovac, a town
about 50 km southwest of Zagreb, Tanjug added.

<HEADLINE> US House of Representatives Approves Wisconsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- Republicans in the U.S. House of
Representatives today pushed through a bill granting fast-track
approval to Wisconsin's welfare overhaul plan, a move Democrats
called election-year politics.
</P>
<P>
The 289-136 vote authorized Wisconsin to implement a dramatic
plan to move people from welfare to work only eight days after
Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson formally requested federal
waivers so the experiment could begin.
</P>
<P>
"The president endorsed the Wisconsin proposal, now we are
giving him the opportunity to personally approve it by signing
this bill," said Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, a
Republican, in explaining the congressional intervention in what
normally is an executive branch decision.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said that President Bill Clinton has granted waivers
to 38 states, including Wisconsin, to carry out limited welfare
reform experiments, and there was no purpose in the legislation
other than to embarrass the president.
</P>
<P>
In his May 18 radio address, Clinton spoke highly of the
Wisconsin plan as one of the most innovative being proposed by
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
Republicans accused Clinton of trying to steal a Republican
issue just before presumptive Republican presidential nominee Bob
Dole was to make a major address on welfare in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
Under the Social Security Act, the Agriculture and Health and
Human Services departments may waive federal regulations for state
programs as long as the programs meet the objectives of federal
assistance. Congress also has the authority to grant specific
waivers.
</P>
<P>
The Wisconsin waivers will still have to be approved by the
Senate and signed by the president.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the bill would
have no impact on the people of Wisconsin before 1997. He
reiterated the White House policy of trying to review the waiver
requests within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
A larger debate is expected in the coming weeks over the reform
of the national welfare system. Republicans want to link welfare
and Medicaid, providing block grants to the states and letting
them run the programs.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has promised to make major changes in welfare with the
emphasis on giving people the training and jobs they need to get
off welfare rolls, but he has twice vetoed Republican welfare
bills on the grounds that they would eliminate federal guarantees
protecting welfare recipients and their children.
</P>
<P>
The "Wisconsin Works" plan will require most welfare recipients
to get jobs, providing subsidies to employers who hire them and
community service jobs for those who can't find work on their own.
</P>
<P>
It also will eliminate Medicaid and replace it with a health
care plan for the poor through the state's existing health
maintenance organization system.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Rejects Balanced-Budget Constitutional Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate rejected a
balanced-budget constitutional amendment today, as Republicans and
Democrats waged an election-year duel over who could seem most
sincere about erasing federal deficits.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted the proposed amendment with 64-35. That was
two votes shy of the two-thirds margin required for approval of an
amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two Republicans and 12 Democrats voted for the amendment,
while 34 Democrats and one Republican voted no. Sen. Claiborne
Pell from Rhode Island did not vote.
</P>
<P>
The outgoing Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole knew the attempt
would fail but hoped it would embarrass President Clinton and
other Democrats in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
"It's not whether you win or lose, but whether you've made the
statement," said Dole, who will resign from the Senate in five
days to campaign fulltime for the U.S. presidency.
</P>
<P>
Republicans in U.S. Congress said the amendment would provide
the pressure needed to force lawmakers to find the savings
needed to end the huge budget deficit that have saddled the U.S.
government since 1969.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats argued that with Republicans and Clinton having
each proposed plans for erasing government deficits by 2002, what
is needed is a bipartisan agreement, not a change in the
Constitution.

decline in military expenditures, trimming from 7.9 percent of GDP
to 3 percent;
</P>
<P>

percent in 1995;
</P>
<P>

at about 1.2 percent of GDP, the lowest share in the world; and
</P>
<P>
-- Europe and Developing countries in the Middle East, which
historically have recorded the highest levels of military
spending, reduced such expenditures from 8.8 percent to 7 percent
of GDP.

4, 1994, when it was quoted at 109.60 yen.

The dollar traded at 1.5296 German marks late Thursday in New
York, compared with 1.5308 marks Wednesday.

The Bank of England chiseled out a 25-percentage point cut in
its base lending rate to 5.75 percent. The British rate cut was a
surprise partly because analysts saw it as motivated by
Conservative Party desires to improve its standing before
elections occur sometime before May 1997.
</P>
<P>
While the Danes also cut short term rates, the French cut was
considered more justified because France is trying to balance its
books to enable its entry into European monetary union in 1999.

<P>
KIGALI, June 6 (Xinhua) --Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu
today expressed the hope that friendly co-operation between
Rwanda and China will be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
President Bizimungu will start a five-day official visit to
China on June 10 at the invitation of President Jiang Zemin of
the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for him to visit China since he
became president of Rwanda on July 19, 1994.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of his tour to China, the president stressed, in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua, that there exists profound
friendship between Rwanda and China.
</P>
<P>
He said, after the end of the civil war and genocide in July
1994, the Rwandan new government faced arduous work to undertake
all tasks neglected and to reconstruct the homeland.
</P>
<P>
"It is at this difficult time that China has given precious
assistance politically, morally and materially to Rwanda," he
said. China was one of the first countries which resumed their
embassies' work in Kigali in the post-war time, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the aim of his forthcoming visit to China, President
Bizimungu said: "I'm going to China, firstly to express my
government and my people's gratitude to China, and then, to
reinforce this friendship and co-operation between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
The president said that he will, during the visit, brief
Chinese leaders and people on the efforts and the progress made
by his government in the reconstruction of homeland and
rehabilitation of economy after the end of the civil war and
genocide in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the internal situation in Rwanda has became calm
and the security situation obviously improved. "Rwanda has forged
ahead a decisive step along the road to build and strengthen
peace and social security and to reconstruct and rehabilitate the
economy in the country," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, President Bizimungu said, despite about 1.8 million
old and new refugees have returned back home, more than 1.5
million refugees are still staying abroad.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot to be done for the national reconciliation and
reconstruction in the country," he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the president said, Rwanda hopes to continue
getting support from China, adding that the Rwandan people need
more support from China, especially at the time when they are
facing numerous difficulties on the road of economic
rehabilitation and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
President Bizimungu expressed his belief that by his visit,
the friendly co-operation between Rwanda and China will be
further strengthened.
