<HEADLINE> South Korea's Hanbo Head Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chung Tae-soo, general chairman
of South Korea's Hanbo Business Group, was arrested by the
prosecution here tonight on charges of fraud and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
In questioning Thursday, the prosecution confirmed that Chung
had floated bad checks in an attempt to raise funds, and had
diverted part of the bank loans extended to finance capital
investment in his steel mill for unauthorized purposes.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors grilled Chung on how he secured six billion U.S.
dollars in bank loans since 1992 without sufficient collateral,
and how his flagship firm, Hanbo Iron and Steel Company, became
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
With the arrest of Chung, the prosecution will try to determine
if he bribed bank or government officials for the privileged
loans, and whether high-profile figures pressured creditor banks
to give the loans to Hanbo, the 14th largest business group in
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Hanbo Iron and Steel Company was declared bankrupt by its
creditors on January 23 after failing to honor billions of dollars
in notes.
</P>
<P>
The Hanbo case has become a major political issue as the
opposition camp claimed that government officials were
instrumental in helping the debt-ridden firm obtain the loans.
</P>
<P>
On January 27, South Korean President Kim Young-sam ordered the
law enforcement authorities to thoroughly investigate "the
loans-for-kickback" allegations involving the bankrupt Hanbo Iron
and Steel Company.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan's seasonally adjusted
jobless rate in 1996 rose 0.2 percentage points from the previous
year to a record high of 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
For three consecutive years, the rate has registered a new
high, reflecting corporate restructuring efforts and a growing
tendency among young people to quit jobs of their own accord in
search of better occupations, Kyodo News said, quoting the
Management and Coordination Agency.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the 1996 unemployment rate was the fourth
consecutive years' rise.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said the figure coincided with the government's
projection of a 3.4 percent jobless rate for fiscal 1996 which
ends in March. Agency officials said they expected a 3.3 percent
unemployment rate for fiscal 1997, which starts in April.

JOHANNESBURG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Interior
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi is to become acting president of
the country at the weekend, President Nelson Mandela announced
today.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi who doubles as leader of Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP), a rival to Mandela's ruling African National Congress,
would hold the presidency for little more than one day, South
African Press Association said.
</P>
<P>
Making the surprising announcement in the Senate today,
Mandela said both he and Deputy President Thabo Mbeki would be
attending a meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos,
Switzerland, early next week.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the constitution provided that when both he and
his deputy are out of the country, he could appoint an acting
president. He said he had decided to appoint Buthelezi to hold
the position in his absence.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said the president would
return home on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believed that the temporary appointment of
Buthelezi has indicated in some way that although the IFP leader
has time and again criticized the cabinet headed by Mandela, he
still enjoy's Mandela's trust.

<HEADLINE> US Economy Increases by 2.5 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy expanded by
2.5 percent last year as boosted by a strong 4.7 percent growth in
the fourth quarter, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
But the department stressed that the increase in the final
three months was based on preliminary estimates.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) last year
topped the 2 percent advance in 1995 which had been the slowest
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
The high-than-expected expansion in the fourth quarter was led
by quick increases of consumer spending and exports, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
The consumer spending, which accounts for about two thirds of
U.S. economic activities, surged by an annualized 3.4 percent in
the last three months of 1996 following a small 0.5 percent in the
previous quarter, matching the pace of the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Exports shot up at a 25.5 percent rate after falling 0.9
percent in the third quarter. At the same time, import growth
slowed to a 4.7 percent rate from its 9.3 percent July-September
pace.
</P>
<P>
However, business investment in new plants and equipment slowed
to a 2.7 percent growth rate from 10.6 percent in the
July-September quarter.
</P>
<P>
The business inventories subtracted by 2.6 billion dollars in
the fourth quarter after adding 27.4 billion dollars to the GDP in
the previous three months.
</P>
<P>
After adjusting for inflation, the GDP totaled 6.911 trillion
dollars at the end of 1996 end and at an annual rate of 7.0087
trillion in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
The GDP of the U.S. had grown at an rate of 2.1 percent rate in
the third quarter and the growth rates in the first two quarters
were 2 and 4.7 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
A measure of inflation in the GDP report showed prices paid by
U.S. residents rose by 2.1 percent last year. It increased at an
annual rate of 2.5 percent during the final three months, up from
1.9 percent from July through September.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Aims at 5.5 Percent Economic Growth: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's main thrust of this
year's economic policy is a 5.5 percent growth in real gross
domestic product (GDP), while maintaining macro-economic
stability.
</P>
<P>
It was announced here today by Finance Minister Ronald Penza
in his budget address to the national assembly.
</P>
<P>
In the address Penza said inflation rate will be brought down
to 15 percent this year from 35 percent at the end of 1996 and
the government borrowing reduced to make resources available to
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The government spending will be focussed on those areas that
support growth, said Penza.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government will maintain the momentum of
privatization, especially privatizing the Zambia Consolidated
Copper Mines (ZCCM), the country's main economic stay.
</P>
<P>
On this year's budget, he proposed to spend a total of 1,427.1
billion Kwacha (about 1.1 billion U.S. Dollars), of which about
two-thirds will be financed from internal financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Recurrent expenditure will account for about 742 million
Dollars while expenditure on capital programs will be about 356
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
To reduce public spendings, the government will cut the number
of civil servants, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will raise revenues amounting to 1,489.1 billion Kwacha
(about 1.15 billion dollars), thus making a surplus of 50 million
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the economic performance, Penza said the GDP in 1996 grew
by 6.4 percent, compared to a decline of 4.3 percent the previous
year. Inflation declined from 46 percent at the end of 1995 to 35
percent in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year agriculture increased 28.7 percent, mining 12.2
percent, tourism 17.7 percent and non-traditional exports 23
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the mining sector, copper production increased from 307,558
tons in 1995 to 313,003 tons in 1996, Penza said.
</P>
<P>
The privatization and parastatal reform accelerated in 1996
with 95 companies sold, bringing the total number of privatized
companies to 155 since the government began the process in 1992.
</P>
<P>
However, Zambia's export earnings declined by almost 18
percent from 1,185.9 million Dollars in 1995 to 974.9 million
Dollars in 1996 due to lower earnings from copper.
</P>
<P>
Earnings from copper exports decreased to as low as 567.7
million Dollars mainly due to the fall of copper prices in the
international market. In addition the export volume of copper
also dropped from 341,443 tons in 1995 to 327,473 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
But earnings from non-traditional exports continued to grow.
preliminary estimates indicate that their turnover for 1996 will
exceed 230 million Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Provide Housing for All by 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Minister of Public
Construction and National Housing Enos Chikowore today said the
year 2010 is now his ministry's new target for the provision of
housing for all in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ministry previously defined the year 2000 as the deadline,
which the minister said is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwean urban centers have an estimated housing
backlog in excess of 670,000 which, under the current rate of
housing provision, could be over one million by 2010.
</P>
<P>
"But these are people who have registered through us or local
authorities. There should be many more who need houses but have
not been recorded," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the ministry is now working on a strategy to set
a budget for a specific number of houses in each local authority
every year.
</P>
<P>
The pay-for-your-house scheme is attracting more people but
the minister will not say how much money is in the scheme's
coffers.
</P>
<P>
"What we are fighting to do now is to match the increase in
individual contributions with money put up by the government. I
am currently sourcing for about 30 million U.S. Dollars for this
year's projects," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Danish Defense
Minister Hans Haekkerup said today Demark views Zimbabwe as a
very important player in peace-keeping operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, the
minister told journalists here that Denmark is discussing
proposals with Zimbabwe to increase its support for the
Harare-based southern African peace-keeping center.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at good proposals to support the peace-keeping
center in Zimbabwe by building more facilities, supplying people
who can help in the process of planning and increase the number
of courses offered," Haekkerup said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "we feel the southern African defense
forces have an important part to play in the maintenance of
stability in the region and their participation in peace-keeping
operations will become more important in the future."
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Staff College at the army headquarters in Harare
was in 1995 selected as the regional peace-keeping center and has
hosted a number of courses for peace-keepers from the southern
African region. The center has received financial and technical
support from Denmark.
</P>
<P>
Haekkerup, who arrived here on Thursday, also held talks with
Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi. He is expected to
leave here for South Africa tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The minister said, "we feel the South African defense forces

<HEADLINE> Blindness Gene Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) - An international science team in
America discovered a gene for glaucoma, a leading cause of
blindness.
</P>
<P>
The gene could enable doctors to diagnose the disorder before
it causes irreversible damage to the eyes, the team reported in
today's journal Science.
</P>
<P>
Glaucoma progressively destroys peripheral vision, eventually
leading to blindness. It seems to be caused by a build-up of
pressure in the eye which damages cells in the optic nerve, but
very little is known about the mechanism behind it.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, including the molecular geneticists Prof Edwin
Stone and Prof Val Sheffield of the University of Iowa's College of
Medicine, have now come one step closer to unraveling that
mechanism by identifying a gene which is defective in one form of
the disorder, juvenile glaucoma.
</P>
<P>
Juvenile glaucoma is a hereditary disease which can strike as
early as the teens and is particularly virulent. Although it
accounts for fewer than one in 100 cases of glaucoma, there is
evidence that the gene identified by the researchers could also
be responsible for some cases that develop in adulthood - when
most cases occur. In all, it could account for 3 percent of
glaucoma.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's caretaker
government has decided to deregulate the petroleum sector from
March 1 and the process will be completed in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here today at a press conference by Federal
Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Javed Jabbar.
</P>
<P>
Jabbar said the oil marketing companies i.e. Pakistan State
Oil, Shell and Caltex and any new entrants to come, will assume
the task of importing deficit petroleum products by taking
advantage of "opportunity-trading" as available at the

</P>
<P>
The oil marketing companies will also manage the freight pool
system themselves and reduce freight costs, thereby enabling
savings to be invested in expansion of infrastructure and
improvement of services.

He said from July 1, 1998, a freight differential will be
allowed in consumer prices in different zones of the country.

"The cumulative impact of deregulation will be positive and
beneficial for consumers, for the country and for the oil
marketing sector," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
For almost 25 years, the composition of the oil marketing
sector has remained static with the existence of only three
companies i.e. Pakistan State Oil, Shell and Caltex.
</P>
<P>
A new policy with appropriate incentives has been prepared for
attracting exploration investment in off-shore areas which has so
far remained relatively limited, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Jabbar noted that the caretaker cabinet has also approved
reforms to restructure the management of Pakistan's largest
state-owned oil and gas company -- the Oil and Gas Development
Corporation (OGDC).
</P>
<P>
The reform program includes giving the OGDC autonomy to operate
virtually like a modern petroleum company, improving exploration
results, increasing production and, more importantly, increasing
its value before OGDC is offered for partial privatization.

<HEADLINE> One In Five British Children Suffers From 'Glue Ear' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- One child in five in Britain
suffers from "glue ear" for more than half of the first three
years of life British researchers say today.
</P>
<P>
The findings are based on a study of 95 babies born between
1991 and 1993 in Oxfordshire who were visited and tested at home,
every month from birth for up to three years.
</P>
<P>
Seventeen of them were were found to have "glue ear" at more
than half of the visits and 33 at more than a third of the
visits. Children under two were the most prone to the condition.
</P>
<P>
Sarah Hogan, audiological scientist at the University
Laboratory of Physiology, Oxford, said in the British Medical
Journal that the most susceptible children tended to have a
greater number of episodes rather than attacks that lasted longer.
</P>
<P>
Glue ear is an accumulation of fluid in the middle ear which
affects hearing. Frequently it goes undetected. One or both ears
can be affected. Often the only sign that children have the
condition is that parents notice some level of deafness. In
serious cases a small tube called a grommet is inserted surgically
in the eardrum to equalize pressure in the ear and allow it to
drain.
</P>
<P>
The condition causes concern among parents because of the
suggestion that hearing loss in infancy could cause their children
to have difficulty distinguishing sounds in noisy environments
when they are older. The surgery is controversial because the
condition can clear up by itself.
</P>
<P>
Hogan points out that current practice in Britain is "watchful
waiting," with doctors keeping the child under review for a while
before deciding on surgery.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Hosts Meeting to Fight River Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 31 (Xinhua) -- A three-day annual meeting on
river blindness control is being held at Ghana's capital Accra to
assess the impact of the Onchocerciasis Control Program (OCP) in
west Africa, the Pan-African News Agency PANA reported today.
</P>
<P>
Onchocerciasis is a disease caused by the blackfly vector
which abounds in rivers. The disease, also known as river
blindness, is most seriously manifested in blindness and other
visual impairments as well as intense itching, rashes and so on.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being attended by a group of independent
experts who monitor and evaluate the impact of the OCP in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, participants will assess the program in the
past year focusing on the spontaneous repopulation of some of the
oncho-freed areas.
</P>
<P>
They are also expected to recommend measures to reduce the
pressure agricultural and other forest activities may have on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The experts have reportedly expressed their welcome to
resettlement in the fertile areas along rivers previously
deserted for fear of the disease. However, they urged the
governments in the sub-region to direct such activities to
promote sustainable socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The OCP is sponsored by the World Health Organization, United
Nations Development program, the World Bank and the U.N. Food and
Agricultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
The countries covered by the OCP in west Africa are Ghana,
Niger, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea,
Senegal, Burkina Faso, Benin and Togo.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Calls for End of Israeli Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz reiterated here today a call for an end of the
Israeli occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Responding to mounting Israeli threats against Lebanon, the
foreign minister stressed that "an occupation of other countries'
territories does not create a security or peace for the occupier,
but draws responses from the people resisting this occupation."
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held in his office this afternoon,
Boueiz also complained for the world community's failure to
implement its decisions, a reference to U.N. Security Council
Resolution 425, which demands an unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the ball has been thrown to the court of
the Lebanese people and the resistance movement" because of "the
Israeli occupation of Lebanese's lands and the world community's
continuous failure to implement its decisions.
</P>
<P>
"It is the time for Israel to realize that its occupation of
south Lebanon does not ensure a security for Israel but, on the
contrary, causes more costs," the foreign minister underlined.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came in response of statements made by Israeli
leaders following a pre-dawn operation Thursday by guerrillas
targeting an Israeli patrol in the so-called "security zone" in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli officer and two soldiers were killed and
another was wounded in the roadside bomb attack, raising the
number of Israeli casualties to five killed and 14 others
wounded.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, which spearheads
a guerrilla warfare on the last active battlefront of the
Arab-Israeli conflict, claimed responsible for the operation.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday held Syria
responsible for the violence in south Lebanon, citing its close
relations with Hezbollah and its military presence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weisman called on the government not
to resume peace talks with Damascus "as long as such attacks
continue."

<HEADLINE> China Reaffirms Positions on WTO Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of China's
State Planning Commission Chen Jinhua today reaffirmed China's
basic positions on its accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) in Davos.
</P>
<P>
At a session here today on the issue of China Economy in the
annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, Chen said that China
is actively seeking its membership in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The three basic positions that Chen outlined are:
</P>
<P>
-- The WTO would be incomplete without the participation of
China;
</P>
<P>
-- China is a developing not a developed country. Therefore, it
is unreasonable to request too much entrance fee from China;
</P>
<P>
-- It is necessary for China to have a transition period while
it gradually meets the relevant requirements of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government will take a realistic and flexible
attitude to promote the process of its accession," Chen said,
adding that China's accession to the WTO will "not only benefit
the growth of China's economy but also the development of the
world economy."
</P>
<P>
"We greatly appreciate the support to China's accession to the
WTO from various economies," Chen said. "We also welcome the
flexibility shown by the United States and other developed
countries toward this issue."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this problem will be solved as soon as possible
and we will be ready to cooperate effectively with the WTO members
to promote the prosperity of global economy and trade," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
About 150 participants filled the session room and discussed
issues concerning China.

<HEADLINE> Britain Wins 25 Pct of World Defense Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The British Ministry of Defense
confirmed today that Britain has captured a record 25 percent of
the world arms market, nearly doubling its share of the market
over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Procurement Minister James Arbuthnot said in a
statement today that Britain won a quarter of the world market in
guns, fighter planes, helicopters and other defense equipment last
year.
</P>
<P>
"1996 was another very successful year for British defense
companies with a provisional figure of 5.1 billion pounds (about
8.26 billion U.S. dollars) worth of business achieved during the
year," Arbuthnot said.
</P>
<P>
"This represents 25 percent of the world market, an all-time
record for the UK and companies with figures of 16 percent in 1994
and 19 percent in 1995," he added.
</P>
<P>
Britain is now the second largest defense exporter in the
world, only behind the United States, which captured 34 percent of
the global arms trade last year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Acting Presidency, Mandela's Good </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) Mangosuthu Buthelezi may have never dreamed
to become a two-day president of South Africa, but it will be
true to the opposition party chief in the cabinet headed by
President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela announced at a senate meeting today to appoint Home
Affairs Minister Buthelezi to be acting president when he and
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki are due to attend a meeting of the
World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland scheduled for early
next week.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he made the appointment in accordance with the
South African constitution, under which the state president can
appoint an acting person while both president and deputy
president are absent from South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki is already in Switzerland. Mandela is due to leave for
the meeting on Sunday, and will return home next Tuesday, a
president spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, Acting President Buthelezi will
enjoy all the powers of the president, including the authority to
call cabinet meetings, confer honors, appoint ambassadors,
negotiate international agreements, appoint commissions of
enquiry, and pardon or reprieve offenders.
</P>
<P>
What is more important, the IFP leader will also briefly
become commander-in-chief of the South African armed forces in
the coming two days.
</P>
<P>
Local observers said Buthelezi, who called on IFP supporters
to replace the ruling African National Congress (ANC) to run the
country a few days ago, has apparently not expected to enjoy such
a lot of important powers so quickly.
</P>
<P>
Soon after Mandela's appointment, Buthelezi issued a
statement, saying he was "filled with awe" at the prospect of
being acting president of South Africa, even if it will be for
only a few hours.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts believe that Mandela's temporary
appointment of Buthelezi not only indicates the President's
friendly gesture and political trust in the IFP chief, but will
pave the way for improving relations between the ANC and the IFP,
two major black rivals in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The IFP, representing eight million Zulu people in the
country, is the sole major party besides the ANC to hold posts in
the government of national unity. It has been demanding
autonomous jurisdiction in Kwazulu Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
However, since the demand has been opposed by Mandela and the
ANC, it has been widely speculated that the IFP will sooner or
later withdraw from the government.
</P>
<P>
The National Party, which is dominated by the white people and
trys to set up a political alliance with the IFP for the next
general elections, withdrew from the cabinet last May.
</P>
<P>
Following Mandela's latest appointment of Bethelezi, it is
likely to help the ANC win more support from black people in the
country to meet challenge from the National Party in 1999
national elections, the analysts said.

pollution, or violence while grazing out of the river.

<HEADLINE> Samsung Electronics Plans to Buy AST </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Samsung Electronics
Company of the Republic of Korea said that it would acquire the 51
percent of AST Research of 162 million U.S. dollars it does not
already own in an effort to end troubles of the U.S. personal
computer maker.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that since June 1995, AST,
based in Irvine, California, has been plagued by losses.
</P>
<P>
AST said late Thursday that its loss for the fourth quarter
narrowed to 68 million U.S. dollars, or 1.18 U.S. dollars a share,
from 128.6 million U.S. dollars, or 2.88 U.S. dollars a share in
the quarter a year earlier. For all of 1996, AST's losses widened
to 417.7 million U.S. dollars from 263.2 million U.S. dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
As part of the offer, Samsung would also assume 307 million
U.S. dollars in debt. Samsung first bought a 40.25 percent stake
in AST for 378 million U.S. dollars in March 1995, and has since
gradually increased its stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said AST's downfall reflected both the increasing
competitiveness of the personal computer market and the company's
own strategic missteps.
</P>
<P>
Even after the Compaq Computer Corporation and other top-tier
manufacturers slashed prices and went head-to-head with the
cheapest clones, AST clung to its old sales policy.
</P>
<P>
The paper said whether Samsung can make a success of AST's
business under that brand name or its own remains to be seen.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Marks Anti-Smoking Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Committee for
International Exchange of Medical Students (YUMSIC) marked Friday
as "Fight Smoking Day" by founding a section to fight smoking.
</P>
<P>
The YUMSIC will conduct an anti-smoking campaign in cooperation
with the World Health Organization until May 31, when this day is
marked worldwide, said a statement released by the YUMSIC.
</P>
<P>
It said there are about 1.1 billion smokers in the world, about
300 million of whom are in developed countries (200 million men
and 100 million women). The number of smokers in developing
countries is 800 million.
</P>
<P>
About 48 percent of men and 12 percent of women of the world
population are smokers, the YUMSIC said.
</P>
<P>
According to health experts, 1 million people die each year in
the world as a result of smoking, and the number of people who die
due to consequences of smoking is likely to rise to 10 million by
the year 2020 unless the situation changes.
</P>
<P>
The YUMSIC said smoking is one of the greatest challenges
facing public health organizations ahead of the 21st century and
it urged smoking addicts to give up the bad habit. It also called
on health organizations in Yugoslavia to take efficient measures
to prevent harmful consequences of smoking.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reiterates Proposals on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian proposals for an
international conference and a permanent monitoring committee on
Cyprus are still on the table, a Russian Foreign Ministry
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Vladmir Tchizhov, Head of the third directorate for European
Affairs of the Russian Foreign Ministry made the remarks after
meeting with the Cypriot Acting President and President of the
House of Representatives, Spyros Kyprianou.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press after the meeting, Tchizhov reaffirmed
Russia's active involvement in efforts towards a Cyprus
settlement, saying that the Russian proposal for an international
conference on Cyprus is "still on" and remains on the table
until all those who are to participate are ready to do so.
</P>
<P>
Also on the table is Moscow's proposal, put forward last
April, concerning the setting up of a permanent monitoring
committee, composed of the five permanent members of the
U.N. Security Council to assist the U.N. Secretary-General in his
good offices mission, the Russian official said.
</P>
<P>
Tchizhov, who arrived here Thursday night on a five-day
fact-finding mission, added that "we will look into the positions
of the Cyprus government and the Turkish Cypriot side on the
Cyprus problem as well as those of Greece, Turkey, the
U.N. Security Council and the European Union."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Acting President Kyprianou said that the
Russian involvement in the Cyprus peace process is being
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.N. Security-General should have the
leading role in efforts toward a solution and the permanent
members of the U.N. Security Council have the right and the
obligation to participate.
</P>
<P>
Tchizhov also had a meeting this afternoon with the U.N.
Secretary-General's special representative for Cyprus Han Sung
Joo, who is currently in Cyprus, and U.N. resident
representative Gustave Feissel.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cyprus, the Russian envoy will cross
into the Turkish-controlled part of the island to meet Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The Russian envoy's visit is part of recent intensified
international community's peace efforts in the wake of the
tension on this Eastern Mediterranean island following Cyprus
government's decision to buy Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remained partitioned since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup by some Greek Cypriots seeking union with
Greece.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Defense Minister Calls For Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Defense
minister, Yitzhak Mordechai, today reiterated desire to resume
peace talks with Syria, according to a report of the
state-owned Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai made the statement when he was visiting a wounded
soldier in Rambam Hospital of Haifa, north Israel.
</P>
<P>
The soldier was wounded in a roadside bomb attack by the
Lebanese guerrilla group Hezbollah inside the Israeli occupied
security zone late Wednesday night. Three soldiers were killed in
the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai told reporters that Israel wants to renew peace
talks as a way to prevent further violence and bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes it is possible to reach an understanding
over Lebanon within a matter of days.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army Chief of General Staff Lt.-Gen. Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, who accompanied Mordechai during the visit, said
that the Lebanese government is not willing, nor is able to take
responsibility for the developments in the south and, therefore,
there is no one for Israel to reach an agreement with.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Foreign Minister David Levy charged that Syria
should bear responsibility for the deaths of the three
soldiers from an elite Nahal Brigade unit.
</P>
<P>
Levy was speaking in Paris after meeting with French leaders.
He accused Damascus of continuing to allow arms to pass from
Iran to Lebanon, a practice which, he said, is not conducive
to achieving peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli foreign minister said that he did not relay a
message to Syria through France. He added that it was up to
the Syrians to create a right atmosphere for peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But Syrian Ambassador to the U.S. Walid Mualem has denied
that his country supports Hezbollah in its attacks against
Israel in South Lebanon, according to a report from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Mualem said that Syria is interested in resuming peace
negotiations with Israel, but it wants to start again at the
same point it left off with the previous Israeli government
last March.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania, Russia to Hold Talks on Cold-War-Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania and Russia are
to begin crucial talks on the settlement of the 600 million U.S.
Dollar debt which had been contracted before the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Treasury sources said today.
</P>
<P>
A wrangle over payment of the debt emerged in the early 1990s
when Moscow started perusal of its books on aid and credit to
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the talks will focus on the size of the
amount owed by Dar es Salaam to Moscow and the formula of
payment, with consideration of the unstable exchanges rates of
the Tanzania Shilling and the Russian Rouble since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Acting Finance Minister Daniel Yona has recently told
reporters here that the negotiations would get under way soon.
</P>
<P>
"We are due to start talks with Russia very soon," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The debt was bloated due to the massive aid the former Soviet
Union extended to the armed liberation movements in southern
African countries such as Mozambique, Angola, Namibia, Zimbabwe
and South Africa. enditem

<HEADLINE> Syrian Vice President Arrives in Yemen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President
Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-shara arrived
here this afternoon on a state visit to Yemen.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, Khaddam told

</P>
<P>
The message also dealt with current situation in the Arab
region and the Arab-Israeli conflict, he added.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam pointed out that the incumbent Israeli government
adopted a hardline policy rejecting withdrawal from the occupied
Arab territories and insisting on "aggression and hegemony"
politics in the region.
</P>
<P>
Syria is willing to restart the peace talks with Israel on the
foundations of what has been established and hopes for a clear
Arab consensus in facing up to the Israeli stubborn policies, he
underlined.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Syria's endeavor to getting support from the

<HEADLINE> Russian FM to Visit NATO: NATO Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov will come to Brussels on February 23 to meet NATO
Secretary General Javier Solana for the second round of talks over
NATO's plans for eastward expansion, a NATO official said today.
</P>
<P>
The official did not tell reporters further details about the
coming meeting, but said that at the moment NATO was expecting the
working-level discussion scheduled for February 10 in Brussels
between a Russian vice foreign minister and Gebhardt von Monltka,
NATO secretary general assistant for political affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said the two senior officials' discussion would particularly
focus on establishing a consultation mechanism between NATO and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
According to NATO sources, Russian Ambassador to NATO Vitali
Churkin has handed over this week to NATO a "think piece" of
Russia on the consultation mechanism.
</P>
<P>
No breakthrough was achieved during the first round negotiation
in Moscow last week when Solana held five-hour talks with Minister
Primakov.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, Solana has reportedly offered Russia a package
including a special consultative status that would give Russia a
seat at NATO's table, but not a veto right which was demanded by
Russia, especially on issues concerning its "vital interests."
</P>
<P>
NATO's eastward expansion plans have been strongly opposed by
Russia, who claimed that NATO enlargement would inevitably create
a division line in Europe and threaten Russia's national
interests.
</P>
<P>
Both NATO and Russia are trying to reach agreement before the
NATO Madrid summit in July, at which the alliance is expected to
issue formal membership invitations to the Czech Republic, Hungary
and Poland.

<HEADLINE> British PM Announces Program for Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The British ruling party
unveiled today detailed proposals to create a "popular capitalism
for the 21st century" by encouraging broader share ownership and
more flexible private pensions.
</P>
<P>
The party leader, Prime Minister John Major, told a press
conference, "In the 1980s we set the economy free. Now we must
offer people more freedom over decisions that affect their lives."
</P>
<P>
The coming century "will be a new era of more opportunity,
wider choice and more personal ownership of assets," Major said.
</P>
<P>
The number of Britons who own shares has trebled to around 10
million since the Conservatives came to power in 1979.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is for everyone to have a People's Share in our
enterprise economy," the prime minister declared.
</P>
<P>
Millions more will become shareholders for the first time in
1997 when a number of big building societies, which provide the
bulk of Britain's home loans, become publicly quoted companies and
hand out free shares to their savers and borrowers.
</P>
<P>
To reinforce this trend, Major said the Conservative government
would change tax rules so big companies would have an incentive to
give free shares to staff who invested in employee share ownership
schemes.
</P>
<P>
Major expressed the hope that by the turn of the century more
than half of the employees of Britain's largest companies would
own shares or options in their companies.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also announced plans to make personal
pension schemes more flexible and to cut the local taxes paid by
small businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Referring to an opinion poll carried in the Times newspaper,
which shows the Labor Party's lead had risen by four points since
early December to 55 percent, while the Conservatives' support
stayed static at 30 percent, Major dismissed it as "complete
rubbish."
</P>
<P>
He said the Conservatives' own polling painted a very different
picture and he predicted the party would go on to win an
unprecedented fifth election in a row.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Glasgow today, Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine was even more forthright, saying that his party would
"romp home" at the election with a majority of 60 seats.
</P>
<P>
Major refused to give any clues about when he would call the
election. "I will pick my own time, I will do it in my own way and
I'm giving you no nods, no winks," he said.

<HEADLINE> Twenty Seven Inmates Escape from Greek Prison </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven inmates escaped
from Larisa prison in central Greece this afternoon and some of

guards.

<HEADLINE> UN Secretary-General Wants to See China in WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAVOS, SWITZERLAND, February 1 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here today that he would like to
see China become a member of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"I think that it is important that China, with the size of its
economy and population, should play a part in the WTO," Annan told
Xinhua, after giving a speech at the plenary session of the 27th
annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
</P>
<P>
"I know negotiations are going on. I'm not too well informed at
this stage of the details of the negotiations, but I personally
would want to see China as a member of the WTO," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his speech entitled "Building Partnerships to Address the
Challenges of Globalization", Annan said that for both the United
Nations system and the private sector, the goal for the 21st
century was nothing less than the creation of a true global
economy.
</P>
<P>
To fulfil the goal, Annan said, a new partnership among
governments, the private sector and the international community
should be created.
</P>
<P>
He said traditional dogma of North and South should be
abandoned. "In every country of the North there is a bit of the
South; in every South there is a North.
</P>
<P>
"Today there is a clear and demonstrable link between
profitability and raising living standards for the world's poorest
people ... profitability and equity are not mutually exclusive
goals." Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who took office as UN Secretary-General on January 1,
1997, also urged all member states to meet their financial
obligations to the UN in full, but he did not mention the United
States in his speech.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Voices Support to Iran in Resisting Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Ignoring U.S. containment policy
towards Iran, Qatar today said it stood on the Iranian side in
keeping the influence of foreign powers out off the region.
</P>
<P>
This was expressed by the visiting Qatari Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Bin Jaber al Thani when he conveyed a
message from Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa al-Thani to
Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's official news
agency IRNA reported.
</P>
<P>
He said his country regards Iranian peace efforts in the
Persian Gulf as effective in stopping foreign intervention in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Qatar greatly values the principled efforts of Iran
in order to strengthen and maintain regional ties and to prevent
the influence of outsiders in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister said Qatar's diplomacy has focused
on strengthening relations with friendly neighbor Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said Tehran-Doha relations would serve as a model for
regional cooperation, adding that Qatar attaches importance to
Iran's principled efforts to develop peace and security in what he
termed as the sensitive and strategic region of the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The IRNA report quoted Rafsanjani as voicing Iran's willingness
to develop multi-faceted cooperation with the neighboring states
in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is ready to offer economic, industrial and
technical assistance to the neighboring states in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after his arrival in the airport this morning, Bin
Jassem said that Qatar favors continuation of Tehran-Doha
consultations, adding that the latest developments in the region
and bilateral ties are discussed in regular meetings by the
officials of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On security of the Gulf, he said that the security of the
Gulf region is of vital importance for all littoral states
requiring their full cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Qatar is for establishment of security in the
Gulf region and wants the region to remain immune of any
crisis. He said that Qatar is determined to contribute to this
goal as much as possible.

Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati greeted his Qatari
counterpart at the airport and said that the current visit is part
of regular exchange of visits between officials of the two
countries held to discuss bilateral relations and regional
developments.

active part in Qatar's economy activities and major construction
projects.

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Praises Proposals on HK's Existing Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The first Chief Executive of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa
said today that the two decisions and a suggestion passed at the
eighth plenary session of the Preparatory Committee of the HK SAR
reflect the spirit of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong", and high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa said at a press conference in Beijing that he
hopes Hong Kong people will work conscientiously and contribute
more to the smooth transition and the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting approved the decision mandating that the
first Chief Executive and the Provisional Legislative Council of
the HK SAR will start their work before June 30, 1997, the
decision on the establishment of the provisional regional
organizations in the HK SAR, and a suggestion on how to handle the
original laws of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the remarks made recently by Hong Kong Governor
Chris Patten about the Legal Panel's suggestion on how to handle
the original laws of Hong Kong are incorrect. He added that the
Basic Law fully guarantees the freedom and rights of Hong Kong
residents.
</P>
<P>
He said it contravenes the Basic Law that some provisions of
the Bill of Rights Ordinance make the ordinance superior to the
common law of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The British Hong Kong authorities made some revisions to the
Societies Ordinance and the Security Ordinance without consulting
the Chinese side, thus violating the Basic Law and the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Preparatory Committee decided not to adopt the
parts of the two ordinances that have been changed by the British
Hong Kong authorities, he said.
</P>
<P>
How the laws will be dealt with is up to the people of Hong
Kong, Tung said.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Preparatory Committee's Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Increased national strength,
political stability and an advancing economy are fundamental for
the smooth operation of the Preparatory Committee and its
achievements, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
And the creativity and vitality of the "one country, two
systems" principle is fully reflected in China's practice to
resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, Qian noted in
his closing speech at the eighth plenary session of the
Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
Qian, also the committee's chairman, said the majority of Hong
Kong people showed unprecedented enthusiasm for the opportunity to
participate in the preparatory work of the SAR -- a chance that
also gave them a sense of duty and of being their own master.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the principle of "catering to the Hong Kong
people and relying on them" insisted by the Preparatory Committee,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Each achievement made by the Preparatory Committee reveals the
hard work and wisdom of each member of the committee, he said,
when reviewing the six major events completed by the committee
over the past year.
</P>
<P>
The six events are as follows:
</P>
<P>
-- Forming the Selection Committee, composed of 400 permanent
Hong Kong residents;
</P>
<P>
-- Electing the first Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region;
</P>
<P>
-- Forming the 60-member Provisional Legislative Council
through election;
</P>
<P>
-- Putting forward opinions on how to handle the existing Hong
Kong laws;
</P>
<P>
-- Making suggestions on a series of economic issues related to
the transition; and
</P>
<P>
-- Helping to establish a committee in charge of the
celebrations to mark Hong Kong's return.
</P>
<P>
The work report of the Preparatory Committee will be presented
to the fifth session of the eighth National People's Congress,
which will be held next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also extended new year greetings to the Preparatory
Committee members, wishing the smooth success of Hong Kong's
return.

WASHINGTON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. economy grew at a surprisingly vigorous 4.7 percent
pace during the final 1996 quarter, more than twice as fast as
during the summer, while the inflation fell to the lowest level in
three decades, the government reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori flew to Toronto on
Friday to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to
discuss Peru's handling of the hostage siege at the Japanese
Embassy residence in Lima.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The White House moved on Friday to ease congressional
concerns over President Bill Clinton's nominee for labor
secretary, hoping to quell a furor over her role in a
controversial political gathering before it has a chance to
escalate and threaten her confirmation.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 50 years after World War II, a stream of fresh
revelations about the extent of Europe's collaboration with Nazi
Germany is forcing a new generation of political leaders to
acknowledge a legacy of guilt and review the lessons of the past.

<HEADLINE> China Ties U.S. 1-1 in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese national squad
was held to a 1-1 tie on Saturday by the U.S. team in the last of
their two-leg soccer friendly series in China.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team, which went down 1-2 to China in their first
match in Kunming on Wednesday, went all out for the revenge.
Their effort paid off when Alexi Lalas, U.S. footballer of 1995,
opened the scorings with a header on a corner kick in the 24th
minute.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. advantage did not last long as the home team
pulled back 1-1 just eight minutes later through Su Maozhen. Su
headed the goal on a pass from his teammate Pen Weiguo in a
Chinese counter-attack.
</P>
<P>
China dominated the game in the second half, pushing their
U.S. equivalents to a defensive style.
</P>
<P>
The best chance came in the 82nd minute when teenager Li Jinyun
made a solo rounding off several American defenders before
American veteran Lalas had to stop him with a rough drag, which
saw him off after getting two yellow cards in the match.
</P>
<P>
Though capitalising on the 11-10 advantage, the Chinese failed
to convert the second goal in the last eight minutes.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Backs Syrian Negotiation Stance on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Yemen today affirmed its support
for the Syrian position on the talks with Israel to regain Syria's
Golan Heights, which was seized by Israel in 1967.
</P>
<P>
An editorial carried by the state-run local daily "Al-Thawrah"
expressed the support for Syria under the title "Yemen, Syria and
the Just Peace."
</P>
<P>
Yemen reiterated its support for the Middle East peace process
with a very clear vision of the principles and conditions that
should form the basis for peace.
</P>
<P>
The editorial stressed that the most important principle is to
establish a just, comprehensive and lasting peace, which requires
an Israeli withdrawal from the Syrian Golan Heights, south Lebanon
and East Jerusalem where Israel is expanding its settlements.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is fully aware that the expansion of its settlements in
the occupied Arab territories counters the Oslo accord, hinders
the peace process and plants thorns on the road to the final
status talks, due to start next year between Israel and
Palestine," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
After the signing of the Hebron deal recently, many Israeli
officials have reportedly called for resumption of the peace talks
with Syria provided that the talks return to the zero point
without pledging to return the Golan to Syria.
</P>
<P>
In response, Syria expressed readiness to restart the talks but
on the bases of land-for-peace principle, the provisions of the
Madrid peace conference and Israel's pledge to pull out from the
Golan, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
It underlined that the persistence of the Likud government in
ignoring the commitments of Israel's previous government is "an
unjustifiable stubbornness."

LONDON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A furious row between the

<HEADLINE> Report: Israel Worried over US Arms Sale To Arab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli military planners
are worried over massive U.S. arms sales to Arab states,
according to the latest issue of English bi-weekly The Jerusalem
Report.
</P>
<P>
In a recent round of secret strategic talks, senior Israeli
officials complained that the vast quantities and high quality of
the weapons being sold to the Arab world threatened Israel's
technological edge, according to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
The officials warned that the Arabs now had a much greater
offensive capability than ever before.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, the U.S. has sold Egypt, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia and the Gulf states 600 fighters including F-15, F16 and
F-18, 3,000 tanks including M-A1, M-A2 and M60-A3, hundreds of
mobile artillery pieces, dozens of Apache helicopter gunships,
thousands of Tau A-2 anti-tank missiles, sophisticated air-to-air
missiles, naval vessels and Patriot air defense systems, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
The sales in 1995 were worth 7 billion dollars, and in 1996 an
estimated 8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Israeli officials believe, Egypt's air
force now has what they called "strategic penetration capacity"
-- the ability to get inside Israeli air space and drop
bombs -- as well as unprecedentedly sophisticated air-to-air and
air-to-ground weapons.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that Egypt still sees Israel as its greatest
threat, stressing that a recent large-scale "Badr" exercise in
the Sinai was directed against a hypothetical Israeli enemy.
</P>
<P>
In the strategic talks, the Israelis suggested the U.S. not
sell any weapons to the Arabs for which Israel lacks an
adequate military answer. It is not clear whether the Americans
gave any commitments along these lines.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Condemns U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today condemned a United
States government report that put Nigeria's human rights
situation under fresh attack.
</P>
<P>
In its latest annual review of human rights in 194 nations
which was issued here on Friday, the U.S. described the situation
in Nigeria as "dismal".
</P>
<P>
Condemning the U.S. report, Nigerian Special Duties Minister
Alhaji Wada Nas said the United States should have focused on
human rights abuses in its own country rather than elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"The United States made a mistake if they did not include
themselves on the list of countries they indicted," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
He said the Nigerian government has not committed any human
rights abuses or done anything that was abnormal including the
arrest of three former presidential candidates as the U.S. report
cited.
</P>
<P>
"They must have committed a crime or rather; they are being
suspected of committing a crime."
</P>
<P>
The detained politicians have not been charged in court
because investigations on them have not been completed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government, in its human rights report, called on the
Nigerian government to release political prisoners detained
without court charges and ease the restriction on the press.
</P>
<P>
"The detention of Nigerians for essentially political reasons,
including the presumed winner of the 1993 presidential elections,
M.K.O. Abiola, is inconsistent with the openness and tolerance of
dissent that characterizes a truly democratic transition
process," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"These detentions continue to undermine te credibility of the
transition process and the Nigerian government's stated
commitment to return to civilian, democratic rule on October 1,
1998," said the report.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's military government reiterated its determination to
hand over power to an elected government. The agenda of the
three-year transition to civil rule program announced in October
1995 has been basically followed with minor modifications.
</P>
<P>
It, however, has been under constant attacks by western
countries over its human rights record, particularly following
the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and another eight Ogoni activists
in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth immediately suspended Nigeria's membership
and has, together with the European Union and the U.S., imposed
sanctions on it.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Keeping Hong Kong's original
laws basically unchanged is crucial for the region's long-term
stability and prosperity, and is the responsibility of both China
and Britain, Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen said today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the eighth plenary session of the Preparatory
Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
Qian, also the committee's chairman, said it is necessary to
maintain Sino-British cooperation in the late stages of the
transition period, adding that this will benefit both sides, as
well as Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Qian said he expects to meet with the British secretary of
state for foreign and commonwealth affairs in Singapore in two
weeks. "I hope the meeting will take place in a constructive
atmosphere, and that there will be more cooperation and less
trouble," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian pointed out that the Chinese government's policy to retain
Hong Kong's original laws basically as they are has been included
in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and the Chinese side has
abided by its commitment for years.
</P>
<P>
Regrettably, the British side unilaterally made numerous
changes to the existing Hong Kong laws, in spite of opposition
from the Chinese side, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted the method of handling the existing Hong Kong laws
passed by the Preparatory Committee is reasonable and
lenient.

<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Three documents concerned with
Hong Kong's transition were approved at the eighth plenary session
of the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR), which closed today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The three documents included the decision mandating that the
first Chief Executive and the Provisional Legislative Council of
the Hong Kong SAR will start their work before June 30, 1997; the
decision on the establishment of provisional regional
organizations in the Hong Kong SAR; and a suggestion on how
to handle the original laws of Hong Kong, according to a press
communique issued at the end of meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held these documents fully reflect the principles
of "one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong", and a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The two-day session was presided over by Wang Hanbin,
vice-chairman of the Preparatory Committee. The committee's
chairman, Qian Qichen, delivered the opening and closing speeches.
</P>
<P>
It was concluded that the first Chief Executive and the
Provisional Legislative Council must begin preparatory work
concerning the formation of the SAR before June 30.
</P>
<P>
This is necessary for guaranteeing the normal operation of the
SAR when it is established, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The Urban Council, the Regional Council and the District Boards
of the British Hong Kong authorities will cease to exist with the
ending of the British rule of Hong Kong, it said.
</P>
<P>
As the first regional organizations cannot be formed
immediately after July 1, 1997, the smooth transition will be
aided if provisional regional organizations are established, it
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR government will be responsible for forming
these organizations, and their members will be appointed by the
Chief Executive.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Denies Other Riots Aside from Kahatex Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- There was no other riots in
Sumedang and Bandung, capital of West Java province on Friday
aside from the one at the Kahatex textile factory, an Indonesian
military officer said.
</P>
<P>
There was no other riots although rumors developed that
Bandung, Sumedang and their surrounding areas were rocked by
unrest, Chief of the local military area, Col. H.M. Yasin said
last night in Bandung, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Kahatex textile factory was hit by a riot as about 5,000
laborers launched a strike starting from 6:00 a.m. local time on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The strike was over better wage, better working condition and
the Idul Fitri post-fasting holiday allowance.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Muslims are to celebrate the Idul Fitri on February
9 and 10.
</P>
<P>
The factory is located on the Rancaekek main road in Sumedang,
about 25 kilometers from Bandung.
</P>
<P>
At least 68 cars, one motor bike, and 60 bikes belonging to the
factory were destroyed during the riot.
</P>
<P>
Although the factory was almost burned down, there was no
reports on those injured or killed in the riot.
</P>
<P>
Yasin said the riot showed that there had been no smooth
communications between the management and the laborers about many
important issues.
</P>
<P>
Kahatex is one of the largest textile factories in West Java
and it employs no less than 9,000 laborers.
</P>
<P>
Since last July, Indonesia has been hit by a series of riots in
Jakarta, East Java, West Java and West Kalimantan during which 12
people were killed and scores injured as well as hundreds of
public buildings, shops and houses were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
However, government officials have said recently that despite
current riots in the country, political stability and security
were under control.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Trade Deficit Hits Record High in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit hit a
record high of 3.48 billion U.S. dollars, up 1.35 billion dollars
from the 2.13 billion in the same period of last year, the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said today.
</P>
<P>
In January, the country's exports stood at 9.11 billion
dollars, down 8.2 percent over the previous year, while imports
amounted to 12.59 billion, up 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit last month increased 210 million dollars
compared with the 3.27 billion in August,1996, the previous
monthly record high.
</P>
<P>
Semiconductor exports reached merely 1.22 billion U.S. dollars
in the month, down 966 million dollars over the same period of
last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the sharp rise of trade deficit to
an export loss of 317 million U.S. dollars in automobiles and
general machinery, due to the nationwide strikes against a
controversial labor law starting on December 26 of last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, South Korea's trade deficit amounted to 20.4 billion
U.S. dollars, 13 billion U.S. dollars more than the seven billion
U.S. dollars estimated by the government, with exports slightly up
3.8 percent from the 1995 figure to 129.8 billion dollars and
imports soaring 11.2 percent to 150.2 billion.

passengers, including the co-pilot, according to press reports
today.

According to the report, the Brazilian-made EMB 100 plane was
on its way to Jos in the north from Lagos in the southwest.

airport, where, eyewitnesses are quoted as saying, the plane
hovered for about one hour before it cash-landed.
</P>
<P>
Federal Airport Authority of Nigeria Acting Managing Director
Isaac Sakpere confirmed the crash but was not forthcoming on

</P>
<P>
Nigerians were rocked by a spate of aviation tragedies in the
past year. The most serious incident occurred in November when a

<P>
HONG KONG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of the Chinese
Society of Macroeconomics (CSM) from China's inland areas ended a
seven-day visit to Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
Invited by the Hong Kong Business and Professionals Federation
(BPF), the delegation led by CSM President Fang Weizhong exchanged
views with BPF on Hong Kong's financial market and economic
development in the Chinese inland areas.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar jointly held by the two sides earlier this week,
She Jianming, member of the delegation and vice-minister of the
State Planning Commission, said China's national economy will
continue experiencing a steady but fast growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote address entitled "Economic Perspective of
Contemporary China," he said measures taken so far in the inland
areas have resulted in remarkable successes in 1996, meeting the
objectives set by the Chinese National People's Congress earlier
in the year.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the integration of macro-economics control
measures and economic reform has not disturbed a proper balance
among development, reform and stability, and the living standard
of Chinese people both in rural and urban areas has risen.
</P>
<P>
Rafael Hui, financial secretary of the Hong Kong government,
said that in the past few years Hong Kong has gained rich
experience in the development of financial and securities markets
which will be shared with the counterparts in the Chinese inland
areas.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the financial sectors of both sides will
continue their cooperation after Hong Kong returns to its
motherland in mid-1997.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's AirAsia Plans to Fly to Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Asian Countries Soon
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- AirAsia, Malaysia's
second national carrier, plans to spread its wings to China, India
and Indonesia soon, its Director Tik Mustaffa said today.
</P>
<P>
The Transport Ministry has pledged to give an answer soon to
AirAsia's request to fly to the three countries, he told reporters
at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport near here before joining
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on the flight to the country's
famous tourist resort Langkawi in the northwest on board AirAsia's
latest aircraft, a Boeing 737-300.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737-300, leased from GE (General Electric) Capital
Aviation Services Ltd. of the United States for 320,000 US dollars
a month, is the second aircraft for AirAsia, which began
operations last November.
</P>
<P>
AirAsia currently flies to Pattaya, South Thailand, and Taipei
via Kota Kinabalu, capital of Sabah state, East Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The AirAsia official said in the long term, the company plans
to fly to other destinations, apart from Asia, like Europe and
West Asia.
</P>
<P>
"AirAsia will have to get more aircraft by leasing them," he
said, adding AirAsia would lease two more 230-seater Boeing 757
aircraft by the last quarter of this year, bringing the total
number of aircraft owned by the company to four.
</P>
<P>
He said AirAsia might also operate domestic flights if it was
feasible.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Court Sentences Embezzlers to Death, Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A court in Ho Chi Mihn City
Friday sentenced four people to death for their embezzlement of
293 billion Vietnamese Dong (about 27 million U.S. dollars) of
state funds.
</P>
<P>
Other 16 people involved received sentences from three years to
life imprisonment in this believed to have been the country's
largest-ever case of corruption.
</P>
<P>
Those sentenced to death include Pham Huy Phuoc, director of
the now defunct Tan Binh District Import-Export Company (Tamexco),
Tran Quang Vinh, director of Binh Gia Company Limited, Le Minh
Hai, director of Dolphin Company, and Le Duc Canh, director of
Notary Public No.1 of Ba Ria-Vung Tau Province.
</P>
<P>
Phuoc was found to have embezzled 144.8 billion Dong ($13
million) while Vinh was accused of creating false documents about land
sales, embezzling 46.8 billion Dong ($4.3 million), and bribing
Canh, who provided certification on the false estimates of land
prices.
</P>
<P>
Phuoc and his accomplices, together with bribed bankers and
Notary Public officials, laundered the embezzled money by buying
plots of land in Ho Chi Minh City and the nearby southern coastal
province of Ba Ria-Vung Tau at very expensive prices.
</P>
<P>
The land was mortgaged by the First-Vina Bank and Vietcombank
Ho Chi Minh City, with all parties making millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Le Van Phuc, Phuoc's brother-in-law, was sentenced
to life imprisonment for embezzling 2.9 billion Dong (264,000
dollars) and Ngo Van Ho, chief accountant at Tamexco, received a
20-year sentence for assisting Phuoc.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Duy Lo, Nyuyen Manh Thuy and Nguyen Ven De, three
officials of the Vietcombank, and general director of the
First-Vina Bank Tran Linh were also sentenced to three to 15 years
in jail for deliberate violation of state regulations on financial
management.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Decides to Buy British Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has decided to
purchase British Sea Skua surface-to-surface missiles valued at
about 100 million U.S. dollars, according to an official source
here today.
</P>
<P>
One Kuwaiti military source said on condition of anonymity
that final studies conducted by the Defense Ministry concerning
the purchase of the British missiles showed that the deal
was in conformity with the "army regulations and standards."
</P>
<P>
British Aerospace and France's Aerospatiale were competing for
the contract. Kuwait has chosen British Aeirospace's Sea Skua
missile over MM-15 missiles made by France's Aerospatiale for
installation on eight fast patrol boats worth 500 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The patrol boats made by Constructions Mecaniques De
Normandie will be delivered over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Defense Ministry believed that the quality of the
Sea Skua had been proved in service in the 1991 Gulf War
that ended Iraqi occupation of Kuwait while the French MM-15
had not undergone a similar test.
</P>
<P>
The ministry declared recently at the Kuwaiti parliament that
the ministry's decision to accept the British missile was final
and that the ministry had begun taking necessary measures to
conclude the deal.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the signing of the deal is around the
corner.

HANOI, February 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 105,000 Vietnamese boat
people have been repatriated from refugee camps across Southeast
Asia in the past five years, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the repatriated have been accepted with
"open-arms" and have faced no discrimination to re-integrate into
the community, mostly in their places of origin.
</P>
<P>
Since March l989, the UN High Commission for Refugees(UNHCR),
together with other international organizations have assisted
Vietnam in repatriation of its boat people who mainly fled
illegally to Southeast Asia. Several million of U.S. dollars have
been provided to the repatriates, the reports added.

<HEADLINE> Israel Exports 4 Billion Dollars Diamonds In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel exported 4 billion
U.S. dollars worth of polished diamonds in 1996 compared with
3.845 billion dollars in the previous year, according to figures
provided by Israel Export Institute.
</P>
<P>
Exports of raw diamonds that underwent partial processing in
Israel totaled 837 million dollars as compared with 683 million
dollars in 1995, a rise of 22 percent. Thus, the country's total
exports of diamonds (both raw and polished) netted 4.837 billion
dollars in 1996, as compared with 4.529 billion dollars in 1995,
an increase of 7 percent, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was the largest importer of Israeli diamonds,
accounting for 43.4 percent of the total, then came Japan with
16.8 percent, Hong Kong 16.7 percent, Belgium 10.9 percent,
Switzerland 2.2 percent and other countries totaling 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The significant increase recorded in raw diamond exports
attests to the continuing development in Israel of a global
market for raw diamonds that have undergone initial processing in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Israel's diamond industry continued to compete with
those production centers that rely on cheap labor. The industry is
therefore investing in streamlining production and an
advanced emplacement. It is also penetrating new markets and
developing trade relations with sources for acquiring raw
diamonds, in its efforts to maintain its central spot in the
global diamond industry.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon: Big Sale in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 1 (Xinhua) -- By offering big discounts in a
wide range, Lebanon inaugurates a shopping festival today in a
bid to attract more foreign tourists and to improve Lebanon's
images abroad.
</P>
<P>
Shops, restaurants, hotels and even airlines have hung out
plates of sales in response to a government call.
</P>
<P>
An opening ceremony is to be held this evening at the Cadmos
Hotel in west Beirut to the sound of brass bands and the display
of fireworks over Ras Beirut, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Yassin Jaber, Minister of Economy and Trade, was quoted by
today's Daily Star, the only English language daily in Beirut, as
saying that further events were in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
"This festival is the first step in a long series of
festivals we are considering that will promote Lebanon abroad
and encourage tourism," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the reasons for holding the festival was
to repudiate the view that Lebanon is an expensive place to
shop.
</P>
<P>
"Now we can demonstrate to foreigners and particularly Arabs
that Lebanon is cheap," Jaber said.
</P>
<P>
Shop owners, car hire firms, restaurants, hotels and airlines
including Lebanon's Middle East Airlines and the British
Mediterranean Airways have been persuaded to present a broad
range of discounts for their products and services.
</P>
<P>
"Super sale up to 60 percent, 30 days only," a sports wear
shop in Hamra, the commercial center in west Beirut, said in
eye-catching plates.
</P>
<P>
Restaurants are cutting the prices on a la carte menus by 20
percent and are also supplying a special menu at 15,000 Lebanese
pounds (10 dollars) per head.
</P>
<P>
Hotels are reducing single and double room rates by 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering of the Merchants' Association Friday,
Jebar stressed that it was in the interest of shop owners to
abide by the spirit of the event.
</P>
<P>
"The Lebanese trader is very clever and knows how to provide
the best products and the best prices. This festival is for you
to prove this," the minister underlined.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syrian Halfway to Agreement Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's previous Labor
government reached more than 50 percent of a peace agreement
with Syria, former Israeli chief negotiator Uri Savir disclosed
today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to 50 to 60 percent of points in their
negotiations, Savir was quoted by Israel Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States drew up the points in an
unofficial document which stated respective positions of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached 50 to 60 percent of an agreement, not formal
and not drafted, on issues of normalization, economies, water
and regional agreement," Savir said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two sides agreed that Israeli-Syrian peace
would lead to an end of Israeli-Arab conflicts and was intended
to normalize relations between Israel and all Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks have been suspended since last March
following a series of Islamic bombing attacks inside Israel and
the Labor Party's defeat in the May 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Savir made the revelations at a time when Israel is
heightening its pressure on Syria to come back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly called on Syria to resume the peace
talks without preconditions though the Likud government has
vowed not to relinquish its self-claimed sovereignty over the
occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria has rejected Israel's calls, insisting the talks be
resumed only from the point where they broke off, that is, on the
basis of the unofficial understanding it reached with the Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
In the understanding, Israel reportedly promised to fully
withdraw troops from the Golan Heights in order to seal a peace
pact with Syria. The Likud government, though having indicated
willingness to perhaps partial withdrawal, has refused so far to
accept such unofficial document.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Introduce Second Type of Consumer Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Index
</P>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is to introduce
a second type of Consumer Price Index (CPI) which will comprise
essential items used by the general public, not items generally
used by rich people.
</P>
<P>
The second CPI is necessary to measure the inflationary
pressure on the low income people, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim who is also Finance Minister said today in the northwest
state of Pulau Pinang, according to Malaysia's official news
agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
The present CPI which was internationally accepted would
continue to be used for comparison purposes between the situation
now and before and between Malaysia and other countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is in Pulau Pinang to launch the festive fair price sale
which is being carried out throughout Malaysia from today onwards
for the Chinese New Year (Spring Festival) and Moslem's Lesser
Bairam (Festival of Fast- breaking) double celebrations next week.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Cabinet Committee on Essential Items at
its recent meeting had noted the items needed for the festive
season and had directed the relevant parties to ensure that these
were in adequate supply, and sold at fair price.
</P>
<P>
On local markets, there are plenty of essential items for the
double festival celebrators who are seen crowding the shopping
centers here purchasing festive gifts and consumer goods.
</P>
<P>
Unlike in the past when businessmen closed shop for a week or
so after the celebrations, this time the government directed shops
to remain open during and after the celebrations.

<HEADLINE> Stecher Takes Ski Jumping at World Cup Nordic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Mario Stecher, with two
leaps of 90 and 88 meters, won the ski jumping portion of a Nordic
combined World Cup event in Hakuba, Japan, Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Stecher totaled 231 points for the two leaps and earned a one
minute starting lead for Sunday's 15-kilometer cross-country ski
race.
</P>
<P>
Japan's top Nordic competitor Kenji Ogiwara was second with 221
points on jumps of 86 and 86.5 meters, getting a 1 minute handicap
for Sunday's race. He's in 10th place in the overall standings
with 323 points.
</P>
<P>
Overall World Cup Nordic leader Samppa Lajunen of Finland
placed third with 220 points on two jumps of 87.5 meters,
receiving a 1 minute 6 second handicap in Sunday's competition.
</P>
<P>
Lajunen pulled ahead of Stecher for the overall standings lead
in Predazzo, Italy on January 15, when the Austrian had to sit out
the cross-country portion because of a cold. Lajunen has 750
points, over the 665 points Stecher had coming into Hakuba.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Jari Mantila, third in the overall standings with 640
points, finished 18th in the ski jump event, with jumps of 84 and
74.5 meters for 183.5 points.

<HEADLINE> Expansion of Existing Bangkok Airport Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of the existing
Bangkok Don Muang International Airport has been approved at a
meeting chaired by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, according
to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Expanding the Don Muang airport was the best way for
accommodating passenger increases until 2010, as the proposed
second Bangkok international airport at Nong Ngu Hao could not be
completed by the year 2000, Chavalit told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
The said meeting on Friday, of the Second Bangkok International
Airport Development Committee (SBIA), did not discuss the Nong Ngu
Hao issue in depth, as it was being considered by a committee of
the Transport and Communications Ministry, which is scheduled to
submit its findings to the cabinet by February 21.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Chavalit proposed at a cabinet meeting to delay the
construction of the Nong Ngu Hao airport because of its high
construction cost and the country's high current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
His proposal had touched off a dispute because about 7 billion
baht (280 million US dollars) had been invested in the 37-year old
project in relocation of villagers and design work.
</P>
<P>
The air force, which has a base adjacent to the existing Don
Muang international airport, has agreed to give up a plot of land
2,000 meters by 145 meters, enough to build 30 plane parking lots
and runways and passenger buildings, according to Transport
Minister Suwat Liptapallop.
</P>
<P>
The decision to go ahead with the expansion project is likely
to affect the fate of the Nong Ngu Hao airport, further reducing
its urgency.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had hoped to become an aviation hub in the region by
building the Nong Ngu Hao international airport.

<HEADLINE> EC Threatens to Ban Imports of Uganda Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission has
threatened to reject fish imports from Uganda if the country
sprays its lakes with chemicals to kill the water hyacinth,
reported ''The New Vision'' paper today.
</P>
<P>
Most of Uganda's fishes are exported, with the Nile perch
mainly going to the Netherlands, Belgium and Spain. Fish is one
of the Uganda's main exports to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
EU chief Deus Pinherio warned here on Thursday of devastating
consequences of the use of chemicals in Uganda's lakes.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''the water hyacinth is a problem, but we should be
careful with the consequences of chemicals to the fauna and flora.''
</P>
<P>
Uganda is testing the use of chemicals to kill the water
hyacinth which has strangled 90 percent of the shoreline of lakes
and rivers in the country, causing a calamity in social and
economic areas.
</P>
<P>
Uganda exported about 9,300 tons of fish in 1995 compared with
6,810 tons in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The east African country registered six percent of its gross
domestic product (GDP) from fisheries sector in 1994 while the
figure for 1995 rose to 7.9 percent.

KAMPALA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 displaced women,
children and old people demonstrated in the northern Ugandan
district of Gulu against what they said the diversion of food
relief by local officials.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Provinces to Play Greater Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The nine provinces of
South Africa are entitled to playing a greater role in the
country's democratization process under the new constitution,
according to local daily "The Citizen" today.
</P>
<P>
According to the new constitution, which signed into law by
President Nelson Mandela last December and would come into effect
at midnight on Monday, the Senate would be replaced by the
National Council of Provinces (NCOP), scheduled to be established
next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the last meeting of the Senate in Cape Town on
Friday, Mandela said its function had enhanced confidence in the
country's young democracy, while the new role of the provinces
deserves far more attention.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said as the first generation of senators in a
democratic South Africa, the senators would from now on have to
restructure its role as NCOP councillors.
</P>
<P>
"New forms of allocation of revenue from the central
government to provincial governments, together with the shift to
a system of cooperative governance, will greatly enhance the
collective role of the provinces in the governance of our
democracy," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Most of the senators would continue to serve as NCOP
councillors when a new session of parliament begins on February
7.

<HEADLINE> US "Human Rights Report" Criticized in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The US side must stop its
erroneous actions of interfering in China's internal affairs with
an excuse of human rights issue, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Tang Guoqiang said here today.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when asked to comment on US Department of
State's annual "Human Rights Report" in 1996, which criticized
China's human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government has always protected and
promoted human rights and basic freedom of the Chinese people of
all ethnic groups, according to the Constitution and relevant
laws, and has made obvious achievements in this regard.
</P>
<P>
At present, China enjoys political stability, economic growth,
social progress and national unity, and the Chinese people live
and work in peace and contentment, the spokesman noted.
</P>
<P>
These facts have proved that it conforms to China's actual
situations and is in the fundamental interests of the entire
Chinese people to give the top priority to people's rights of
survival and development while strengthening democracy and
improving legal system, in order to comprehensively promote human
rights on a basis of reform, development and stability, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
"The US government distorted and blamed China's human rights
situation, in disregard of above-mentioned facts, which gravely
runs counter to the basic norms governing international
relations. Therefore, the Chinese side is firmly opposed to it,"
Tang stated.
</P>
<P>
"The US side must stop its erroneous actions of interfering in
China's internal affairs with an excuse of human rights issue," he
emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Expansion of Existing Bangkok Airport Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The expansion of the existing
Bangkok Don Muang International Airport has been approved at a
meeting chaired by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, according
to the local press today.
</P>
<P>
Expanding the Don Muang airport was the best way for
accommodating passenger increases until 2010, as the proposed
second Bangkok international airport at Nong Ngu Hao could not be
completed by the year 2000, Chavalit told reporters Friday.
</P>
<P>
The said meeting on Friday, of the Second Bangkok International
Airport Development Committee (SBIA), did not discuss the Nong Ngu
Hao issue in depth, as it was being considered by a committee of
the Transport and Communications Ministry, which is scheduled to
submit its findings to the cabinet by February 21.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Chavalit proposed at a cabinet meeting to delay the
construction of the Nong Ngu Hao airport because of its high
construction cost and the country's high current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
His proposal had touched off a dispute because about 7 billion
baht (280 million US dollars) had been invested in the 37-year old
project in relocation of villagers and design work.
</P>
<P>
The air force, which has a base adjacent to the existing Don
Muang international airport, has agreed to give up a plot of land
2,000 meters by 145 meters, enough to build 30 plane parking lots
and runways and passenger buildings, according to Transport
Minister Suwat Liptapallop.
</P>
<P>
The decision to go ahead with the expansion project is likely
to affect the fate of the Nong Ngu Hao airport, further reducing
its urgency.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had hoped to become an aviation hub in the region by
building the Nong Ngu Hao international airport.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Syrian Halfway to Agreement Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Israel's previous Labor
government reached more than 50 percent of a peace agreement
with Syria, former Israeli chief negotiator Uri Savir disclosed
today.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to 50 to 60 percent of points in their
negotiations, Savir was quoted by Israel Radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States drew up the points in an
unofficial document which stated respective positions of the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached 50 to 60 percent of an agreement, not formal
and not drafted, on issues of normalization, economies, water
and regional agreement," Savir said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two sides agreed that Israeli-Syrian peace
would lead to an end of Israeli-Arab conflicts and was intended
to normalize relations between Israel and all Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks have been suspended since last March
following a series of Islamic bombing attacks inside Israel and
the Labor Party's defeat in the May 29 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Savir made the revelations at a time when Israel is
heightening its pressure on Syria to come back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly called on Syria to resume the peace
talks without preconditions though the Likud government has
vowed not to relinquish its self-claimed sovereignty over the
occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria has rejected Israel's calls, insisting the talks be
resumed only from the point where they broke off, that is, on the
basis of the unofficial understanding it reached with the Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
In the understanding, Israel reportedly promised to fully
withdraw troops from the Golan Heights in order to seal a peace
pact with Syria. The Likud government, though having indicated
willingness to perhaps partial withdrawal, has refused so far to
accept such unofficial document.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Zambian Women to Get Aid for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Zambian women who want to be
self-reliant through their own initiatives can get help from the
Women Entrepreneurs Association of Zambia (WEDAZ).
</P>
<P>
WEDAZ is setting up a revolving fund this year to help the
women who could not get loans from the lending institutions
because of the difficult conditions attached, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The fund targets grass-root women who, with low levels of
education, cannot find employment but strive to earn a living by
doing some small-scale businesses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, almost all the lending organizations ask for
collateral in form of title deeds for some property or a fully
insured vehicle or know how much money one has before a loan can
be given.
</P>
<P>
Women in Zambia usually find it difficult to get loans because
the interest rates are prohibitive as all money institutions ask
for commercial rates which a small-scale business women cannot
afford.
</P>
<P>
The average Zambian women do not own property such as houses
or cars and if they do, they own them jointly with their
husbands. Therefore, the women cannot use such property which is
jointly owned as collateral.
</P>
<P>
It is from this point of view that they felt the necessity for
continued support, networking and advice, hence the need to set
up an association of their own.
</P>
<P>
The vision of WEDAZ, established in 1995, is to see women with
small-scale businesses grow into bigger ones and to help them
contribute to the well-being of the nation in general and their
families in particular.

HARARE, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Incessant rains in the last two

now expected to be reduced unless there is at least a week of

</P>

While most crops were looking good for the better part of the
season, they are now beginning to show the negative growth signs
associated with water-logging with the country's staple food,
maize, being the most affected.

<P>
Almost all activities, from weeding to chemical application,
are hinging on a week of sunshine, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Agritex (agriculture technical extension department of the

livestock report that the current widespread rains are now
causing severe water-logging in all provinces and leaching of

In most places this has caused the maize crop to turn yellow

<HEADLINE> Quota on Chinese Commodities to Hurt German Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 31 (Xinhua) -- To limit the import quota on
Chinese commodities would hurt the German economy, said a report
by the Kiel World Economic Institute today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that quota on Chinese toys, leather,
porcelains, textile goods and musical instruments between 1988 and
1994 has saved Germany some 650 jobs, but cost it 300 million
Dutch marks (about 200 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
In other words, Germany has to spend 460,000 marks (about
307,000 dollars) to keep one job under the quota system as against
50,000 to 250,000 marks (about 33,000 to 167,000 dollars) with no
quota, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The quota system is harmful to Germany's long-term interest,
the report added, because it will channel new employees to those
economic sectors that have already lost competitive edge in the
international market.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) failed to hold onto its strength this week when
selling pressure set in later in the week.
</P>
<P>
The 100-stock Composite Index (CI) ended this week at 1,216.72,
down 27.41 points against last week's 1,244.13 while the all-main
board Emas Index finished at 350.19, easing 3.57 points from
354.20 and the Industrial Index settled at 2,292.74, losing 15.4
points compared to 2,308.14 last week.
</P>
<P>
Players seemed to switch interest to medium-cap stocks from
high- cap ones and they were confident that, despite the easing
tone, the market remained well-supported and should test another
support level above 1,250.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said most investors were also cautious about trading
aggressively following the uncertainty on Wall Street overnight
and fears of a rise in U.S. interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"Players prefer to get out of their portfolios and lock in
their profits before deciding on their next course of action," the
analyst added.
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said a downtrend was seen in this week's
trading which saw most investors refraining from buying or selling
amid divergent views on the market's outlook in the short term.
</P>
<P>
Players were cautious about participating aggressively in
anticipation that the traditional Chinese New Year rally was
unlikely to be repeated this year while some quarters felt that
there was the possibility of another rally but it would not be as
sharp as the "Super Bull" in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
Share prices on the KLSE are expected to continue their
downward trend next week with the CI estimated to drift toward the
1,200-point level as most of the big players are already in a
holiday mood ahead of the Chinese New Year and Muslims' Lesser
Bairam (Festival of Fast- Breaking) double celebrations next week.
</P>
<P>
The weekly main board ready turnover increased to 1.295 billion
shares worth 7.293 billion ringgit (about 2.9172 billion U.S.
dollars) from 1.191 billion shares valued at 6.708 billion ringgit
(about 2.6832 billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The second board turnover was down to 320.926 million shares
worth 4.084 billion ringgit (about 1.6336 billion dollars) from
314.83 million shares valued at 4.195 billion ringgit (about 1.678
billion dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals amounted to 197.194 million shares worth 1.31
billion ringgit (about 524 million dollars) from 185.347 million
shares valued at 1.504 billion ringgit (about 601.6 million
dollars) last week.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of
Crude palm oil (CPO), tin and rubber closed the week mixed.
</P>
<P>
CPO physicals prices improved this week with February South
closing the week 5 ringgit (about 2 US dollars) higher to 1,345
ringgit (about 538 US dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The prices are expected to improve next week in pre-holiday
short-covering activities.
</P>
<P>
Players are likely to cover their positions because February
is considered a short month for trading following the long Chinese
New Year and Moslem's Festival of Fast-breaking holidays, a dealer
said.
</P>
<P>
The market sentiment could also be boosted by China's increase
in its import of Malaysian palm oil, which was expected to be
over 100,000 tons this month, the dealer added.
</P>
<P>
During the week, two cargo surveyors, Caleb Brett and Societe
Generale de Surveillance (SGS) released bullish palm oil export
data for January 1997. Caleb Brett estimated Malaysia's palm oil
exports for January at 616,372 tons while SGS put it at 586,046
tons.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM) was in a downtrend this
week.
</P>
<P>
Tin closed the week at 14.26 ringgit (about 5.704 US dollars)
per kg, 42 sen down from 14.68 ringgit (about 5.872 US dollars)
per kg last week.
</P>
<P>
The metal market is expected to stabilize next week with the
improvement in the price of tin on the London Metal Exchange
(LME).
</P>
<P>
The better sentiment from LME might, however, be offset by
higher offerings from sellers and lack of buying interest on the
local front, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover for the week rose to 505 tons compared
with 494 tons the previous week.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the market saw a lack of participation by
Japanese buyers while European and local buyers accounted for the
bulk of the transactions.
</P>
<P>
The premium between the KLTM and that of the LME was at 70 US
dollars per ton from 20 US dollars per ton last week.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian rubber market remained directionless throughout
the week following poor sentiment of the Tokyo futures due to the
depreciation of the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
On the local front, an increase in supply due to improved
weather condition, coupled with the absence of export demand
dampened market sentiment.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said, "with the incoming long holiday next week, it
is hard for prices to climb back to the 300 sen (about 120 US
cents) per kg level, but perhaps with better Tokyo futures
performance and should end-users come back to cover their
positions before the long holiday, the price would likely
sustain."
</P>
<P>
February RSS One closed the week four sen lower to 298.00 sen
(about 119.2 US cents) per kg from 302.00 sen (about 120.8 US
cents) per kg last week while SMR 20 eased by 3.5 sen to 293.50
sen (about 117.4 US cents) per kg from 297.00 sen (about 118.8 US
cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to maintain its current price next
week.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Gets Less Ganges Water Last Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh received more water in
the first 10-day cycle of January than the sharing formula in the
water treaty with India, but far less in the last two cycles of
the same month, according to officials of the Hydrology
Department.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh got 70,122 cusecs of water per day on average in the
first 10-day period of January against 67,516 cusecs mentioned in
the treaty, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
But, the water received during the last two 10-day cycles was
only 55,673 and 49,247 cusecs per day respectively against 57,673
and 50,154 cusecs agreed upon by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka and New Delhi, in a 30-year Ganges water sharing treaty
signed on December 12 last year, agreed to share the water of the
common river during the lean period beginning January.
</P>
<P>
In the first month of the lean period this year, Bangladesh got
 1,817,455 cusecs of water against 2,073,997 cusecs received in
the same period of last year when this country had no agreement
with India on water sharing.
</P>
<P>
Officials recorded the water level of the Ganges at the
Hardinge Bridge point near the Indian border at six centimeters
lower during January than a year earlier.
</P>

Water experts from the two countries started joint monitoring
at the Hardinge Bridge point on January 18.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Central Bank Steps In to Shore Up Baht </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Thailand
has twice intervened in the money market this week to support the
baht as the Thai currency was struggling to stay above the
psychological low of 26 baht to the appreciating U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
At one point on Friday the baht was traded at 25.994 baht to
the dollar, although the mid-rate set by the Bank of Thailand
remained unchanged from the previous day at 25.87 baht a dollar.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the central bank spent "a substantial amount" of
foreign exchange to support the baht on Friday, following similar
efforts on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand's intervention successfully pulled the
spot trading price from the peak 25.994 baht a dollar down to
25.840. However, the dollar later rallied again to 25.905 baht.
</P>
<P>
Rumors that the Bank of Thailand would devalue the baht caused
heavy selling of the Thai currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the interest rate for overnight loans among
commercial banks skyrocketed to 17-25 percent. However, very few
banks actually agreed to lend to others since most had to reserve
funds for pay day and to cope with high demand for money over the
Chinese New Year holiday next week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said using the country's foreign reserves, which stand
at 38.7 billion dollars as of the end of December, for such
intervention could drive interest rates up to attract overseas
funds.
</P>
<P>
Although the central bank has repeatedly denied a baht
devaluation plan, the baht has in fact already depreciated over
the past year against the currencies of Thailand's main
competitors.
</P>
<P>
The baht has weakened by an average 3 percent over the past six
months against the currencies of Singapore, Malaysia, China and
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The movement of the dollar against the baht is about the same
level.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Thai exports have gained in competitiveness in
relative terms, said central bank sources.
</P>
<P>
On the stock market, foreign investors also sold off heavily on
Friday to protect themselves in case the baht would be devalued.
</P>
<P>
The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET), which had remained above
the 800-point level for a few weeks, tumbled 32.14 points, or 3.92
percent to close at 788.04 on Friday. Turnover however was
impressive, amounting to 7.68 billion baht (307.2 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The SET index at 788.04 points was the lowest since January 3,
when it reached a 52-month low of 787.47 points.

PANAMA CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Panama and Colombia are
scheduled to sign an agreement on the protection of biodiversity
in the boarder region between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be signed by Panamanian President Ernesto
Perez Balladares and his Colombian counterpart Ernesto Samper, who
arrived here today for a two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
Before signing the agreement, the two sides will assess the
ecological potentials of the boarder area.
</P>
<P>
The region, measuring a total of one million hectares with
700,000 hectares belonging to Panama and 300,000 to Colombia,
forms a great natural reserve.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents reportedly will also discuss serious drug
trafficking problems in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Perez Balladares is expected to seek support from his guest for
the multinational center against drug trafficking to be built in
Panama.
</P>
<P>
But on previous occasions, Samper expressed reservation on the
project, which was sponsored by the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents agreed that the United States was committing
an inadmissible intervention by "certifying" other countries'
efforts in battling against drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Poisonous Fish Brings Restaurants Heavy Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Restaurants and hotels are
banned from selling blowfish, and violators will be severely
punished, according to an announcement by the Ministry of Public
Health, which is carried in today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the ministry introduced a regulation making the sale
of blowfish parts illegal. Medical experts believe that some parts
of the fish are poisonous and can cause death.
</P>
<P>
But the ministry has received several reports complaining that
some restaurants in Beijing, Shanghai and Shandong still sell
blowfish parts, which has resulted in several food-poisoning
incidents in recent months, said an official with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Two restaurants in Beijing, both run by a Japanese food
company, were fined 10,000 yuan (1,200 US dollars) each. Other
cases are still under investigation, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health has released a circular asking
health departments at all levels to tighten law enforcement on
selling of blowfish.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn
Gyaw today criticized the U.S. human rights report on Myanmar as
"misleading."
</P>
<P>
"It is, in fact, a misleading one issued by the U.S. State
Department," the minister said at a monthly press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department issued recently a report on the human
rights situation in Myanmar, accusing the country of violating
human rights.
</P>
<P>
On Myanmar-U.S. relations, the minister said his country looks
forward to improving the ties.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the withdrawal from Myanmar of investment by the
Pepsi-Cola company of the United States, he said the withdrawal
would not affect the climate of foreign investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of foreign investment in Myanmar also
stated at the press briefing that such investment in the country
has reached 5.36 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 2.12 billion dollars of the investment was made
in the first 10 months of the 1996-97 fiscal year ending in March.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Promises China Long-term Commitment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Boeing, one of the world's
leading aircraft manufacturers, yesterday reaffirmed its long-term
commitment to China and promised to ensure the planned merger of
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas benefits Chinese airlines, according
to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the result of the merger is that we can do a
better job," said Ronald B. Woodard, president of the Boeing
Commercial Airplane Group.
</P>
<P>
Woodard said the new company would improve Boeing's service in
China "because we'll have more resources to apply."
</P>
<P>
After the merger, Boeing will upgrade the quality of McDonnell
Douglas' product support and engineering, he said. Meanwhile, it
will carry on all McDonnell Douglas' sales contracts and
co-operation projects in China.
</P>
<P>
For example, Boeing will support both production and sales on
the co-operation project in Shanghai to produce 20 McDonnell
Douglas aircraft. If the project proves successful, Boeing is
willing to co-operate with China to manufacture more such planes,
he added.
</P>
<P>
The company has just announced the establishment of two offices
in China, and it is possible that joint ventures could be
established in the near future, Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
"Boeing has had a close relationship with China for 25 years,"
he noted, and its relationship with China is a long-term one in
which Boeing will keep investing.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's disarmament process
dragged on despite the deadline which expired at midnight on
Friday as thousands of faction fighters were queuing at assembly
camps to lay down their arms.
</P>
<P>
The 14 disarmament camps in the country were very crowded,
according to officers of the peace-keeping force, known as
ECOMOG, quoted by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG said so far some 17,000 pieces of weapons have been
received from the fighters by the peace-keepers who, however,
failed to give the exact number of soldiers that have laid down
their arms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said
in Liberia's capital Monrovia that about 20,000 soldiers, out of
a total of 60,000 faction fighters in the west African country,
have surrendered their arms.
</P>
<P>
Among the disarmed soldiers are 3,000 child fighters who are
eager for going to school or joining their parents whom they have
missed all along the seven-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Liberia is scheduled to hold the general elections in May
1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today NATO
expansion must be carried out in a way acceptable to Russia and
for that purpose it was trying to establish a mechanism of
reciprocal consultation.
</P>
<P>
John Kornblum, assistant secretary for Canadian and European
affairs of the U.S. State Department, made the remarks at a news
briefing after meeting with the contact group of the Italian
foreign ministry here.
</P>
<P>
He said the United States hoped to reach "a true partnership"
with Russia, which can "play its role in many areas including
Central Asia."
</P>
<P>
Talking about Europe and NATO, Kornblum stressed that Europe
must play a "new role, a crucial role" in the military alliance.
</P>
<P>
However, Kornblum insisted on U.S. authority over Southern
Europe Command, saying there was good reason for this.
</P>
<P>
Kornblum promised to build a "strategic partnership" with Italy
in order to deal with problems in the Mediterranean area and
Southeast Europe.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Capital Controlling Hungary's Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, January 31 (Xinhua) -- With the privatization
progressing in Hungary, foreign capital has been gradually taking
control over the country's stock market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the total market volume of the Budapest Stock
Exchange is equivalent to 5.3 billion U.S. dollars, and listings
with foreign background account for 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, according to official figures, stocks issued by
dominantly state-owned companies account for 1 billion dollars and
those by local private companies account for 300 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The country's privatization process, which is expected to be
accomplished this year, has so far converted some 70 percent of
the state-owned assets into private ownership.
</P>
<P>
Most of Hungary's state-owned businesses going public were
bought by foreign interests from Germany, the United States,
Austria and other countries with 15 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign stockholders have bought into 134 of the 200 biggest
Hungarian businesses, and 120 of them have had the majority shares

<HEADLINE> Kornblum Expects Strategic Partnership Between US, Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Italy are
developing a strategic partnership aimed at closer collaboration
in dealing with problems in the Mediterranean region and Southeast
Europe, U.S. State Department European Affairs Chief John Kornblum
confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press at the American embassy ahead of the
meeting of the Contact Group for former Yugoslavia, Kornblum
reviewed various problems North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) and the United States faced in the wake of the swift
changes on the European continent.
</P>
<P>
The American diplomat envisioned a new role for Europe within
NATO, saying it would be "central" to the cross-Atlantic
alliance's enlargement, "a process which create democracy and a
free market".
</P>
<P>
"We support this strongly both within the European Union and in
NATO," Kornblum continued, "for it is a way by which we can truly
achieve all objectives set by the Marshall Plan."
</P>
<P>
"But attention must be paid not to create new lines which
divide Europe," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia's opposition to NATO's eastward expansion,
Kornblum said this must be done in an acceptable way.
</P>
<P>
He added that "a structure for reciprocal consultation" is
under study, and it has yet to be decided whether the structure
will be separated from NATO.
</P>
<P>
In any case, he said, the United States hopes there can be "an
authentic Partnership for Peace" between Russia and NATO, for
"there are many areas where it could be applied, in Central Asia,
for example."
</P>
<P>
After defining the problems between the European Union and
Turkey as "more psychological than economic, Kornblum said that
the problem of Cyprus was a "strategic challenge for NATO."
</P>
<P>
As for France's demand for a European head for NATO's Southern
Europe Command in Naples, Kornblum said: "There are many and
excellent reasons for it to remain under American control."
</P>
<P>
Kornblum, who succeeded Richard Holbrooke at the State
Department post, stressed that "NATO remains a political-military
alliance" despite the changes of environment. What was needed was
an "agile structure which can move swiftly" to tackle various
problems, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Takes Measures to Revive Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The Ukrainian government today
proposed a package of reform measures aimed at reviving the
country's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Telegraph Agency said the measures were put
forward under the guidelines formulated at a January 10 national
meeting on agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The measures include: securing food supply, stabilizing
agricultural product prices, establishing food wholesale market,
organizing purchase of agricultural produce and developing
agricultural machinery.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Telegraph Agency said the government will also
start work to revise laws on the lease of farm land, and on
agricultural cooperation.
</P>
<P>
An eight-year draft plan for agricultural revival and
development is expected to be unveiled by the government one month
after the 1997 budget is approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's agriculture suffered a serious setback last year as
poor weather conditions, fuel shortage and reduced state financial
input resulted in a 8.5-million-ton drop of grain output from
1995's 25.4 million tons.

an 8-percent growth rate by the end of the century," Finance
Minister P. Chidambaram said.
</P>
<P>
"We will affirm to the world business community assembled in

BUCHAREST, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Interior Minister
Gavril Dejeu has issued an order to discipline the 18 police
personnel described as "umbrella" of local gangsters.
</P>
<P>
The policemen and police officers of Vilcea County, who
intentionally shielded an eight-member criminal group, will either
be fired, degraded or their bonus suspended, Dejeu said.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1996, many residents of Vilcea County were robbed
and blackmailed by the criminal group. Some 53 victims reported
their cases to the local police station, but only found the
robbers lightly fined.
</P>
<P>
The criminal group had been rampant in the area until last
month, when Romania's chief police office launched a blitz
operation to arrest the eight gangsters.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Rejects U.S. Report on Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Mexico rejected today a
U.S. Department of State report that human rights were infringed
upon in Mexico, countering that in its own country "there is much
to be said and to be done" on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Department of State omitted in its world report on
human rights published Thursday a chapter on the U.S. situation of
the rights problem, the Mexican Foreign Relations Ministry said
late Thursday in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The document was just an opinion of the U.S. authorities and
had not international authority, it added.
</P>
<P>
"There is much to be said and to be done about human rights in
the United States, as shown by the experience of many of our
nationals in that country," said the communique, citing the
well-known incident that U.S. border patrolmen last year hit with
batons illegal immigrants who were not resisting arrest on a
California highway.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Mexican government rejected any foreign
unilateral evaluation of the human rights situation in the
country, especially if it was done out of the context of the
applicable international agreements.
</P>
<P>
The new U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright charged in
the report that Mexican authorities were continuously violating
the human rights of its people.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican government refuted that it observed the exact
application of the justice system in line with the legislation and
international conventions signed on rights protection.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Court Stops Privatization of Waterworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A Philippine court on Friday
temporarily stopped the privatization of the Manila waterworks, a
7 billion U.S. dollar project and the largest of its kind in the
world, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a temporary restraining order, the Court of Appeals ordered
the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) management
not to take any further action to privatize the waterworks in the
capital region.
</P>
<P>
The court enjoined the MWSS, the Office of the President and
the Cabinet Committee on Privatization not to close the concession
agreements with the winning bidders, Ayala consortium and Benpres
Holdings Corp., until further orders from the court.
</P>
<P>
The order also gave the Cabinet Committee on Privatization 10
days to answer a petition filed by groups of commercial and civic
leaders from Rizal Province that the privatization was
unconstitutional and would unduly displace thousands of MWSS
employees.
</P>
<P>
To salvage the grossly inefficient water utility in the capital
region, the government has sought to privatize the MWSS. On
January 23, the MWSS announced that Ayala and Benpres separately
won the bid to operate the MWSS starting May 7.
</P>
<P>
But the privatization project was strongly opposed by MWSS
employees for fear of losing jobs after the two corporations take
over the MWSS. Some residents also objected to the privatization
plan for fear of spiraling hikes in water rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Chile struck an investment
deal with a Canadian firm here today to turn the Latin American
nation into the largest methanol producer worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Chilean Economy Minister Alvaro Gracia
and General Manager Rodolfo Krause of Canada-based Methanex, calls
for a new methanol plant in Cabo Negro, of southern Magallanes.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the Canadian firm will top its 525 million
U.S. dollars investment on the two existing plants at the site
with a new fund of 375 million dollars for the third plant.
</P>
<P>
The new plant, scheduled for operation after 1999, is expected
to boost Methanex Chile's annual methanol production to 3 million
metric tons, or 20 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
With the third plant's annual exports estimated at 200 million
dollars, the entire Chilean operation's annual sales could reach
500 million dollars after 1999, Krause said.
</P>
<P>
The plant will also generate 600 new jobs for Chileans, Krause
said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Hints at Action Against Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Chief of Staff Feisal Tanjung has threatened stern action that he
hopes will prevent further mass violence.
</P>
<P>
"If (people) are still causing unrest, ABRI will certainly deal
with them more firmly," Tanjung said at the closing of a Military
Command School course in Bandung, 200 kilometers southeast of
Jakarta, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung's statement came after thousands of Rengasdengklok
residents in West Java went on a rampage on Thursday, burning and
damaging scores of places of worship and property.
</P>
<P>
Tanjung said he believed "There is certainly a third party
which mobilized and planned" the violence and this was being
investigated.
</P>
<P>
According to Tanjung, those who instigated the riots in
Rengasdengklok and the December violence in Tasikmalaya were
"anti-government and anti-development."
</P>
<P>
In Tasikmalaya, West Java, thousands of people angered by
alleged police mistreatment of three teachers at a local Islamic
school, went on a rampage on December 26, attacking places of
worship.
</P>
<P>
Four people died in the riot and more than 100 buildings and
vehicles were damaged or burned.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has since last July been hit by a series of riots
during which 12 people were killed and scores injured and hundreds
of public buildings, shops and houses were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
However, government officials have said recently that despite
current riots in the country, political stability and security are
under control.

<HEADLINE> Thai Universities "in Crisis" Due to Instability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 1 (Xinhua) -- University-level education in
Thailand is in a crisis due to political instability and the
discontinuity of policy implementation and coordination, academics
have warned.
</P>
<P>
Many academics, who attended a meeting on higher education
reform held here earlier this week, believe higher education in
this country has reached a critical point because the unstable
political system has long led to interrupted development and
policy implementation and short-term solutions, the Bangkok Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
They urged the Thai government to push for clear-cut policies
to direct higher education institutions and define their roles and
duties.
</P>
<P>
Kasem Suwannakul, a former rector of Chulalongkorn University,
said Thailand's higher education is in a crisis as many university
lecturers are not qualified and are refrained from doing academic
research while most graduate students just want diplomas, not
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Wichai Tansiri, a lower house education committee member, said
the percentage of Thai students who have access to higher
education should increase from no more than 10 percent to 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
All universities must be prepared to accommodate some 500,000
students a year in the next five years to prevent a crisis, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Panama Vows to Fight Against Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Panama has pledged to fight
against money laundering and adopted a strict cash flow control in
the national financial system, Eudoro Jaen, general manager of the
government-owned Caja de Ahorros savings bank, said today.
</P>
<P>
In today's Enlace, a publication of the Ministry of Industry
and Commerce, Jaen said his country is far from "a laundering
machine" for drug trafficking money, as alleged by the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
"Panamanian authorities strive day after day to improve the
unjust image imposed on us of being a giant laundry of money," he
added.
</P>
<P>
To combat money laundering, Jaen said, it is necessary to
neutralize drug cartels' earning capabilities. Therefore, the
authorities implemented a strict cash flow control in the national
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Jaen suggested to register all money transactions in every
financial institution, customs office and border checkpoint, and
to relay the information to the National Banking Commission.
</P>
<P>
The manager added that Panama's banking system applies the
policy of knowing its clients, since the institutions must first
identify the nature of the enterprises and their location, and
then decide whether the transactions are consistent with the kind
of business they are engaged in.

<HEADLINE> TV Broadcasts Now Reaching Jilin's Villages in Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to local government
efforts, television broadcasts can now be received in all the
rural villages of China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of last year, the provincial government began
a program to get all local villages covered by television
broadcasts. For many families, television sets were nothing but a
household ornament.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, local governments spent two million yuan to
install cable-TV facilities for villages, and villagers
contributed a certain amount of the funding.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the move was complete and all local
villages have access to TV broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, 93.1 percent of rural families
in northeastern Jilin Province have at least one television
set.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Around 5,000 workers of Pt.
Kahatex in Bandung, capital of West Java Province, Friday burned
68 cars belonging to the company to press their demands for better
pay and other benefits, the Antara News Agency and the Indonesia
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
They also set fire on a motorcycle and 60 bikes belonging to
the textile factory, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The workers initially held a gathering early in the morning
near the company's factory in Sumedang, in the eastern part of
Bandung, 200 kilometers southeast of Jakarta on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The workers demanded that their wages be based on the new
regional minimum wage regulation and other allowances be paid and
that the management provides leave to pregnant women and
menstruating girls.
</P>
<P>
As the company did no pay enough attention to their demands,
the workers damaged the company's office and factory and burned 68
cars, 60 bikes and one motorcycle belonging to the company,
security guards of the company said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the workers and management staff were injured, but no
one was killed.
</P>
<P>
The riot lasted five hours before hundreds of policemen and
troops were sent to disperse the workers and bring the situation
back to normal.
</P>
<P>
The head of the territorial police of Priangan, Sudirman Ail
said seven workers had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has since last July been hit by a series of mass
riots during which 12 people were killed and scores injured and
hundreds of public buildings, shops and houses were destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Rush for Patents Reflects Strong Market Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A record number of more than
100,000 patent applications flooded into the Patent Office of
China in 1996, with overseas applications leading the way,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"After lingering for around two years, patent applications
reached a new peak last year," said Jiang Ying, deputy
commissioner of the Patent Office.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 102,735 patent applications were made, a rise of
nearly 24 percent from 1995. Of this total, 29 percent of
applications were for invention patents, 48 percent for utility
model patents, and 24 percent for patent designs.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated patent applications had reached 625,309 by the end
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said overseas applications continued to expand
rapidly. Last year such applications hit 20,542, jumping by 45
percent from 1995 and constituting 20 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The fast increment of overseas applications indicated that
China's improving environment and huge market potential are
attracting more and more overseas business people, she added.
</P>
<P>
The inflow of advanced technology from abroad could help push
forward the upgrading of China's science and technology, but it is
also posing challenge for domestic enterprises, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, domestic enterprises made 20,302 patent
applications, rising by 71 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Patent Office approved 43,780 patents in 1996. By the end
of last year, China had approved 311,996 patents in total.

<HEADLINE> East China's Fujian Sees Progress in Port, Airport Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fuzhou, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A number of new ports and
airports went into operation last year in east China's Fujian
Province, which is preparing for direct shipping across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
Newly completed projects include three berths, one terminal for
10,000-tonnage ships, and a terminal for passenger ships of 3,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has over 3,000 kilometers of coastline, but its port
facilities were inadequate until recent years when the province's
economy took off and the matter of direct shipping to Taiwan was
finally discussed. A consensus was reached last month between the
two sides on direct shipping links between Fuzhou and Xiamen in
Fujian, and Kaohsiung on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to a long-term plan, Xiamen will increase its annual
port handling capacity to 60 million tons in the year 2000, from
30 million tons for the whole province in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At present, Xiamen has over 60 shipping routes to more than 100
countries, and Fuzhou, the provincial capital, plans to build 11
new berths in the coming four years.
</P>
<P>
With its 73 cargo and passenger ship berths, Fuzhou has become
a Category One port and is one of the top ten container terminals
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Last year also saw the completion of the second phase of
construction of Gaoqi International Airport in Xiamen, and
Jinjiang Airport in Quanzhou City.
</P>
<P>
Projects now under construction include Zhangzhou Port, a
terminal for 35,000-tonnage carriers in Xiouyu Port, a
5,000-tonnage container terminal at Houzhu Port in Quanzhou City,
and Changle International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Exports From Philippine Economic Zones Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Total export receipts from the
Philippine economic zones (ecozones) hit 6.5 billion U.S. dollars
in 1996, a 52-percent increase over the 4.28 billion dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
The total 1996 export receipts exceeded by 130 percent the
target of 5 billion dollars set by the government, the local
newspaper The Manila Chronicle today quoted Lilia Lima, director
general of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Lima attributed the rise to the ongoing expansion of ecozone
developers.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1995, she said, there were three additional
ecozones last year bringing to 18 the number of operational
ecozones.
</P>
<P>
As early as October last year, PEZA already reached its target
when the ecozones registered export earnings of 5.13 billion
dollars, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Total exports of ecozones account for 32 percent of the
targeted 20.5 billion dollar total merchandise receipts for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Regular ecozones comprising the Baguio City Economic Zone,
Cavite City Economic Zone, Mactan Economic Zone and Bataan
Economic Zone contributed 3.8 billion dollars in exports.
</P>
<P>
Receipts from 14 special zones reached 2.7 billion dollars, 94
percent higher than the 1.4 billion dollars in 1995, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
PEZA noted that ecozone exports have been increasingly
improving at a fast pace of over 50 percent over the past two
years, compared with an average of 30 percent in total export
growths.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Russia's population decreased by
475,000 in 1996, the biggest drop in five years, according to
figures from the State Statistical Committee.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Russia was a nation of 147.5 million
people by January 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The statistical committee said the main cause of the fall in
population was the country's high death rate in 1996, which was
1.6 times of its birth rate at the time.
</P>
<P>
Areas reporting the biggest drops due to natural causes
included Tula, Yekaterinburg and some other regions traditionally
populated mainly by ethnic Russians.
</P>
<P>
Ingush, Dagestan and Kalmyk were among the few regions which
saw a natural growth in population.
</P>
<P>
Compared with 1995, the number of immigrants dropped by one
third in 1996. Among the 349,500 who moved into Russia last year,
most were from former Soviet Union republics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of people who moved out of Russia fell by
15,000 compared with 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, February 1 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province did
10 billion U.S. dollars worth of export business last year, a rise
of 7.2 percent over 1995, and putting it in fifth place, after
Guangdong Province, Shanghai, Jiangsu Province, and Shandong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attribute the rapid growth to many
overseas-backed enterprises operating here, and to increased
investment or expanded production.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the number of overseas-backed enterprises in the
province has been increasing at a rate of over 1,000, most of
which are export-oriented production enterprises.
</P>
<P>
State-owned foreign trade companies recorded negative growth in
exports in the first seven months of last year because of state
macro-economic controls. But things have turned better since
August.
</P>
<P>
Overseas-backed enterprises played an important role in
increasing the province's exports and contributed 5.82 billion
U.S. dollars worth of commodities last year, up 21 percent from
1995, according to local officials.

Honduras Might Harbor Drug Manufacturing Plants
</P>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA -- The rise in importing chemical raw materials
such as toluene, potassium permanganate and acetone could indicate
that manufacturing plants for synthetic drugs are in operation in
Honduras, an official warned today.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Sosa Coello, President of the Congressional Commission
Against Drugs, said this business could be the source of some big
fortunes now touring the country.

Nicaragua Refuses to Participate in Anti-Drug Air Force
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman rejected today a
Panamanian proposal to create a Latin American air force,
headquartered in Panama, to combat drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
"From our point of view, we do not see the need for Nicaragua,
a poor country, to join a Latin American air force to be
established in any country," he said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Further in Path of Separatism: Spokesman (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman from the Taiwan
Affairs Offices of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of
China and the State Council has responded to the so-called
"national development conference" held by the Taiwan authorities,
accusing them of going to far down the path of separatism.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the Taiwan authorities recently held the
conference, during which they defined the relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits as "two equal political entities,"
and said nothing about "one China" and the reunification.
</P>
<P>
This signals that the Taiwan authorities are further deviating
from the "one China" principle and refusing the reunification, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that separatist forces on the Taiwan Island
tried to deny the fact that the Taiwan is a province of China in
the name of "constitutional reform," in a move to further cut off
contact between Taiwan and its motherland.
</P>
<P>
This move will surely deteriorate the cross-straits relations,
and it has received strong opposition from the compatriots on both
sides of the straits as well as in Hong Kong and Macao, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
It is well-known that there's only one China in the world, and
Taiwan is part of China, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides are temporarily separated from each other,
the legal status of Taiwan as part of China and a province set out
by China's administrative demarcation is the common understanding
of all the Chinese people including Taiwan compatriots, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to create "two Chinas", "one China, one Taiwan" or
"Taiwan independence" will never be successful, he emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Authorities Further in Path of Separatism: Spokesman (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the conference, some remarks were made in reference to
the talks between the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan
Straits (ARATS) in China's inland areas and the Straits Exchange
Foundation (SEF) in Taiwan, he noted. But no changes were made to
the stance held by the Taiwan authorities to create "two Chinas",
and hinder the cross-straits economic cooperation and the direct
postal, commercial and transport links.
</P>
<P>
"We have always advocated that the two sides of the straits
should hold political talks," he said, "Only if the Taiwan
authorities stop their activities to create 'two Chinas' or 'one
China, one Taiwan', and wipe out all the man-made restrictions on
cross-straits economic cooperation and the direct postal,
commercial and transport links, can a proper atmosphere be
developed for the resumption of the talks between the ARATS and
SEF."
</P>
<P>
"We have repeatedly emphasized our willingness to exchange
views with various parties and people in various circles of
Taiwan, on the cross-straits relations and the national
reunification, through various forms," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged that more efforts will be made in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that China will resume the exercise
of sovereignty over Hong Kong this year, which will inspire the
Chinese people both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
After the smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao, and the
successful implementation of the "one country, two systems"
principle, to settle the Taiwan question and accomplish the
ultimate reunification of the motherland will become more
prominent issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted China's reunification and rejuvenation are the common
desire of all the Chinese, including the people in Taiwan, adding
that the Taiwan authorities should not go against the historical
trend and damage the basic interests of the Taiwan people.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Treatment of Leprosy With Bonus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 1 (Xinhua) -- Many local governments in China
are taking new steps to improve the prevention and treatment of
leprosy, and some are awarding cash to people who report cases of
the disease to authorities.
</P>
<P>
In some economically-developed areas, up to 500 yuan can be
given for turning in the names of people who suffer from the
chronic condition -- a bacterial disease of the skin and nerves
which causes severe deformities.
</P>
<P>
According to official reports, the number of cases is now
estimated at 7,000, and that of newly-discovered cases has gone
down from nearly 5,000 in 1985 to some 2,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy used to be rampant in Guangdong, Shandong and Jiangsu
provinces in southern China, where great financial and human
resources have been focused on treating the disease. Today, the
disease has been nearly wiped out in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Leprosy dates back more than 5,000 years, and has been in
existence in China for at least 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1957, the official estimate of the leper population in China
was put at between 380,000 and 390,000. Those afflicted were
concentrated mainly in the southeast coastal areas and the Yangtze
River area, and scattered throughout the northeast, north and
northwest parts of China.
</P>
<P>
According to He Daxun, secretary general of China Leprosy
Association, China's strategy is to discover the patients as early
as possible and treat them with chemotherapy as recommended by the
World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO standard, a country is considered to have
basically wiped out leprosy if the incidence rate drops below 0.1
per 1,000. China reached the goal in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Several nationwide surveys of contagious diseases were carried
out in the 1970s. Nearly all the lepers in China were discovered
and registered by 1981, and 250,000 lepers were cured.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Public Health,
the number of lepers needing treatment was reduced to less than
120,000 at the end of 1981.
</P>
<P>
To completely eradicate leprosy, the Chinese Government set its
own goal in November of 1981, vowing to reduce the incidence rate
in every county or city to less than 0.01 per 1,000 at the end of
the century. At present, 83.4 percent of the counties have reached
the target.
</P>
<P>
He Daxun started research on leprosy in the 1960s, and treated
lepers in Tibet from 1970 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
"Health education is crucial to the prevention and treatment of
leprosy," he said. "It is crucial that the lepers be discovered
and treated before they become severely handicapped."
</P>
<P>
If treated at the initial stage, more than 90 percent of the
leprosy bacteria can be killed, he said. But to return cured
patients to society is a tremendously painful task.
</P>
<P>
China stopped isolating lepers by placing them in separate
rooms in 1986. Patients now are asked to receive treatment at home.
</P>
<P>
On the last Sunday of January every year, which is both the
World Leprosy Day and China's Leprosy Day, various activities are
held to spread knowledge about leprosy, and officials visit lepers.
</P>
<P>
The 15th International Leprosy Conference will be held in
Beijing in 1998. China will announce to the world at the
conference that it has basically exterminated leprosy, He
disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Cycling Union Adopts Blood Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyclists will take blood tests
this year to determine whether they have excessive levels of red
blood cells in their system, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The International Cycling Union (UCI) in Laussane adopted the
measure following allegations that many riders are using EPO, or
erythropoietin, a banned performance-enhancing drug that boosts
the production of red blood cells, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The tests will measure the rider's hematocrit level, which
represents the total volume of red blood cells in the system. If
the level is higher than 50 percent, the rider is declared
ineligible to compete.
</P>
<P>
Cyclists have also used a procedure known as blood doping,
which involves removing their own blood, freezing it and
reinjecting it before a race.
</P>
<P>
The blood tests will begin in March and the UCI is reportedly
going to take 750 and 1,000 tests over the course of the year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denies Sets Up Liaison Office in DPRK in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.S State Department
said on Friday that the United States has no plan to establish a
liaison office in Pyongyang in the near future as there are still
unsolved logistical issues.
</P>
<P>
The State Department was referring to an article from Japan's
news agency Kyodo, which said the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea (DPRK) and the United States have agreed to establish
liaison offices in each other's capitals by July. The article also
named who will represent the United States in the liaison office.
</P>
<P>
" We have not agreed to any specific date for it (referring to
establishing liaison offices). These are sill some logistical
issues that need to be worked out," State Department spokesman
Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
the DPRK and the United States agreed in principle in Oct. 1994
to set up liaison offices in each other's capital, and the United
States has sent a diplomat, Evans Revere, to South Korea to learn
Korean so that he can take over the U.S. office in Pyongyang when
it opens.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the United States has long had the objective of
establishing the liaison office in Pyongyang, "but we have not
made a formal decision on this, so I cannot agree with the basis
of that report."
</P>
<P>
When asked about remarks from James Laney, American ambassador
to South Korea, who said there might be a further delay of a
briefing in new York between the DPRK and the United States and
South Korea, Burns said he would have to get a better indication
of that before confirming whether there would another postponement
of the briefing, which had been scheduled on Jan. 29 but was put
off and reset on Feb. 5, after the United States agreed to a
request for the postponement from the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
"We'll have a better indication of that in the next 24 to 48
hours, because I believe the North Korean diplomats have to
apply for visas at our embassy in Beijing, and We'll have to see
what happens," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
"I know we're continuing planning to hold the joint briefing in
New York on February 5th and then the U.S.-North Korean bilateral
meeting after that," he added.
</P>
<P>
The joint briefing was proposed to the DPRK by U.S. President
Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young Sam last April
for four-party talks, grouping the United States, South Korea,
DPRK and China, on Korean Peninsula peace.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Algeria Asks France Not to Interfere in Its Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Algeria today asked France not to
interfere in its internal affairs, in a reaction to a statement
made on Thursday by French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, who
said Algeria "intends to drag France for a support which France
does not want to give."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that France will not worry about our affairs, that
France will not interfere in the running of our national
affairs," the Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Algerian Foreign
Minister Ahmed Attaf as telling the press.
</P>
<P>
He said that Algeria has never asked for support from France,
and wants France to "move as far away from our internal affairs
as possible."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister also rapped former French President
Giscard d'Estaing for suggesting that the outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS) be allowed to join the legislative and local
elections to be held in the first half of 1997 in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
"This declaration makes up an unhealthy contribution to an
attempt to rehabilitate those who are precisely the origin of the
tragedy which our country is living," said Attaf.
</P>
<P>
Algeria was plunged into violences after the FIS was deprived
of a victory in legislative elections held in late 1991.

<HEADLINE> Little Progress Made in Search for Missing in Bosnia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Friday that there had been little
progress made in the search for at least 18,172 persons missing
during the Bosnian war from early 1992 to late 1995.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC Belgrade office said in a statement that, after a year
of regular meetings of the working group for missing persons in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the process had lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
"No visible progress has been made by the group after three
months of consecutive sessions, including the last session, held
in Sarajevo on Thursday," the ICRC said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the three Bosnian parties -- Muslims, Serbs
and Croats -- and of the ICRC had therefore agreed to review the
approach to the problem of the missing persons.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the ICRC would in the coming weeks open a series
of bilateral talks and keep the international community informed
about the results.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC was especially disappointed by the Thursday meeting,
all the more so as ICRC President Cornelio Sommaruga had toured
Bosnia-Herzegovina two weeks ago in an effort to speed up the
search for the missing, it said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the former Bosnian belligerents, the
international High Representative Carl Bildt, the Bosnian
Stabilization Force (SFOR), the European Union, the five-nation
Contact Group and the United Nations had regularly been meeting in
the working group which was formed early last year to deal with
the thorny issue of missing persons.
</P>
<P>
According to the ICRC, 18,172 families have reported a missing
member to the ICRC, but only 1,045 families have received an
answer to their enquiries so far. The overwhelming majority of the
missing persons are believed to have died as all the prisoners of
war have been exchanged after the Bosnian war was ended more than
a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Drug Lord Gets Life Sentences, $128 Mln Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's drug lord, Juan
Garcia Abrego, today was given 11 life sentences and fined 128
million U.S. dollars by a U.S. court in Houston.
</P>
<P>
Abrego, 52, was accused of transforming Mexico's backwoods
marijuana trade into a booming cocaine smuggling operation.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted last fall of smuggling 15 tons of cocaine into
the United States and laundering 10.5 million U.S. dollars. The
jury also authorized the U.S. government to seize up to 350
million dollars of his assets, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr. ordered that the life
sentences be served concurrently.
</P>
<P>
He was said to be making an annual two billion U.S. dollars
before he was captured by drug agents in Mexico, drugged and put
on a plane to Houston a year ago, AP said.

<HEADLINE> British, Italian Prime Ministers Meet in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 31 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major held talks with his Italian counterpart Romano Prodi here
today to exchange views on bilateral relations and European Union
(EU) issues.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders failed to reach agreement on whether and how a
small group of EU members should be allowed to move faster than
other members in the European integration process.
</P>
<P>
There are different views on the so-called flexibility, which
means faster integration for some EU members. Germany, France and
Italy are in favor of eliminating the national veto power on some
major EU issues, but Britain refused to give up the veto power.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Prodi after the
meeting, Major said that there was agreement within the 15-nation
bloc on the need for flexibility.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government insisted that all EU countries
must approve any plans for a small group of members to go ahead
without the other members, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone wishes to see a position in which a small
hard core, against the interests of everybody else, proceed ahead.
We need to find a way of coping with that and protecting the
interests of other nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that different countries had different interests and
his meeting with Major "is very useful to understand each other
much better."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also promised to further bilateral cooperation
in all fields including defense manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> France Intends to Improve Relations with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today told visiting Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy that
France will seek "as many contacts as possible" with Israel, and
announced that French Defense Minister Charles Millon will visit
Israel in April.
</P>
<P>
The goodwill message was given by Chirac as a clear intention
to improve relations with Israel, after a period of freeze of
relations between the two countries following the visit by Chirac
to Jerusalem last October.
</P>
<P>
Chirac quarreled with Israeli security guards when he visited
the old town of Jerusalem, to protest excessive security measures
imposed by Israel.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette also promised Levy
that France will try to shorten the distance between Israel and
Syria, in order to help them resume peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We have expressed our determination to give to our relations
a maximum of density, intensity and friendly warmth," said de
Charette, adding that he will visit Israel within one month.
</P>
<P>
He also praised the signing of the accord on the partial
withdrawal of Israeli troops from Hebron as "the re-discovery of
confidence" between Israel and the Palestinian authorities.
</P>
<P>
An envoy of the European Union will visit Israel next week to
deliver a message from Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad on the
Israeli proposal to resume negotiations on the U.N. Resolution
242.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad wants to know what is in the mind of Israel when it
proposes to resume talks on the basis of this resolution, which
calls for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Arab territories
it occupied in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Levy said today that Israel wants to make peace with Syria
"without diktat" and on the basis of a "synthesis" of the
positions of the two countries.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 31 (Xinhua) -- New York stock markets had a
mixed session Friday, pulling back from the day's highs as
investors locked in some profits.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 10.77 points to 6,813.09,
trimming the week's advance to 116.11 points.
</P>
<P>
Advancers outnumbered decliners by more than a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, as its volume rising to 574.51
million shares from 520.41 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures ended higher, but also gave back much of their
early advance, which was spurred by a big drop in interest rates
in the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 1.99 to 786.16, just
0.07 shy of a record high. The NYSE's composite index rose 0.78 to
411.98, less than a point from a record.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 8.82 to 1,379.84, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 0.11 to 588.77.
</P>
<P>
Bonds rallied this morning despite a Commerce Department report
revealing that the economy grew a 4.7 percent growth rate in the
last quarter of 1996. Analysts had expected fourth-quarter growth
of just 3.8 percent in the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds fell
from late Thursday's 6.87 percent to 6.79 percent.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Welcomes Croatian Offer of Rights to Serbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council welcomed on Friday an offer of civil rights and political
guarantee the Croatian government made to Serbs in Eastern
Slavonia, the area that is to be transferred to Croat control this
year.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Croatian President Franjo Tudjman offered to
allow any Serb now in the Eastern Slavonia region who had been
registered to vote in Croatia in 1991 to vote in municipal
elections this Spring.
</P>
<P>
"The council," said the statement, "shares the view of the
Transitional Administration that the rights and guarantees
outlined in the letter from the government of Croatia, if fully
implemented, constitutes a solid basis for the holding of
elections simultaneously with nationwide elections in Croatia, and
offer substantial progress towards the completion of the process
of peaceful reintegration of the region."
</P>
<P>
It called upon the government of Croatia to implement fully the
commitments it has made and also called upon both sides to
cooperate in good faith on the basis of a peace agreement singed
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Previously, only Serbs from the region were considered
eligible. This time, Tudjman agreed to allow refugees from other
areas of Croatia the right to choose whether to vote in their old
homes or in Eastern Slavonia.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia is the last area still controlled by Serbs.
Under the 1995 agreement, it has been placed under United
Nations supervision pending its return to Croatia.
