<HEADLINE> Romania Seeking Major U.S. Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Romania is seeking large
investments from big American companies in a bid to enter the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
A series of U.S. projects in Romania on machine building, the
power industry, road construction through forests, and agriculture
are being discussed, a memorandum aimed at boosting
U.S. investments said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum, composed by the Romanian Foreign Ministry, is
paving the way for an official summer trip by Romanian President
Emil Constantinescu to Washington. The two countries formed a
strategic partnership last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the development in bilateral cooperation, Romania,
which is eager to gain NATO membership, is still dissatisfied with
the current U.S. capital inflow.
</P>
<P>
The reluctance of major American firms to make substantial
investments leads to negative opinions on the business climate in
Romania, and implicitly on the country's image," said the document.
</P>
<P>
American investments in Romania of 280-290 million U.S. dollars
are not enough to encourage Washington's backing, compared to the
6.2 billion in Hungary, 4 billion in Poland and 1.53 billion in
the Czech Republic, three nations ready to be admitted into NATO.

LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Fitch IBCA, the international rating
agency, lowered the Long-term rating of Hong Kong's Kwong On Bank
from "A" to "A-" and the Short-term rating from "F1" to "F2."
</P>
<P>
The bank's other ratings, i.e. the Individual rating of "B" and
Support rating of "3," remain unchanged, according to an
announcement by Fitch IBCA here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kwong On Bank is majority owned by Japan's Fuji Bank and the
lowering of its Long-term rating reflects the lowering by Fitch
IBCA of its Long-term rating of Fuji Bank, from "A+" to "A."
</P>
<P>
Fitch IBCA said that Kwong On Bank itself is a sound bank whose
own financial condition is indicated by its Individual rating of
"B."
</P>
<P>
The bank will be affected by the slowdown in Hong Kong's economy
but it is starting from a strong position, and is particularly
well capitalized, the agency added.

<HEADLINE> Bank of England to Transfer Banking Supervision to FSA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England will transfer
its responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial
Services Authority (FSA), which will come into force on 1 June.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on the Banking Act Report Wednesday,
Michael Food, executive director of the bank, said, "This is the
last such report produced by the Bank of England."
</P>
<P>
On May 6, 1997, the British government announced a major reform
of financial regulation, the transfer of responsibility for
banking supervision from the bank to a single statutory regulator
for all financial services business in Britain.
</P>
<P>
In announcing this decision, Chancellor Goldon Brown emphasized
the aim of delivering more effective and efficient supervision of
financial business, giving firms and customers better value for
money.
</P>
<P>
After the transfer, the bank and the FSA will maintain close
working relationship, as set out in the Memorandum of
Understanding between the Treasury, the FSA and the bank on the
common objective of financial stability.
</P>
<P>
The FSA's future regulatory approach will be to maintain the
standards of banking supervision currently practiced by the bank
and it will continue to implement changes designed to improve the
effectiveness of supervision.
</P>
<P>
The FSA has indicated that its approach to the supervision of
complex groups is likely to evolve and that it will pilot
multi-disciplinary supervisory teams with a limited number of
groups.

HARARE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The three-day international
conference on gender and good governance ended in Harare
Wednesday with resolutions passed calling to empower women in the
volatile world environment which is dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by about 100 women politicians and
parliamentarians from Africa, Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The delegates recommended that there should be a mechanism to
ensure women were treated with equality at government level.
</P>
<P>
They also called upon world governments to ensure an
environment free from the threats of nuclear wars and mass
destructions.
</P>
<P>
They said the environment should be free of local conflicts
which were being used as arenas for weapon testing.
</P>
<P>
The delegates called for increased allocations for the social
sector and severe cuts in defense spending.
</P>
<P>
In international organizations, it was recommended that
multilateral financial institutions must consider debt
cancellations to free resources for human development in
afflicted countries.
</P>
<P>
Steps had to be taken to ensure that the international
political economy was transparent and accountable in the true
spirit of world democracy.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also proposed that women as a group in countries
torn apart by war should be extended stronger support in their
efforts toward conflict resolution, peace making and peace
keeping.
</P>
<P>
The women emphasized the need to have access to media and
communication technologies to facilitate their effective
participation in the governance process.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was organized by the women development division of
the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs in collaboration with
the Royal Netherlands Embassy in Harare.
</P>
<P>
Its objective was to develop a common understanding of the
role of women in good governance and democratic processes, and to

2-3 late Wednesday and took the second place of Group A. Denmark
won the top place of the group.
</P>
<P>
World number one Peter Gade-Christensen gave Sweden a flying
start with his 15-3, 17-16 narrow win over second-ranked Chinese
Sun Jun in the first singles, which was his second win over the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Having beaten Gade-Christensen twice, Sun, at 22 to win this
year's All-England Open, lost to the Dane in their latest meeting
in the final of this year's Swedish Open in March.
</P>
<P>
Gade-Christensen displayed what he later described as his best
ever performance in the 52-minute thriller, especially during the
first game, which he won 15-3.
</P>
<P>
With volleys and smashes, the Dane kept his pressure on Sun in
the second game. Sun led 2-0 after the match went into setting of
three points following a 14-14 tie in the second game. But the
aggressive Gade-Christensen took the game and the match by winning
three points in a row to make it 17-16.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy to win this crucial match. Both of us are now in a
very good shape since we did not have any major competitions since
the Swedish Open," a joyful Christensen said after the victory.
</P>
<P>
"It's like a dream come true," he said. "I'll have no big
problem if we went into a third game. But I'd prefer to win it
2-0," he admitted.
</P>
<P>
Denmark's fourth-ranked Poul-Erik Hoyer-Larsen, 32, showed his
depth of strength when he won the first game 15-6 over China's
world number three Luo Yigang in the second singles. But Luo, at
21 as the semi-finalist at this year's All-England Open, won two
consecutive games 17-16 and 15-10 to win the match and brought
China to a 2-1 lead on the team score. It was Luo's first ever
win over the veteran Dane.
</P>
<P>
After Chinese Duet Zhang Jun and Zhang Wei failed to hold on
after a 14-14 tie and lost the decisive third game and the second
doubles 1-2, the Chinese team's fate hanged on its world number
five Dong Jiong, who had to beat Denmark's Kenneth Jonanssen,
ranked 12th in the world. The two split the two previous
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Jonansson won over Dong 15-6, 2-15, 15-8 for a narrow Danish
victory over China.
</P>
<P>
In the other Group A match Wednesday evening, Sweden won over
hosts Hong Kong, China, 4-1 to take the third place of the group.
</P>
<P>
In Uber Cup's semi-finals on Thursday, defending champions
Indonesia will play Denmark while runners-up China take on South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Buyoya, Factions Leaders Agree to All-party Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 20 (Xinhua) - Burundi President Pierre
Buyoya and all the conflicting factions leaders agreed here
Wednesday to attend the all-party peace talks scheduled on June
15 in Arusha in northern Tanzania for a national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the international facilitator of the
Burundi conflict, made the statement following his two-hour
meeting at his residence in the Msaasani suburb of Dar es Salaam
with visiting Major Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
"Buyoya and all the other leaders have agreed to take part in
the Arusha meeting," Nyerere told a press conference at his
residence. "They don't set any preconditions for attending the
meeting."
</P>
<P>
Buyoya, who arrived here this morning for talks with Nyerere,
a former Tanzanian president, also held talks with Tanzanian
President Benjamin Mkapa at the State House at noon before
leaving for Burundi capital Bujumbura Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A senior aid to Nyerere said the meeting between Nyerere and
Buyoya, the first of its kind held in Tanzania, was "friendly and
constructive."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has since last Saturday been consulting with various
Burundi leaders in Dar es Salaam in preparation for the all-party
negotiations in Arusha in an effort to reach a national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The leaders include the Speaker of the National Assembly
Leonce Ngendakumana, former Presidents Jean-Baptiste Bagaza and
Sylvester Ntibantunganya, Chairman of the Front pour la
Democratie au Burundi (FRODEBU) Jean Minani, and Chairman of the
National Council for Defense and Democracy (CNDD) Leonard
Nyangoma as well as a joint government and parliament delegation
led by the Minister for Reconciliation Ambrose Niyonsaba.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere discussed separately with these Burundi leaders at his
residence or at the downtown Sheraton Hotel all the proposals to
prepare for the Arusha negotiations, a secretary of Nyerere's
said.
</P>
<P>
The last regional peace talks held in Arusha last August were
boycotted by Major Buyoya who cited the security concerns and
accused Nyerere of bias against Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Secretary General of the United Nations
Kofi Annan, during his eight-nation African tour, met and
encouraged Burundi President Pierre Buyoya to accept the
mediation by Nyerere over the Burundi crisis to achieve a
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Annan reaffirmed the U.N. support for the efforts by the
leaders in the Great Lakes region to try to find a way out for
the Burundi crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary General noted that some progress has been made
for Burundi to meet certain conditions set by the regional
leaders for lifting the economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi peace talks were stalled last year after the
Burundi government said it had no faith in Nyerere because he is
both the international mediator in the Burundi political conflict
and an advocate of imposing economic sanctions on the central
African nation.
</P>
<P>
East and central African nations, backed by the Organization
of African Unity (OAU), have imposed economic sanctions on
Burundi since August of 1996, just a few days after Major Buyoya
toppled a civilian government led by President Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multiparty system in 1993.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Arms Inspectors Continue Activities Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. arms inspectors continued
their monitoring and inspection activities in Iraq on Wednesday,
with full cooperation from the Iraqi side, the Iraqi News Agency
INA reported.
</P>
<P>
Eleven monitoring groups of the U.N. Special Commission on
disarmament in Iraq, known as the UNSCOM, made surprise and
scheduled visits to 15 sites off monitoring, INA quoted an
official source at the Iraqi National Monitoring Department as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The source said one of these monitoring groups used
helicopters to reach its destination.
</P>
<P>
A biological team made a surprise visit to two sites under
monitoring in Baghdad, while two others were visiting some sites
under monitoring in Neniveh and Qadisiya provinces by helicopters,
said the source.
</P>
<P>
Another biological team returned from Basrah province after it
had finished its activities in several sites there, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
A team responsible for surveying areas of war heads
destruction started its activities on Wednesday and will continue
for 30 days with the aim of counting the remnants of destroyed war
heads in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. inspectors must verify that Iraq is free of weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. sanctions imposed on the
country in 1990 for its invasion of Kuwait can be lifted.

<HEADLINE> Major Mews Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Hard-line military leaders clamped down on the capital of
Indonesia in an effort to choke off plans for a huge demonstration
hours after President Suharto rejected calls to step down, saying
instead that he would hold elections some time in the future.
Barricades also isolated the Parliament building, where thousands
of protesting students had camped overnight.
</P>
<P>
-- Iran trumpeted a Clinton Administration decision to waive
sanctions against three foreign companies that are doing business
there as a moral victory for the European Union and one that
should signal an end to American attempts to deter similar
investments. A government communique called on the United States
to repeal altogether the legislation that requires sanctions on
companies that deal with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A panel of business leaders, academics and members of
Congress has proposed a rescue of the ailing Social Security
system using a combination of personal investment accounts and
increased retirement age. The group said Tuesday that the plan
would ensure the system's solvency for 70 years without a tax
increase.
</P>
<P>
-- India's May 11 announcement that it had tested nuclear
weapons ignited a frantic effort by the Clinton administration to
dissuade Pakistan from doing the same, beginning with a phone call
from President Clinton to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
and an 18-hour flight to Islamabad in a windowless military plane,
refueled in the air, by a high-level U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Pager services were disrupted when a communications
satellite operated by Pan-AmSat spun out of control. PageNet, one
of several firms that use the spacecraft, said more than 80
percent of all U.S. pager users lost service, and that rerouting
may take a day. The satellite also carries advance feeds to
television stations.

<HEADLINE> EU: No Plan to Boycott Israeli Goods From </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) has no
immediate plan to implement a controversial proposal on excluding
goods produced in Israeli settlements from EU tariff breaks, EU
ambassadors said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Israeli Finance Minister Yaacov Neeman
Wednesday afternoon, ambassadors of the 15 EU member states
said that the recommendation, proposed by the EU Commission last
week, was "being examined by EU institutions."
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, Neeman said it was clear that the
EU would not implement the proposed sanctions on settlements'
products. He added that the Israeli government and the EU would
continue the discussions in the near future to solve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
In its report to EU ministers, the EU Commission criticized
Israel's practice of exporting goods produced in Jewish
settlements in the Palestinian territories of West Bank, Gaza
Strip and East Jerusalem, as well as the Golan Heights which was
seized from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Israel exported these goods to Europe with a "made in Israel"
label, entitling them to enter Europe duty-free in the framework
of EU-Israeli free trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The commission suggested that since these occupied territories
are not part of Israel, goods produced in Jewish settlements in
these areas should be restricted and excluded from benefits of
the EU-Israeli trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation has infuriated Israeli officials, who
dismissed it as an attempt to prejudge Israel's borders before
these have been duly determined through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned Tuesday that the
proposed boycott would "put an end" to any EU role in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
For its part, however, the EU scorned Israel for its
"political motivated reading" of the document. In a statement
issued Tuesday, the EU said that the "restriction" suggested to
be placed over goods produced in Jewish settlements "does not
refer to either sanctions or to a boycott."
</P>
<P>
Israel has been at odds with the EU in the past months over
the EU's attempt to expand its role in mediating the Israeli-Arab
peace process.
</P>
<P>
To match its status as the leading aid provider to the
Palestinian National Authority, the EU has tried in vain to break
the monopoly by the United States on the mediation of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. Balancing Washington's
pro-Israeli bias, the EU has been pressuring Israel to end the
settlement activities and make concessions to break the year-long
deadlock in the process.
</P>
<P>
But Israel, blaming the EU for being pro-Arab, has so far
rejected to increase the EU's say in the process.

<HEADLINE> Out-of-Control Satellite Knocks Pagers Across U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 19 (Xinhua) -- Service to millions of pager
users across the United States was interrupted on Tuesday
afternoon due to a communications satellite out of control.
</P>
<P>
The satellite is Galaxy 4 operated by PanAmSat. It started having
problems about 3:30 p.m. Behind-the-scenes television transmissions
also were disrupted.
</P>
<P>
One of the paging companies estimated that 80 percent to 90
percent of the 40 million to 45 million U.S. pager users lost
service. It would take a day for the company to switch service to
another satellite.
</P>
<P>
Many pager users still don't know why their pagers were not
working.
</P>
<P>
Galaxy 4 was launched in June 1993 aboard an Ariane rocket,
primarily covering the United States, Puerto Rico and the
Caribbean. Los Angeles-based Hughes Communications Inc. is the
major owner of PanAmSat. The satellite is expected to end service
by 2005.

<HEADLINE> Annan Condemns Armed Attack Against U.N. Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday strongly condemned Tuesday's armed attack against
the United Nations personnel in Angola.
</P>
<P>
On May 19, a vehicle patrol composed of a military observer, a
police officer from the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola
(MONUA), an Angolan National Police (ANP) liaison officer, a local
ANP commander, as well as a local interpreter, was ambushed about
five kilometers north of Calandula, Mallange province. The injured
ANP commander escaped from the site of the incident.
</P>
<P>
The MONUA immediately launched a rescue operation. The MONUA
military observer was found Wednesday, very seriously injured, and
evacuated to Luanda. After a long search, the MONUA police officer
was also found and evacuated to Luanda, where his physical
condition is being ascertained. However, the body of the local
interpreter was discovered near the burnt vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reiterated in strong terms that the safety and
security of all United Nations personnel in Angola should be
unequivocally respected.
</P>
<P>
Annan also expressed concern over the recent deterioration of
the military and security situation in Angola. He appealed to the
parties, and in particular to the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola, to complete without delay the various
pending tasks under the Lusaka Protocol, in accordance with the
plan submitted to the parties by his special representative for
Angola on May 15, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Israeli PM Confirms Demand for Aid From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu Wednesday confirmed reports that he has demanded one
billion U.S. dollars from the United States to help Israeli troop
pullback from the West Bank, Israel Television reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the confirmation after a weekly cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Haaretz newspaper has reported that Netanyahu told U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright during their meeting in
Washington last week that when an agreement on the Israeli
withdrawal is reached, Israel will ask the U.S. to give a special
aid of one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said the aid would be used for security arrangements
in the West Bank, mainly building bypass roads for Jewish
settlements.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper quoted U.S. sources as saying that
Albright has not made a response.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that if the U.S. decides to meet Netanyahu's
demand, assistance would also be given to the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The PNA has reportedly asked the U.S. for 100 million dollars
to help fund steps it will be required to take in connection with
Israel's redeployment.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the PNA and Israel has been stuck over
the Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. The U.S. has reportedly
called on Israel to hand over another 13 percent of the West Bank
to the PNA.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has accepted the initiative. But the Jewish state has
argued that the withdrawal scope in the American initiative will
endanger its security and said it will relinquish no more than 9
percent of the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Renamo Urges EU not to Back Mozambique's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican National Resistance
Movement (Renamo), the biggest opposition party in the country,
asked the European Union (EU) Wednesday to change its position of
supporting the local elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued here Wednesday, Renamo said the
elections scheduled to be held on June 30, is a "farce", and that
the EU should change its position toward the elections.
</P>
<P>
Renamo also urged the international community and all walks of
life in the country to press the ruling Mozambican Liberation
Front (Frelimo) and its chairman Joaquim Chissano to "respect
truth."
</P>
<P>
Renamo and 15 other opposition parties, had decided to boycott
the local elections on the pretext that Frelimo practised
irregularities during last year's registration for the elections.
They demanded vote re-registration and the participation of the
opposition parties in the management of the electoral
secretariat, but was rejected by the government.
</P>
<P>
The EU, while admitting that there were mistakes in last
year's registration, which it saw only amounted to four percent
in the whole process, said there is no need for another
registration, as the mistakes have been corrected.
</P>
<P>
Reaffirming its position of boycotting the elections, Renamo
said in the communique that "we wish all those who take part,
directly or indirectly, in the elections, must be aware that by
supporting the elections, they are pushing the country to
instability."
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican president and his ruling Frelimo party,
meanwhile, have expressed their stance on many occasions that the
elections would be held as planned even if Frelimo turned out to
be the only party for it in the end.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the local elections would be held in 33
towns and cities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The EU has not toed the line of the U.S. which has announced
suspension of its financial aid for the elections.

<HEADLINE> Abacha Refuses to Be Parties' Only Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Head of State, General
Sani Abacha may have decided to refuse the invitation by the
country's five political parties to have him as their consensus
candidate for the August 1 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Wednesday quoted government sources as saying
that he will choose to contest on the platform of the United
Nigeria Congress Party, which has emerged the overwhelming winner
in the local government council, state assembly as well as the
national assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, General Abacha may have directed the other
four parties to nominate new candidates.
</P>
<P>
The move, reports said, is to restore the credibility of
General Abacha's transition to civil rule program, by which he
pledged in 1995 to hand over power to an elected civilian
government this October.
</P>

Earlier last month, Nigeria's five registered parties all

<HEADLINE> Germany Suspends All Cross-Border Nuclear Waste </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The German government has ordered the
suspension of all nuclear waste shipments to foreign reprocessing
plants after extremely high radioactive contaminations have been
detected outside many nuclear waste containers.
</P>
<P>
Because of the still undetermined contamination, the nuclear
waste transport to the British reprocessing plant at Sellafield
was also suspended Wednesday after a similar move on May 14
concerning the waste transport to the French La Hague plant, the
German Environment Ministry announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also said that an investigation had been launched
to clarify the issue and proper measures would be taken
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace and German opposition parties however accused
the Bonn government of having been informed of the contamination
several years ago but having tried to cover up.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the charge, the Environment Ministry said that it was
informed of the problem by the French side for the first time at
the end of April. Moreover, no contamination had been reported in
Germany so far.

<HEADLINE> Turner's Fund for U.N. Projects Starts Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The 1 billion U.S. dollar
fund set up by prominent U.S. businessman Ted Turner started to
move ahead Wednesday with the first batch of 22 million dollars to
be channeled to women, children and environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
Turner, co-chairman of Times Warner Inc., announced last fall
that 1 billion dollars would be contributed to support the United
Nations in achieving its goals. The money arrives in 10 years with
each year averaging 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the main objectives of the United Nations Fund
(UNF), Fund President Timothy Wirth told reporters here Wednesday
that the fund is to support U.N. causes and reforms, to make
Americans better understand the U.N. and to find more contributing
resources for the world body.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the 22 million dollars will go to women and
population programs (9.3 million dollars) in Latin America,
Asia-Pacific and Africa, with another 6.5 million dollars
earmarked for children's health, and 1.4 million dollars for
environmental schemes.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the money goes to such items as food aid, the fight
against drug abuse, poverty alleviation and mine clearance.
</P>
<P>
Turner's gesture was well received by the U.N. which is in a
financial crisis due to debt owed by the United States and other
countries.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Find Sporting Gene </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- British scientists said Wednesday
that they have found the gene responsible for elite sporting
performance in humans.
</P>
<P>
The fitness gene, a polymorphism of the angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE), was evident among high altitude moutaineers and a
group of raw army recruits who successfully completed a grueling
10 week physical training program.
</P>
<P>
The study, completed by the Center for Cardiovascular Genetics
at University College London, is thought to have major
implications for the treatment of strokes and cardio-vascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
The researchers identified two varieties of the ACE gene in
human, the I and D class, which are paired in three possible
associations, namely the II, ID and DD.
</P>
<P>
"We have demonstrated that version I alleles are associated
with better endurance performance than the D allele," Dr Hugh
Montgomery, who led the research team, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
DNA samples were taken from a group of 33 high altitude
mountaineers who had all climbed above 7,000 meters without the
use of breathing equipment.
</P>
<P>
These climbers were found to be more likely to carry one of the
I alleles in its two possible forms. Further studies of 15
climbers with ascents of over 8,000 meters without oxygen revealed
that none was of a DD genotype.
</P>
<P>
A second study of 78 army recruits found that those with II and
ID genotype showed improvements in repetitive weight lifting 11
times greater than those with the DD genotype.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believed that the ACE gene may influence physical
performance by increasing the take up of nutrients and oxygen to
muscle cells.
</P>
<P>
"The real benefit of this work is in saving lives. If this gene
does work by making cells more efficient it might be able to stop
cell death when fuel supply is reduced," said Dr Montgomery.

<HEADLINE> French Rightwing Claims 35-Hour Work Week Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- France's rightwing opposition Rally
for the Republic (RPR) and Union for French Democracy (UDF)
Wednesday declared as "unconstitutional" the 35-hour work week law
definitely adopted Tuesday by the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 140 parliament deputies from the RPR and UDF have seized
the country's Constitutional Council to decide whether the law
conflicts with the Constitution or not.
</P>
<P>
The deputies, including RPR and UDF parliament group presidents
Jean-Louis Debre and Francois Bayrou, said that five motives of
the Socialist-drafted law are unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
The law lacks clarity, violates the rules of laws on social
security financing, blocks the constitutionally guaranteed freedom
of taking action and violates the rights of both employers and
employees, they said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also blamed the law for breaking the principle
of equality, and failing to respect the principle of holding
collective negotiation between social partners coming into law.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was on the agenda of legislative campaign by the
Socialists last year, expects to reduce weekly working time to 35
hours by 2000 in big enterprises and by 2002 in small enterprises
in France.

UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) said Wednesday that it would move quickly
to begin using the 6.5 million U.S. dollars granted by the U.N
Foundation, totaling 1 billion dollars contributed by U.S.
businessman Ted Turner.
</P>
<P>
The 6.5 million dollar grant is part of the first batch of 22
million dollars announced Wednesday to be channeled into women and
population and environmental projects.
</P>
<P>
Turner's money comes in 10 years with each year averaging 100
million dollars in Time Warner stock.
</P>
<P>
Six UNICEF proposals have been approved for immediate work in
Africa, Indonesia and Vietnam on issues ranging from fighting
diseases to demobilizing child soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The largest portion of 2.8 million dollars is for a three-year
guinea worm eradication project in Africa, a goal set eight years
ago at the World Summit for Children.
</P>
<P>
The disease, the result of a parasite found in drinking water,
causes joint deformities, ulcers, fever and debilitating pain.
</P>
<P>
With its partners, the UNICEF will focus on disease control at
the village and district level and on improvements in water
supply.
</P>
<P>
A grant of 1 million dollars will support a battle in Nigeria,
Africa's most populous nation, to fight child killers of measles
and vitamin A deficiency.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Gratis Personnel Should Not Be Accepted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Gratis personnel should not
be used to perform functions that could be carried out by other
United Nations staff members; nor should they be accepted because
of recruitment failure.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made at the Fifth Committee (Administrative
and Budgetary) Wednesday as it discussed use of such personnel and
aspects of the support account for peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Gratis personnel are staff loaned to the United Nations, free
of charge, by its member states. The General Assembly adopted a
resolution on September 15, 1997 which prescribes the
circumstances under which such personnel may be utilized.
</P>
<P>
They may be accepted for a limited period of time, after a
budget is approved, to provide expertise not available within the
organization. Also, they can be used to provide temporary and
urgent assistance for a new or expanding mandates, pending the
assembly's decision on funds for those mandates.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the committee, Prayono Atiyanto of Indonesia,
speaking on behalf of the Group of 77 developing countries and
China, said members of the Secretariat should be appointed and
should serve according to the relevant articles of the United
Nations Charter.
</P>
<P>
He said that in 1997, the General Assembly had decided to end
the extraordinary practice of using gratis personnel, and in that
regard, the group looked forward to full implementation of the
assembly's resolution.
</P>
<P>
Those gratis personnel that fell beyond the scope of the
provisions contained in the resolution should be phased out
expeditiously, he said, adding that all the functions performed by
gratis personnel should be performed by United Nations staff.
</P>
<P>
The delegate stressed that it was the lack of adequate staff
resources that led to the use of gratis personnel, rather than the
need for specialized expertise not obtainable through recruitment.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's delegate Nester Odaga-Jalomayo said Uganda is
concerned by the acceptance of gratis personnel.
</P>
<P>
He said there was already, in the organization, a growing
tendency to undermine the provision of the assembly's resolution,
which stated that such personnel would be accepted only because
their expertise was otherwise unavailable.
</P>
<P>
He said such personnel should not be brought in to perform
functions that could be served by other staff members. Uganda is
afraid that such personnel would be accepted in order to make up
for recruitment failure.
</P>
<P>
The delegate said Uganda had long been emphasizing the need to
eliminate gratis personnel. Among other reasons, such personnel
had loyalty to their governments and could ultimately be withdrawn
by them at any time, he added.
</P>
<P>
Euy Taek Kim, the representative from the Republic of Korea,
said acceptance of gratis personnel inevitably entailed additional
financial costs for the organization, and the acceptance of gratis
personnel was often the result of insufficient staff resources,
rather than the lack of specialized functions in the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
He urged the full compliance of the assembly's resolution on
the acceptance of such loaned staff. He welcomed the U.N.
secretary-general's revised guidelines on it and looked forward to
their implementation throughout the United Nations system.

Al-Haji Ali, Assistant Secretary-General of the Sudanese

gesture of good will from the Ugandan side.
</P>
<P>
Two UPDF soldiers are still in custody in Sudan, it reported.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has put no conditions on the release of these Sudanese
soldiers but just a gesture of political tolerance. It wants to
show that it is for a peaceful solution for the long-standing
conflict between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Leader Hails Waiver of U.S. Sanction on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Wednesday hailed the waiver of the U.S. sanction
law on Iran, saying that the U.S. defeat showed Iran's real
strength.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei told the country's Friday prayers leaders that the
U.S. had incessantly attempted to plot against Iran since the
early times of the history of the Islamic revolution with all its
might through its political, cultural and financial means,
according to the Iranian official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington has madly tried to threaten those
countries to withdraw from their economic contracts signed with
Iran, however, all its attempts had met deaf ears.
</P>
<P>
In order to save face from further ignominy, the U.S. recently
retreated from the failed application of d'Amato
extra-territorial law at the international level, he said,
"doesn't this really show the real power enjoyed by the sovereign
state of the Islamic Republic of Iran?"
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressures from the European Union and its members,
U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on Monday to waive the law
and not to punish French, Russian and Malaysian companies, which
have reached a 2-billion-dollar deal with Iran in the field of gas
and oil.
</P>
<P>
Under the D'Amato Act signed by Clinton in 1996, the U.S. would
punish any companies which invest over 40 million U.S. dollars in
the energy sector in Iran. The ceiling was lowered to 20 million
dollars last August.

<HEADLINE> Museveni, Moi Stress Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
and his Kenyan counterpart Daniel arap Moi Wednesday stressed the
importance of economic integration of the east African region as
an avenue for enhancing development and attracting investors.
</P>
<P>
They made this statement at a luncheon hosted in Moi's honor
by the Uganda Manufacturers Association on Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that the sustainability of all businesses is
based on markets and that the east African market of 100 million
people is good for the manufacturers and is certainly a strong
force in attracting foreign investors to the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda's contribution in the context of east
African development lies in the area of energy products since
Uganda is richly endowed with water resources.
</P>
<P>
Moi, who is on his three-day official visit to Uganda,
stressed that Uganda's rapid economic growth is essential to the
economic revival in his country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania should not be taken as separate
economies but as a unified economic unit, said the Kenyan
president.
</P>
<P>
He called on the business community in the region to strive
for higher quality of their products in order to get more market
shares.
</P>
<P>
The visiting president also pressed for the removal of trade
barriers hindering the economic activities between the members of
the east African cooperation and appealed for concerted efforts
to create conditions favorable for the eventual establishment of
an African common market.

<HEADLINE> Delayed Sale of Copper Mines Likely to Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Further delay in the sale of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) is likely to have serious
financial complications on the country's economy, Finance
Minister Edith Nawakwi said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said that the government has no financial capacity to
sustain the ailing conglomerate and further delay in privatizing
the mines will derail the current economic program.
</P>
<P>
However, she said that her country will not sell Nkana and
Nchanga mines under duress despite the urgent need to dispose of
the assets.
</P>
<P>
She told a news briefing that even the donor community has
supported Zambia's stand by recommending that the mines should be
sold at a value that is most beneficial to the Zambian people.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reasons for the breakdown of the negotiations
between the Kafue Consortium and the government was that the
bidders refused to take over the 75 million U.S. Dollars of ZCCM
debt as part of the package in the sale of the two biggest mines
of the copper-producing country, according the minister.
</P>
<P>
Nawakwi said a number of industries depending on ZCCM for
sustenance like Chilanga Cement Corporation, Kafireond
Explosives, are likely to lose business if ZCCM collapses.
</P>
<P>
Due to disagreement over the prices of the two mines, Zambia
discontinued the negotiations last month with Kafue Consortium.
The two mines make up 65 percent of the ZCCM assets.
</P>
<P>
Because of copper price falls and outdated equipment, lack of
investment and mismanagement, annual copper output of the country
has decreased gradually to about 300,000 tons in recent years
from its peak 750,000 tons in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
To attract foreign investment, advanced technology and
management to revive the stagnating copper production, the
government has invited foreign tenders for the ZCCM mines and
assets.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Warns Against Recognition of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
Wednesday evening warned against any idea supporting any form
of recognition of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot regime in
northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the 23rd Cyprus International Fair,
Clerides stressed that any such suggestions would be rejected by
the Greek Cypriot side and would harm relations between the
Cyprus Republic and anyone nurturing such ideas.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes "the international community and those
foreign states working toward the resumption of negotiations and
a solution to the Cyprus problem should insist that the
so-called 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus' will not be
recognized and that the basis for holding talks will not change."
</P>
<P>
"I would like to stress emphatically that any thoughts of
granting some form of status or recognition to the de facto
situation created and maintained through the continuing illegal
occupation of part of the Cyprus Republic will on the one hand be
unanimously rejected by the Greek Cypriot side and on the other
will harm Cyprus' relations with anyone considering supporting
such ideas," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' remarks came in the wake of a deadlock in the Cyprus
peace process since last summer when Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash walked out of the U.N.-led peace talks with Clerides in
protest against European Union's decision to start accession
talks with Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Denktash has said he would not return to the negotiating table
unless his entity in northern Cyprus controlled by the turkish
Cypriots is recognized and the Cypriot government suspends talks
with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said the Cypriot government "fervently desires a
solution to be found by peaceful means as soon as possible," that
is why it submitted a proposal for demilitarization in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal is still valid," he said, calling on all who
are interested in drastically reducing tension in Cyprus to "take
immediate action so the demilitarization proposal is
implemented."
</P>
<P>
Clerides described the present situation as "not only unjust
and absurd, but fraught with dangers for peace and stability in
our region."
</P>
<P>
But he believed that "with the proper preliminary work the
coming months can give other opportunities to achieve the goal of
resuming negotiations."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been making efforts to help
Cyprus reunify under the bizonal and bicommunal formula sponsored
by the U.N., but so far, no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Remains Leading Exporter to Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. expanded its market in
Cyprus and remained the number one exporter to Cyprus in 1997 for
the third consecutive year, U.S. Ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth
Brill said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the U.S. pavilion in the
23rd Cyprus International Fair, which opened here Wednesday, Brill
said "our share of Cyprus' total imports, including imports for
re-export, grew from 17.8 percent in 1996 to an all-time high of
19.0 percent in 1997."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. is participating in the Cyprus Fair as the largest
single-country pavilion. Some 500 exhibitors representing some
1,600 companies from 40 countries are participating the fair.
</P>
<P>
He said trade and economic relations between the two countries
have grown even closer over the years.
</P>
<P>
"As Cyprus is gearing up to join the European Union (EU), it
will face new challenges and opportunities. Our sincere wish is
that EU accession ultimately benefits all Cypriots," Brill added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "as Cyprus moves to liberalize its economy and
respond to growing economic competition globally, Cypriots will
find the U.S. government and U.S. business community to be good
partners."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted its application for EU membership in 1990,
and started its accession negotiations with the EU last March.

<HEADLINE> Han Xue Wins Women's 50m Freestyle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAODING, North China, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Han Xue, a world top
women's short-course breaststroker, stunned favorite Hu Xiaowen to
capture the women's 50 meters freestyle on the last day of the
Chinese national swimming championships here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old clocked 25.67 seconds for the win, beating Hu
to second by seven hundredths of a second. Nian Yun finished third
in 25.92.
</P>
<P>
Han, world record holder in the short-course 50m breaststroke,
never thought she could win the title of freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"I had never expected to take the sprint freestyle crown," she
said. "My personal best, set in the national trials for the 1996
Olympic Games, was just 25.97 seconds."
</P>
<P>
The Beijing native added: "I could feel someone was keeping
shoulder with me untill the last five meters. I held my breath and
tried my best to touch the pad. I didn't know I was the winner
till I saw the time on the scoreboard."
</P>
<P>
Hu, world record holder of the short-course 100m individual
medley, attributed her loss to the lack of experience. "I was
less experienced in the finishing techniques than Han," she
said. "Anyway, this is my debut in this sprint event."
</P>
<P>
Chen Yan from Liaoning Province, double world champion and
world record holder of the 400m individual medley, took the silver
in the 200m backstroke in 2:16.53, behind her namesake Chen Yan
from Jiangsu Province in 2:14.27.
</P>
<P>
The seven-day championships, which introduced semi-finals for
the first time, has attracted 280 swimmers from 29 clubs across
the country.

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Indonesian President Suharto apologized for his mistakes and
resigned after 32 years in power, handing office to his Vice
President, B.J. Habibie, in a nationally televised ceremony. After
his brief statement of resignation, Suharto turned the microphone,
toward Habibie, who immediately took the oath of office.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. House budget committee, on a party-line vote,
approved a 1.72 trillion dollars fiscal blueprint for next year
that resumes the Republican drive to scale back the Federal
government and cuts taxes by an additional 101 billion
U.S. dollars over five years.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton has decided to order the
stockpiling of vaccines and antibiotics to treat massive numbers
of civilians in the event of a biological attack against the
United States , said sources familiar with the plan.
</P>
<P>
-- Medical clinics in Wisconsin resumed performing
first-trimester abortions on Wednesday after local law enforcement

under a new state law that bans what opponents call "partial
birth" abortions.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States posted a record 13.03 billion dollars

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China, Indonesia to Vie for Uber Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Both defending champions
Indonesia and runners-up China demonstrated superb form when they
won their respective semi-finals at the 17th Uber Cup Badminton
Finals here Thursday, thus setting a championships final clash
between the two Asian badminton arch rivals.
</P>
<P>
Seeking to win back the game's most coveted trophy they had
lost four years ago, China scored an easy 5-0 victory over South
Korea in the first semi-final tie Thursday afternoon in Hong
Kong's Elizabeth Stadium.
</P>
<P>
And Indonesians' 4-1 semi-final triumph over the Danes in the
evening offered a chance to repeat the same rivalry at the last
championships final two years ago at the very same venue.
</P>
<P>
After a record-setting five consecutive victories, China lost
the Uber Cup trophy to Indonesia when conceding 3-2 in the final
in 1994 and again two years later.
</P>
<P>
China qualified for the semi-finals of the current world team
championships after winning Group A with an unbeaten record while
defending champions Indonesia took Group B's top place with three
straight wins.
</P>
<P>
Both China and Indonesia fielded their best line-ups Thursday.
China's fairly easy 5-0 semi-final win over South Korea, which
cost them less than two and a half hours, came out a warm-up
before taking on their Indonesian opponents at Saturday's
championship final.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Li Yongbo said he felt more confident of his
team as well as world number one Ye Zhaoying. "Ye has improved
both mentally and technically. If she plays to her best form
during the final, she will win," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Ye lost to Indonesia's world champion and Olympic gold-medalist
Susi Susanti 2-1 after winning the opening game in the 1996
championships final. Ye has not lost a single game in the current
tournament here.
</P>
<P>
But Susanti had some trouble in her semi-final clash Thursday
evening against Denmark's European champion Camilla Martin, who
upset the Indonesian ace 11-7 in the opening game. But an
experienced Susanti did not give too much chance to her opponent
when she took two consecutive games to seal up a 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
China's world number three Gong Zhichao won over South Korean
Lee Joo Hyun 2-0 in 18 minutes Thursday afternoon. The Chinese was
upset by lowly-rated Japanese Yasuko Mizui 1-2 in a Group A match
four days ago.
</P>
<P>
"We've been giving Gong some special training this week,
including her footwork. She has improved a lot since then, both on
mentality and technique. She is back to her best and confident
today," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"The whole (Chinese) team is getting into the top form," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the Thomas Cup semi-finals Friday, runners-up Denmark will
play Malaysia in the afternoon and defending champions Indonesia
will take on China in the evening. The championships final is
slated for Sunday evening.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Adopts Measures to Relax Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Russian cabinet in a meeting
Thursday adopted a package of measures designed to ease the
current crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko said the measures were aimed at
increasing revenue and cutting government expenditures.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will not impose additional taxes but
promised to regulate the taxation system.
</P>
<P>
If the owners of enterprises fail to pay their debts, all their
assets would be confiscated, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to bring in more revenue, the government decided to
set up or increase taxes on those products, particularly food
products, that can be manufactured in Russia.
</P>
<P>
However, the import tax for advanced technologies and equipment
will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The government will also levy higher taxes on those enterprises
that are unable to use land efficiently or those that have already
gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russia will also strengthen control over the alcohol
market.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko pointed out that the government has decided to cut 43
overseas business offices in an effort to reduce expenditures.
</P>
<P>
On the current financial situation in Russia, the prime
minister said the government brought the situation under control
when the Central Bank raised interest rates following the crisis
that hit the security market last Friday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the financial crisis mainly to the country's
heavy debts but made it clear that Russia will pay all its
internal and external debts.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko said that despite a complicated market situation,
there can be no talk about the government's failure to fulfill its
commitments.
</P>
<P>
At the session, the premier stressed the need for sticking to a
firm budget.

reforms to be carried out," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Son-in-Law of Iran's Dissident Canonist Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Hadi Hashemi, son-in-law of Iran's
famous dissident religious canonist Ayatollah Hussein Ali
Montazeri, was arrested recently for creating political
disturbance, the evening daily Kayhan reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an informed source as saying that Hashemi recently
encouraged a group of people to create tension in Isfahan and
Najafabad in the central province of Isfahan. But the paper
did not mention when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
Following reports about a scheduled demonstration by a group
of people to show their support for Montazeri, Iranian supreme
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a statement last week,
calling on the people of Isfahan province "to neutralize the
attempts by deceived people."
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was canceled after the people of Isfahan
province turned out to reiterate their loyalty to Khamenei and
condemned any plots against the supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
Montazeri, former designated successor of the late Iranian
supreme leader Imam Khomeini, has been placed under house arrest
in the religious city of Qom since last November after he
challenged the supreme leadership of Khamenei and blamed him for
interference in government affairs.
</P>
<P>
During the past months, many people in Isfahan province,
particularly in Montazeri's hometown Najafabad, expressed
dissatisfaction with the attitude of the authorities toward
Montazeri.
</P>
<P>
Kayhan also said that Hadi Hashemi, then chief of Montazeri's
office, had been arrested in 1986 along with his brother Mehdi
Hashemi for creating confrontation between Montazeri and
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Hashemi was executed, but Hadi Hashemi was released after
he promised not to intervene in the affairs of Montazeri, who was
also forced to resign as Khomeini's successor.

<HEADLINE> Fu Quanyou Holds Talks With German Military Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Gen. Fu Quanyou, a member of the
Central Military Commission and chief of the General Staff of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), held talks here today with
Gen. Hartmut Bagger, inspector general of the German Federal
Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
Fu expressed a warm welcome to Bagger and said that he believed
Bagger's visit is bound to further understanding between the two
countries and their armed forces, and push forward their friendly
relations.
</P>
<P>
Fu said, with joint efforts the exchanges and cooperation in
various sectors between the two countries and their armed forces
have been strengthened continuously, and the PLA is ready to
further advance its friendly and cooperative ties with the German
Federal Defense Forces in the spirit of mutual respect, equality
and benefit.
</P>
<P>
Fu briefed his guest on China's independent foreign policy of
peace, its defence-oriented defence policy and the strategic
principles of active defence, as well as China's views on the
current international situation.
</P>
<P>
With regard to India's recent nuclear tests, Fu noted that
India, by conducting successively five nuclear tests May 11-13,
has ruined the international efforts to bring about a
comprehensive ban on nuclear tests and has met strong protests
from the world community. The Chinese government has expressed its
strong condemnation.
</P>
<P>
India's action, which runs against the historical trend, will
have a serious impact on peace and stability in South Asia and the
world at large, Fu stressed. Some Indians with ulterior motives
advocate the so-called China threat; in fact, they are looking for
an excuse to carry out India's nuclear weapon program, he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu noted that the Chinese armed forces, sticking to the road of
fewer but better troops with Chinese characteristics, is firmly
implementing the strategic decision announced by President Jiang
Zemin to reduce the PLA by another 500,000 personnel within three
years.
</P>
<P>
Bagger said Germany opposes and has condemned India's nuclear
tests, and Germany regards India's move as undermining stability
in the South Asian region.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit to China is short, but he is deeply impressed
by this country and he has changed some of his past views on
China.
</P>
<P>
He added that, although the cultures of Germany and China are
quite different, the two countries can make positive contributions
to guaranteeing lasting peace in the world as long as they enhance
exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Bagger stressed that Germany and China should not only develop
their economic and political relations, but also develop ties
between their armed forces. He said that he hoped that the armed
forces in the two countries would bolster personnel exchanges,
especially among young officers, so as to develop all-around
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Lieut. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the PLA General
Staff, and Herbert Jess, minister of the German Embassy in
Beijing, were present at the talks.
</P>
<P>
Bagger arrived in China on May 17 for an official visit as Fu's
guest.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader Visits Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Palestinian Islamic
Resistance Movement Hamas Sheikh Ahmed Yassin started on Thursday
a three-day visit to Syria in an effort to unify the Palestinian
groups based here.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, Yassin is expected to hold talks with
Syrian leaders on the latest developments of Middle East
situations, and Hamas' attitude towards the Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) and the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
He will meet with leaders of the Damascus-based Palestinian
factions to unify the ranks of the Palestinians against the
Israeli intransigence.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at unifying Palestinian groups to confront
Israel, Yassin said, adding that the Palestinians must use force
to retrieve the land the Jewish state took by force.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of restoring the occupied Arab land
and establishing an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas leader spoke highly of Syria's stand on the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Syria's stand is good and great and no seed of sand will be
ceded to Israel," Yassin said.
</P>
<P>
He is on a tour of Muslim countries. He has visited Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and
Yemen. He will also travel to Lebanon, Pakistan and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, a 61-year-old quadriplegic, founded Hamas in 1989. He
was freed by Israel last October after serving 10 years of a life
sentence in an Israeli jail for ordering the killing of
Palestinians who collaborated with Israel.

<HEADLINE> India Wants to Continue Dialogue With China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Indian official
said Thursday that India wants to continue dialogue and improve
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Brajesh Mishra, principal secretary of Indian Prime Minister
Atal Behari Vajpayee, said to reporters that both sides should put
aside the statements made against each other over the past few
days and restart the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
In the recent past, Indian Defense Minister George Fernandes
slandered China, calling it the "number one threat" to India.
</P>
<P>
On May 11, when India conducted three nuclear tests, Vajpayee
wrote to leaders of nine countries, referring to China and
Pakistan as a threat to India and the main reason for the nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
China has dismissed the statements as groundless.
</P>
<P>
Mishra said that India wants to improve relations with China
through dialogue on various levels as they did before.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Indian ambassador to China would go back to
Beijing within a few days and that his recall had been planned
before the nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Indian ambassador to China was called
back for consultations due to tense relations between the two
countries following India's nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
He said India also wants to dialogue with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
On the nuclear tests in May 11 and 13, which has caused strong
reactions from the world community, Mishra said that India would
like to propose a unilateral moratorium on its future nuclear
tests and it is prepared for talks with nuclear weapon states to
formalize this obligation.

<HEADLINE> Israel, U.S. Test Missile-Proof Building Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the United States are
carrying out tests to develop new building materials and equipment
capable of withstanding ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
A report of the Haaretz daily said on Thursday that a test took
place Wednesday in the Negev Desert in southern Israel.
</P>
<P>
The test involved the detonation of a ballistic missile with a
warhead containing a tonne of explosives.
</P>
<P>
A five-story structure was built for the test, using reinforced
concrete for the skeleton and the stairwell.
</P>
<P>
The building had internal shelters built according to
regulations. The test was intended to examine the strength of the
walls, which were built with different types of blocks.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is conducted jointly by the Israeli army and
the U.S. Defense Department, began in 1996. It is aimed at
providing alternatives to sealed rooms and internal shelters that
are mandatory in new apartments in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The tests are financed by the U.S., which supplies
sophisticated measuring devices to gauge the resilience of the
walls and the durability of the blocks during a blast.

<HEADLINE> Peace Process in W. Sahara Going Well: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Western Saharan envoy Ould-Salek
Salem has delivered a special message from his leader Mafoud Ali
Beiba to OAU Chairman and Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
here, saying the peace process in the territory is going on well.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Herald paper after the meeting
Wednesday, Salem said the message was an appraisal of Mugabe's
work in his capacity as Chairman of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) on the current situation in Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
He said, "as you know, we agreed with Morocco last September
to hold a referendum in Western Sahara under the supervision of
the United Nations. I have come to brief President Mugabe about
the progress that has been made so far in that respect."
</P>
<P>
Salim charged that Morocco intented to bring in its citizens
so that they could take part in the referendum with a view to
influencing the results.
</P>
<P>
"President Mugabe gave assurances that he would ensure that a
free and fair referendum takes place," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vote is to decide whether Western Sahara, a former Spanish
colony, should be incorporated into Morocco, which controls most
of the territory, or become independent, as sought by the
Polisario Front which set up the Saharawi Arab Democratic
People's Republic with Beiba as its President.
</P>
<P>
A U.N.-monitored cease-fire between Polisario and Morocco has
been in force since September 1991 but the referendum has been
repeatedly postponed because of differences over the eligibility
of voters, with Morocco and Polisario accusing each other of
trying to pack the electoral rolls.
</P>
<P>
The referendum, originally set for January 1992, had been time
and again put off till the recently-scheduled date of December 7
this year because lack of progress in resolving issues linked to
the identification of applicants from three disputed tribal
groups.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations moved in last December and set up election
posts to enable the people to vote in a referendum deciding
whether they want total independence from Morocco or not.
</P>
<P>
Salem said the identification of genuine voters has been
proceeding well.

<HEADLINE> Japan-China Group Raps Controversial Movie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A Japan-China association on Thursday
blasted the controversial Japanese film "Pride -- the Fateful
Moment" which whitewashes Japan's aggression against neighboring
countries during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Hotsuki Ozaki, representative executive of the Japan-China
Cultural Exchange Association, said the movie distorted history
and sanitized Japan's invasion of Asia during the war.
</P>
<P>
"The movie equivocally depicts the Japanese invasion of China
and gives the impression the Nanjing Massacre was a mere
fabrication," Ozaki said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The movie cannot be accepted since it destroys trust of Asian
nations in Japan," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The movie, to be put on show later this month, deals with the
trial and last days of General Hideki Tojo, Japan's wartime prime
minister, who was executed as a Class-A war criminal by the
International Military Tribunal for the Far East in November 1948.
</P>
<P>
It also depicts Japan's aggression against neighboring
countries during World War II as self-defense and denies Japanese
troops' war crimes including the Nanjing Massacre in which about
300,000 people were killed by the Japanese army.
</P>
<P>
The film has drawn criticism from various circles both at home
and abroad since its previews were given last month.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Urge U.N. to Be Impartial in Afghan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban militia
Thursday urged the United Nations to be impartial in mediating
peace talks among warring factions, saying otherwise the world
body can "hardly play any effective role" in resolving the Afghan
issue.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the U.N. proves its impartiality ... it can hardly play
any effective role as mediator, and gain any achievement in
resolving Afghan issues," Taliban's envoy in Pakistan Adul Hakim
Mujahid told reporters here Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban envoy held the rival Northern Alliance "fully
responsible for" the failure of the latest round of Afghan peace
talks, which broke down early this month in Islamabad. The talks,
the first encounter between the Afghan rivals in over a year, were
under the auspices of the U.N. and the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC).
</P>
<P>
"The roots of this can be traced in their (the alliance)
negative attitude towards the talks, the internal differences
among the various opposition factions and their benefits from the
continuation of war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also, he said, the U.N. shall to be blamed "in part" for the
break-up of the talks because it failed to play the role of a
neutral mediator.
</P>
<P>
Despite the request of the Taliban, the U.N. "did not publicize
the original record of the talks," and in its statements, the U.N.
made no mention of the concessions made by the student militia
during the talks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the U.N. did not criticize the statement made by the
opposition spokesman minutes after the suspension of the talks
which actually announced the agreement over the Ulema (religious
scholars) Commission as void and null, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban envoy's statement came after the U.N. has accused
that the Taliban have abandoned direct talks with the Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. spokesman said in New York Tuesday that the Taliban
leadership has withdrawn a proposal to set up a Ulema Commission
to rule Afghanistan, which is seen as the country's best chance at
peace in decades.

<HEADLINE> China Sets Up Its Largest Christianity Research Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- A research center on Christianity
was set up here today under the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Zhuo Xinping, the center's first director, the
center is the largest of its kind in China and will play a
leading role in China's Christianity research.
</P>
<P>
He said that currently there are over 10 research institutes on
Christianity in China, involving nearly 200 full-time
researchers. During the past five years, some 50 books in this
field have been published in China.
</P>
<P>
The expert said that China's Christianity research has
made significant progress since the reform and opening-up started
in late 1978.
</P>
<P>
"Now Chinese scholars participate in most of the international
workshops held on Christianity, and books written by Chinese
Christianity researchers have drawn attention from academic
circles all over the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Ji, vice-president of the Chinese Academy of Social
Sciences, addressed today's inaugural meeting, saying that
research on Christianity -- including Catholicism, the Orthodox
Eastern Church and Protestantism -- is very important for getting
to know both the world and mankind better.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the history of China's research in this
regard is not long, full importance has been paid by the related
departments from the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
He said the new center will promote China's Christianity
research and act as an open window on China's religious policy for
foreigners.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian Harvey Goodman was
banned for two years on Thursday after the weightlifting champion
was found for an illegal testosterone level.
</P>
<P>
An independent tribunal found the triple Commonwealth champion
had breached anti-drug guidelines. The Australian Weightlifting
Federation (AWF) confirmed the finding and said it would enforce
the ban.
</P>
<P>
Goodman tested positive in a drug test carried out in June
18. AWF executive director Robert Kabbas said Goodman had argued
that he had taken a ginseng-based herbal remedy.
</P>
<P>
When competitors record an above normal testosterone level it
can indicate they have ingested testosterone or steroids.

RIO DE JANEIRO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The under-strength River
Plate scored a 2-1 win over fellow Argentines Colon in the first
leg of their South American Libertadores Cup quarter-final in
Buenos Aires on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Five-times champions Penarol from Uruguay enjoyed a 2-0 home

</P>
<P>
River Plate were missing five players involved in Argentina's
World Cup preparations, two with Paraguay and leading striker
Marcelo Salas with Chile.
</P>
<P>
But they were still too strong for Colon. All the goals came in
the first half with Colombia's Juan Pablo Angel scoring the winner
a minute before halftime.
</P>
<P>
A last-minute strike by veteran Uruguayan international Pablo
Bengoechea gave Penarol a two-goal lead after Jose Franco had put

<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's new President
Bacharuddib Jusuf Habibie pledged here Thursday evening to speed
up reforms in all fields and to form an honest government as early
as possible to meet the aspiration of the people.
</P>
<P>
In a nation-wide television address, Habibie said he needs
support from the whole nation to carry out his duties in
implementing political, economic and legal reforms at the current
difficult time when the country is facing severe political and
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"I deeply concern about the aspiration of the people, including
those from various social circles as well as students and House
members for a total reform in the country. So I will soon set up a
professional cabinet to review the existing laws," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said he will create a clean government without corruption,
nepotism and monopoly.
</P>
<P>
To make the reform a success, Habibie called on the people of
the whole country to unite and avoid confrontation in an effort to
tide over the current economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the Indonesian government will
implement all agreements it signed with foreign countries
including the reform agreement with the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reiterates Support for Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordan said on Thursday it firmly
sides with the Palestinians in their peace efforts, especially at
a time when the United States fails to bend Israeli government's
hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians enjoy Jordan's support for restoring their
rights and establishing an independent state on their national
soil, Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali said after
meeting with Palestinian National Authority's Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation Nabil Shaath.
</P>
<P>
Jordan backs the Palestinians in confronting Israeli
"intransigence" in their peace talks and the stalemate of the
peace process caused by the intransigence, Majali said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Jordan "seeks to use its good relations with all
the concerned parties to put an end to the stalemate created and
imposed by the Israeli government."
</P>
<P>
Shaath, who arrived here on Wednesday for a two-day visit, said
after the meeting that U.S. recent efforts have failed to revive
the long-stalled Palestinian-Israeli peace talks and now the hope
is pinned on the mediation of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have been in a deadlock
since March 1997 when Israel broke ground for the construction of
a Jewish settlement in East Arab Jerusalem, which the Palestinians
want as capital of their independent state.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks are also stuck over Israeli troop withdrawal
from the West Bank. The U.S. has reportedly called on Israel to
hand over another 13 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But the Jewish state has rejected the scope, saying it would
endanger its security.

<HEADLINE> Fines, Fees Not to Be Used as Department Expenditures: Wei Jianxing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Imposing fines and collecting
administrative fees must not be regarded as income sources for
jurisdiction, law-enforcement or executive departments, a
high-ranking Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The income from fines and fees must be put into the state
coffers, and a clear line must be drawn between these incomes and
the expenditures of the departments in charge of the work of
imposing fines or collecting fees," said Wei Jianxing, member of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and secretary of the CPC
Central Commission for Discipline Inspection.
</P>
<P>
Wei made the remarks at a national televised conference on
carrying out the concerned regulations. "The separation of
departments' incomes from their expenditures is an important step
for taking precautions against and rooting out corruption," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Some departments intercept and hold onto such incomes, which
not only results in a large amount of financial waste but also
creates corruption, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Ministry of Public Security, the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, the Supreme People's Court and the State
Administration of Industry and Commerce to strictly carry out the
regulations.
</P>
<P>
"No one and no work unit is allowed to divert or withhold such
funds, and systems should be established to strengthen their
management," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, governments at all levels should also strictly
adhere to the CPC Central Committee's instructions, he said,
adding quotas are by no means allowed to be imposed on departments
concerned for the incomes from fines and fee collections.
</P>
<P>
Luo Gan, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, member of the secretariat of the CPC Central Committee,
and secretary of the Central Political Science and Law Committee
presided over the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Call For Better Protection of Rare Dolphins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Two leading scientists with the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have urged relevant departments
to ensure better protection for the white-flag dolphin, which is a
more endangered species than the panda.
</P>
<P>
Academicians of CAS Liu Jiankang and Chen Yiyu suggested that
moving white-flag dolphins from their original habitat to a nature
reserve would be the ideal way to protect them.
</P>
<P>
China is the only country which has the most endangered species
of dolphin in the world, with fewer than 100 living on the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, said Liu, a professor at
the Research Institute of Aquatic Animals and Plants.
</P>
<P>
The number of such dolphins is shrinking due to the rapid
development of fishing, shipping, water conservancy and
environmental pollution on the river, Liu said, adding that more
than 90 percent of the deaths of white-flag dolphins are due to
such factors.
</P>
<P>
He said that since these adverse factors cannot be eradicated
in the short term, the only way out is to move the dolphins to a
nature reserve which has a similar natural environment as their
original habitat.
</P>
<P>
Liu and other scientists at the institute have tried to raise
black finless porpoises, which have similar habits to white-flag
dolphins, in the Tian'e Zhou River at Shishou City, in central
China's Hubei Province, and found the area suitable for raising
dolphins.
</P>
<P>
They have delivered a report about setting up a nature reserve
for white-flag dolphins in the area to the State Council, and have
already received approval.
</P>
<P>
Liu suggested that the Ministry of Agriculture should organize
a special team to remove the dolphins to the area, and provide
sufficient funds for the management of the nature reserve.
</P>
<P>
He said the state should ban fishing totally from the area and
arrange other jobs for local fishermen.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Xiao Yang, president of China's
Supreme People's Court, stressed here today that a sound public
supervision system, especially supervision by the legislature and
advisory body, is an important guarantee of the impartiality of
the people's court.
</P>
<P>
Invited by the Supreme People's Court, some members of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) as well
as some members and Standing Committee members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) inspected it and gave instructions on its work,
yesterday and today, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The move is regarded as one of the practical measures that the
Supreme People's Court has taken to rectify itself by directly
soliciting criticism and suggestions from the NPC and the CPPCC.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that it is the starting point for the work of the
people's court to practice the rule of law and ensure judicial
justice. Greater efforts must be made to improve the
quality of the judges and eliminate corruption in the judicial
sector.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the instructions of the central government as
well as the criticism and suggestions from NPC and CPPCC
members, the people's court will work hard to stop abuses of
power by judges.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the court will rectify disciplinary procedures and
solve such problems as judges and court staff leaking secrets and
accepting bribes, Xiao said.

<HEADLINE> Volatile Trade at Karachi Bourse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE)
saw a volatile session Thursday rising dramatically in the morning
session but closing the day relatively unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The KSE-100 Index Thursday gained 1.26 points to close at
1,250.86 points against Wednesday's closing of 1,249.60.
</P>
<P>
A total of 81 million shares were traded Thursday against 121
million shares traded the previous day. There were 51 gainers and
47 losers.
</P>
<P>
Having hit a five-year low in trade Wednesday, analysts
remained wary of a rebound at the KSE-100 Index.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the confidence of the investors will likely
remain weak until Pakistan's dispute with India on the latter's
nuclear tests and the issues relating to the independent power
producers are resolved.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect trade on Friday to be dull and the KSE-100
Index is likely to show little change.

<HEADLINE> China's B-Share Market Expected to Bottom Out (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Besides, only a limited number of enterprises can be listed on
overseas capital markets, and not all Chinese enterprises can meet
the qualifications for listing overseas.
</P>
<P>
"Investors should not feel depressed about the B-share market,"
said Coull. "All markets in the world go through this, and the
B-share market is no exception.
</P>
<P>
"I'm quite confident that prices of B-shares will represent
value for someone, and investors will come back to the market."
</P>
<P>
Coull's view was echoed by stock analysts with the Jun'an
Securities Co. Ltd, who said that the current B-share market
provides the best investment opportunities. They said that they
expected the Shenzhen B-share index to gain 67 percent at the most
in the near future, and Shanghai, 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the authorities are expected to take measures to
improve the investment climate of the sluggish B-share market and
to enliven the trading for the rest of this year. Various upcoming
policy incentives will trigger a strong upward trend on the
B-share market, they added.

<HEADLINE> China's B-Share Market Expected to Bottom Out (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The bearish Chinese B-share market
is expected to gain lost ground and embark on an upward trend in
the near future, according to messages from the authorities and
predictions of stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is looking
into the problems with the nation's hard currency stock
market and will do its best to solve them, declared Chen Yaoxian,
vice-chairman of the CSRC.
</P>
<P>
"Compared to the active A-share market, the B-share market has
been failing the investors' expectations," Chen admitted,
adding, "We still take a positive attitude toward the B-share
market, and we are full of confidence in its future."
</P>
<P>
"The B-share market will see accelerated development very
soon," Chen stressed.
</P>
<P>
The B-share stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen have been
stranded in a downward trend since 1992. The sharpest decline
since then stood at 72.7 percent and 81.15 percent for the two
markets, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, there seems to be no doubt that the B-share market, a
hard currency stock market targeting overseas investors, will
continue to act as an offshore capital market for domestic
enterprises until the RMB yuan becomes fully convertible.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing basically wrong with the B-share market, and
the system is capable of raising a substantial amount of money for
China," said Gary Coull, chairman and CEO of Credit Lyonnais
Securities Ltd. "The B-share market has been severely bearish
since there are so many choices of different ways to play China,
and B-share companies are facing competition from companies listed
on better-regulated overseas markets, such as red chips, H-share
companies and N-share companies."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Promote Family Life Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Social Welfare
Department (SWD) is making efforts to promote family life
education (FLE) in a bid to prevent domestic problems faced by
many families such as single-parent families, marital conflicts,
parent-child relationship and battered spouses.
</P>
<P>
The SWD's Committee on FLE Publicity Campaign and the Radio
Television Hong Kong have jointly produced a series of 10-episode
radio docu-drama to illustrate a wide range of problems and issues
challenging the families.
</P>
<P>
Based on genuine cases, each episode will present a typical
story of modern families in an open-end drama, with FLE worker's
advice on the prevention of the problem at the end of the program.
</P>
<P>
As part of the year-long publicity campaign to convey the
thematic message "Care for Your Family", the radio docu-drama is
scheduled to be broadcast Friday.
</P>
<P>
With an annual funding amounting to 831,000 HK dollars (106,538
U.S. dollars), the publicity campaign will highlight the roving
family puppet shows to be performed in the latter half of the year
throughout Hong Kong to arouse public awareness of care and
concern in the family.
</P>
<P>
In addition, an election of happy families is being held by
inviting submissions of essays from the general public to share
experience on ways to overcome family problems to echo the theme
"Care for your Family: Put Your Care in Words".
</P>
<P>
As recent social and economic changes have surfaced various
family problems, the promotion of FLE is deemed to be a proactive
and primary strategy to tackle the issue.
</P>
<P>
Figures showed that all family services centers in Hong Kong
had been handling more and more cases, with the total caseload
increased from about 48,750 in March last year to some 51,540 in
the same period this year, representing an increase of six
percent.
</P>
<P>
To cater for the great demand for family services, the total
number of family caseworkers has been increased from 491 to 706 in
the past three years and another 26 will be added to the force
this year.

<HEADLINE> Australian Exports increase 10 Percent in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Australian exports increased 10
percent in 1997 over 1996, with manufactured goods leading the
way, a study on Australia trade released Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
Composition of Trade 1997, released by the Department of
Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), revealed that exports increased
by 10 percent last year to 85 billion Australian dollars (54
billion U.S. dollars), while imports increased by six percent to
83 billion Australian dollars (52.7 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 2.3 billion Australian dollars surplus was a major
improvement compared with the previous year's 0.8 billion trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
Japan was once again Australia's single biggest market, taking
20 percent or 16.8 billion Australian dollars (10.67 billion U.S.
dollars) of Australia's exports, an increase of eight percent from
the figures in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Next were South Korea with 6.8 billion Australian dollars and
the United States with 6.3 billion Australian dollars (4.3 and 4.0
billion U.S. dollars respectively).
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific region took a massive 71 percent of
Australia's exports, with growth in Asia alone registering 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, trade figures released Thursday for the first quarter
of this year showed a dramatic slump in Australian exports,
especially to Asia.
</P>
<P>
Exports to every major country in Asia were down in the first
quarter, while the exports to the United States increased to
account for 13 percent of the Australian exports due to the fall
in the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, coal was Australia's single biggest export, rising 13
percent to 8.8 billion Australian dollars (5.9 billion U.S.
dollars), which accounts more than 10 percent of the total
exports.
</P>
<P>
Australia's reputation as a quarry and a farm for the world is
being rendered out of date by the growth in manufactured exports,
which now account for 33 percent of total exports up from 28
percent just five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
However, exports of the traditional staples, wheat and wool,
increased by more than 10 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
On the import side, the United States remains the single
biggest source, supplying a massive 22 percent of the overseas
goods, followed by Japan which supplied 12 percent of imports.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Reap Rice Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Agricultural
Minister has predicted a rice harvest in the country this season
despite the negative effects by floods over the past months.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Thursday quoted Paul Kimiti, Minister
of Agriculture and Cooperatives, as saying that the government is
likely to allow traders to export the rice if an assessment
presently underway proves that Tanzania is going to have enough
rice stocks.
</P>
<P>
However, the government will be unable to transport food in
stocks from harvest areas to those which suffer from food
shortage due to damaged roads, the minister said in the
Sumbawanga District Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa said earlier this year Tanzania needed more
than 100 million U.S. Dollars to repair damaged roads and other
infrastructure facilities.
</P>
<P>
The east African country banned food exports a few years ago
after food stocks were exhausted.
</P>
<P>
The report further said during the current season, rains
blamed on El Nino devastated farms and caused an outbreak of
rodent invasion unseen in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has spent 200 million Shillings
(about 325,000 U.S. Dollars) to fight the crop eating bird of
quelea quelea which invaded a lot of farms in the country.

<HEADLINE> China Concerned About Its Citizens in Indonesia: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China is paying close attention to
the development of the situation in Indonesia and is concerned
about Chinese citizens in that Southeast Asian country, Chinese
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu Bangzao said here today.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a reporter's question, Zhu said that, upon
instructions from home, the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia is
sparing no efforts to provide consular protection and assistance
to Chinese citizens in Indonesia, including compatriots from Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The embassy has registered Chinese citizens there and kept
close contact with them. It has also transferred some
Indonesian-Chinese to safe areas, he noted.
</P>
<P>
For those Indonesian-Chinese who want to leave Indonesia, the
embassy has worked hard to give them all necessary help and
facilities, and arranged with the Cathay Pacific Airways and
Southern China Airlines to put on more flights to and from
Indonesia, Zhu said, adding that relevant departments in China are
also working hard for this.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to pay close attention to the development
of the situation in Indonesia as well as the situation of the
Indonesian-Chinese in that country, and take proper measures to
provide them and Chinese citizens with all necessary assistance,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Indonesian-Chinese, Zhu said that many of them
have relatives in China, and their relatives are also concerned
about their plight.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, China hopes the situation in Indonesia will calm
down as soon as possible, and that the Indonesian Government will
take effective measures to protect the lives and properties of all
ethnic groups in the country, including the Indonesian-Chinese, he
said.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Govt Committed to Civil Service Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Anson Chan, secretary for
administration of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), stressed here Thursday the government's firm commitment
to upholding Hong Kong Civil servants' fine tradition of
integrity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of a seminar on "Hong Kong into the
21st Century -- Maintaining Integrity in the Civil Service", Chan
said that the Hong Kong Civil Service enjoys a well-deserved but
hard earned reputation among the local and international community
for its efficiency and honesty.
</P>
<P>
"Our high standard of probity and performance are acknowledged
to be among the key advantages that have secured Hong Kong's very
high position in the global league of the best places to live and
to invest and work," she said. "but we cannot afford to be
complacent."
</P>
<P>
Over 190,000 strong, the Civil Service is the single largest
group of employers in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural policy address last October, Chief Executive
Tung Chee Hwa affirmed the commitment of the Civil Service to
serve the community through the proper exercise of its powers and
the faithful discharge of its responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
Chan said the responsive government which the Chief Executive
described needs a Civil Service which adheres to a set of shared
values.
</P>
<P>
These values can best be summed up in six key principles of
commitment to the rule of law; honesty and integrity above private
interests; accountability and openness in decision-making and in
all actions; political neutrality in conducting official duties;
impartiality in the execution of public functions; and dedication
and diligence in serving the community, she said.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 senior civil servants from about 90 bureaus and
departments attended the seminar which was jointly organized by
the Civil Service Bureau and the Independent Commission Against
Corruption.
</P>
<P>
After the seminar, Lily Yam Kwan Pui-ying, commissioner of the
Independent Commission Against Corruption, and Lam Woon-kwong,
secretary for the Civil Service, gave a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Yam revealed that corruption reports against the police dropped
by five percent in the first four months of this year compared
with the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Reports against other government departments rose slightly from
255 to 269 in the same period, she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if there had been any change in the pattern of corruption
since the handover, Yam said that it remained very much the same
and that Hong Kong's corruption figures were comparatively low.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Failed TV License Bidders to Sue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Two bidders which failed to
win South Africa's first private free-to-air television license
earlier this year will sue the authority body involved for its
"unfair" decision, local media reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two consortiums, Free to Air and New Channel TV, said
Wednesday they will apply to the high court for a review of the
decision of the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), which
oversees the nation's broadcast services, to grant the license to
Midi Television.
</P>
<P>
The two top bidders, among the six failed bidders, argue that
Midi is not the most suitable applicant and there were
"procedural irregularities" in the granting process.
</P>
<P>
Despite the court action threat, Midi Television said Thursday
it will begin broadcasting on October 1, and become virtually
the first competitor of the now dominating state TV operator, the
South African Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The IBA said Wednesday it intended to stand by its decision
and was confident it conducted the process in a fair and
transparent way.
</P>
<P>
The IBA also said the pending action is "quite exciting" as
it will help "build jurisprudence around broadcasting
regulation."
</P>
<P>
Revealing the reasons for its decision last month, the IBA
said Midi's corporate status and strong black empowerment
ownership gave it the "competitive edge."

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, May 21 (Xinhua) -- About 100 teachers from all sorts of
primary schools in Macao gathered together on Thursday to study
the basic law of Macao in a part-time course.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest event in the growing trend to learn the
basic law among Macao residents. Macao grassroots organizations,
civil service groups and even the Macao-born Portuguese
communities have started their own course to make themselves
familiar with the law.
</P>
<P>
Lau Sin Peng, director of the Macao Chinese Education
Association, which organized the course, told Xinhua that her
association had to expand the class from one to two now as it was
overwhelmed with applications from local primary schools,
including those private- and publicly-funded.
</P>
<P>
"It is today's students who will abide by, implement and
defend the basic law of Macao in the future," she said. "But to
make the students familiar with the law we must first let the
teachers know the law, that's why we start the course."
</P>
<P>
She said that encouraged by the teachers' enthusiasm to the
course, her association plans to hold more in the future,
including one set for the summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
Following the publication of the Macao Basic Law Textbook in
1994, more and more primary and middle schools in Macao have
initiated the basic law course.

<HEADLINE> Final Members of Cambodia's Constitutional Council Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The last three members of
Cambodia's nine-member Constitutional Council were appointed
Thursday by the Supreme Council of Magistracy.
</P>
<P>
They were chosen from seven candidates at a three-hour meeting
of the Supreme Council chaired by Chea Sim, president of National
Assembly and acting head of state.
</P>
<P>
The list is yet to be approved by King Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
The Constitutional Council is empowered to review laws passed
by the National Assembly and to rule on election disputes,
including interpretation of election results. General elections
are scheduled for July 26.
</P>
<P>
The king and the National Assembly have each appointed their
three respective representatives on the Constitutional Council.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the king's three, the rest come from Cambodia's
People's Party (CPP).
</P>
<P>
The three members named by the Supreme Council are Chan Sok,
president of the Supreme Court, Prak Sok, secretary of state at
the Ministry of Public Works and Thor Peng Leath, former governor
of the National Bank.
</P>
<P>
Oppositions and legal experts have criticized the formation of
the council as hasty.
</P>
<P>
"The council is being formed in a hasty and irregular manner
that will impair its function and put its legitimacy in question,"
said Chau Sen Cocsal Chhum, the most senior appointee to the
council named by the King.
</P>
<P>
"If the formation of the council proceeds as planned and the
election date stands at July 26, the council will be unable to
properly perform its duties to ensure an election that is valid
under the Constitution," he said in a statement Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Merger partners NationsBank and
BankAmerica Wednesday announced a commitment of 350 billion
U.S. dollars over the next decade for low-and-moderate-income
customers, including mortgages and loans to minority applicants.
</P>
<P>
In a joint release, both banks called it the largest, most
comprehensive program of its kind.
</P>
<P>
The 350-billion-dollar commitment includes specific lending and
investment goals for affordable housing, small business, consumer
lending and economic development. As part of the commitment, the
new company pledges to acquire, build or rehabilitate 50,000
affordable housing units during the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Of the money, 180 billion dollars for small businesses will
include conventional and government-assisted loans, as well as
investment in small business investment corporations and minority
business venture capital funds.
</P>
<P>
The affordable housing program with 115 billion dollars
includes single- and multi-family lending and investment to low-
and moderate income borrowers and minority applicants.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five billion dollars for economic development include
loans and investments to nonprofit organizations such as community
development corporations.
</P>

Thirty billion dollars for consumer loans include home-related
loans for borrowers below median income and other auto and
consumer loans for borrowers with an annual household income at or
below 80 percent of median income. Credit card borrowing is not
included in this commitment.
</P>
<P>
Last month, NationsBank and BankAmerica announced a
57.2-billion-dollar marriage to create a coast-to-coast banking
behemoth. The new company will have about 180,000 employees and

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Increases Credit Financing Facilities to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced here Thursday to double the
country's export credit financing facilities to 4 billion ringgit
(1.0666 billion U.S. dollars) with immediate effect to promote
exports.
</P>
<P>
Of the 4 billion ringgit, 3 billion ringgit ( 0.8 billion U.S.
dollars) would be allocated for the Export Credit Refinancing
(ECR) scheme, up 1.7 billion ringgit ( 453.333 million U.S.
dollars) from the present level of 1.3 billion ringgit (346.666
million U.S. dollars), Anwar, who is also finance minister, said
at a press conference here after chairing a meeting with bank
officials and exporters to discuss additional allocation for
export credit.
</P>
<P>
The other 1 billion ringgit (266.666 million U.S. dollars) is
allocated for the supplier credit, buyer credit and overseas
investment credit facilities being managed by the Export-Import
Bank (Exim Bank), he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that the facilities have proven to be effective in
promoting exports. In recognizing the important role that trading
companies play in marketing and promoting exports of Malaysian
goods, the ECR scheme would also be extended to these trading
companies, he added.
</P>
<P>
The ECR facility, being managed by Exim Bank, is made available
to all banks in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that with increased globalization, countries have
become more vulnerable to external shocks, and competition has
been heightened in the light of the East Asian crisis with all
countries in the region striving to expand through an
export-oriented strategy.
</P>
<P>
He said the facilities were made available by the government to
assist exporters in export promotion efforts.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister called upon exporters to put in more
efforts in undertaking the necessary structural changes themselves
to adapt to the changing competitive environment so as to be
well-positioned to face increased global competition.
</P>
<P>
"They have to be more aggressive in their marketing efforts and
increase exports, not only extending their market share in
existing markets but also through penetrating new markets," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The export-oriented strategies have been a cornerstone of
Malaysia's industrialization strategy and in the present
environment, strong export growth has become even more important
in reducing the country's vulnerability and contributing to
economic recovery.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Kenyans Suffer as Lake Victoria Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Xu Jianmei)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Fear and panic are gripping
south-western Kenyan region ashore Lake Victoria as its waters
have continued rising since last week, wreaking havoc and
displacing hundreds of people.
</P>
<P>
Families are stranded with no food, livestock trapped and
drowned in the floods and crops ruined.
</P>
<P>
Villages and schools have been swept away and other houses
submerged as the lake waters engulf the mainland.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of acres of farmland, mainly under maize, sorghum and
sugarcane, are flooded with the crops destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government on Wednesday announced plans to evacuate
families ashore Lake Victoria, the second largest fresh water
lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
But efforts by the Kenyan government to rescue the displaced
have been hampered by poor roads, which were made impassable by
the floods, while the lack of communication also worsens the
situation.
</P>
<P>
All telephone lines in government offices in the affected
areas have been disconnected over unpaid phone bills and thus
"has made it difficult to monitor the situation and file an
accurate report," said an official in Kisumu, the largest city
ashore the lake.
</P>
<P>
Now rivers of Nyando, Sondu-Miriu, Yala and Nzoia, with the
help of their tributaries, have swept into the lake large amounts
of silt and vegetation from the catchment areas of the western
highlands.
</P>
<P>
From Osodo Bay to Winam Gulf, the land is flooded, a field
report from the Daily Nation newspaper confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As the water rises, villagers -- many of them fishermen --
have fled to safer and drier land, leaving their homes and
possessions covered in a thick layer of marshland vegetation,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
Many grass-thatched houses collapsed, their soaked mud walls
crumbling and bringing down the roofs. The floated carcasses of
drowned animals drifted slowly on the flood waters between tall
trees, as patient vultures circled above.
</P>
<P>
Men, women and children carrying a few belongings on their
heads, waded through the waist-high waters to safety.
</P>
<P>
The flooding has raised fears of disease. Last year,
water-borne diseases such as typhoid, cholera and diarrhoea swept
across the region, claiming scores of lives.
</P>
<P>
The lake supports some 25 million people, 10 million being in
Kenya, although it only holds about six percent of the lake's
2,760 cubic km of water with Tanzania 49 percent and Uganda 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also sparked heated debate about its causes
with some experts arguing the phenomenon, last seen in early
1960s, is mainly a result of siltation due to the blockage of
river estuaries by the hyacinth weed.
</P>
<P>
The blockage by water hyacinth forced silt deposits in the
shallow sections of the lake, damming the rivers and causing
floods, says William Saina, an agricultural expert.
</P>
<P>
He attributed more siltation to destruction of trees and
cultivation in water catchment areas in highlands near the Rift
Valley province.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a marine expert, Joseph Mucuthi, also said the
hyacinth weed runs riot with roots and leaves having collected at
the bottom of the lake, making it shallower, hence the overflow.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is the shoreline "which is now shrinking
towards the lake" as it has not been surveyed for more than 50
years, Mucuthi said.
</P>
<P>
However, Dr Geoffrey Howard of the International Union for
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources said Monday the
hyacinth invasion is an unlikely cause of the water rise as 92
percent of the weed is water.
</P>
<P>
"Rainfall increase might be the cause, that is, if the totals
are abnormally high as the one experienced in 1960," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth is likely to increase the rate of evaporation
hence decreasing water levels, he argued.

LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's flower exports to the
European market stood at 5,231 tons last year compared to 3,861
tons in 1996, with a 35 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Steven Humphreys, Chief Executive of the Export Board of
Zambia said Wednesday that the Zambia Export Growers Association
will continue providing quality services to its members in 1998
to achieve a 30 percent growth in flower exports this year over
last year, Times of Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Rose flowers registered 45 percent of the total exports, said
Humphreys.
</P>
<P>
Flower growers in Zambia have put 500 hectares under flower
production this year to achieve sharp increases in flower
exports.
</P>
<P>
The association has embarked on a training program for farm
supervisors to impart on them modern flower management skills to
ensure that the produce meet the international standards.
</P>
<P>
In Zambia, the management of horticultural exports is still
dependent on foreign expertise because of a shortage of qualified

an Israeli attack, the Voice of the People radio reported here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The militant was killed when shells fired by Israeli troops
crashed in the village of Soujud in the eastern sector of the
occupied zone, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army has confirmed the fatality, saying in a
communique that at least one "terrorist" was killed in its latest
attack on a guerrilla unit in the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
There is no report of Israeli casualties so far.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a guerrilla war to fight
about 2,000 Israeli occupation forces and their 2,500-strong
allied militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Guinea Bissau to Tighten Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria and Guinea Bissau have
agreed to further promote bilateral and sub-regional cooperation,
especially in the field of energy.
</P>
<P>
To this end, a meeting of the Nigeria-Guinea Bissau Joint
Commission is to be held in the Nigerian capital Abuja next
month.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting will discuss economic and social
issues that will deepen the good relations between the two
countries and, particularly, the current energy problem in west
Africa to find an early solution.
</P>
<P>
These are the highlights of a communique issued Wednesday at
the end of the two-day visit to Nigeria by President Joao Bernado
Vierra of Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Vierra and his Nigerian counterpart General
Sani Abacha reviewed the progress made in the implementation of
the various cooperation agreements between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the need to increase the present level of
economic ties between the two countries, the leaders explored new
ways of forging closer and more rewarding collaboration and
reaffirmed the need for regular and sustained contacts and
consultations at various levels.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed their commitment to the objectives and
principles of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS), in which their countries are founding members.
</P>
<P>
The leaders renewed their commitment to rapid economic
integration in the sub-region while appealing to member states to
demonstrate the political will to accelerate various ECOWAS
agreements and protocols.
</P>
<P>
As ECOWAS leaders, Abacha and Vierra reaffirmed their
commitment to the use of dialogue and consultations in resolving
conflicts and maintenance of peace and security in the
sub-region.
</P>
<P>
They consequently appealed for the reinforcement of the
mechanism for the prevention of conflicts and maintenance of
peace in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Within the wide context of African economic integration, the
two leaders called on all the members of the Organization of
African Unity to take necessary measures at national, regional
and continental levels to ensure effective economic cooperation
among groupings.

<HEADLINE> Intel's Relay Baton Passed onto Non-Founding Member </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Craig Barrett, a 24-year
veteran of Intel Corp., Wednesday took over the chip giant's helm
and became its first chief executive officer who was not there at
the founding.
</P>
<P>
Formerly the company's vice president and chief operating
officer, Barrett took the relay baton from Andrew Grove, who
relinquished his title as CEO but will remain chairman.
</P>
<P>
The transition comes as Intel faces diminished profits and
increased competition. Last month the company reported its worst
financial performance in 10 years and said it would eliminate
3,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
At Wednesday's annual shareholders meeting, Barrett reiterated
the company's plan to tackle the industry-wide personal computer
showdown by diversifying its microprocessors to serve different
segments of the market and investing in manufacturing and research
and development.
</P>
<P>
"We need to renew and sustain our historic growth," he told
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
Intel supplies 85 percent of the world's computers with
microprocessors, which function as the brains of the system. The
company's profits and revenues have remained flat for the last 18
months, due to competition from small rivals and slackening of
demand for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Its revenues for 1997 came roughly to 25 billion U.S. dollars
and profits to 6.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Analysts describe Barrett, 58, as a master planner. He has been
running Intel's day-to-day operations for quite a long time. He is
credited with revamping the manufacturing operations in the 1980s,
making Intel's efficiency the envy of the industry.

<HEADLINE> Iran's New Party Calls for Solidarity, Prosperity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Iran's first political party since
the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the Constructive Executives of Iran
(ECI), Thursday vowed to work for "Islamic Dignity, Sustaining
Construction and Iran's Prosperity."
</P>
<P>
The new party, which came into being Wednesday after being
permitted by the Interior Ministry, called on Iranian people,
especially the young generation, to join hands to build a more
vigorous Iran, according to the Hamshahri daily.
</P>
<P>
In a statement carried by the paper, the party pledged its
commitment to upholding the two principles of Islamism and
Republicanism of the country.
</P>
<P>
As a moderate party, the ECI also expressed its "determined
support" for the government led by moderate President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Another moderate daily Iran News reported Wednesday that the
ECI would start its political activities "as a full-fledged
political party" with Tehran Mayor Gholamhussein Karbaschi, a close
ally of Khatami, as its secretary general.
</P>
<P>
The ECI was evolved from G-6, originally a political group
founded in 1996 by six technocrats, including Karbaschi.
</P>
<P>
The group played a significant role in the presidential
elections in May last year, in which Khatami won with a landslide
victory.
</P>
<P>
The birth of the ECI may indicate a breakthrough in Iran's
politics because political parties had been banned in the country,
according to analysts here.

PARIS, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- A war criminal has become a hero on the screen of movie
theaters in Japan. ``Pride, the Fatal Moment'' which was on Hideki
Tojo, hanged in 1948 for crimes against humanity, came out last
Saturday in 140 movie halls. It depicted the Japanese army invading
Asian countries as a ``liberation army'' freeing Asia from white
colonialism. The film also paid hommage to Indian judge Radhabinod
Pal, the only one of 11 judges at the Tokyo Far-East Military
Tribunal who pleaded for acquitting Tojo.
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli information center for human rights Betselem has
accused the Israeli security forces of routinely torturing
Palestinians. A report published on Tuesday by Betselem said that
the Israeli secret service Shin Beth exercises tortures on 85
percent of some 850 Palestinians detained by them each year.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- French Prime Minister Wednesday broke all ambiguity about
his attitude toward the president of the republic and called for
a ``most total reservation'' by the members of his cabinet in
making comment on judicial issues. Jospin said that he and
President Chirac have never engaged in any kind of battle against
each other, although they hold different convictions.
</P>
<P>
-- With the theme of ``the Oceans, a Patrimony for the Future,''
an exhibition will be opened on Thursday in the Portuguese capital
Lisbon in the presence of 12 chiefs of state and government. The
exhibition is presented as a window of modern Portugal and will
recall a golden age of ocean sailings. It also falls on the 500th
anniversary of the arrival in the Western Indian islands by Vasco de
Gama on May 21, 1498.

SEOUL, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Navy launched its
seventh 1,200-ton submarine Thursday at the country's southern

</P>
<P>
Christened "Lee Sun-sin-ham," the diesel-powered submarine is

The sub, which will be officially commissioned after a one-year

who as a deputy for the national hero Adm. Yi Sun-sin, expelled
the invading Japanese armada in the South Sea.

<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's non-governmental diplomatic
work is mainly aimed to build up mutual understanding, trust and
friendship among the people around the world, President Jiang
Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with members of the Seventh Council of the
Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries
(CPAFFC) at the Great Hall of the People, Jiang said the CPAFFC, a
major organization engaged in unofficial diplomacy, has played a
vital role in improving China's international environment and for
the country's domestic construction over the past four decades.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the hope that China's non-governmental diplomatic
work will continue promoting international economic and cultural
cooperation through existing unofficial channels to the service of
China's reform, opening-up and economic development.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the CPAFFC to continue to involve itself in
forging sisterly-city ties with other countries so as to
facilitate the Chinese cities' international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji and Vice-Premier Qian Qichen were along with
President Jiang at the meeting with over 280 CPAFFC Council
members, who are attending its seventh council meeting that opened
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CPAFFC, founded in 1954, has so far set up cooperative
relationships with 364 unofficial organizations in 115
countries. Moreover, it has helped form 821 pairs of sisterly-city
relationships between the Chinese cities or provinces with their
counterparts in other countries.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will release
30 million U.S. Dollars this week to stabilize the foreign exchange
market, said Financial Minister Edith Nawakwi.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia Thursday quoted the minister as saying that
the government has already off-loaded more than 50 million
dollars on to the market since the shortage of foreign exchange
started a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange to be released on the market will come
from the Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM), the country's
main foreign exchange earner, Nawakwi said.
</P>
<P>
The additional release this week will offset the period of
time it took for the donors to start disbursing the 531 million
dollars pledged at the consultative group meeting held in Paris
last week, she said.
</P>
<P>
It took the World Bank two weeks and the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) three weeks to get approval from their boards
of directors before they could start to disburse the money.

<HEADLINE> New Chief Minister Named for Malaysia's Sabah State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Malaysian
government has named Bernard Dompok, 49, as new chief minister of
Sabah, East Malaysia, representing the state's non-Muslim
Bumiputra (aboriginals) community.
</P>
<P>
Dompok, who is state Tourism and Environment Minister and Parti
Demokratik Sabah (PDS) president, will succeed Yong Teck Lee,
whose term as chief minister expires on May 28.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim made the
announcement at a press conference here Thursday, saying "I've
been asked by Prime Minister (Mahathir Mohamad) to announce the
name of the new Sabah chief minister to succeed Yong Teck Lee and
he is Bernard Dompok."
</P>
<P>
Mahathir is recuperating at the Universiti Kebangsaan Hospital
here after last week's minor ankle surgery and is resting upon
doctor's orders.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said "He (Dompok) will hold talks with the prime minister
at the earliest possible time before taking his oath of office and
forming the state cabinet."
</P>
<P>
The appointment of a non-Muslim Bumiputra (aboriginal) as chief
minister Thursday has fulfilled Mahathir's pledge to the people of
Sabah in 1994 that the post would be rotated for two years each
among Sabah's three majority communities -- Muslim Bumiputras,
Chinese and non-Muslim Bumiputras.
</P>
<P>
Sabah, one of the two states in East Malaysia, is the only
state where a rotation system is implemented by Mahathir-led
Barisan National (BN) (National Front).
</P>
<P>
The first chief minister under the rotation system came from
the Muslim Bumiputra community followed by Yong, representing the
Chinese.

<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- After years of agricultural
development, China's Yellow River Delta is now looking for faster
economic and infrastructure development and opening to the outside
world, "People's Daily" reports today.
</P>
<P>
The Delta area has 5.17 million people in 12 districts and
counties in the city of Dongying on 18,000 sq km of land, with
about 1.74 million hectares of farmland, as well as oil, copper,
gold and granite reserves.
</P>
<P>
It also has China's second largest oilfield, the Shengli, and
is an important petrochemical, agricultural, animal husbandry, and
fishery center.
</P>
<P>
It has, however, long been economically backward because of
saline soil, various disasters, and unused resources, in sharp
contrast to the prosperity and fast development of the Yangtze
River Delta or the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong Province in the
South.
</P>
<P>
The Delta area's Binzhou Prefecture has had some success with
economic development and opening up to the outside world. One
parcel of land has been turned into high-yield farmland after many
years of development. Seven of its counties have become cotton and
wheat production centers, and other farm and sideline product
centers are being built.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has 4 pillar industries in textiles, chemicals,
machine-building, and foodstuff, and overseas investors have shown
an interest in it as its infrastructure improves. It has approved
334 overseas-financed ventures and established business ties with
more than 50 countries and regions and exported 3.5 billion yuan
worth of goods in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It has also tried to benefit from the Shenmu-Huanghua project
for transporting coal from northwest China to the northern Chinese
coast for economic development.

<HEADLINE> Officials Dismissed for Incompetence in Central Chinese Province </HEADLINE>

<P>
CHANGSHA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- More than one hundred government
officials in China's Hunan Province have been dismissed or demoted
as a result of being found incompetent during an evaluation
process that began earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Ruanjiang, as many as 39 were dismissed,
demoted, or even given disciplinary penalties for incompetence.
</P>
<P>
Five officials in the city of Yueyang managed to avoid being
sacked immediatedly but have been given a year of probation before
a final decision is made.
</P>
<P>
The old practice that Chinese officials could not be dismissed
as long as he or she did not commit major crimes has now been
abandoned in a growing number of places in China as it prepares to
open wider to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Hunan government said that last year
the province worked out new regulations that specifically define
reasons for promotion, dismissal, or demotion of government
officials to try to systematize the selection procedure.

<HEADLINE> Artificial Rain Project to Ease Yellow River Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai Province in northwest China
where the Yellow River originates will carry out a three-year
artificial rain project to help ease water shortage in the
country's second longest river.
</P>
<P>
Starting this year, the province will use planes, rockets and
cannons to induce rain over the upper reaches of the Yellow River
during the six months from April to September. The operation
expects to bring 300 million to 600 million cubic meters of water
to the river.
</P>
<P>
The first act was carried out in mid April and the annual cost
is estimated at some three million yuan (about 375,000 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Running through seven provinces in northwest and north China,
Yellow River is the main water source in the arid northern
areas. The deteriorating ecological environment in the upper
reaches of the river in the past dozen years has reduced the
already scarce rainfall in the region.
</P>
<P>
In longyangxia, the largest hydro-power station in the region,
the water level has fallen to a historical low. The station is
operating with difficulty.
</P>
<P>
Reduced rainfall has also caused flow stoppages in the middle
and lower reaches of the river. Last year alone, the lower reaches
suffered from 222 days of dry-ups. Last year, Qinghai Province
experimented several artificial rainfalls which added 280 million
cubic meters of water to the river.

<HEADLINE> Murder Suspects of Former Rwandan Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan police have arrested two
Rwandans and one Ugandan who are suspected to be involved in
Saturday's murder of exiled former Rwandan interior minister Seth
Sendashonga and his Kenyan driver in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Police, declining to name the arrested, said Wednesday that
one was a son of a former Rwandese immigration chief, who had
masterminded the killing because of a cash swindle with
Sendashonga while the other two were hired hit-men.
</P>
<P>
The mastermind's father and the murdered, both Hutus, had
previously conspired to steal 54 million U.S. Dollars from the
Rwandan government, said Nairobi Provincial Police Officer Njiru
Kyanda.
</P>
<P>
After they stole the money, it is claimed that Sendashonga
arranged for his accomplice to be murdered in Kigali, the Rwandan
capital, before he went into exile in Kenya in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The organizer tells us he had killed the former minister in
revenge for defrauding his late father, a director of
immigration, of the 54 million U.S. Dollars which they had both
looted while in Rwandan government," said Kyanda.
</P>
<P>
The self-confessed ringleader said he was motivated by
personal revenge, not politics, adding that he was happy about
the successful assassin of Sendashonga, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
The police have also recovered a firearm with seven rounds of
ammunition when detaining the suspected, said Kyanda.
</P>
<P>
However, Sendashonga's widow, who works for the U.N.
Environment Program (UNEP) in Nairobi, denied the police claims
Wednesday and accused the Rwandan Patriotic Front government of a
cover-up in the murder.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kigali strongly dismissed having any links with the
killing.
</P>
<P>
Police in Nairobi said Wednesday the investigations into the
murder were still under way and all claims would be thoroughly
investigated and the facts verified.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNEP Executive Director Klaus Topfer urged the
Kenyan government to take action against surging insecurity in
the capital.
</P>
<P>
Sendashonga, until his death, was a leader of the exiled
opposition Resistance Forces for Democracy in Rwanda. He was
gunned down on the spot during a thunderstorm at a busy junction
in Nairobi on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He joined the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF)
before it seized power in 1994, served as interior minister of
Rwanda in July that year and was sacked in 1995. He then went
into exile in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
He was regarded as a moderate Hutu opposed to the 1994
genocide in which more than 500,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus
were killed.
</P>
<P>
He survived a previous murder attempt on the outskirts of
Nairobi in June 1996 in which his nephew was critically wounded.

SHIJIAZHUANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing Astronomical
Observatory (BAO) attached to the Chinese Academy of Sciences has
discovered 26 supernovas in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The International Astronomical Union has confirmed the BAO's
latest discovery of two new stars in March via Internet.
</P>
<P>
The Xinglong Station of BAO first observed a supernova in
April, 1996 with a home-made astronomical telescope and the
International Astronomical Union confirmed the discovery soon.
</P>
<P>
Since then, BAO discovered another 25 supernovas with the
home-made intelligence telescope, the largest in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
The union has named last June "Xinglong" for one of the
supernovas discovered by the BAO's Xinglong Station in recognition
of its contribution to world astronomical research.
</P>
<P>
China's history books recoded eight nova eruptions.
</P>
<P>
Supernova observation is an important project for astrophysics
and is also an important tool in the research of cosmology.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Railways to Retrench Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- About 2,600 employees at the
flagging state-owned Zambia Railways will lose their jobs in a
retrenchment program aimed at saving the company from collapse,
an official from the company has said.
</P>
<P>
The company's Managing Director Rober Crawford Wednesday
confirmed the development as saying that the move is "inevitable"
in the light of the falling freight and passenger services, Times
of Zambia reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment program, which will begin before the end of
this year, will affect about half of its 5,200 employees in both
management and unionized scales.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time for the railway company to retrench its
workforce. A total of 700 people were laid off in 1992 whereas
another 2,000 were fired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The company's management and the union will start negotiating
a retrenchment package immediately, said Crawford. The company
can not maintain a huge workforce when the services are going
down, he added.
</P>
<P>
The freight services has reduced to 1.4 million tons during
the 1997-98 period while five years ago the freight was four
million tons a year.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Small Valley Areas Along Yangtze River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China is making headway in harnessing
small valley areas along the Yangtze River, China's longest, and
some water conservation projects have begun to yield benefits.
</P>
<P>
Pilot projects for comprehensive harnessing were started last
year in 11 small valley areas, involving 7 provinces and
municipalities, according to the Yangtze River Water Resources
Committee under the Ministry of Water Resources.
</P>
<P>
Fengdu County of Sichuan Province, for example, increased
farmers' per-capita farmland to 0.08 hectare and grain output,
672 kilograms, last year, through harnessing the
Duanqiaogou small drainage area.
</P>
<P>
The water and soil conservation area in the Chenshuiwan small
river basin of De'an County, Jiangxi Province, has expanded from
20 ha to more than 33 ha, and the number of fish and pig raising
projects is increasing as a result.
</P>
<P>
By now, 14 provinces and municipalities along the Yangtze River
have opened 33 experimental projects on small valley area
harnessing, and the pilot projects focusing on flood-prevention
are now geared to local development.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Cooperate With New Indonesian Leader: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Australia would continue to work
with Indonesian President Jusuf Habibie' government, Australian
Prime Minister John Howard said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"My government will cooperate fully with Dr. Habibie's
administration as we have in the past cooperated with the former
President Soeharto's administration," Howard told reporters in
Canberra.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very big challenge ahead for Indonesia. It is
important that international economic confidence be built," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Australia wanted further political reform in
Indonesia but it was up to the Indonesian people to decide the
pace of that reform.
</P>
<P>
Howard refused to speculate on whether the government would
offer further aid to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it's appropriate at this stage for me to be
speculating about further initiatives. It's only a couple of weeks
since we announced a 30 million Australian dollar (19 million U.S.
dollar) humanitarian aid package," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government regards Indonesia as the third most
important nation after the United States and Japan to Australia,
and has been helping Indonesia politically and economically in
recent years instead of criticizing its largest neighbor as some
Western nations have done.
</P>
<P>
Also Thursday, Australian opposition leader Kim Beazley called
on the Australian government to take a leading role in the
humanitarian relief effort which would soon be needed in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The likelihood of food shortages was so great that Australia
should start to organize international efforts in the time
remaining before the crisis, the Australian Labor Party leader
said.
</P>
<P>
Beazley made the appeal following the resignation of Indonesian
President Soeharto Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Indonesian Crisis May Affect Asia's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Asian markets may take a breather
from the Indonesian crisis in the days ahead after President
Soeharto resigned Thursday, but the crisis seems far from over and
could affect Asia's recovery process.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, financial markets across the region were
battered by violence on the Jakarta streets and confusion in
Indonesia's corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen fell to 136.4 against the U.S. dollar Tuesday
and Wednesday, the lowest in seven years, while the Indonesia's
rupiah hit the 12,000 level to the greenback after its recent
recovery. Other currencies and stock markets in the region also
tumbled.
</P>
<P>
Although Asian markets could breathe a sigh of relief after
Soeharto's resignation, the calm in the market might be only
temporary as the situation in that country is still very delicate,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the crisis continues to deteriorate, not only
the financial markets but also the whole recovery process in the
region could be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
At present, the immediate effect of the crisis on the Asian
economic recovery is the possible holdback of investment in the
region because prolonged anarchy in Indonesia would scare away
both foreign and domestic investors.
</P>
<P>
At an international investment conference meeting in Geneva
last week, investors were told to avoid troubled Asia, where
economic recovery could be affected by the outbreak of violence in
Indonesia, India's nuclear tests and other problems.
</P>
<P>
It is quite natural that investors will reassess Asia's
recovery prospects if Indonesia continues on its current path,
said Bill Belchere, economist at Merlin Lynch in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
After being hit severely by the 10-month-old financial crisis,
countries such as South Korea, Thailand, Indonesia and the
Philippines are badly in need of foreign funds to speed up their
economic recovery process. The potential withdrawal of funds will
reopen the region's economic wounds.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the potential reduction in foreign investment,
the deterioration of the Indonesian economy would also impede the
economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, whose economy occupies about one fourth of the gross
domestic product of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), has close economic relations with other countries in the
region, especially with Singapore and Malaysia, both ASEAN
members.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, many foreign and domestic investors and
business executives fled Indonesia, shops and factories were
closed in major cities, and the International Monetary Fund and
the Asian Development Bank withheld bailout loans to the nation.
All these factors have pushed the Indonesian economy to the edge
of collapse.
</P>
<P>
As its trade and economic partners, countries in the region
could be hit by Indonesia's economic conditions, economists said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Japanese banks are owed 23 billion U.S.
dollars by private Indonesian borrowers, and the delay of
repayment of the debts by Indonesian companies seems disastrous
for Japan's bad debt-burdened banks.
</P>
<P>
Some economists warned that the unrest in Indonesia could spark
a new wave of panic-selling across the region, thus triggering
renewed turmoil in the region's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the influx of Indonesian refugees to neighboring
countries will also create security and social problems for these
countries and weaken the confidence of investors in Indonesia's
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said that the strife in Indonesia is
Singapore's nightmare come to life.
</P>
<P>
Singapore has long been nervous about an influx of Indonesian
boat people across the Straits of Malacca, which is clearly
worrisome.
</P>
<P>
As the Indonesian crisis seems far from over, economists are
still assessing the implications of the crisis for the Asian
economy. But one thing is certain: the long-term effect of the
crisis on the regional economy will be very profound.

<HEADLINE> Jilin Strengthens Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Jilin province,
one of China's heavy industrial bases, has strengthened
international cooperation in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The province has introduced foreign advanced equipment and
funds conducting monitoring and protection of local environmental
developments.
</P>
<P>
Fu Xing, director of the Jilin Provincial Bureau for
Environmental Protection, said that Jilin has close relations of
cooperation with neighboring countries including the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea(DPRK), the Republic of Korea(ROK),
Japan and Russia in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
According to Fu, the Changbai Mountains in the eastern part of
the province have rich forest and biological resources and feed a
number of rivers including the Tumen River, Songhua River and the
Yalu River.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that Jilin Province and the DPRK signed an agreement to
harness the Tumen River in 1982, according to which the two sides
work to reduce pollutants discharged into the river and will
exchange related information and jointly conduct monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Development Program has conducted research and
evaluation of the water quality of the Tumen River valley, and a
sewage treatment plant has been built in Huichun city, a
state-level development zone, to reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
Japan has also joined in to help harness the Tumen River, which
empties in the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Fu said that Jilin has obtained an investment of 100 million US
dollars from the Japanese side to establish three sewage treatment
plants in the Tumen River valley. The three plants have an annual
handling capacity of 800,000 tons and are expected to help reduce
pollutants by 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two sides have also cooperated in investigating
and monitoring the ecological environment in the Changbai
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
A regular forum on environmental protection has also been held
among the four nations of China, Japan, the ROK and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Practice of Classifying New Bank Loans Introduced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China, the
central bank, has selected the economic power house of Guangdong
province to experiment with classifying new loans in a bid to
improve the management on credit loans.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this month, banks in Guangdong, adjacent to Hong
Kong, has already begun with with the "five grade" classification,
which is said to comply with the international practice. And in
August, the banks nationwide will have to introduce the practice.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, which emphasizes risk management, loans will
be classified into five categories, namely, "the standard, special
mention, substandard, doubtful and loss." This is different from
the previously-used loan classification that was focused on
management according to loan terms.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the central bank, told a bank
meeting held in Guangzhou recently that the new system is designed
to better reflect the risk, real value, and quality of bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Lu Ruihua, Guangdong's provincial governor, said that selecting
his province to experiment with the new system reflects the
support of the central government and the concern of the
province.

<HEADLINE> White House Reiterates Constructive Engagement with China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States government
Wednesday reiterated its adherence to the constructive engagement
policy toward China as the White House is preparing President
Bill Clinton's state visit to China next month.
</P>
<P>
Briefing reporters on the visit, spokesman Michael McCurry
said, "We're going there despite all the differences we have with
the People's Republic to try to work constructively to improve
this relationship, which is so important to billions -- literally
billions -- of people."
</P>
<P>
He rejected calls by some U.S. legislators for Clinton to
eschew a formal welcome normally reserved for heads of state when
he starts his trip on June 25.
</P>
<P>
"To ask that we not be received in a manner in which you would
normally be received at a state visit would do some violence to
the idea that we are trying to work in a cooperative way to
improve this relationship," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be as if someone visiting here said, 'Well, we don't
really want to be greeted on the South Lawn of the White House
even though that's where people are greeted when they arrive for
state visit,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
McCurry also said that the U.S. easing on its export of
satellite technology had no connection with campaign fund-raising
and denied that allowing U.S. companies to launch their satellites
on Chinese rockets damaged U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
He criticized House Speaker Newt Gingrich for planning to set
up a special panel to investigate Sino-U.S. satellite launching
contacts.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday approved four
amendments to the fiscal 1999 Defense Department spending bill
aiming to restrict U.S. export of sensitive satellite and missile
technology to China.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Suharto's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton Wednesday
welcomed Indonesian President Suharto's decision to step down,
calling the move a "peaceful process" that would lead to a
democratic transition for Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome President Suharto's decision, which provides an
opportunity to begin a process leading to a real democratic
transition for Indonesia -- an opportunity for the Indonesian
people to come together and build a stable democracy for the
future," Clinton said in a statement read by a White House
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We urge Indonesia's leaders to move forward promptly with a
peaceful process that enjoys broad public support," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the United States stood ready to support Indonesia
as it moved toward creation of a stable democracy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged
Suharto to perform a "historic act of statesmanship" and open the
way for democracy.
</P>
<P>
Albright's statement, issued about 10 hours before Suharto
decided to resign, was seen here as an appeal ouched in diplomatic
code asking him to step down.
</P>
<P>
"Now he has the opportunity for a historic act of
statesmanship, one that will preserve his legacy as a man who not
only led his country but who provided for his democratic
transition," Albright said in a speech at the U.S. Coast Guard
Academy in New London, Connecticut.

<P>
LHASA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China has launched the second
meterological experiment on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, according
to sources from the Tibet Autonomous Regional Meterological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that on-the-spot experiments are being carried
out from May 10 to August 10, in addition to theoretical
studies. The aim of the experiments is to study the influence of
global climate changes and disastrous climates in China caused by
air flows from the Qinghai-Tibet plateau.
</P>
<P>
Related experiments cover land and high-altitude meterological
monitoring, atmospheric boundary layer, atmospheric ozone and
solar radiation.
</P>
<P>
China launched its first such experiment in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, three other meterological experiments including
experiments on South China Sea monsoon, rainstorms in south China
and analysis of energy and water cycling in the Huaihe River
valley are going on smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The experiments are carried out by scientific and technological
workers from China and a dozen other countries including the
United States, Japan, Australia and the Republic of Korea.

<HEADLINE> China Uses Caissons to Build Oil Platforms in Bohai Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China has started to sink caissons
to build offshore oil platforms at the Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield in the
Bohai Bay, according to Lin Shaodong, president of the China
Offshore Oil Bohai Corporation, as a new way of doing the
construction work.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhou 9-3 Oilfield is in icy waters about 20 km from the city
of Jinzhou in Liaoning Province and has more than 30 million tons
of proven reserves.
</P>
<P>
Lin says that conventional methods of construction would be
very costly and make it difficult to recover the investment. So,
after eight years of studies, Chinese petroleum geologists decided
to use the steel boxes for efficiency and safety.
</P>
<P>
At present, 13.8-m-high containers that are 38 m. in diameter
are in place.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhou Oilfield is designed to have 27 oil wells, 26 water
injecting wells, and one natural gas well, and an annual oil
drilling capacity of one million tons. The oilfield will go into
production in 1999.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu indicated
Wednesday that the scope and timing of Israeli troops' third
redeployment in the West Bank were his primary concern and the
actual sticking point in his recent rounds of negotiations with
U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was no confirmation by the U.S. State
Department or the White House that U.S. President Bill Clinton
would be meeting with his advisers Thursday to decide the
administration's next steps and say who is to blame for the
impasse in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's centrist Third Way Party has said that it would
leave the coalition government if the second redeployment in the
West Bank was not carried out in accordance with the map drawn up
by the party.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. State Department has given Netanyahu an extension
of one week before accepting the U.S. peace plan to pullback from
13 percent of the West Bank in its second redeployment, U.S.
government sources said.
</P>
<P>
They said that if Netanyahu failed to do so, the U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would openly blame Israel
for the impasse in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Say El Nino Due Next Around 2002 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China's National Research Center
for Marine Environmental Forecasts said today that next El Nino
will occur around 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to the center's Dr. Wang Zhanggui, El Nino is related
to sunspot activity, and generally occurs four to five years after
a period of little sunspot activity, which was the case last year,
when there was strong El Nino activity.
</P>
<P>
Song Xuejia, the center's deputy director, says that no other
scientists have made such a "bold prediction" before. They reached
their conclusion after having studied a large amount of materials
on unspots and El Nino for the last 250 years.
</P>
<P>
"No El Nino has occurred in the last 100 years, for which
records are quite complete, in a period when sunspot activity
increases," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Sunspot activity is expected to increase this year and will
reach its apex in 2000, according to the Royal Observatory of
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Sunspot activity will decrease again in 2006 and complete
another cycle. Wang predicts that two to three El Ninos will occur
in the first seven years of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his colleagues found the links between sunspot
activity and El Nino through satellite photos, and say that
sunspot activity can affect ocean temperatures and cloud, which
give rise to El Nino.

<HEADLINE> China, Japan Jointly Launch Research on Sandstorms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and Japanese scientists
have signed an agreement on research of sandstorms in arid and
semi-arid areas and on finding preventive measures.
</P>
<P>
The Environmental Protection Research Institute of northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region and Japan's Shimane
Prefecture Institute of Public Health and Environmental Science
will jointly launch the research in the forming of sandstorms and
their movements.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to spend over 120,000 U.S. dollars to
carry out the four-year research program. So far instruments from
Japan have been installed in Yinchuan, region capital of Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the two countries will also probe into the
relations between the sandstorm and air pollution and provide
scientific evidence for the prevention of sandstorms and
desertification.
</P>
<P>
The sandstorms often haunt arid and semi-arid central Asian
areas. Strong sunshine often causes rapid temperature rises on the
ground surface which lead to sand flow when cold air fronts from
Siberia arrive.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is located in northwest China's arid and semi-arid
area. Four sandstorms hit the region in spring this year and two
of them reached Beijing and Tianjin.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Urged to Open Economy to Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti government has been
urged to to open its economy to foreign investors by removing
bureaucratic hurdles and simplifying investment regulations, the
English-language Kuwait Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by foreign diplomats here, especially
U.S. ambassador James Larocco.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on "Kuwait's economic security in the 21st
century" Wednesday, Larocco expressed the hope that investment in
Kuwait will grow and opportunities for investment will improve in
the days to come.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that new policies need to be evolved to provide
better investment climate to attract investors.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait should aggressively seek foreign investment through
clear guidelines, rules, and incentives that will attract
technology transfer, create employment, and provide managerial and
technical know-how young Kuwaitis are looking for, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced concern about Kuwait's high tax rate on foreign
investors, which has reached a staggering 55 percent on income.
This is the one of the reasons why there is so little foreign
investment in Kuwait, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indian Nuclear Tests Part of Extremist Designs: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The five underground nuclear
tests conducted by India at Pokhran last week is part of the
extremists designs of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
This was stated by former Pakistani diplomat Dr. Maqbool Bhatti
while speaking in a live television program broadcast here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bhatti said that the BJP had been saying for many years that
they would develop nuclear weapons which, as they think, are
essential for emerging as a big power in the region as well as in
the world.
</P>
<P>
"But the way and time adopted by India while conducting these
nuclear tests is a direct threat to the security of Pakistan," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged his nation to unite at this crucial time rather than
feeling disappointed. "We can defend our security and other
interests if our people remain united," he said.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated the government's decision to send high-level
delegations to various countries to brief the outside world about
the situation.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Prices Fall in Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Malawi tobacco auction floors
opened for this season's tobacco sales with lackluster interest
from the buyers and recorded low prices for the growers, Zambia
Daily Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The average price for the tobacco sold so far averaged around
1.2 U.S. Dollars per kilograms, much lower than last year's
average price of 1.5 Dollars per kilograms.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, sales of tobacco in Malawi reached 158.1 million
kilograms, which represented an 11 percent drop in production.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in prices is attributed to the anti-smoking
campaign in the United States which is the major importer of
Malawi tobacco.
</P>
<P>
This has been worsened by the few tobacco buyers at the
auction floors in the country who, at times, collude to offer low
prices.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco exports, which account for about 62 percent of
Malawi's total exports, amounted to 5.5 billion Malawi Kwacha
(367 million Dollars) in 1997, a growth of 20.7 percent over
1996.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that this year's low tobacco prices could
adversely affect Malawi's economic performance which is largely
agriculture driven.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi to Rebouble Efforts Against Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region, which has one tenth of China's population living under the
poverty line, has decided to basically eradicate poverty by the
end of next year.
</P>
<P>
This is a major decision of the regional government
recently. If the goal is realized, Guangxi will fulfill the
poverty relief plan of the central government one year ahead of
schedule.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the central government worked out a plan asking for
efforts to solve the food and clothing problem of the country's 80
million rural population living below the poverty line in seven
years. By this year, Guangxi has eight million people without
enough food and clothing, most of them living in rocky mountain
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to Li Zhaochao, chairman of the regional government,
in the past five years, Guangxi has spent 3.8 billion yuan (457.8
million US dollars) in supporting diversified operations of poor
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Another over 400 million yuan were used for the resettlement of
some 150,000 poor farmers in 22 mountainous counties.
</P>
<P>
Through the efforts, people living under the poverty line were
reduced from eight to 3.66 million in 1997. Of the 49 poor
counties, 33 have been lifted above the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The goal of this year is to help 1.1 million poor people get
rid of poverty, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts are also called for solving drinking water problems in
28 poor counties in the first half of this year, and lay roads to
every village next year.

in Jiangsu Province has put two years into setting up a village
where 233 hectares of wasteland can be used and 6,000 peasants
moved, a project that has got 90 million yuan for ten enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ningxia used over 60 million US dollars worth of
foreign investment, 41.9 percent more than for 1996 and approved
43 foreign-backed projects.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has approved 512 foreign-backed projects, involving 560
million US dollars, in energy, transport and telecommunications,

<HEADLINE> China Records Most Serious Sea Disasters in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- China recorded the most serious sea
disasters last year since the founding of new China in 1949,
sources from the National Bureau of Oceanography said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ye Renmiao, director of the forecasting department of the
bureau, said that last year's windstorms, typhoons, oceanic ice
and abnormal marine phenomena killed over 200 people and caused an
economic loss of over 30 billion yuan (3.5 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that last year, China's coastal areas were hit by
four typhoons, all in August.
</P>
<P>
The typhoon "No. 11" or "Typhoon Winnie", in particular, hit
Shanghai and Tianjin municipalities, and the provinces of
Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei and Liaoning, causing a
record economic loss of over 26 billion yuan (some 3 billion US
dollars), he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Bureau of Oceanography, the "Typhoon
Winnie" destroyed more than 770 kilometers of coastal embankments
and damaged over 1,000 vessels.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that heavy land pollution also polluted the country's
offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
He said, in 1997, red tides hit China's offshore areas eight
times, and a rare red tide of blue green alga hit Xiamen of Fujian
province and Guangrao of Guangdong province last October and
November respectively.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, deterioration of the water quality and abnormal
marine phenomena caused the massive death of scallops off north
China's vast sea waters. The National Bureau of Oceanography asked
coastal provinces and cities to pay close attention to reports on
marine developments and enhance disaster relief efforts, to reduce
loss as far as possible.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Using Foreign Funds for Telecommunications </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, May 21 (Xinhua) -- North China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region has used 72 million US dollars worth of foreign
funds since 1992 to develop its post and telecommunications
sector.
</P>
<P>
A regional post and telecommunications bureau official says
that foreign funds accounted for 30 percent of the region's total
spending on posts and telecommunications for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
They were used for 423,000 program-controlled digital
telephones, 15,000 long-distance phone lines, and 16 microwave
transmission systems.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia also purchased 850 kilometers of optical fiber cables
for 18 cities and counties.
</P>
<P>
New equipment and technology has improved the region's post and
telecommunications industry, like a 66.5-million-U.S.-dollar
government loan from Belgium and Australia for 113,000
program-controlled telephone switching systems in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The official says that, during the 1996-2000 period, Ningxia
will use a 20-million-U.S.-dollar loan from the Japanese
government for 310,000 program-controlled phones and a
telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
There are now 7.3 telephones for every 100 people in Ningxia,
more than the average in China. People in the capital of Yinchuan
can now phone directly to 195 countries and regions around the
world.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, the telephone coverage rate in Ningxia is expected to
be above 10 percent, and in Yinchuan, above 42 percent.

JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
announced here Thursday morning his resignation after holding a
meeting with leadership members of the House of Representative
(DPR).
</P>
<P>
"In line with the article 8 of the 1945 Constitution, and after
deeply considering the opinion of the leaders of the House and
Chairmen of the DPR factions, I hereby decide to resign as the
President of Indonesia starting the moment I make this
announcement on Thursday 21st of May, 1998," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
In line with the 1945 Constitution, Vice President B.J. Habibie
will continue the remaining presidential term of office of
1998-2003, he added.
</P>
<P>
"For the support of the Indonesian people during my time
leading the nation, I express my gratitude and apology for any
mistakes and my shortcomings. May the Indonesia people, with
Pancasila (five principles for national construction) ideology and
the 1945 constitution, remain glorious," he added.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto, 76, who held the presidential post for the past 32
years, also said starting today, the Seventh Development Cabinet
is demissioned.
</P>
<P>
Because the situation does not allow for the presidential
oathtaking before the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), and to
avoid vacuum in the national leadership, "Vice President Habibie
right now will take oath before the Chairman of the Supreme Court
(MA)," Soeharto said.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of Soeharto, B.J. Habibie
immediately read out his oath as the country's third president.
</P>
<P>
"In the name of Allah, I swear, I will fulfill my obligation as
President of the Republic of Indonesia as best I can and as just
as possible, uphold the national constitution and adhere to all
laws and regulations honestly and serve the country and the
nation," said Habibie.
</P>
<P>
The article 8 of Indonesia's 1945 constitution states: "In the
event of the untimely demise or incapacity of the president, or
should he be unable to execute his duties during his term of
office, his office shall be assumed by the Vice President until
the expiry of that term."
</P>
<P>
Soeharto in his speech earlier said that he took the decision
to resign out of his understanding of the people's aspirations for
total reforms and for the sake of national unity.
</P>
<P>
He added that since his suggestion to set up a Reform Committee
did not receive favorable response from the public, so the planned
reshuffle of the Seventh Development Cabinet would no longer be
carried out.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto said that taking into account of the above-mentioned
matters, he decided to resign because it would be very difficult
for him to continue implementing the administration and
development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, following the announcement, Defense and Security
Affairs Minister/Armed Forces Commander (ABRI) General Wiranto
declared the ABRI support to the resignation of Soeharto as well
as the appointment of B.J. Habibie as the new president.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said: "After witnessing the transfer of presidential
post, the Minister of Defense and Security/Commander of the Armed
Forces will announce (the ABRI) political stance and make an
appeal to the whole people of Indonesia."
</P>
<P>
He said Firstly, understanding the development of the situation
and the people's aspirations, ABRI supports and welcomes the
resignation of Soeharto as President, and in line with the
Constitution, "we support Vice President B.J. Habibie as the new
president."
</P>
<P>
Secondly, ABRI, which remains solid and united, hopes and
appeals to the Indonesian people to accept the personal initiative
of President Soeharto, according to the article 8 of the 1945
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, in this case, ABRI will remain to play an active role
in preventing violations and other activities which threatens the
national unity.
</P>
<P>
Fourthly, to uphold national noble values, ABRI will protect
the safety and dignity of former President Soeharto and his
family.
</P>
<P>
Fifthly, ABRI calls on parties to remain calm in order to
prevent any violences and riots, which would eventually harm the
people themselves, he said.

SINGAPORE, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Share prices shot up on the
Singapore market soon after Indonesian President Soeharto
announced his resignation Thursday morning, as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index increased sharply by 34.43 points
to end the morning session at 1308.21 points.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that share prices ended the morning session
higher, buoyed by euphoria following Soeharto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
But they were quick to add that the market eased from its
intra-day highs after learning that Vice President B.J. Habibie
was sworn in as new President of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Habibie's appointment did little to quell concerns over the
introduction of much-needed reforms, they said.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Indonesian Former President Soeharto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
resigned Thursday morning. Following is his profile.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was born in a farmer family in the densely-populated
Central Java on June 8, 1921. His father was a village staff in
charge of water distribution service.
</P>
<P>
He only received formal education at a junior high school, but
later with the military training and education, he won his laurels
and obtained the highest military and civilian positions.
</P>
<P>
Starting as a non-commissioned officer in the Dutch colonial
army and a member of the Indonesian militia during the Japanese
occupation, Soeharto was promoted to the country's military
leadership when he distinguished himself during the fight for
independence in the second half of the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was regimental commander, brigadier general and major
general from 1945 to 1962. From 1970 to 1965, he worked as deputy
chief of army staff and then as chief of army staff between 1965
and 1968.
</P>
<P>
He became acting president in 1967 to replace Indonesia's
founding president Soekarno. Then he became president in 1968. He
has since run unopposed and elected by acclamation for six times.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's People's Consultative Assembly (MPR) in March 1998
elected 76-year-old President Soeharto to his seventh five-year
term of office.

<HEADLINE> Dust Pollution Harms Million Bangkok Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Dust pollution has harmed more than
a million Bangkok residents, resulting in more than 88 billion
baht (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) being spent on their medical
treatment, according to a study of the Pollution Control
Department (PCD).
</P>
<P>
Even though the current level of dust content in Bangkok was 30
percent lower than last year, it was still above the safety
standard, the Nation newspaper Thursday quoted the study as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The study stressed that health problems are usually caused by
small particulate matters with diameter of less than 10 microns
and capable of being inhaled into the lung, and whose average
level is 13 percent higher than the World Health Organization
standard of 0.51 micrograms per cubic meter.
</P>
<P>
The study said the main sources of dust pollution in Bangkok
are dust from the roads and emissions from vehicles and factories.
</P>
<P>
The study was funded by the World Bank, and aimed at seeking
proper measures to draw a master plan for dust pollution
management.
</P>
<P>
Sirithan Pairojboriboon, PCD's director general, was quoted by
the Nation as saying that the study had suggested five measures,
including replacing the two-wheelers with four-wheelers; enforcing
diesel trucks to use benzene or natural gas instead of diesel;
strictly controlling emissions from diesel trucks; cleaning the
roads in the metropolis; and changing the fuel used by power
plants and factories from crude oil to natural gas.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Eyes to Be Regional Food Production Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Food-Processing Industry Club
of the Federation of Thai Industries has set a five-year master
plan aimed at transforming Thailand into a regional food
production center by 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to a report Thursday, the plan launched this year
will require local manufacturers to improve raw material quality,
production technology and marketing to ensure sustainable export
growth with a view to eventually making Thailand a world-class
food production center.
</P>
<P>
Club Chairman Surapon Vongadhanaroj was quoted as saying that
to become a food center, Thailand would have to be able to cope
with competition from world-class manufacturers such as Nestles
and Unilever, which are recognized by consumers the world over for
their marketing, brand names and product quality.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has many advantages attractive to manufacturers, such
as local raw materials, a skilled workforce, experience in the
food industry and export credibility. The problem facing the
manufacturers is how to translate these advantages into increased
productivity.
</P>
<P>
Food exports generated 226.7 billion baht (5.9 billion U.S.
dollars) last year, up 20.2 percent compared with 1996, and
accounting for 12.5 percent of the country's total exports. The
food industry's total registered capital is around 11.93 billion
baht (313 million dollars) with more than 2,500 factories
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Major export products are fishery products, livestock, rice,
vegetables and fruits, and the main markets are Japan, other ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries and the
European Union.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Expected to Rise in Thailand: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment in Thailand topped the
government's estimates early this year and is expected to rise
higher after the middle of the year when new graduates are due to
enter the job market, the Nation newspaper Thursday quoted a
national statistics office survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
To make matter worse, severe drought triggered by the El Nino
weather phenomenon has prevented the agricultural sector from
absorbing the unemployed who have been returning to their rural
homes to work on farms, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Labor Ministry's forecast, the number of
jobless people may reach 2 million by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
But the National Statistics Office discovered that the number
is much higher than the ministry expected.
</P>
<P>
The survey said, at the end of February the unemployment rate
reached 4.7 percent, about 2.8 million, including the 1.3
seasonally unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The rate is higher than the unemployment standard of 3 percent
of population set by the International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry reported earlier that more than 200,000
laid-off workers have returned to their home towns in rural areas
to work on farms. But the survey found that those people are still
jobless because the agricultural sector has been hit hard by
drought.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office also expected the jobless number to
increase with additional entrants of the 500,000 graduated
students in middle of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, the labor ministry refused to accept the number of the
survey, saying the 1.3 million seasonally unemployed was an
exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Permanent Secretary Phan Chantarapan said staff
had been ordered to check the accuracy of the number.
</P>
<P>
He also vowed to stick to the solution to the mass national
unemployment according to the government plan.
</P>
<P>
The government last week allocated an urgent budget of about 9
billion baht (230.8 million U.S. dollars) for job creation through
short-term investment projects by government units as a part of
the social safety net program.

<HEADLINE> Water Supply Crisis in Dhaka Turns Critical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The water shortage situation in the
capital city of Dhaka this summer has turned critical with no
signs of improvement, an English daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Residents in different parts of the city had been asking the
municipal government to take measures to ensure the required
supply of water, The Financial Express said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Dhaka Water and Sewerage Authority can only
meet about 64 percent of the demand for water supply in the city,
supplying around 900 million liters per day against the demand of
more than 1.4 billion liters.
</P>
<P>
People in many areas of the city with a population of more than
9 million have been compelled to go without water for many days.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the water and sewerage authority said the main
reasons for the supply crisis included load-shedding, low voltage
and unplanned growth of the city, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a system loss of around 45 percent had also made the
situation worse, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Dhaka municipal government is expediting the implementation
of some water projects and plans to take effective measures to
reduce system losses to ensure the water supply of the city, they
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has launched more dams and
water projects in a bid to boost agriculture, especially in the
central part where agriculture mainly depends on irrigation water.
</P>
<P>
Official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar Thursday reported
that irrigated areas in the entire country in fiscal 1996-97 made
up of 16.4 percent of the total sown land, up 12.5 percent from
the previous fiscal year, thanks to successful implementation of
86 irrigation projects.
</P>
<P>
Of the 18 million hectares of cultivated land in the country,
only 9 million hectares were planted with various crops annually,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in 1996-97 alone, more than 60,750
hectares of virgin and fallow land were reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar government designated agriculture as the nation's
main economic sector in an endeavor to develop the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-five percent of the country's export earnings are from
the agricultural sector which contributes 36 percent to the
national Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The country's GDP grew by 5.8 percent in 1996-97, during which
agriculture production increased by 3.7 percent. The targeted GDP
growth for 1997-98 is 6.4 percent, with an agricultural growth of
6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector employs 64 percent of the nation's
working force.

SHENYANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Stock of the Jinzhou Port (Group)
Co. Ltd. of China's Liaoning Province is now being traded on the
Shanghai Stock Exchange, as of May 19.
</P>
<P>
China's two stock exchanges, in Shanghai and Shenzhen, trade
two major kinds of stocks, A-shares for domestic investors and
B-shares for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The group company issued 100 million B-shares with a face value
of one yuan, which sold for 0.21 U.S. dollars. The proceeds from the
issue will be used for a bulk cargo berth and expansion of a
goods storage area, a company executive says.
</P>
<P>
The company's B-shares are the only new ones to be added to the
Shanghai exchange this year and are the only B-shares of a port
facility. The Jinzhou Port Group was established on December 30,
1992 and was the first port to issue shares in China.
</P>
<P>
The volume of cargo handled there has been increasing 41
percent annually since 1993. Last year, it handled more than five
million tons of cargo.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Two Van Goghs, One Cezanne Stolen from Rome Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Two masterpieces by Vincent van Gogh
and a third by Paul Cezanne were stolen from Italy's National
Gallery of Modern Art Tuesday night, Italian Culture Minister
Walter Veltroni said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Veltroni said the police hypothesized that the robbery occurred
at 10 p.m. local time when three masked and armed men entered the
museum and walked off with the three masterpieces in their frames.
</P>
<P>
Van Gogh's "The Gardener," which depicts a man in a
broad-brimmed hat, dates back to 1889, while "L'Arlesienne," a
portrait of one of van Gogh's friends, was painted one year
later. This portrait was among the master's favorites.
</P>
<P>
Cezanne's unfinished landscape "Le Cabanon de Jourdan", was
painted in 1906, the year of his death.
</P>
<P>
Some Italian art experts estimated the total worth of the
paintings at about 30 million U.S. dollars, but others insisted
the works, especially for historical value, could not carry a
price-tag.
</P>
<P>
Robbery of art works has become more and more frequent in Italy
in recent years. Although the Italian government spent some 570
million dollars per year on security against art theft, a total of
2,653 such cases were registered in 1994-97.

<HEADLINE> hke - World Bank President Urges Russia to Reassure Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank president Wednesday
urged the Russian government to take a series of emergency
measures to reassure panicked investors.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Moscow international relations institute, James
Wolfensohn said Russia was too dependent on short-term bonds,
making the current economy very vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said it is impossible to solve the development issue
by way of foreign loans. He urged the country to cut its budget
deficit and increase its public revenue.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Interfax news agency, the president
said Russia had made some improvement in terms of using World Bank
social development loans.
</P>
<P>
However, Russia was able to do much better and the government
needed to further cooperate with the World Bank, Wolfensohn added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Wolfensohn met with Russian Deputy Prime
Ministers Viktor Khristenko and Oleg Sysuyev and discussed health
and education projects. He also talked with Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov.
</P>
<P>
The Russian economy edged up 0.4 percent last year after
shrinking every previous year in the 1990s. The government has
forecast 2 percent growth this year, but recent problems have
reduced those prospects.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn, who arrived on Tuesday evening, is due to meet with
President Boris Yeltsin and Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko.
</P>
<P>
Russia has received some 10 billion U.S. dollars from the World
Bank. A further three billion dollars has been promised for this
year.

DHAKA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people were killed and
more than 100 injured in a cyclone that hit Bangladesh's coastal
districts of Cox's Bazar and Chittagong Wednesday, sources of the
government's Central Relief Control Room said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Besides, about 100 fishermen were missing in the cyclone with a
maximum wind speed of 150 kilometers an hour, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Some 10,000 houses were razed, a lot of trees and electric
poles uprooted, and crops on 10,000 acres of land inundated
following the cyclone. Tidal surges caused by the cyclone also
washed away 50,000 tons of salt, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Authorities concerned declared Wednesday Chittagong
International Airport unfit for operation for 24 hours because of
the silt brought by the tidal surge arising from the cyclone.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone-hit people had been evacuated to different shelters,
and members of the armed forces and the local administration had
distributed dry food to them, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Red Crescent Society had taken measures to ascertain
the losses caused by the cyclone, and instructed its volunteers in
the coastal districts to play an effective role in rescue
operations in the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
Preparation beforehand had helped reduce the damage of the
cyclone, according to State Minister for Manpower M. A. Mannan who
visited the affected areas Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Central Bank Slashes Banks' Reserve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
has agreed to slash banks' reserve requirement on deposits to help
bring down interest rates, the Philippine newspaper Malaya
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Monetary Board, the highest decision-making body of the
central bank, agreed Tuesday to cut banks' statutory reserve
requirement from 10 to 8 percent, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
But banks' liquidity reserves, which should be used to buy
government equities, were retained at 7 percent, and thus, the
total reserve requirement will be 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a sweetener for banks, the board also increased from 25
percent to 40 percent the proportion of statutory reserves the
central bank will pay interest in.
</P>
<P>
The new reserve requirements will be in place by May 29.
</P>
<P>
The central bank expects banks to pass on to their clients the
cheaper cost of funds by keeping lending spreads from 1.5 percent
to 6 percent over the benchmark Treasury Bill rate.
</P>
<P>
This means that if the Treasury Bill rate is 14 percent, the
highest rate banks can charge clients is 20 percent.

NANNING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region will spend 170 billion yuan during the 1998-2000
period on 220 key infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
A government official says that, since 1992, Guangxi's economy
has had an average annual GDP growth of 16.2 percent. To keep this
up, Guangxi will increase spending on infrastructure like water
control, transportation, and hydro-electric power stations.
</P>
<P>
About a billion yuan will be spent this year on 30 medium-sized
and large reservoirs and the first phase of a shelter-belt project
along the Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi will also spend 6.75 billion yuan on highway, waterway
and railway construction, berths at Fangcheng port, and
expansion of the Beihai Airport.
</P>
<P>
The region will also invest 7.1 billion yuan in hydro-electric
power and thermal-power stations, 3.9 billion yuan on posts and
telecommunications, and 8 billion yuan on technology improvements.

BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shanghai municipality
plans to privatize all of its state small commercial firms within
three years, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Commerce Commission
indicated that 179 such businesses in the municipality have
already been privatized, paving the way for across-the-board
privatization of small firms.
</P>
<P>
The commission categorizes small enterprises as those with net
assets below 10 million yuan (1.2 million US dollars). The
majority are losing money or barely making a profit.
</P>
<P>
The commission convened a meeting recently to showcase several
enterprises in Huangpu, Luwan and Hongkou districts that have
successfully changed from State to private ownership.
</P>
<P>
With regard to large- and medium-sized enterprises, the
commission plans to restructure large and medium-sized enterprises
to turn them into shareholding companies in which the State owns
the controlling stakes. This will allow the company managers to be
freed from government administration so that they will be more
responsive to the market.
</P>
<P>
Other provinces and regions in China are also adopting similar
measures to sell their small State-owned enterprises.

SAN JOSE, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Miguel Angel
Rodriguez on Wednesday expressed his support for a joint
anti-drugs patrol with the United States in the waters of the
Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez made the statement when meeting the U.S. Ambassador
to Costa Rica, Thomas Dodd. The United States is pressuring
Caribbean and Central American countries to accept the presence of
navy cruisers in their waters so as to stop drug trafficking in
the region.
</P>
<P>
However, not everyone among Costa Rica's leadership is willing
to accept the joint patrol proposal. The attorney general has
warned the proposal violates the Costa Rican constitution.
</P>
<P>
"We have to defend ourselves from drugs and maintain our
sovereignty. We must find a balance," Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
"I share in this idea of patrolling our seas adequately and at
the least possible cost," the president said, adding that the
proposal could also improve the relations with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The relationship was strained when Washington dispatched a
minor official to head a U.S. delegation for the inauguration of
Costa Rica's new president on May 8.

rate of 150 percent in recent years, making the sector a pillar of
the country's telecommunication industry.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that most of the cellular phone subscribers
registered this year are GSM digital phone users, bringing the
number of such users to 10.18 million by April. GSM phone was
introduced to China in the latter part of 1995, linking it with 27
other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
At present, China's mobile phone telecommunication network
covers 31 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The authorities expect that the goal set to have 20 million
mobile phone subscribers by the year 2000 will be realized ahead

</P>
<P>
He said that local E-business services are "convenient and

Last week, he visited an on-line CD shop sponsored by the
Beijing-based Guoxin Technology Company on internet. He placed an

In early April, the National Commodity Trading Center put into
operation a nationwide E-business network that can be accessed
through Internet. So far, millions of yuan worth of contract have
been signed and payment made through the on-line system.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that Chinese people have come to realize the
advantages of E-business. He said that people have yet to break
the traditional forms of trading and do business via Internet.
</P>
<P>
In mid-April, China's first on-line stock brokerage system went
into operation in Shanghai, enabling investors elsewhere to deal
in via Internet stocks on the country's two stock exchanges in

<HEADLINE> Multilateral Trading Hailed at WTO Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) agree that the multilateral trading system has
played a significant role in reducing tariffs, promoting world
trade and lifting living standards since the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (GATT) went into force 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The WTO director-general, Renato Ruggiero, made the remarks at
a press conference here Wednesday at the end of the organization's
three-day ministerial conference, the second since it replaced the
GATT in 1996.
</P>
<P>
WTO statistics show global merchandise exports grew by 6.8
percent per year on an annual average from 1948 to 1997, and
output by 3.8 percent. In 1997, global trade totalled 6.5 trillion
U.S. dollars, 14 times more than that of 1950.
</P>
<P>
At the closing session, WTO members unanimously approved a
proposal by the United States to hold the third ministerial
conference in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The exact date and the venue are yet to be decided by the WTO
General Council.
</P>
<P>
Also by consensus, the organization adopted another
U.S. proposal on global electronic commerce. It suggested that no
customs duties be imposed on electronic transmissions.
</P>
<P>
The proposal calls for a comprehensive work program to be drawn
up at the next special session of the general council to examine
all trade-related issues on global electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
It especially urges the council to "take into account the
economic, financial, and development needs of the developing
countries" in the work program.
</P>
<P>
"Globalization is a reality," Ruggiero said. Different members
had different ways to manage it.
</P>
<P>
He noted with delight that these proposals were adopted by
consensus despite differences between the members.
</P>
<P>
The WTO director general reaffirmed his support for China's
entry into the WTO. He called on the two sides in the negotiations
to make joint efforts for an early conclusion.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Chinese delegation to the conference, Long Yongtu,
said that as the multilateral trading system turned 50, the WTO
must face two realities -- the political reality that more than
100 members out of a total of 132 were from the developing world,
and the economic reality that world trade was more and more
integrated.
</P>
<P>
This, he said, constituted a big challenge to the WTO as to how
to ensure that all its members, big or small, rich or poor, shared
the benefits of economic globalization on a justified basis in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
China hoped that by participating in the multilateral trading
system, it would be able to work with the WTO and make its own
contributions to the establishment of a fair and reasonable world
economic order in the new century, said Long.

<HEADLINE> Facts and figures About Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Following are facts and figures
about Indonesia:
</P>
<P>
Geography -- Indonesia, the largest archipelago nation in the
world, consists of a group of about 17,500 islands, lying between
the mainland of Southeast Asia and Australia. The islands stretch
from the Malay peninsula to New Guinea. It has an area of 1.9
million sq. kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Population -- With a population of 202 million by the end of
December 1997, Indonesia is the fourth most populous nation in the
world after China, India, and the United States. It is home to
more than 300 ethnic groups and scores of languages and dialects.
The country includes an urban middle class and tribes barely out
of the stone age.
</P>
<P>
Official language -- Bahasa Indonesia, based on the Malay
language indigenous to the region, is the unifying language among
more than 200 distinct regional languages.
</P>
<P>
Capital -- Jakarta with a population of more than nine million.
</P>
<P>
Religion -- About 88 percent of the 202 million inhabitants say
they are followers of the Sunni branch of Islam, making it the
world's largest Muslim country. Roughly 10 percent are Christians
and approximately two percent Hindu and Buddhists.
</P>
<P>
Economy -- Sustained economic growth pushed per capita gross
domestic product from 60 U.S. dollars in the late 1960s to 1,089
U.S. dollars in 1997. The economy boomed in the 1970s with oil and
natural gas exports and diversified in the 1980s to create a
wide-ranging manufacturing base. However, the country's economy
has been hit badly since July last year by the financial crisis
with the rupiah's value having dropped by about 80 percent and
many economic activities being scaled down.
</P>
<P>
Armed Forces -- 500,000 including the police forces.
</P>
<P>
Government -- Indonesia declared independence from the
Netherlands and Japan on August 17, 1945. The government is
structured as a unitary republic; the 1945 constitution vests the
highest authority in the People's Consultative Assembly.

CHANGSHA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Hunan Province, an
underdeveloped area, had 65.6 percent growth in its information
technology industry in 1997, with an output value of 3.4 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hunan is second only to Guangdong, the country's most
successful province in growth in that industry, according to the
Provincial Electronics Industry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Bureau officials attribute the industry's phenomenal growth to
efforts to create bigger companies in the past two years. The
Hunan Electronics Information Industry Group, which was founded in
1996, for example, had an output value of 1.74 billion yuan in
1997, accounting for 51 percent of the provincial total.
</P>

The company also has a 20.5 percent stake in the Hunan Computer
Joint Stock Co., Ltd., which was set up in July of last year and

<HEADLINE> Profile: Habibie, Indonesia's New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jakarta, May 21 (Xinhua) -- B.J. Habibie became Indonesian new
president Thursday morning. Following is a profile of the new
president.
</P>
<P>
Born in the remote village of Nepo, Parepare, South Sulawesi,
on June 25, 1936, Habibie was brought up in a strictly religious
Muslim family.
</P>
<P>
He, the third of four children in his family, began reading
newspapers when he was a child. His lifelong religious devotion
continued in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
His father, Alwi Abdul Jalil Habibie, from the South Sulawesi
town of Gorontalo, died when Habibie was 13 years old. Then his
Javanese mother brought her children to Bandung, West Java.
</P>
<P>
After attending the Bandung Institute of Technology for about a
year in 1954, Habibie won a scholarship from the Ministry of
Education and Culture to study aircraft construction engineering
in Aachen, Germany, a course he completed in 1960.
</P>
<P>
As a research assistant at Aachen's Technische Hocheschule
(1960-65), Habibie created a design of a deep sea submarine and a
high pressured and temperature room for Julich Atomic Center.
</P>
<P>
With the Hamburger Flugzeugbau (HF) aircraft industry, he
designed the world's first aircraft with one consolidated wing,
which remains the only aircraft in the world capable of vertical
landing and takeoff.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, President Soeharto summoned Habibie home and made him
his technological consultant. Habibie has been state minister of
research and technology since 1978.
</P>
<P>
His close ties with out-going president Soeharto began when he
was a teenager.
</P>
<P>
Habibie's strengths, according to political observer Riswandha,
include his popularity among the majority Muslim community, the
esteem he holds among youth and his long service as Soeharto's
minister.

SHIJIAZHUANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Wheat output of Hebei, a
leading wheat producer in north China, is to renew the historical
record this year if no adversities occur in the upcoming two weeks.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Female Journalists Embracing Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Women journalists in China view
computers as a way to raise their work efficiency and sharpen
their competitive edge -- much more than their male counterparts,
said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
However, male journalists are more interested in computers and
the Internet than female journalists, although there is no gender
difference in the frequency of computer use.
</P>
<P>
These are some of the findings of a survey conducted by the
Research Institute of Journalism under the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,100 journalists with the Xinhua News Agency, People's
Daily and China Daily were polled. Of them, 91.5 percent said
computers were available to them at work, but only 27 percent used
them every day, mainly for writing articles and searching for
information.
</P>
<P>
Those polled show little interest in using the Internet, with
only four percent browsing on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, the Internet cannot change the
principle that journalists must judge the value of news, but it
could serve as a tool for obtaining information.
</P>
<P>
Female and male journalists start on an equal footing in using
computers and the Internet. But they are constrained by factors
such as technical problems and lack of training, money and time.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 21 (Xinhua) -- Liaoning Province, a heavy
industrial center in northeast China, has built three state-level
and three provincial-level new and high-tech development zones,
which played a big role in promoting local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the provincial government approved the establishment
of 110 foreign-funded firms and construction of 17 projects with
each involving an investment of 20 million U.S. dollars in these
development zones, which cover a total area of 71.8 sq. km., said
Yang Derun, deputy head of the Provincial Science Commission.
</P>
<P>
These zones generated a combined business income of 57.77
billion yuan (6.97 billion US dollars) from industry and commerce
last year. Over 60 percent of the receipts came from the new and
high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
State-listed development zones in the cities of Shenyang and
Dalian have forged ties with science parks in other countries.
</P>
<P>
This year, these development zones should give priority to
development of name-brand products, build more high-tech
enterprise groups and integrate industry more closely with
commerce, Yang said.

MANILA, May 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items

</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer:

<HEADLINE> Real Madrid Takes Record Seventh Champions Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMSTERDAM, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A 66th-minute goal by Yugoslav
international Mijatovic lifted Real Madrid to another record, its
seventh win of the UEFA Chmapions Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish club ended Juventus' winning streak that started
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Both sides played neatly with tight defense for most of the
match and Real Madrid did not find its scoring chance until its
Brazilian defender Roberto Carlos volleyed for a shot from within
the area.
</P>
<P>
Unguarded Mijatovic collected the loose rebounder from
Juventus goalkeeper Peruzzi and dribbled past the keeper to lob
the ball into the far corner of the goal for the winner.
</P>
<P>
Striker Filippo Inzaghi missed a couple of scoring chances for
the Italian side when his volleying shots went either slightly
over the crossbar or just on the wrong side of the post.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's triumph was indeed a sweet one for the Spanish
club that waited for a hiatus of 17 years to enter their first
final. It last lost the final 1-0 to Liverpool in 1981 and it
last won the cup in 1966.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid, however, already held a record by winning the
Champions Cup the most times, in 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960 and
1966.
</P>
<P>
This was the eighth encounter between Real Madrid and
Juventus. The Spanish club now holds a win-lose record of 5-3.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid downed Germany's Borussia Dortmund 2-0 on
aggregate to reach the Amsterdam final while Juventus defeated
French club Monaco 6-4 on aggregate for the final berth.

<HEADLINE> UK to Take Action against Football Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- British Home Secretary Jack Straw
took measures Wednesday to prevent his country's football fans
from stirring up trouble in France during next month's World Cup,
media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Straw asked parliament to give British courts the right to
prosecute any football fans convicted of violence in France and
prevent them from travelling to other soccer matches abroad.
</P>
<P>
He told parliament that "we have been able to reach a
bilateral agreement with the French authorities in advance of the
World Cup".
</P>
<P>
"This will allow us to take action in our courts in addition
to prosecution and conviction in France," he said.
</P>
<P>
Straw added that while French magistrates will be available at
each of the World Cup venues to deal swiftly with any violence,
Britain, in turn, will ask its courts to issue a restriction
order when those hooligans return to the UK. This will prevent
their attendance at future matches abroad.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Exports Down in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 20 (Xinhua) -- After climbing 3.3 percent in
February, Canada's total exports fell 2.1 percent in March,
Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Energy and agricultural products were among the biggest export
losers in March, bringing down Canada's total exports to 25.9
billion Canadian dollars (17.9 billion u.s. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Exports of energy products dropped 18.9 percent in March,
mainly because of the lower natural gas prices. Crude oil prices
also dropped owing to a mild February in the United States.
</P>
<P>
After rising sharply in the previous month, exports of
agricultural and fishing products tumbled 8.3 percent in March.
Lower exports of wheat to Asia and of malt and canola to South
America and Mexico are partly to blame, the statistics agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Canada's exports of forestry products edged down 2.6 percent in
the month. Lower newsprint exports were the main contributor to
the decline.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the slowdown in imports carried over into
March, chiefly because of continuing lower imports of machinery
and equipment and energy products.
</P>
<P>
In March, Canada's total imports were 24.3 billion dollars,
which was 1.2 percent down from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The country's trade balance was 1.6 billion dollars in March,
down 300 million dollars from February, the agency added.

<HEADLINE> Tutu Awarded Cape Town's City Honor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Truth and Reconciliation
Commission (TRC) Chairman Desmond Tutu on Wednesday received the
Freedom of Cape Town award, the city's highest honor, for his
contribution to South Africa's anti-apartheid movement.
</P>
<P>
The honor was bestowed on Tutu at a special meeting of the
Cape Town municipality in the civic center by Mayor Theresa
Solomon.
</P>
<P>
"We are gathered here to pay tribute to a man who has been at
the center of the struggle," Solomon was quoted by South African
Press Association as saying at the function, which was attended
by senior national, provincial and municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
She said that Tutu, as TRC chairman, also played a positive
role in the statutory body charged with finding out truth about
the past and recommending compensation for apartheid victims.
</P>
<P>
"Your legacy will live for generations," Solomon said, noting
that Cape Town was proud to bestow its highest honor on him.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was preceded by a peace march across the city in
remembrance of the historic march to parliament in 1989 led by
Tutu.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 people took part in the march to protest against
the apartheid election at that time, which triggered nationwide
protests and brought down the apartheid rule.
</P>
<P>
Tutu was the seventh "freeman" in the city since the honor was
first granted in 1858. South African President Nelson Mandela was
awarded the honor0in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Blair Makes Last Push for Yes Vote in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on
Wednesday visited Belfast again for a last-ditch efforts to secure
a yes vote in the referendum on the Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Joined by Conservative leader William Hague, Blair said he had
spent more time working on the Northern Ireland issue than any
other in his first year as prime minister and made an impassioned
plea to wavering Protestant voters to endorse the historic peace
deal in Friday's referendum.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this agreement, fashioned as it has been on secure
principle, offers the best chance for people here...for peace and
hope and stability in the future," he told an audience of
academics at the University of Ulster in the northwestern town of
Coleraine.
</P>
<P>
The peace deal, reached on April 10 by the province's political
parties, preserves Northern Ireland's links with Britain but
builds closer ties with mainly Roman Catholic Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"This is the chance for Northern Ireland to gain a better
future. I don't know whether that chance will come again this
generation if we turn our back on it now," he was quoted by
Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that on Friday people, whatever their doubts...have
courage to vote for the future and for the prosperity and
stability we can bring."
</P>
<P>
During his trip to Belfast, his third visit this month, Blair
promised that anyone who used violence will be excluded from a
role in government and that prisoners will be kept in jail until
violence is given up for good.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that Northern Ireland might wait a long time
before it gets a better opportunity to resolve its troubled
history of political strife.
</P>
<P>
With the 40 per cent Catholic Irish nationalist minority firmly
behind the pact, polls forecast an overall cross-community
majority for the deal in Friday's referendum.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll on Wednesday showed that majorities of voters
in both the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland intend to back the
peace plan in the referendum.

NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip stocks on Wall Street
surged back toward record levels today, but the broad market were
less active in an uncertain direction of interest rates and
company profits.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 116.83 to 9,171.48,
about 40 points from last Wednesday's record of 9,211.84, despite
a brief dip into negative territory during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Broad-market indicators were mixed. The technology-heavy Nasdaq
composite index suffered the heaviest damage after Dell Computer
reported a healthy quarterly profit that failed to meet Wall
Street's more enthusiastic forecasts.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 8.25 to 1,117.77, about 13
points from the record of 1,130.54, set nearly a month ago on
April 23. The Nasdaq composite fell 14.11 to 1,831.76.
</P>
<P>
Advancers barely outnumbered decliners on the New York Stock
Exchange. However, in Nasdaq trading, decliners outnumbered
advancers by a 4-to-3 margin.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 586.33 million shares as against Tuesday's
lower-than-average tally of 565.37 million.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index rose 4.71 to 578.63, about 7 points

<HEADLINE> Former Junta Members Back to Apologize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- Several members of Sierra Leone's
ousted military junta Wednesday apologized to the people of the
country for what the junta has done and is doing.
</P>
<P>
According to a British Broadcasting Corporation report
monitored here, these junta members include the former
secretary-general, mayor of the capital Freetown and transport
secretary, as well as two civilians.
</P>
<P>
They came back last week from neighboring Guinea where they
fled over the fall of the junta in mid-February and are now being
held in the custody of the west African peacekeeping force
ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The former secretary-general of the dislodged junta said they
wanted and needed to come and to see how they can help stop the
evil of the junta remnants against the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
Under the intensified mopping up exercise launched by ECOMOG
and allies, the remnants of the junta forces and allied rebels
are reportedly perpetrating atrocities in the east and north of
the country, killing and maiming by chopping off people's hands
and legs.
</P>
<P>
The former junta secretary-general condemned the mutilation of
the people and called on the fleeing junta forces to lay down
their guns and surrender.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma to stop
what is happening or give instructions to stop what is happening.
</P>
<P>
But none of them said they were in contact with any junta
members and asked for a press conference to convey their message.
</P>
<P>
Despite their apologies, Sierra Leoneans are still
unforgiving, particularly when everyday people come from villages
across the east and north with amputated hands and legs.
</P>
<P>
The people of the country will not change their mind at the
apologies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Like most of their former colleagues, according to the report,
these former junta members are going to be tried. The former
militiamen will go to the court martial with the two civilians to
the civil court.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean government has earlier tried two groups of
more than 30 former junta members and collaborators with the
charge of treason.

<HEADLINE> S. African Navy Facing Collapse for Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- South African navy and the
military medical services might both be heading for total
collapse as the cash-strapped defense ministry can not afford to
buy new equipment, the ministry warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The army was also unable to perform its primary duty of
protecting the country's borders, the ministry said in its
1998/99 budget document presented to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
As growing personnel costs are squeezing out funds for
operating costs and new equipment, readiness and service levels
would reach an "unprecedented low", South African Press
Association quoted the ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the navy, the shortage of cash for spares meant ships and
submarines were being cannibalized and would have to be phased
out sooner than planned.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that by 2002 the navy would no longer be able
to run any submarines, and its surface ships would cease to
operate by 2005.
</P>
<P>
"There is a distinct probability that the navy will enter a
period of irreversible decline until it...collapses," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it said although the budget for the defense force's
medical services was being raised by 16.2 percent, this would be
affected by the 21 percent medical inflation rate and growing
demand on medical services.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the services would no longer be able to fulfill its
mandate of providing "operationally essential" medical services
to South African National Defense Force members and their
dependants.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said personnel are insufficiently trained for
their duties, productivity and morale are declining, and
urgently-needed people with the right qualifications are leaving.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African Defense
Ministry is planning to borrow money from private arms
manufacturers to meet its arms renewal demand, the ministry told
parliament Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is because this year's budget allocation to the fund used
by the National Defense Force to buy and maintain major weaponry
falls far short of meeting contracts the defense force has
already signed, the ministry was quoted by South African Press
Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
The current budget earmarked 688 million Rand (136 million
U.S. Dollars) for the weaponry fund, which is down 38.1 percent
in real terms on the 1997/98 budget and could only cover half of
the contract commitments, ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
This amount is just enough to buy a third of a tank regiment,
or 13 tanks, 1.3 advanced fighter aircraft or two-thirds of a
corvette, a defense force weapon acquisition official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry had asked state expenditure to approve
bridging finance of 771 million Rand (152 million U.S. Dollars)
from the armaments industry. The fund would be repaid from the
defense budget over four years.
</P>
<P>
The financing is expected to be organized by Armscor, the
state arms procurement agency, from the industry locally or
overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry proposes that manufacturers simply grant the
ministry credit for the material they delivered, and the eventual
repayment would include interest charges.
</P>
<P>
The request is being considered by Finance Minister Trevor
Manuel, the report said.

NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell to profit
taking Wednesday as turmoil in Indonesia continued and the U.S.
record trade deficit.

since the government started tracking merchandise and services
trade on a monthly basis in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Outage Disrupts Pagers Across U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 20 (Xinhua) -- A vital communications satellite
lost track of Earth Tuesday night, disrupting services to nearly
all of the millions of pagers used nationwide in the United States
and blacking out some television and radio stations' programs.
</P>
<P>
Official of the Galaxy 4 satellite, PanAmSat, said they
expected the satellite to remain inoperable at least through
Wednesday and they started transferring services to other
satellites Wednesday and decided to move another satellite into
position in orbit.
</P>
<P>
The satellite stopped relaying pager messages and media feeds
at about 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday when its onboard control system and a
backup switch failed and the satellite rotated out of position.
</P>
<P>
As of mid-day Wednesday, technicians had been unable to restore
Galaxy 4's attitude control systems and restore its orientation
toward Earth.
</P>
<P>
Some paging service was switched to other PanAmSat satellites.
There was no indication when all paging and media feeds would be
restored.
</P>
<P>
PageNet estimated that 80 percent to 90 percent of the 40
million to 45 million U.S. pager users lost service. It said it
would take about a day for the company to finish switching service
for most of its 10.5 million customers.
</P>
<P>
The only customers not affected were those whose connections
are through ground-based radio transmitters.
</P>
<P>
The pager problem has also brought problems to hospitals,
police and gas stations. Some police stations said the paging
system for officers in the major crimes unit was down, and gas
stations had problems with pay-at-the-pump machines that were not
accepting credit cards.

<HEADLINE> Annan Reports on Identification Process in Western Sahara </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 20 (Xinhua) -- While the pace of
identification in Western Sahara was slow during the month of
April, 1998, the parties concerned had demonstrated their
willingness to cooperate and to increase the pace substantially,
U.N. secretary-General Kofi Annan said in his latest report on
Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
In the report, Annan said the process of identification in
Western Sahara could be completed at the latest by the end of
August 1998, provided the POLISARIO Front and Morocco cooperate
fully.
</P>
<P>
However, Annan said, no consensus solution on ways of dealing
with the 65,000 applicants from the contested tribes has been
found as yet.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said his Special Representative will continue to
discuss with the Government of Morocco and the POLISARIO Front
practical and concrete ways of resolving this problem by the end
of June 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General urged the parties to cooperate with his
Special Representative in the search for appropriate solutions,
with a view to enabling the successful and timely completion of
the identification process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unveils New 20 Dollar Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. monetary authorities
today unveiled the redesigned 20 dollar note, which includes new
and modified security features to deter counterfeiting of U.S.
currency.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Federal Reserve banks and the Secret Service
introduced the money in Washington, New York, San Francisco, Los
Angeles and Huston to the press, hoping to spread the public
education of the new features of the U.S. currency quickly.
</P>
<P>
"Counterfeit money making has been at a surprisingly low level
since the U.S. government introduced the redesigned series
starting from 1996," said Joseph Botta, vice president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
He noted that about a total of 230 million U.S. dollars worth
of counterfeit dollars were discovered last year, and only 14
million dollars worth were in new 100 and 50 dollars. Most of the
fake money were found before they entered the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Series 1996 20-dollar note will be introduced in the fall
of 1998. The new 50-dollar note was introduced in October 1997,
and the 100-dollar note was issued in March 1996. Lower
denominations will follow.
</P>
<P>
There will be no recall or devaluation of U.S. currency already
in circulation.
</P>
<P>
"We are most gratified with the successful introduction of the
new notes," said the Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. To
date, about two thirds of all 100-dollar bills and about a third
of all 50-dollar bills are the new series 1996 notes, he said.
</P>
<P>
About 88 billion U.S. dollar worth of 20-dollar notes is
currently in circulation, 80 percent of those are in the U.S. More
than 450 billion worth of U.S. currency circulates around the
globe, according to Fed statistics.
</P>
<P>
The 20-dollar notes will be in bigger circulation, because they
are supplied by most of the ATM machines across the country.
</P>
<P>
The overall architecture of the 20-dollar note has carried more
new and modified security features. Microprinting and security
threads, which first appeared in the 1991 series currency,
continue to prove effective deterrents and appear in the new note
series. For example, the security thread is in green and on the
left side of the Fed seal.
