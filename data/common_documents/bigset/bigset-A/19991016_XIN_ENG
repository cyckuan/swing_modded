<HEADLINE> Russia, Germany Discuss Chechnya, International Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov and his visiting German counterpart Joschka Fischer
discussed Chechnya and international security issues in St.
Petersburg Friday, Russian media reported.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian leadership is ready for a dialogue with all
Chechen forces open to a search for political solutions to the
Chechen crisis," Ivanov told a joint news conference after his
meeting with Fischer.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops have launched an offensive against
Islamic rebels in the breakaway republic following armed Chechen
separatist incursions into the neighboring Daghestan republic and
bomb blasts in four apartment buildings that killed 300 people in
Moscow and two other cities.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe Chechen terrorists were behind the
explosions. Fisher said Chechen terrorists would be arrested if
they entered German territory.
</P>
<P>
"The German government abides by international obligations and
will act if the terrorists, wanted by Interpol on suspicion of
committing crimes, are in the country's territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Chechnya issue, the two ministers also discussed a
number of international issues, such as the situation in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov expressed Moscow's concern over "the emerging trend
towards severing Kosovo from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"That should be prevented, otherwise it would endanger the
process of political settlement in Kosovo and in the Balkans as a
whole," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement released at the end of their meeting, the
two ministers stressed that the main responsibility for preventing
and settling conflicts and keeping peace and international
security rests on the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"There is no alternative in the world to the U.N. as a unique
and universal organization," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the "strengthening of the nonproliferation
of weapons of mass destruction," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed serious concern over the U.S. Senate's
refusal to ratify the treaty of a comprehensive ban on nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed bilateral and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two rounds of closed-door talks were held in what Fischer
described as "a serious and constructive atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
The two sides decided to hold active political consultations in
the future to promote Russian-German relations, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who arrived in St. Petersburg Thursday, left for the
Finnish city of Tampere Friday.

<HEADLINE> French Communists Against Merger of Aerospace Group With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF)
said it is against the merger between the French aerospace and
defense group Aerospatiale-Matra and Germany's DASA.
</P>
<P>
A PCF leader said in a communique Friday that the PCF wants the
government to "freeze" the merging process.
</P>
<P>
"It is regrettable that the Prime Minister (Lionel Jospin)
chose a solution which accentuates the domination of the
aeronautic and space industry of France and Europe by financial
investors," said Michel Duffour, a member of the leading national
bureau of PCF.
</P>
<P>
The group that intends to merge, EADS, will put 40 percent of
its shares in the stock markets of Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam,
while the French government will maintain 15 percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 45 percent of the shares will be held by DASA, a
private group owned by Daimler Chrysler, the French Lagardere
group which owns Matra, and unidentified French holders.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the government freeze the process of merger and
engage in a debate linking entrepreneurs and financial investors,
elected deputies and employees, in order to move toward a new type
of European cooperation," said the PCF.
</P>
<P>
The party also said that French aerospace and defense
enterprises are undersold in the deal, because they are superior
to their German counterparts in terms of industry, technology and
research.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Protests UNMIK's Decision on Foreign Air Flight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Friday
entered a protest against a decision by the U.N. Mission in the
Serbian province of Kosovo to grant foreign air companies to fly
commercial flights to Pristina, the provincial capital, saying
that the move runs counter to the relevant U.N. resolution and
hoping such a decision be revoked.
</P>
<P>
The protest was contained in a letter to the president of the
Security Council from Vladislav Jovanovic, charge d'affaires of
the Yugoslav Mission to the United Nations. The letter is being
distributed here today.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo
(UNMIK) has decided to contract air companies Tyrolen (Austria),
Adria Airlines (Slovenia) and ADA (Albania) to fly commercial
flights to Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The decision, "taken without the prior consent of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia," is "contrary to Security Council
Resolution 1244 (1999) and violates the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO) membership rights of the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia," Jovanvic said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution, adopted on June 10, demands all countries
to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Balkan
country.
</P>
<P>
"All the more so as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia has no
bilateral air traffic agreements with the Republic of Albania and
the Republic of Slovenia," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
In his October 1 letter to the president of the Security
Council, Jovanovic has expressed his great concern at what he said
"unilateral and arbitrary decision" by the UNMIK.
</P>
<P>
Therefor, "The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia reiterates its
expectation that the decision of UNMIK to open Pristina Airport
and to grant permission to foreign air companies to fly commercial
flights to Pristina will be revoked and the all relevant issues
will be resolved in cooperation with the competent Federal
authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," Jovanovic
said.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up his two-day visit to Kosovo, U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said in Pristina Thursday that the United Nations was
not preparing the Serbian province for independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Annan made it clear that the United Nations was bound
by the terms of the Security Council resolution that authorizes
its work in Kosovo and declares respect for the territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"We are not here to prepare the people for independence. We
have to live within the mandate which we have been given. And I
hope this is understood by all," Annan said at a news conference
in Pristina.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Eradication Day to Be Marked Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The world's goal of
halving poverty by the year 2015 is receding fast and inequality
within and between countries is increasing, a U.N. official warned
Friday.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) Administrator Mark
Malloch Brown made the remarks in his message on the occasion of
the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty which falls
on October 17.
</P>
<P>
UNDP is organizing activities in over 70 countries to mark the
Day. The activities include televized debates, launch of national
studies on poverty and sports and musical events to promote
awareness about poverty issues.
</P>
<P>
UNDP figures show that one fifth of the world's population are
in extreme poverty, living on little more than one U.S. dollar per
day.
</P>
<P>
According to UNDP, since its so-called NetAid program to use
the Internet for poverty eradication campaign was launched on
September 8, millions of hits and hundreds of non-governmental
organizations have registered and linked to the site.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the project is to help the developing world know
more about poverty and development through information technology.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Canada Reserves 23 billion Canadian Dollars for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada is
stockpiling 23 billion Canadian dollars (about 15.5 billion U.S.
dollars) in case of a Y2K induced run on cash at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
The Globe and Mail reported Friday that the country's central
bank is also setting up a special command post to make sure
communications run smoothly with the chartered banks.
</P>
<P>
Though the bank holds the view that business will be normal at
the year's end, it anticipates that people may take out extra cash
because of unexpected Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
Some people are still worried that computers could read 2000 as
00 and interpret it as 1900, causing some chaos in the financial
system.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the reserves will be held by the Bank of Canada in
Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
As January 1, 2000, falls on Saturday in Canada, central bank
staff say they will be on duty to ensure normal business
operations, instead of having their first millennium "long weekend,
" which begins from Saturday till Monday, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien declared 99 percent
readiness in early September in the federal services for the year
of 2000, saying his country has gained a leading position in
tackling the Y2K problem in the world.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Send 7,000 Peace-keepers to Congo: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has indicated
that it would send at least 7,000 troops to monitor the
implementation of the cease- fire agreement in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven
Mahachi said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi called on the U.N. to speed up the deployment of troops
to the DRC which had been lobbying the U.N., together with several
southern African leaders, to send troops immediately.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was one of the countries which had indicated that
it would contribute troops to the peacekeeping force in the DRC,
the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Withdrawal of troops could only start after the deployment of
U.N. peace- keepers. Initially, the Zimbabwean government had
announced that the withdrawal was likely to start either in
December this year or January next year.
</P>
<P>
"I can not say when the withdrawal is likely to start," Mahachi
said.
</P>
<P>
"According to the cease-fire agreement, we will only work out a
 withdrawal program when the United Nations peace-keepers are on
the ground," Mahachi added.
</P>
<P>
On the violation of the peace accord which was signed in
Zambian capital Lusaka in July, Mahachi said that such violations
were being reported to the Joint Military Commission, noting that
the last attack by the rebels was on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola deployed troops to the DRC in
August last year when the Congolese rebels backed by Uganda and
Rwanda launched an attack to topple DRC President Laurent Kabila.

<P>
TAMPERE, Finland, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
summit here could be judged a success if it manages to convey a
four-fold message to EU constituencies, European Commission
President Romano Prodi told leaders from the 15 EU member states
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said clear messages have to be conveyed to EU citizens,
administrations, the criminal world, and the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the message to EU citizens is clear: to
maintain and enrich their freedom by ensuring that it can be
enjoyed in conditions of security and justice.
</P>
<P>
The message to EU administrations is a cooperative venture
between the Union's institutions and its member states, Prodi said,
adding that, "The time for institutional and competence quarrels
is well and truly over.
</P>
<P>
"Criminal activity and organized crimes in particular can be
added to the list of our main post Cold War enemies," Prodi told
the EU leaders when addressing, "A message to the criminal world."
</P>
<P>
To the outside world, Prodi said, "Our justified concern for
the security and well-being of our own citizens will not be
pursued at the expense of Europe's long-standing tradition of
openness beyond our borders."

<HEADLINE> Nepal Launches Agro-Processing Program for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Intermediate Technology
Development Group (ITDG) Nepal has launched a four-year program
to help rural people develop effective techniques and skills for
small-scale agro-processing activities.
</P>
<P>
Under the program funded by the British Department for
International Development and the European Commission, ITDG will
carry out activities related to developing agro-processing
industries in Nepal, such as technology development, skill
development training, workshops and seminars, marketing support,
exchange of visits and tours.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the program is to help rural people improve their
livelihood through developing small-scale food processing
industries.
</P>
<P>
There are great potentialities in agro-processing in Nepal due
to growing demand for processed products, increased chances for
agro-product export, rapid urbanization, changing lifestyle and
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As Nepal is an agrarian country with 80 percent of the
population living on agriculture and with agriculture, forestry
and fishing accounting for over 40 percent of its GNP,
agro-processing is an important sector of income and a major
source of employment for tens of thousands of people.

TAMPERE, Finland, October 15 (Xinhua) -- European Commission

so-called "Millennium Round" talks, in particular the investment
and competition, and have not agree a common position among
themselves.
</P>

EU sources said a French demand for a strong commitment to
protect national culture from an invasion of American television
and films and a German call for a working group to examine trade
and labor issues aroused early this week as obstacles for a single
tone of the 15 EU members on transatlantic trade.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Criticizes West's False </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday accused some developed countries of being hypocrites
by preaching about democracy and transparency.
</P>
<P>
In his eulogy at the burial of Sikwili Khohli Moyo, who was
member of the Central Committee of the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union- Patriotic Front, in Harare here, Mugabe warned
Zimbabweans not to be misled by those who pretended to be
champions of democracy when they were the worst violators of human
rights during the colonial era.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Moyo, who was also a non-constituent member of
Parliament, sacrificed his life for the country's liberation.
</P>
<P>
The president deplored that some Zimbabweans chose to listen to
some developed countries, whose aim was to cause disunity in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"They pretend to be the champions of democracy when yesterday
they were the oppressors and we had to fight to teach them that we
wanted the right to vote -- our democratic right... We now have
to teach our people because the inclination now is to listen to
the developed countries," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"Colonization came from the West and at that time they did not
talk about democracy and transparency... The talking started when
Africa was decolonized and when it was talking about self rule,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The president called for unity, saying that Zimbabweans should
uphold Moyo's identity.
</P>
<P>
"There is need for us to be united so that we can fight against
poverty, hunger and disease and more so politically," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
"We should continue to make unity for a common cause. Today
there are those that want to destroy us and we have to fend off
the intruders who were our colonial masters," he added.

NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks plunged at
the open Friday, hit by rising U.S. wholesale inflation and a
warning from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 175.08 and the technology

The latest U.S. Producer Price Index, the main indicator of

That is the focus of concern to investors who fear that rising
inflation could bring higher interest rates to result in a severe
market correction.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The private investment in
Ethiopia is showing an upswing since the new privatization policy
came into effect for two years, according to the Ethiopian

<P>
LUANDA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Criminal Chamber of the
Angolan Supreme Court has issued an order for the release of four
UNITA deputies of the National Assembly (parliament) from prison,
an official source said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Neto de Miranda, a counsellor judge of the Supreme Court, said
that the criminal chamber made the decision because the process of
the case is still waiting for "better proof".
</P>
<P>
But de Miranda also said that the Public Prosecutor could, in
five days, interpose its recourse in a plenary session of the
Supreme Court on the decision of the criminal court.
</P>
<P>
Five deputies of the National Union for Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) were arrested by the Angolan police in early
January, 1999, which triggered strong accusation by the Portuguese
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that these deputies of the National
Assembly had been detained because they would not cut off ties
with their leader Jonas Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Candanda, Vicente Vihemba, Manuel Saviemba, Daniel Jose
Domingos and Carlos Alberto were later accused of being
accomplices of the armed rebellion led by Savimbi in the central
area against the state security.
</P>
<P>
Later, Manuel Saviemba was released and returned to his office
in the National Assembly for the police did not find enough
evidence in proof of his guilt.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fightings between the government troops and the rebels
are still under way near the cities of Kuito, Huambo and Malanje

<HEADLINE> Lebanese President Reiterates Establishment of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 15 (Xinhua) -- On the occasion of his first
election anniversary, Lebanese President Emile Lahoud Friday
reiterated the establishment of a state of law as spelled in his
swearing-in speech.
</P>
<P>
"We are well aware that the state of law has not existed in
Lebanon since independence in 1943. We have lived through many
years of lawlessness," he said in an interview with the state-run
TV channel Tele Liban.
</P>
<P>
He said he will redouble his efforts to complete the creation
of such a state.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud, a former army commander, was elected president for a
six-year term on October 15 last year. He was sworn in November 24.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud admitted that Lebanese politicians, especially those who
will be affected in the drive, were against the state of the law.
</P>
<P>
His opponents, notably the previous regime of Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri and his ally Walid Jumblat, whose Progressive
Socialist Party fielded the mightiest Muslim militia in the
1975-1990 civil war, have accused him of militarizing the regime
to establish a reign of terror.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said critics had doubted his ability to create a
national army when he took over the military command in 1989, but
he had turned the ravaged sectarian units into a cohesive fighting
machine, despite the monumental civil war legacy.
</P>
<P>
"Remember and mark my words, I am going to carry out my goal of
instituting the state of law," the president added.

UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Friday unanimously endorsed a set of sanctions
on Afganistan's Taliban Islamic movement, pressing it to stop
supporting international terrorists.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution drafted by Canada, the Netherlands, Russia,
Slovenia, Britain and the United States, the 15 council members
demanded that the Taliban turn over Saudi exile Usama bin Laden
without further delay to a country where he has been indicted.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said council members noted the indictment of bin
Laden by the U.S. for the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania. The blasts on August 7 killed over 220 people,
including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
The council decided that all states should not provide air
traffic facilities to the Taliban and should freeze funds and
other financial resources owned or controlled by the Taliban. It
will set up a committee to deal with the matter.
</P>
<P>
The council urged Taliban to cease the provision of sanctuary
and training for international terrorists and to ensure that the
territory under its control will not be used for terrorist
installations.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban movement, claiming to have controlled 90 percent of
Afganistan's land, has said it wants proof of bin Laden's
involvement in international terrorism before turning him over.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday unanimously adopted a resolution to set up the
United Nations Office in Angola (UNOA) in a bid to effectively
assist the Angolan people in capacity-building, humanitarian
assistance and the promotion of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Office, to be established for an initial period of six
months until April 15, 2000, will be staffed with the personnel
necessary to liaise with the political, military, police and other
civilian authorities, with a view to "exploring effective measures
for restoring peace, assisting the Angolan people in the area of
capacity-building, humanitarian assistance, the promotion of human
rights, and coordinating other activities," the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The resolution means one more effort by the United Nations to
restore peace in the southwest African country after it closed
down decade-long peacekeeping operations in Angola in February
this year.
</P>
<P>
"A continued presence of the United Nations in Angola can
contribute greatly to the promotion of peace, national
reconciliation, human rights and regional security," the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided, pending further consultations
between the United Nations and the Government of Angola, UNOA will
consist of up to 30 substantive professional staff, as well as the
necessary administrative and other support personnel, the
resolution said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution blamed the rebel National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas Savimbi for
causing the conflict in the country, saying that "the primary
cause of the present situation in Angola" is UNITA's "failure to
comply with its obligations under the Peace Accord, the Lusaka
Protocol and relevant Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"The lasting peace and national reconciliation can only be
achieved through peaceful means," the resolution said, voicing its
concern at the humanitarian effects of the present situation on
the civilian people in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The resolution said that the U.N. Humanitarian Assistance
Coordination Unit (UCAH) will continue to operate and to be funded
in its present configuration.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called upon the Angolan Government and
UNITA in particular to ensure the safety, security and freedom of
movement of the United Nations and associated personnel and to
respect fully their status, the resolution said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member Security Council also called on the Angolan
Government and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to "conclude as
soon as possible a Status of Mission Agreement," said the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
Angola descended back into civil war in December last year
after the unraveling of a shaky four-year peace deal between the
Angolan Government and UNITA, which funds its war efforts through
illegal sales of diamonds, worth millions of U.S. dollars
annually, in areas under its control.

<HEADLINE> Quarter of Botswanan Adults HIV Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- More than 25 percent of
the botswanan adults are HIV positive, according to information
from the Botswana's AIDS/STD (sexually-transmitted diseases) unit
Friday.
</P>
<P>
For those in the sexually active 15-49 age group, 29 percent
are infected, said Christine Stegling, assistant health officer in
the government's AIDS/STD unit.
</P>
<P>
For the general population of all ages, the figure is 17
percent, Stegling said.
</P>
<P>
"By June last year, we estimated that 260,000 had been
infected. For the year 2000 we are predicting that 332,000 will
be infected," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the beds in each of the country's two
biggest hospitals -- Gaborone's Princess Marina and Francistown's
Nyangabwe hospitals -- are occupied by AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan government has reportedly provided 30 million
pula (around six million U.S. dollars) for a community network to
provide home-based care for AIDS patients and ease the pressure on
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that the long-term effects will be harrowing
for Botswana's 1.5 million people, despite the wealth created by
the country's diamond industry, which produced a third of all the
diamonds mined in the world last year.
</P>
<P>
According to them, AIDS will reduce economic growth by an
average 1.0 percent a year and will have a similar effect on
population growth, which is currently over 2.0 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
A study of the Health Ministry forecasts that the number of
AIDS orphans under the age of 15 would reach 65,000 by next year.

<HEADLINE> Tribunal Decides on Lesotho Election Model </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's election
arbitration tribunal Friday decided on the allocation of
parliament seats in next year' s general election, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal proposed a mixed electoral model with 80
constituency-based and 50 proportional representation seats in
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal, led by a South African judge, Jules Browde,
consisted of two other arbitrators, both senior lecturers in law
and political science at the National University of Lesotho.
</P>
<P>
Browde said the tribunal was of the unanimous view that the
constituency- based "first past the post" model applied in Lesotho
in the past, had been a source of "great dissatisfaction and a
major cause of unrest after elections."
</P>
<P>
He said the tribunal was therefore unanimously of the view that
Lesotho needed to embrace the proportional representation model as
soon as possible and needed to move in that direction immediately.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal decided that for the year 2000 election only, the
mixed ratio of constituency seats to proportional representation
should be 80/50.
</P>
<P>
Thereafter the mix ratio should be on the basis that the first
past the post and proportional representation would constitute 50
percent each of the 130 seats in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal was called to arbitrate after the Independent
Political Authority, established to determine Lesotho's future
political system, failed to reach agreement on the allocation.
</P>
<P>
In the May 1998 elections the ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy won 79 of the 80 seats which were up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Basotho National Party did not accept the
results amid claims of irregularities. The ensuing political
crisis resulted in Lesotho' s Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili
calling on the military intervention of Southern African
Development Community.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Fight against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's ruling Frelimo
Party general secretary Manuel Tome unveiled here Friday the new
program for the government which gives priority to the fighting of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
Tome said the policies to improve living conditions and to
eradicate absolute poverty were also top on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The program promises that Frelimo will introduce
anti-corruption legislation, and will ensure that anti-bribery
clauses are inserted into contracts, notably procurement
contracts, and those concerning privatization and the development
of natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The Frelimo government will facilitate the involvement of
civil society in anti-corruption reform program, the document
says.
</P>
<P>
Tome said the corrupt practices were caused by habitual
dishonest behaviours of certain companies, the lack of "a strong,
speedy and more efficient justice system", the "fragility of state
institutions" and "the vulnerability of workers in the state
apparatus".
</P>
<P>
This susceptibility of state employees, notably teachers, to
corruption is clearly linked, not only to their poor wages, but to
late payment of wages.
</P>
<P>
Tome reiterated Frelimo's commitment to removing unnecessary
red tape.
</P>
<P>
The programme says that reform will continue to reduce the tax
burden, and tax collection system will be modernized "so as to
offer the taxpayer an efficient service that is simple to use".
</P>
<P>
Tome said that the main goal would be "to broaden the tax
base".
</P>
<P>
"This is a program that is not very specific about the
mechanisms for achieving its goals," he admitted. "Those
mechanisms will be in the operational programs to be approved by
parliament."

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Pushes for Kosovar Turks' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel Friday urged Kosovar Albanian officials not to
discriminate against the 60,000-strong Kosovar Turkish community,
the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the appeal in a speech in the Turk-populated
village Mamusha in Pristina, the capital of the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo, on his one-day visit in the province.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish community in Kosovo has a bitter relationship with
the ethnic Albanian majority in the region, who have been seeking
to establish an Albanian-dominated independent state, said the
agency.
</P>
<P>
Demirel said "we have told the world that the Turkish community
should participate in Kosovo's administration."
</P>
<P>
"As the Turkish community of Kosovo, you have the right of
equal rights and equal representation in Kosovo's new political
order. We will continue to be the defenders of your rights,"
Demirel told the Kosovar Turks.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated between the Turks and the Albanians in
Kosovo since the beginning of the Albanian insurgence against
Belgrade's rule in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Although Turkey participated in the air campaign against
Yugoslavia by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and sheltered
thousands of Kosovar refugees, the Kosovar Albanians have accused
the local Turks of siding with the Serbs, whom the Albanians are
now trying to oust from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish president promised to continue to raise the
sensitivities and expectations of the Turks in Kosovo both in
the international arena and to the ethnic Albanian officials.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Turks to stay united and establish friendly
relations with the other ethnic communities in Kosovo and in
particular the majority Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the
population of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"You are a constant bridge of friendship between Turkey and
the Balkans... You've lived in these lands for centuries and you
will continue to do so," he added.
</P>
<P>
Demirel returned to Ankara Friday night.

<HEADLINE> British Government Won't Act on Pinochet Until </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The British government will not
take action in the case of Chile's former leader Augusto Pinochet
until court proceedings against him are over, officials said on
Friday after Chile sent a formal request for his release.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw could not take any action at all
until the judicial proceedings were finished, a Reuters report
quoted a spokeswoman for Straw as saying.
</P>
<P>
"His role won't come into play until those appeals are over,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made after Chile's foreign minister, Juan
Gabriel Valdes, said in Chile on Thursday that a petition seeking
the return of Pinochet had been presented to Britain's Foreign
Office, to be passed on to the Home Office headed by Jack Straw.
</P>
<P>
Straw has the last saying on Pinochet's fate. Under British
law, extradition must be approved by both the courts and the home
secretary. The law allows Straw to block an extradition on
humanitarian grounds such as ill health, and this is what
Pinochet's backers hope he will do.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital a year ago at the
request of a Spanish judge, who wants to try him on torture
charges from the latter part of his 1973-1990 rule.
</P>
<P>
A British magistrate ruled out last week that Pinochet could be
extradited. But Pinochet's lawyers have until October 23 to lodge
an appeal in London's High Court.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, is said to suffer from a number of health
problems and a doctor has testified that he suffered two apparent
strokes last month.
</P>
<P>
The Home Office confirmed on Thursday that Chilean President
Eduardo Frei had sent a confidential letter to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair last week. It is expected that the letter is
asking British government to release Pinochet on humanitarian
reasons.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany to Talk on Merger of Electronic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- France and Germany will soon
begin talks on merging the electronic defense industries of the
two countries, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted a source at the French Defense Ministry as saying
that the French electronic defense group Thomson CSF will engage
in talks on merger with the German DASA, which has already agreed
to merge its aerospace part with France's Aerospatiale-Matra.
</P>
<P>
The merger agreement signed on Thursday between
Aerospatiale-Matra and DASA to create the world's third largest
aerospace group has raised the need to set up an alliance between
the electronic defense industries of the two countries, said the
source.
</P>
<P>
The Daimler Chrysler group of Germany, which owns DASA, and the
Lagardere group which is a major shareholder of
Aerospatiale-Matra, will engage in talks seeking the possibility
of allying DASA with Thomson CSF, it said.
</P>
<P>
The French government, which has proposed the construction of a
double-pillar European aerospace and electronic defense industry,
has already agreed to a merger between the electronic defense
industries of the two countries, according to the same source.
Together with the French telecommunications group Alcatel, the
French government remains a major shareholder of Thomson CSF.

<HEADLINE> UN Official Calls for Greater Efforts to Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
United Nations said here Friday that the coming International Day
for the Eradication of Poverty is an opportunity to remind the
world of the scourge of poverty and to increase support for
anti-poverty activities.
</P>
<P>
U.N. resident coordinator Samuel Nyambi told a press briefing
that the U. N. General Assembly-sponsored poverty eradication day,
which falls on October 17, is to galvanize support both at
national and international level for the eradication of poverty.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the fact that significant gains have been made
in economic growth and living standards over the past three
decades, the reality facing many people is still a miserable one.
</P>
<P>
According to Nyambi, who is also resident representative of the
United Nations Development Program, almost one third of the
world's population are facing poverty -- living on less than one
U.S. dollar a day.
</P>
<P>
Noting 80 countries experience lower per capita income today
than they did a decade ago, Nyambi said income poverty is
particularly pervasive in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Some 220 million African people, accounting for 42 percent of
the population in the continent, are living on less than one U.S.
dollar a day - - a figure that will rise to nearly 300 million by
the year 2000 if the current trend is not halted, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyambi said to eradicate poverty simply by raising the general
level of income is not sufficient.
</P>
<P>
Effort to tackle poverty must take account of a complex set of
inter- related deprivations in the economic, social, and political
arenas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official stressed that greater efforts have to be made
to create effective alliances of national actors to fight poverty
in a co- ordinated manner.
</P>
<P>
"Policy makers need to ensure that the poverty dimensions of
their actions have been carefully evaluated; public expenditure
must be focused towards the poor - expanding their capabilities,
opportunities, and life choices," he said.

OTTAWA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new cars in Canada were
up for the third straight month in August, with an increase of 1.8
percent over the previous month to hit 67,847 units, Statistics
Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Truck sales slipped 0.9 percent to 63,705 for the same month,
compared with July.
</P>
<P>
The overall sales of new cars and trucks, however, have been
rising since last fall, jumping by 15.6 percent between October
1998 and August this year, according to the official agency.
</P>
<P>
The rise was based on price hikes of new vehicles, which cost
an average of 27,701 Canadian dollars (about 18,709 U.S. dollars)
each in August, up 5 percent compared with the same period of last
year.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Leader Insists on Four-Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktas said on Friday that the Cyprus problem is an issue among
Turkey, Greece, Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Denktas made the remarks upon his arrival in Istanbul, the
largest city of Turkey, for a private visit. He said a resolution
on the Cyprus issue should be reached by these four parties.
</P>
<P>
However, Denktas warned that foreign interference into the
Cyprus issue could render resolution of the problem more difficult.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriots have repeatedly insisted on a two-way talks
only between the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
Denktas added that the Greek Cypriot "unilateral application
on behalf of the entire island" for accession to the European
Union (EU) has devastated the intercommunal talks and necessitated
a new approach.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Cypriot-dominated Republic of Cyprus which controls
the southern two-thirds of the island is recognized by the
international community as the only legitimate regime of the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
Denktas said if the Greek Cypriots are to "drop their claim of
being the government of the entire island, abandon policies of
enmity and end the embargo on Turkish Cypriots," a path will be
opened for a resolution of Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been trying for decades to
reunite the island through a bizonal, bi-communal federation
formula, but no tangible progress has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the two sides have been stalled since 1997
after Denktas demanded international recognition of his breakaway
republic in the north, now backed only by Ankara, and that they
talk with the Greek Cypriots on a state-to-state basis.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Post A Sharp Rise in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. prices at the wholesale
level jumped 1.1 percent in September, the largest increase in
nine years, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The big advance in the Producer Price Index, which measures
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, followed a 0.5
percent gain in August. It marked the biggest gain since September
1990, when wholesale prices rose 1.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the
so-called core rate of inflation at the wholesale level rose a
strong 0.8 percent in September, the largest increase since
December 1998, when the core rate rose 1 percent. In August, the
core rate fell 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the unexpected advance in wholesale prices,
if matched at the consumer level, could stoke concerns at the
Federal Reserve about a potential breakout of inflation.
</P>
<P>
Last week the central bank decided not to raise interest rates
for a third time this year, but held open the door to higher rates
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Financial markets have been on edge, worried about the
prospects for another interest rate increase when Fed
policy-makers meet next on Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 3.5 percent, compared with no change for all of
1998. The pickup in this year's wholesale prices is coming from
big increases in energy costs, which had been declining for much
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In September, energy costs rose 2.2 percent, reflecting higher
gasoline, heating oil and natural gas prices, and followed a 3.7
percent gain in August. A 5.5 percent spike in energy prices in
April put the Fed on inflation alert, and on June 30 the central
bank raised interest rates for the first time in two years.
</P>
<P>
A 2.2 percent rise in gasoline prices last month contributed to
the advance in overall energy costs.
</P>
<P>
Food prices posted a 1 percent increase, the biggest gain since
January, when food costs rose 1.5 percent. The rise in food prices
comes as the East Coast and other parts of the country suffered
bad weather last month. In August, food prices rose 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
In another report today, the Commerce Department said that the
level of inventories held by businesses on shelves and backlots
rose 0.3 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
There were other price gains that contributed to the overall
spike in wholesale prices in September.
</P>
<P>
Passenger car prices rose 2 percent, the biggest since a 3
percent rise in September 1990; tobacco product prices rose 8.4
percent, the largest increase since a 26.1 gain in December 1998
and cigarette prices rose 9.5 percent, the biggest gain since a
30.7 percent increase in December 1998.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps Mozambique Restructure Rail, Port Systems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced
Friday that it has approved a credit of 100 million U.S. dollars
to help the government of Mozambique improve the efficiency of the
three major port-rail systems.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique has three important transport corridors each
consisting of integrated railways and port facilities and serving
primarily regional transit traffic. The Maputo, Beira and Nacala
Corridor systems are distinct geographical segments with no
physical linkages between them.
</P>
<P>
The project will support the Mozambican government's objectives
of transforming the railways and ports into modern, competitive
efficient, market-driven and financially viable systems.
</P>
<P>
Within four years of the project's commencement, the traffic on
the three port-railway systems could increase to at least 7 and 10
million tons respectively by 2002, up from 4.1 million tons for
railways and 7.6 million tons for ports in 1998. This will
translate into an increase in gross revenues from the current
level of 80 million dollars to about 150 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank also said that the project will not only benefit
Mozambique but also the region more broadly. Neighboring countries
like Zimbabwe, Malawi, Swaziland, South Africa, Zambia and the
Democratic Republic of Congo will benefit from reduced costs in
overseas exports and imports, resulting from reduced distances for
surface transport.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), the World Bank's lending arm for the poorest
countries, and on standard IDA terms of 40 years maturity,
including 10 years grace. The government of Mozambique will fund
the project with an additional 20 million dollars.

Meteorological service spokesperson said that the weather
disturbance caused rains in the Pinar del Rio, Matanzas, Havana,

Winds of hurricane strength toppled hundreds of trees in Havana
and thousands of people left their homes and were taken to safer
sites. The hurricane also threatened to damage Cuba's sugar cane
fields, due to start harvesting in early december. Coffee, tobacco
and banana plantation were also under threat.

<P>
BAGHDAD, October 15 (Xinhua) -- A visiting UNICEF official on
Friday called on the world community to stop the "wheel of deaths"
in Iraq, referring to the death of hundreds of Iraqi children
every day due to U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bellamy, United Nations Children's Fund executive
director of North Africa and Middle East Bureau, told reporters
that UNICEF dedicates itself to work for lessening the sufferings
of Iraqi children and improving their situation.
</P>
<P>
She said that under the difficult circumstances of the
sanctions, Iraqi children have been subjected to malnutrition and
other health, environment and education problems, and that the
assistance provided by UNICEF is very limited.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said UNICEF hopes to be able to offer more assistance
to Iraqi children, whom she said have become "victims of the
cruelest tragedy in modern history."
</P>
<P>
She called for speedy delivery of contracted medicine and
medical appliances under the U.N. oil-for-food program to Iraq and
voiced willingness to provide help in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export limited
amount of oil in every six months to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies for its 24 million people.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the United States and British
representatives at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the
endorsement of its contracts with foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy arrived here on Tuesday for a one-week visit to review
the effect of the nine-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraqi children.
She has visited some schools and hospitals and met with some Iraqi
officials.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF said in its latest report that the mortality rate
among Iraqi children have more than doubled since the imposition
of the U.N. sanctions on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said Friday that the award of 1999 Nobel Peace Prize to
Doctors Without Borders is a victory for the right of very victim
to receive life-saving aid as quickly and efficiently as possible.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the group of doctors as a valued partner of the U.N.
humanitarian community.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Friday issued
a statement seeing the award as a strong endorsement of the need
to protect civilians and provide immediate relief in natural
disaster and on all sides of armed conflict.
</P>
<P>
The award is a recognition of the vital role of humanitarian
workers whose safety is coming under increasing threat, said UNICEF
Executive Director Carol Bellamy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Falls in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve said
Friday that U.S. industrial production at the nation's factories,
utilities and mines dropped an unexpected 0.3 percent in September,
the first decline since a 0.2 percent down in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Fed attributed the decline to Hurricane Floyd, which raked
the East Coast in September. It said the storm held down production of
electricity, motor vehicles and some other goods.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the storm's effects, industrial product would have
posted a small increase, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, U.S. industry operated at 80.3 percent of capacity,
down from 80.7 percent the month before.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan: U.S. Economy May Be Hit by Y2K Related Reactions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The threats of massive
computer failures from the Year 2000 date change have been
eliminated but the U.S. economy could still be buffeted if
businesses and consumers alter their spending patterns because of
unwarranted fears, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks to the National Italian American Foundation,
Greenspan said that massive amounts of preparation in getting
computers ready for the date change have left him confident that
when January 1, 2000 rolls around, American businesses will be
ready.
</P>
<P>
"The probability of a cascading of computer failures in mission
critical systems is now negligible," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
But he said that he is still concerned about potential economic
impacts if businesses and consumers alter their buying patterns in
significant ways.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, Greenspan said it is important for authorities
to get out the most up-to-date reliable information so that
business and consumers can make their economic judgments based on
facts and not rumors.
</P>
<P>
In that way, businesses will be able to base their decisions on
inventory stockpiling on accurate information and not overstock
out of unfounded fears.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan in previous speeches had voiced concerns about
production bottlenecks leading to inflation pressures if a large
number of businesses feel the need to have sizable inventories on
hand at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said that consumer reactions will also be critical to
determining whether the computer change will have a major impact
on economic activity.
</P>
<P>
So far, only a "small number of households, driven by fear of
the unknown, tell pollsters that they are planning to build large
stockpiles of food, water, fuel and cash as the millennium
approaches," Greenspan said. But he expressed concern about a
rising level of consumer worries as the news media focuses more
attention on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Further Fight Corruption to Win IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Finance Minister Chris
Okemo said Friday the government would make further efforts to
combat corruption in order to consolidate the trust he built with
International Monetary Fund (IMF) officials earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The IMF board is expected to discuss whether to resume loan
talks with Kenya in November and Okemo said earlier this week he
was confident the board would agree.
</P>
<P>
"To strengthen the likelihood of a favorable consideration, the
 government will continue with the implementation of the planned
measures in the area of governance and of its prudent
macroeconomic policies,'' Okemo told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
He said key work included strengthening the Kenya
Anti-Corruption Authority, the Kenya Revenue Authority, the
Comptroller and Auditor General' s office and the government's
internal accounting and auditing systems.
</P>
<P>
Budget planning and implementation will also be improved as
well as public expenditure management, he said.
</P>
<P>
IMF suspended the 205 million U.S. dollars loan in July 1997
in protest at corruption and poor governance in Kenya. The halt
severely damaged investor confidence and led to a dramatic sharp
economic downturn.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Calls For Clear Message to EU Constituencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPERE, Finland, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The summit of European
Union (EU) being held here can be judged to have been a success if
it manages to convey a four-fold message to EU constituencies,
European Commission President Romano Prodi told leaders from the
15 EU member states Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said clear messages have to be conveyed to EU citizens,
administrations, the criminal world and the outside world. The
objective of a message to EU citizens is clear: to maintain and
enrich their freedom, by ensuring that it can be enjoyed in
conditions of security and justice, the EU executive head said.
</P>
<P>
A message to EU administrations is a fully cooperative venture
between the Union's institutions and its member states, Prodi said
adding that "the time for institutional and competence quarrels is
well and truly over".
</P>
<P>
"Criminal activity, and organized crimes in particular, can be
added to the list of our main post-Cold War enemies," the EU
Commission president told the EU leaders when addressing "a
message to the criminal world".
</P>
<P>
He also delivered "a message to the outside world" in the
southern Finnish city of Tampere. "Our justified concern for the
security and wellbeing of our own citizens will not be pursued at
the expense of Europe's long-standing tradition of openness beyond
our borders," Prodi said.

<HEADLINE> Nobel Peace Prize Winner Calls For Right EU Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPERE, Finland, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Doctors Without
Borders (Medecine Sans Frontieres), winner of the Nobel Peace
Prize for 1999, called on leaders of the 15 European Union (EU)
member states to pay major attention to the root causes of
migration when designing a political strategy for the EU's asylum
and migration policy for coming years.
</P>
<P>
In the southern Finnish city of Tampere, the organization
received the news about the Norwegian Nobel Committee's decision
to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 1999 to it "in recognition of
its pioneering humanitarian work on several continents."
</P>
<P>
Doctors Without Borders also called on the EU leaders attending
a special EU summit here over the weekend to tackle the root
causes of migration in order to reduce the need for peoples to
migrate from a place to another.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the root causes of migration does not absolve states
of the need to develop a protection-oriented within EU asylum and
migration policy, the non-governmental group reaffirmed "the need
for a broad interpretation of the 1951 Refugee Convention, an
alternative protection status for people in need of international
protection and a decent reception system based on humanitarian
values and human dignity."
</P>
<P>
Doctors Without Borders, a group of doctors, nurses and
volunteers for humanitarian aid actions from mainly European and
North American countries, said here that it is facing daily with
all kinds of root causes of migration.
</P>
<P>
Alex Capelle, Doctors Without Borders' general director of
Belgian section, said an explosive mixture of war, violence
conflicts, harsh living conditions and extreme poverty forces
people to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
The organization is here with other non-governmental groups to
hold a meeting calling for the EU's right strategy on migration
issue.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation in the early 1970s, Doctors Without
Borders has adhered to the fundamental principle that all disaster
victims, whether the disaster is natural or human in origin, have
a right to professional assistance, given as quickly and
efficiently as possible, according to the Norwegian Nobel
Committee.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Condolence messages kept
pouring in from different parts of the world Friday to mourn the
late founding president of Tanzania Julius Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Indian President K.R. Narayanan said, "the world has lost a
statesman of international stature whose contributions to the
liberation and resurgence of Africa were matched by his work for
the fashioning of a new and equitable world order.
</P>
<P>
"Nyerere was a tower of strength for the non-aligned movement
and he struggled ceaselessly for the solidarity of the movement
and for the strategic concept of south-south cooperation."
</P>
<P>
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said in a statement,
"Julius Nyerere was one of the great African leaders among those
who struggled against colonialism and oppression under minority
rule and for national independence," Persson said. "As Father of
the Nation, Nyerere laid the foundation for the building of a
nation which has become an example for peaceful and multi-cultural
co-existence."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said, "we have lost a
unique, wise and great leader whom he left a remarkable legacy to
the human history in the 20th century."
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton paid tribute to Nyerere,
describing him as " a pioneering leader for freedom and
self-government in Africa".
</P>
<P>
President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi said, "We want particularly
to renew to Mwalimu (teacher) Nyerere compliments for all the
efforts that he has always deployed as a mediator for the Burundi
conflict and for peace in the country."
</P>
<P>
Nyerere has been tirelessly brokering peace in Burundi that
borders Tanzania since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, who retired as Tanzanian president in 1985 after 24
years of rule, died of leukemia in the St. Thomas Hospital in

The Argentine president, who arrived Thursday in Brasilia for a

</P>
<P>
This would reinforce the integration of the two nations, and as
a consequence, increase the power of the bloc in international
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Mercosur is a process of proven success, but it is still
necessary to advance more to tighten the relations with the
European Union and with other countries during the World Trade
Organization Round of the Millennium," said Menem.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur is composed by Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and
Uruguay, with Bolivia and Chile as associate members.

NEW YORK, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average ended above 10,000 Friday after falling below the
milestone briefly in the late trading.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip index closed down 266.90 at 10,019.71.
The index fell 288.43 at 9,998.18 in the late trading, more than
6 months after crossing into the five digital territory at the
closing session.
</P>
<P>
The loss pushed the average 1,306.33 below the record
closing high of 11,326.04 points set on August 5. and cut the
index's gain for the year into 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were sharply lower. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fell 36.01 at 1,247.41 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 75.01 at 2,731.83.
</P>
<P>
The stocks plunged after the Labor Department reported that
the wholesale prices surged 1.1 percent in September, the
biggest increase in nine years. The Federal Reserve chairman
Alan Greenspan's comments about the threat of a possible
"bursting bubble" of stock prices last night also hit the
market.
</P>
<P>
The government report and Greenspan's remarks made investors
believe that the U.S. economy got pressures on inflation and the
Federal Reserve, therefore, will raise interest rates for the
third time this year to battle the inflation.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Bolivia Reduce Cocaine Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Drug Control
agency reported Friday that Peru and Bolivia successfully reduced
cocaine production in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia is expected to eliminate 14,000 hectares under cocaine
cultivation, surpassing its record in this regard, according to
Executive Director of the U.N. Office for Drug Control and Crime
Prevention and U.N. Under-Secretary-General Pino Arlacchi.
</P>
<P>
Bolivia will start the new millennium with barely 12,000
hectares of illicit coca, less than one sixth of the area under
cultivation ten years ago, he told a session of the 54th U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, coca cultivation in Peru has fallen from a peak of
129,000 hectares in 1992 to 51,000 hectares in 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official partly attributed the achievements to
international support for alternative development in the Andean
countries.
</P>
<P>
He painted a different picture in Afghanistan, which accounts
for over 75 percent of the world's opium production due to
difficulties in fully applying the alternative development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
The 4,600 tonnes of raw opium expected to be harvested this
year by the central western Asian country is 70 percent higher
than 1998. A prolonged civil rift there impedes international
drug control efforts.

<HEADLINE> 14 Cigarettes Everyday for Italian Smoker, Study Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The average Italian smoker is aged
between 35 and 39 and gets through 14 cigarettes a day, Italian
doctors said at a conference here Friday.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of studies conducted in conjunction with a
national anti-smoking campaign, associations representing family
doctors and lung specialists said there were 16 million smokers in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Smoking is believed to cause 90,000 deaths a year among
Italians, the bulk of whom started between the ages of 15 and 17.
</P>
<P>
On a more positive note, doctors reported that there were now
six million former smokers in Italy and that some 80 percent of
current smokers said they wanted to give up.
</P>
<P>
Fiorenzo Corti, head of the anti-smoking campaign said it was
essential that family doctors developed the expertise to be able
to spot nicotine addiction among their patients.
</P>
<P>
"Giving up smoking at any age can significantly reduce the risk
of disease and lengthen life expectancy," he added.

TAMPERE, Finland, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Finland and Sweden are
among the most sober European Union (EU) member states when
consumption is measured in liters of pure alcohol drunk per year,
according to the Eurostat yearbook's 1998-1999 edition.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that average consumption was 8.4 liters in
Finland and 6.4 liters in Sweden in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Norwegians and Icelanders drank even less with 4.8
liters in a year's consumption. Currently, Norway and Iceland do
not have EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburgers drink average 14.5 liters per year to top the
list.
</P>
<P>
On a road accident survey, Portuguese and Greek men are most
likely to die with 34 deaths per 100,000 men.
</P>
<P>
Men drive most safely in Sweden, Britain, Norway and Finland,
yet are still three times more likely than EU women to die in road
accidents.
</P>
<P>
The Eurostat yearbook also cited smoking average figures. The
EU smoking average was 1,646 cigarettes per person a year in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In Finland, 41.8 out of every 100,000 men committed suicide to
lead EU statistics. On average, EU men are twice as likely as
women to commit suicide.

<HEADLINE>   Fans Will Keep Beckham at Man United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- David Beckham's father said on
Friday that loyalty to Manchester United and its fans will keep
his son at Old Trafford.
</P>
<P>
Beckham's position at United has come into question in recent
days, with the latest reports claiming he and wife Spicy Girl
Victoria Adams have splashed out on a new mansion in Hertfordshire,
200 miles from Manchester.
</P>
<P>
But the England midfielder's father Ted insists his son will
stay at Old Trafford after the fans helped him recover from his
World Cup red card ordeal in France to win the Treble last season.
</P>
<P>
Beckham went on record this week to say he had no intention of
leaving United and his father said: "He loves the club and the
supporters. They turned it for him after the World Cup and he
loves them for that. He is not going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
"The club and the fans have been brilliant to him and he has
got so much respect for Sir Alex Ferguson and the supporters.
</P>
<P>
"His form is good at the moment and he is very, very happy at
Old Trafford and that is the important thing."
</P>
<P>
Speculation has linked Beckham with a move south because
Victoria, aka Posh Spice, is fed up with living in Cheshire.
</P>
<P>
But Beckham's father insists that his son would not be able to
achieve the same level of success at any other club.
</P>
<P>
"There is no chance of him moving and, at the end of the day,
stories about him leaving are a load of rubbish.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke to him the other day and he said 'Where else can I go
bigger and better than United?"'

LONDON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Lawrie McMenemy has rejected the
offer of a new contract to carry on as Northern Ireland manager,
according to local reports on Friday.
</P>
<P>
McMenemy, who had been in charge since February 1998, has told
the Irish Football Association that he and his coaching team
intend to move on when their current deals expire on November 30.

A statement issued by IFA general secretary David Bowen said: "
Mr. McMenemy said that he and his management team were all keen to
pursue their individual future careers in club football."
</P>
<P>
The news will be welcomed by the majority of Northern Ireland
fans, who had lost faith in McMenemy's so-called "dream team"
after a miserable European Championship qualifying campaign in
which they won only one game.

Gonzalez Macchi dismissed General Hector Galeano from his post of
Chief of Staff of the Joint Armed Forces in an unexpected move
Friday, said official reports from Asuncion, capital of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal was announced 24 hours after the resignation of
Army Commander General Eligio Torres Heyn.
</P>
<P>
President Gonzalez appointed Admiral Ramon Ocampos Alfaro as
the new Army Commander and General Emilio Canela to replace
Galeano, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is widely seen as one of the first steps by the
Gonzalez government to restructure the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Torres's resignation is reportedly related to his long conflict
with Defense Minister Nelson Argana, son of Vice President Luis
Maria Argana who was assassinated in March.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Governor Attacks S&AMP;P's Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chatu Mongol said Friday that Thai banks need only 140-150
billion baht (3.58-3.84 billion dollars) in fresh money within the
next year to absorb losses on problem loans.
</P>
<P>
His estimation was based on an assumption that non-performing
loans (NPLs) in the Thai banking sector would sustain at 47
percent of total loans.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank governor came out with his statement just
one day after S&AMP;P's, a U.S.-based rating agency, gave a sobering
warning that Thai banks were still crippled with a mountain of bad
debts and they required 863 billion baht to restore solvency,
absorb losses on problem loans and recapitalize to a level
appropriate for its heightened risk profile.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P's warning coincided with the Bank of Thailand's
announcement Friday, pointing to the fact that the country's
financial sector is still struggling under massive NPLs which make
up 46.8 percent of the total credit extension.
</P>
<P>
Problem loans in Thai banking sector at the end of August
amounted to 2.6 trillion baht (66.67 billion dollars), a fall of
1.3 percent from the previous month. Total loans, including NPLs,
by local banks, foreign full branches and finance companies
amounted to 5.6 trillion baht (143.58 billion dollars), the Bank
of Thailand said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chatu Mongol said that local banks needed fresh money
much less than S&AMP;P's had estimated as the nationalized bank's NPLs
have already been guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
He said he was not worried about private banks'
recapitalization because most of them could use the rights to sell
their new stake to existing shareholders.

<HEADLINE> Dong Zhen, King on the Rings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin has tasted the most
excitement and glory as the host of gymnastics world championships
when local hero Dong Zhen captured the gold medal on the rings on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Tianjiner had fulfilled the dream of the host
city and lived up to the expectation. The specialist on the rings
claimed to be "the king of the rings" after defending champion
China retained the men's team title for the fourth consecutive
time earlier on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China had set a target of winning two titles in the men's
category in the championships -- the team title and the rings.
Dong did not let the Chinese disappointed.
</P>
<P>
Under the deafening roar punctuated by drums and whistles from
some 10,000 local supporters, Dong scored 9.775 points to top all
the finalists on the rings, beating his closest rival Szilveszter
Csollany of Hungary for the crown.
</P>
<P>
Dong said he now knew a mixed feeling of sweetness and
bitterness when he recovered the thoughts of falling down twice
from the horizontal bar and got injuries in two years.
</P>
<P>
"Since then, whenever I touch the trembling bar I was nervous
and could not finish all the six apparatus. Maybe that is the
reason for my victory on the rings," Dong explained.
</P>
<P>
Dong, who wrapped up all the rings titles in the national
championships since 1996, jumped onto the world-level stage when
making his debut at the World University Games in Spain this July.
</P>
<P>
Dong executed a perfect routine on the rings and brought the
longest cheers after his routine in the Games, but had to concede
for a silver medal while world champion Ivan Ivankov from Belarus
won the judges for the gold.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit upset at that time but I knew that a good
impression from the judges is very important. They knew nothing
about me before, but now they paid special attention to me after
we won the team title at this championships," Dong said.
</P>
<P>
"My dream now is to win at the Sydney Olympic Games," he added.

<HEADLINE> World Gymnastics at Crossroads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The direction for gymnastics
remains uncertain as the Extra Congress of the International
Gymnastics Federation (FIG) failed to reach consensus on the rules
change which is routine following an Olympic cycle.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day congress which opened here on Wednesday, heated
discussions surrounded how the scoring rules should develop and
which is the right direction of gymnastics since the sport has
seen a growing tendency to perform more and more difficult tricks
in competitions.
</P>
<P>
Some representatives proposed that there should be no capping
for the maximal score and the start value at 8.6 for men and 8.0
for women be lowered to zero.
</P>
<P>
But such countries as China, Russia and Romania were adamant in
their objection to this proposal, thinking this will encourage the
unbridled growth in the degree of difficulty and is harmful to the
future of gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
The traditional powerhouses argued that such change to the
rules will increase the chances injuries and make the sport less
artistry but more acrobatic.
</P>
<P>
There is another concern that it will also make the rules more
complex and spectators feel harder to appreciate the competition.
</P>
<P>
Miao Zhongyi, the technical director of the Tianjin
championships, said that the current rules remain to be improved
but any irresponsible change should not be made.
</P>
<P>
"We should take a cautious approach to make changes to the
rules pattern which has existed for so long," said Miao.
</P>
<P>
Chinese world and Olympic champion Li Xiaoshuang also said that
the change should be made in light of the safety of the gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
Since Sang Lan tragedy happened last year, there have been
increasing calling for stopping the unlimited pursuit of difficult
tricks.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Chinese girl, a national vaulting champion, had
to say good-bye to her beloved gymnasiums and teenage fellows as
she fell victim to a tragic accident during a warm-up exercises at
last year's Goodwill Games in New York.
</P>
<P>
The rules changes were forced to be postponed after no
compromise were reached and the FIG will make final decision after
the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Bulls Guard Armstrong to Undergo Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Chicago Bulls veteran point
guard B.J. Armstrong, who last month re-signed with the team with
which he enjoyed his greatest success, is slated to undergo
arthroscopic surgery in his left knee on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He will then sidelined up to a month.
</P>
<P>
A member of three championship teams in Chicago, Armstrong was
looked upon by second-year coach Tim Floyd to provide some
leadership to a team in the midst of a transition. Gone is the
core of the team that won six titles in eight seasons and among
the new faces are 1999 first-round picks Elton Brand and Ron
Artest.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old Armstrong signed a one-year contract with the
Bulls on August 30. He played in just 32 games last season for
Charlotte and Orlando, averaging just 3.3 points and 1.9 assists.
Traded from Charlotte to the Los Angeles Lakers in mid-March,
Armstrong was signed by the Magic on March 14.
</P>
<P>
The baby-faced Armstrong, who has a smooth shooting touch, has
averaged 9.9 points and 3.3 assists over 10 NBA seasons, also
playing parts of three years with the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
Armstrong was one of three first-round picks by Chicago in 1989.
He played his first six seasons in the NBA with the Bulls, missing
only one game.
</P>
<P>
In six seasons with Chicago from 1989-1995, Armstrong was a
part of three straight championship teams between 1991-93. He had
his best season in 1994, averaging 14.8 points and earning a berth
on the All-Star team.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Cut Non-Plan Expenditure By 10 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The new Indian government
planned to cut non-plan expenditure by 10 percent with an aim to
save 20 billion to 25 billion rupees (around 465 million to 581
million U.S. dollars) in the 1999-2000 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Express reported Saturday that the Finance
Ministry kicked off the expenditure control exercise on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha asked the financial advisers of
various ministries to strictly comply with the decision of cut,
which was taken in August but could not be implemented due to
general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to senior officials of the Finance Ministry, about 40
financial advisers working in different ministries attended the
meeting called by Sinha on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sinha said that the government would review all subsidies
except food and fertilizer and relook all non-plan expenditure as
a step to check fiscal deficit.
</P>
<P>
During the first five months of the current financial year
which began on April 1, total non-plan expenditure had accumulated
to 746.9 billion rupees (approximately 17.36 billion dollars) in
the country.
</P>
<P>
However, expenditure on revenue account during the same period
went up to 679.26 billion rupees (nearly 15.8 billion dollars)
from 573 billion rupees (some 13.6 billion dollars) in the
corresponding period last year.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Reject U.N. Resolution on Bin Laden Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Afghan Taliban
authorities have rejected the latest U.N. Security Council
resolution aimed at bringing Saudi dissident Osama bin Laden to
punitive action.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council passed a U.S. proposed resolution
Friday, giving the Taliban one month to hand over Osama bin Laden.
Otherwise, financial sanctions will be imposed against the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
A report by Afghan Islamic Press Saturday quoted a spokesman
for Taliban's supreme leader Mulla Omar as saying, "these
sanctions will hurt only the Afghan people who have already been
plunged into plenty of problems."
</P>
<P>
"This unfair action was taken under the pressure of the United
States ... So far, there has not been any evidence of Osama's
involvement in terrorism by any one," the unnamed Taliban
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an Islamic issue," he said, pledging "until there is no
way out of this issue according to Islam, we will not turn over
Osama."
</P>
<P>
The United States has charged Osama bin Laden for being
involved in the bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and
Kenya in August last year in which more than 200 people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's supreme leader has proposed that Muslim scholars
from Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and any other Islamic country iron
out a "unanimous decision" on the fate of Osama bin Laden.

<HEADLINE> Fake Visa Scandal Exposed in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Charalambos Anastassiades, twin
brother of Cyprus' ruling Democratic Rally party leader Nicos
Anastassiades, has been arrested for involving in forgery, conspiracy
and extortion, local mass media reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Anastassiades, 53, who has worked as a labour agent
specializing in employing foreign workers, turned himself in to
Limassol Police on Thursday after hearing on the radio that a
warrant for his arrest had been issued.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus police last week launched an emergency probe into
allegations that police officers are involved in flesh-trading
and are being paid to supply fake residence permits for foreign
women in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has acquired a bad reputation for importing female
cabaret dancers who are then allegedly forced to work as
prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Late Thursday night, police arrested three law officers in
connection with the same crime.
</P>
<P>
They were named as Pelopidas Evgeniades, Senior Police Officer;
Sergeant Efstathiou Theodorou, Intelligence Bureau Officer;
Sergeant Demetris Himona, Port and Naval Police officer serving
with the Limassol Crime Prevention Squad.
</P>
<P>
The charges under investigation include forging or altering
official documents, illegal employment of a foreigner, conspiracy
to commit a crime and extortion.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that foreign women can pay 170 Cyprus pounds
(340 U.S. dollars) to get a forged visa, but it is only valid for
15 days. Every other 15 days, renewal of the "visa" will cost 170
pounds more.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has expressed that it would "go all the
way" to follow the case.
</P>
<P>
"The case will go on, no matter who the accused are and who
their relatives are," the Government Spokesman Michalis Papapetrou
said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Cyprus' Immigration Chief and a senior immigration
official were suspended for three months service on the same
charge.

should continue to protect the country from both internal and
external enemies to ensure peace in the country to guarantee
development.

The government would ensure professional training for the

Noting that the security of the country relies on good military
 training, the president said Zambia needs a disciplined army and

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Files Lawsuits Against California, Illinois Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Microsoft Corp., the world'
s largest software maker, Friday filed software piracy lawsuits
against four California companies, accusing them of committing
organized crimes.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the lawsuit, Microsoft cited statistics
showing that pirated software accounts for close to 30 percent of
all software sold in California.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Microsoft also filed similar lawsuits against five
computer resellers in Illinois for allegedly distributing
counterfeit Microsoft software and installing unlicensed software
on computers.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft said the lawsuits are part of its ongoing efforts to
hinder the negative effects of software piracy, which, it said,
has significant impact on the commercial businesses of software
distributors and the economies they work to support.
</P>
<P>
A recent study showed that the state of Illinois is one of the
top 10 states to lose wage, salary and tax revenue from software
piracy, losing more than 241 million U.S. dollars in 1998. The
state also lost more than 5,400 jobs due to piracy.
</P>

In 1998, software piracy caused 2.8 billion dollars in tax

jobs, according to statistics released by International Planning &AMP;
Research Corp.

<HEADLINE> California Agencies Ordered Not to Buy Illegal Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. California State
Governor Gray Davis on Friday signed an executive order, asking
every state agency not only to combat software piracy but also
enforce compliance within their own offices.
</P>
<P>
"The state should operate on its own nickel. We should be a
moral example," Davis said at a press conference at Stanford
University where he was attending his 35th college reunion.
</P>
<P>
According to Davis, the problem of software piracy had got so
bad that some of the government agencies charged with enforcing
copyright laws may be unwittingly using counterfeit products
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Becca Gould of the Business Software Alliance, who attended the
signing ceremony to show their support for the order, said that
government agencies could be especially susceptible to buying
illegal software since they often have mandates to get the lowest
bid for products and services.
</P>
<P>
"Often the lowest bid seems too good to be true and sometimes
it is," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dan Bross, a representative for Microsoft Corp, who also
attended the signing ceremony, said the fact that pirated software
was even making its way into government offices indicated how
sophisticated some counterfeiters had become.
</P>
<P>
"This isn't just mom-and-pop. It's organized crime," said Bross,
who cited statistics showing that pirated software accounts for
close to 30 percent of all software sold in California.
</P>
<P>
The Business Software Alliance estimates that the use of
illegal software costs some 11 billion U.S. dollars each year
worldwide, and 2.8 billion dollars in the United States, including
lost sales taxes and wages.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Finances Lebanon's Road Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti development group is
shelling out 16 million U.S. dollars in soft loans to help Lebanon
improve highways on capital Beirut's northern edge, the Daily
Star reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The loan from the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development
(KFAED) will help Lebanese Council for Development and
Reconstruction (CDR), which is in charge of the country's post-war
rebuilding, widen and develop the main coastal highway between
Dbayyeh and Naqqash.
</P>
<P>
The 16.27-million-dollars loan, which will mature after 20
years at a yearly interest rate of 3 percent, will cover 53
percent of the cost of CDR's plans to build the three-kilometer
highway.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Othman and Badr Humaidi, who serve as presidents for
the CDR and the KFAED, inked the deal Friday at the office of
Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss, who said the government would
pay the rest of the cost.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is expected to ease rush-hour traffic jams in
the area, is due to be finished at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war in Lebanon, the
Kuwaiti government and the KFAED have granted Lebanon 89.28
million dollars in grants.
</P>
<P>
The grants have funded training programs for government
employees, agricultural development plans, updating equipment in
government-run clinics and the rebuilding of the sports stadium.
</P>
<P>
The KFAED has given Lebanon 243 million dollars in
predominantly soft loans to rehabilitate the country's
electricity, water and telephone networks and develop the southern
and northern entrances to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
About 141 million dollars are being spent on projects that are
still underway.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the KFAED has promised 185 million dollars over the
next two years, part of which will go to developing drinking-water
networks in the country's central province of Mount Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Over 20 Injured in Clash in Skamitrovica, Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Violence flared up in Kosovo's
Skamitrovica town when more than 3,000 ethnic Albanians tried to
cross a bridge to the Serb side, leaving four multinational
peacekeepers and more than 20 ethnic Albanians injured.
</P>
<P>
During the four-hour clash, French-led peacekeepers used tear
gas and percussion grenades to drive back hundreds of ethnic
Albanians, who hit back with showers of stones.
</P>
<P>
The clash was attributed to a recent announcement from the U.N.
Mission in Kosovo, which required all universities in Pristina and
Skamitrovica to use both Albanian and Serbian in class.
</P>
<P>
Skamitrovica has been in tension since September 10 when ethnic
Albanians attacked a Serb residential area with mortar, in which
more than 30 people were injured.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Curb Deforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
issued new and tough measures aimed at stopping the wanton
destruction and grabbing of public forests, the Daily Nation
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Environment Minister Francis Nyenze was quoted as saying
Friday in a press statement that the government has imposed a
moratorium on all existing timber harvesting concessions until a
full inventory of all plantation forests is carried out.
</P>
<P>
The government has appointed Gideon Gathaara, a senior forestry
expert from the Kenya Wildlife Services, to assist the ministry to
embark on a long-term program within the forest department, Nyenze
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has also stopped the issuance of any new
timber harvesting licences and ordered a review of the existing
ones with the aim of eliminating the current inadequacies that
lead to unsustained forestry practices.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the government will in the next few
months meet with stakeholders in an effort to develop sustainable
management of the country's forest resources.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to make important changes in the forestry
sector, he said, adding that the move aims to establish an
infrastructure capable of maintaining an independent and
universally recognized standard of forest management.

JOHANNESBURG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Botswanan President Festus
Mogae was among the first voters in the capital Gaborone on
Saturday when the polls opened for the country's general
elections, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Mogae, leader of the ruling Botswana Democratic Party (BDP),
said he was confident of victory.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the electorate to vote and expressed concern
over voter apathy. Only 467,000 of the 800,000 eligible voters
have registered.
</P>
<P>
A new BDP government would concentrate on the diversification
of Botswana's economy away from its reliance on diamonds, Mogae
said. "My thrust will be to create jobs and industry," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would spend up to 60 million Pula (13.3
million U. S. dollars) to combat AIDS/HIV.
</P>
<P>
"We have not done enough yet. The epidemic is very serious it
is hurting our economy," Mogae added.

<P>
CAIRO, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- The Egyptian-Sudanese permanent technical committee on Nile
water will hold meetings Monday in Khartoum, capital of Sudan. The
one-week-long meetings will tackle the effects of the two floods
of the years 1998 and 1999, said Egyptian Minister of Public Works
and Water Resources Mohamed Abu Zeid.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Minister of Economy and Foreign Trade Youssef
Boutros Ghali signed with visiting U.S. Secretary of Commerce
William Dalay an agreement on encouraging the two countries'
private sectors to increase the volume of bilateral E-trade.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Works on the third and last stage for the project to upgrade
Egypt's famous Pyramids Plateau will kick off early next year,
said Minister of Culture Farouq Hosni. The project comprises
removal of slums in the area and setting up a single entry from
the Cairo-Fayoum road.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Mail:
</P>
<P>
-- Shots rang out in celebration, tears flowed and bagpipes
played as 151 Palestinian prisoners freed by Israel Friday
returned home to loved ones in a crush of hugs and kisses. The
releases, delayed for a week by a dispute over who would go free,
were another sign of closer cooperation between Israel and the
Palestinians since Prime Minister Ehud Barak took office in July
pledging to revive peace-making.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Copper Industry Continues Record Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 15 (Xinhua) -- Copper consumption in the
United States grew about 30 percent between 1992 and 1998, at a
compound annual growth rate of 4.5 percent, according to a report
released Friday.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate outstripped the growth of the U.S. Gross
Domestic Product, which was 3.2 percent for the same period, said
the report from the Copper Development Association (CDA), the
information, education and technical development arm of the copper,
brass and bronze industry of the United States.
</P>
<P>
U.S. end-use consumption of copper, copper alloy and foundry
products in 1998 totaled 3.87 million tons, setting an all-time
record, up two percent from the 1997 level, the CDA report said.
</P>
<P>
Consumption levels for the first seven months of 1999 ran 2.6
percent ahead of last year. If the rate continues, the CDA said,
more than four million tons will be recorded for 1999, the fourth
straight record year for U.S. copper and copper alloy consumption.
</P>
<P>
The United States consumes some 24 percent of the world's
refined copper output, amounting to 10.8 kilograms per capita,
according to the CDA.
</P>
<P>
Building construction in 1998 continued to be the largest end-
use market for copper products, accounting for 41.4 percent of
total U.S. consumption. Other end-use markets included electrical
and electronic products, transportation equipment, industrial
machinery and equipment, and consumer and general products.
</P>
<P>
There is increasing demand for copper tubes, brass rod, and
electrical and telecommunications wiring, stemming from robust
activity in the housing, commercial construction, air-conditioning
and transportation market, the CDA said.
</P>
<P>
Copper maintains an 85-percent market share for water tube in
the United States, the CDA said, while virtually all branch wiring
in new homes and commercial buildings is solid copper. The growth
of the Internet, and the consumer and commercial demand for being
"connected" are pushing up high-capacity copper wiring
installations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the increased production of automotive vehicles and
their increasing reliance on electronics is fueling a surge in
copper for wiring harnesses and related devices.
</P>
<P>
Copper continues to be one of the most highly recycled metals
in the United States, according to the CDA. Copper from secondary
sources currently accounts for 45 percent of all U.S. consumption.

<HEADLINE> Rural Ugandans Urged to Fight Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KAMPALA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans living in rural areas
have been urged to eradicate poverty as the first step for rural
development and improvement of their living standards.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry
and Fisheries Kisamba Murgerwa in a statement he issued to mark
the 18th World Food Day Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He described poverty as a root cause of food insecurity and
indeed environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
"Government has so far taken the lead by putting in place
credit programs such as Entandikwa (starting fund) and Program
for Alleviation of Poverty to help eradicate poverty among the
rural poor," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts to eradicate poverty are also embraced in the
policies of decentralization, privatization, liberalization,
democratization and agricultural modernization," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ugandans, those living in the countryside in particular, are
encouraged to adopt sustainable agricultural strategies,
high-yield technologies such as improved seeds and stocking
materials, to use fertilizer and apply appropriate water and soil
conservation techniques.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Uganda is not among the low income food deficit
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, poor food distribution within the country remains a
major constraint and puts many rural and urban poor at great risk
of going hungry.
</P>
<P>
Low productivity limited food production leading to insecurity
and low incomes for farmers. Meanwhile, limited credit
opportunities and poor marketing infrastructure also reduce
levels of available food for home and the market.
</P>
<P>
At present 46 percent of Uganda's population still lives under
the poverty line and most of them are the rural poor.

<HEADLINE>   China Big Winner on Final Day of Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China was the big winner on the
final day of the gymnastics world championships here when Li
Xiaopeng and Ling Jie captured two more gold medals for the host
country here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gymnasts from South Korea, Canada and Romania shared the other
three titles.
</P>
<P>
Li, world champion in the parallel bars and floor exercise,
delighted the local crowd when he celebrated his first vault gold
medal in his career with 9.668 points.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old edged Evgeny Sapronenko of Latvia and Dieter
Rehm of Switzerland who collected 9.656 and 9.468 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ling Jie, runner-up on the women's uneven bars apparatus final
Friday, took off a flying start on the balance beam and claimed
the victory of the breath-taking competition with 9.775.
</P>
<P>
Andreea Raducan of Romania finished second with 9.762 and Olga
Raschoupkina of Ukraine came to third on 9.737.
</P>
<P>
But Romania's new star Raducan turned the situation in the
floor exercise when she displayed a flawless routine to score a
leading score of 9.837 points, overshadowing her veteran teammate
Simona Amanar and Russian Svetlana Khorkina.
</P>
<P>
Though world and Olympic champion Khorkina performed her
fascinating balletic routine with smile on her face, she had to
settle for the bronze medal with 9.787, behind Amanar's 9.800.
</P>
<P>
Lee Joo-Hyung of South Korea won the men's parallel bars with 9.
750 points, and Alexei Bondarenko of Russia and Naoya Tsukahara of
Japan shared the silver with identical scores of 9.675.
</P>
<P>
While everyone else bumbled and tumbled on the horizontal bar,
Jesus Carballo of Spain made easily displayed his routine which
earned him 9.712 points, followed by Canadian Alexander Jelkov
with 9.700 and Chinese Yang Wei in third place with 9.612.
</P>
<P>
Russia showed their depth in gymnastics by topping the overall
medal standings with five gold medals, followed by China with four
and Romania three.
</P>
<P>
Romanian women and Chinese men wrapped up team victories
earlier at the eight-day gymnastics world gala, the biggest and
last meet of the kind in China in this century.
</P>
<P>
The biyearly event, which drew 651 gymnasts from 73 countries
and regions, served as the last chance for gymnasts to qualify for
the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Speaker Regrets Over Hebron Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (parliament)
Speaker Avraham Burg has expressed regrets over the Hebron
incident last week during which Jordanian parliamentarians were
harassed by Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
In a message to Jordanian Lower House Speaker Abdu Hadi Majali,
Burg said that "the attitude of the settlers is not acceptable"
and he hoped "appropriate measures against the settlers" will be
taken after a thorough investigation into the incident is
completed, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Burg expressed hope that the Hebron incident would not affect
bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The message was apparently another goodwill gesture from
Israel after a 20-member Jordanian parliamentary delegation was
forced to receive security checks last Saturday when they were
prepared to visit the Ibrahim Mosque in the Israeli-controlled
part of the West Bank city of Hebron, and then were heckled and
attacked by some 15 Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Jordan welcomed an Israeli move to prosecute one
of the settlers believed to be involved in the harassment case,
saying it is a good signal and a step in the right direction
towards easing the tension between the two countries over the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Jordan has lodged a formal and strong protest over the
incident and demanded a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
Amman also postponed indefinitely a visit to Jordan scheduled
for October 13 by Israeli Industry and Trade Minister Ran Cohen
over the incident.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident was one of the few unhappy episodes
between the two countries after they signed a peace treaty in
1994. For years Jordan has been actively promoting the peace
process between Israel and its Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> China Big Winner on Final Day of Gymnastics Worlds (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- China was the big winner on the
final day of the gymnastics world championships here when Li
Xiaopeng and Ling Jie captured two more gold medals for the host
country here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Gymnasts from South Korea, Canada and Romania shared the other
three titles.
</P>
<P>
Li, world champion in the parallel bars and floor exercise,
delighted the local crowd when he celebrated his first vault gold
medal in his career with 9.668 points.
</P>
<P>
"I just tried my best, I think I will do better in the future,"
said Li.
</P>
<P>
However, his coach Chen Xiong said though he displayed his true
form, he still has room to improve in his vault rotation.
</P>
<P>
Chen said: " Some excellent gymnasts failed to enter the finals
here, so the competition is not very intense and you can see that
the scores are not as high as expected."
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old edged Evgeny Sapronenko of Latvia and Dieter
Rehm of Switzerland who collected 9.656 and 9.468 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Ling Jie, runner-up on the women's uneven bars apparatus final
Friday, took off a flying start on the balance beam and claimed
the victory of the breath-taking competition with 9.775.
</P>
<P>
"I was the first to compete on the beam, this usually meant
disadvantage for the scores," said Ling. "But my coach did not put
me under pressure so that I could did my best performances this
afternoon," Ling said.
</P>
<P>
Andreea Raducan of Romania finished second with 9.762 and Olga
Raschoupkina of Ukraine came third on 9.737.
</P>
<P>
But Romania's new star Raducan turned the situation in the
floor exercise when she displayed a flawless routine to score a
leading score of 9.837 points, overshadowing her veteran teammate
Simona Amanar and Russian Svetlana Khorkina.
</P>
<P>
"As Khorkina and Amanar had earned high scores before, I was
just calm and quiet. I did not have emotion and I just did my
exercises well," said the 16-year-old who made her debut in the
world championships.
</P>
<P>
Though world and Olympic champion Khorkina performed her
fascinating ballet routine with smile on her face, she had to
settle for the bronze medal with 9.787, behind Amanar's 9.800.
</P>
<P>
Lee Joo-Hyung of South Korea won the men's parallel bars with 9.
750 points, and Alexei Bondarenko of Russia and Naoya Tsukahara of
Japan shared the silver with identical scores of 9.675.
</P>
<P>
"This is the top honor I won in my gymnastics life, and I want
to work harder in the future." said Lee.
</P>
<P>
While everyone else bumbled and tumbled on the horizontal bar,
Jesus Carballo of Spain easily displayed his routine which earned
him 9.712 points, followed by Canadian Alexander Jelkov with 9.700
and Chinese Yang Wei in third place with 9.612.
</P>
<P>
"I had competed in the European championships and won the medal,
but this time it was much harder. I will prepare myself fully for
the Olympics," said the Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
Russia showed their depth in gymnastics by topping the overall
medal standings with five gold medals, followed by China with four
and Romania three.
</P>
<P>
Romanian women and Chinese men wrapped up team victories
earlier at the eight-day gymnastics gala, the biggest and last
meet of the kind in China in this century.
</P>
<P>
The biyearly event, which drew 651 gymnasts from 73 countries
and regions, served as the last chance for gymnasts to qualify for
the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games.

PARIS, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French humanitarian organization, Medecins Sans
Frontieres (MSF), founded in 1971 by Bernard Kouchner, won on
Friday the Nobel Peace Prize. The surprise announcement by the
Oslo-based prize committee was received with an outbreak of joy at
the MSF headquarters at the Bastille Square in Paris.
</P>
<P>
-- The French Communist Party (PCF) will organize a big rally
against unemployment in Paris on Saturday. The PCF national
secretary Robert Hue expected 50,000 people to participate in the
demonstration, which will also be joined by the Citizen's Movement
party, the Greens and some extreme-leftwing parties such as Lutte
Ouvriere.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Medecins Sans Frontieres obtained the Nobel Peace Prize
on Friday for its humanitarian aid on several continents. The
president of MSF, Philippe Biberson, said that the prize is a
reward for civil and humanitarian action which is carried out
without prejudice and independent of political and military
influence.
</P>
<P>
-- The French Socialist government and its Communist allies
reached an agreement on Friday on the second law of 35-hour work
week, one day before the Communist Party is due to organize a
demonstration in Paris in protest against unemployment. The
government has agreed to make some amendments in the law,
including government aid to enterprises engaged in reducing work
hours.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian Budget Deficit Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, October 15 (Xinhua) -- The national budget deficit of
Hungary that continued increasing this year had surpassed the
target set for the whole year by September, according to the
statistics released by the Finance Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit reached 465.3 billion forints (about 1.96
billion U.S. dollars) in September, 6.2 percent over the target
set for 1999, the ministry reported.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the figure was 391.2 billion
forints (about 1.64 billion dollars), accounting for 89.3 percent
of the whole year, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The deficit was mainly attributed to the fact that the
government did not collect enough revenues while the financial
expenditure went far beyond the predefined plan.
</P>
<P>
Some economists estimated that it would be difficult for
Hungary to realize its plan of limiting the whole-year budget
deficit to less than four percent of gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> EU Leaders Agree on Single Area of Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAMPERE, Finland, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from the
European Union (EU) said here Saturday that they have reached
greater consensus on a package of legal reforms.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from 15 EU member states said they have agreed on "
a number of policy orientations and priorities" which will
harmonize the EU-wide legal system.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders held a special meeting on Friday and Saturday in
the Finnish town of Tampere, focusing on the creation of an area
of "freedom, security and justice" within the bloc.
</P>
<P>
The EU governments said they are determined to develop the
union by making full use of the possibilities offered by the
Treaty of Amsterdam, the EU's basic law.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to place and maintain their political will for
setting up the single judicial area "at the very top of the
political agenda", which will keep under constant review any
progress in implementing necessary measures and meet the deadlines
set by different EU mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
In close connection with the area, the European heads of state
and government have agreed to form a body "entrusted with drawing
up a draft Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders also underlined the importance of ensuring the
necessary transparency and of keeping the European Parliament
regularly informed.
</P>
<P>
European observers believe that the establishment of the common
judicial area signals a turning point of the cooperation in law
and order in the EU as a whole, which will promote the European
bloc to a new stage of integration in early next century.

<HEADLINE> China Face Uphill Battle in Sydney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Sportswriter Liu Guang
</P>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 16 (Xinhua) -- With the fourth men's team
title to their credit, hosts China now set their sights on the
Olympic gold which they have never stopped dreaming of.
</P>
<P>
But the 34th world championships, which concluded on Saturday
here, turned out to be so intense that it forecasts a more
dramatic competition one year ahead in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Russia, who topped the final gold standings with five golds,
sent a belated but sure signal that they remain a strong power to
beat although they had been plagued by chronical injury and
sluggish form of some big guns in the Tianjin world championships,
which also served as the qualifier for the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Svetlana Khorkina impressed the spectators with her artistry
but caused surprises with her uncharacteristic fall off apparatus
which cost her defense of the women's all-round title and Russian
chance to win the team title.
</P>
<P>
Though placing 12th in the final all-round rankings, she proved
to be a mountain to overcome for the Chinese girls as she beat
Huang Mandan and Ling Jie to retain the title of the uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
Alexei Nemov, the 1996 Atlanta Olympic champions, had been
struggling with chronical injury but he managed to show his teeth
with two golds in the floor and pommel horse in the last stage of
the championships.
</P>
<P>
As the veterans remained aggressive, newcomers like Elena
Zamolodchikova surged to win the bronze in all round and vault
gold and she for sure will be an ace for Russian 2000 Olympic
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's side also need to catch up with the pace of
Romania who achieved the feat of four straight team titles in the
world championships although they sent only two veterans for the
world championships.
</P>
<P>
Guided by Romanian coach legend Octavian Bellu who produced
such greats like Lavinia Milosovici and Gina Gogean, the Romanian
Dream Team showed their great depth and extended the sights on
future glory.
</P>
<P>
Both Maria Olaru, 17, and Andrea Raducan, 16, emerged from the
shadow of veterans and became the new queens of gymnastics after
they beat Simona Amanar and Svetlana Khorkina to win the all-
around competition and floor, repsectively, at their world
championships debut.
</P>
<P>
The Romanians have been impressive rather for their resilience
in staging a comeback fight than for their routines as they
overcame the mishaps on the beam and one point deficit to snatch
the team title from Russia who was the winner in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The championships also see the golds distributed among not only
traditional powerhouses but also less known teams like Spain,
South Korea, Japan and Bulgaria who kept their dominance in some
specialities.
</P>
<P>
It is a good pre-Olympics test not only for the young Chinese
women's team but also for such countries like Australia, the
United States and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Though without a medal won here, Australia eye glory in 2000 as
the Olympic Games will be staged in their homeground and their
championships are expected to be stronger threat to the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
The United States are heralding a new era after the Magnificent
Seven as they showed not only their well-excuted routines but also
depth, ambition and confidence in this championships.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine felt no worry about the retirement of Olympic champion
lilia Podkopayeva for they have a new generation of gymnasts among
whom the leader is Vyctoria Karpenko who grabbed the silver in the
all-round of this championships.
</P>
<P>
China captured historical four gold medals from a single world
championships, but competition sent a signal for the Chinese that
more dramatic competition is ahead and they have no choice but
hone their skills.
</P>
<P>
The women's team need more international exposure in order to
be mentally stronger and technically consistent.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda to Restore Confidence in Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Uganda and Rwanda have agreed
to restore confidence in each other following the recent clashes
in Kisangani between their troops, killing dozens of soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued Friday in Rwanda's capital Kigali
after a five-day negotiation, representatives from both countries
said that the alliance and cooperation between them is of
paramount importance and therefore urgent measures to restore
confidence must be taken.
</P>
<P>
The communique, signed between Uganda's National Political
Commissar James Wapakhabulo and Rwanda's General Secretary of the
ruling Rwandese Patriotic Front Charles Murigande, noted the
ideological closeness between the two countries and mapped out a
strategy to strengthen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reaffirmed their commitment to the implementation
of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement, the communique said. They
reviewed the progress so far made and proposed the way forward, it
added.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiation, the two sides discussed ways of
strengthening their alliance to ensure that the objectives which
took them to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are
achieved, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda began to keep military presence in the DRC
soon after the civil war broke out there in early August of 1998.
They have been supporting the rival rebel groups since the main
rebel group, the Congolese Rally for Democracy, split in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
The recent clashes between the two countries in Kisangani, a
northeastern city in the DRC, are widely believed to be a result
of their gapping differences in strategies in the DRC.

</P>
<P>
The chief media officer said that they were developing programs
for the coaches which would standardize the development of
gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
"When we do coaches workshops in Africa, we will do the same
curriculum as we do in Asia, this will bring everyone with the
same experience," said Corn.
</P>
<P>
"We also develop the Age Group Program for competition, its
purpose is to offer a good basic understanding of the gymnastics
development."
</P>
<P>
The world gymnastics ruling body also have teamwork with other
sports authorities to help realize a balance between the developed
and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"We also cooperate with the International Olympic Committee. We
deliver courses under the solidarity of the IOC and help the
national organizations apply for money for their gymnastics," said
Corn.
</P>
<P>
"We will try to send the coaches or workshops, judges and
whatever kind of courses or workshops they need," Corn added.
</P>
<P>
As for those countries who are still in a wilderness of
gymnastics, the FIG has set up a Development Commission to help
such countries start gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
"For example, Cope Verde is a small island in Africa and is yet
to develop its own gymnastics. We help them to get equipment so
that they can start their own program."
</P>
<P>
"But in Africa it is really a long way to go, because the
artistic gymnastics needs the apparatus, the gym and the like, all
of this cost a lot. It is expensive for them," said Corn.
</P>
<P>
Yamani Mohamed, president of African Gymnastics Union (AGU),
said that what they need most are experienced coaches.
</P>
<P>
"Our main problem is the lack of experienced coaches. The
financial problem is very delicate but not every country lacks
apparatus and equipment. The others are local problems that we
have to solve by ourself," The AGU president told Xinhua on
Saturday here.
</P>
<P>
The president held that gymnastics had a long tradition there
but it was yet to be the priority in the continent.
</P>
<P>
He, however, was confident about the future of African
gymnastics and chances for the Africans to get involved in the
sport as the "relation has become stronger between the AGU and
FIG" .
</P>
<P>
"We have the judges courses and we have the age group program,
All the help the FIG provided us have boosted the development of
African gymnastics," he added.

HANGZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A 245-km-long expressway is
expected to bring more business opportunities to a relatively poor
areas in central Zhejiang Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
The expressway will run from Jinhua City and ends in Wenzhou
City, via Lishui. Forty percent of the work on the Jinhua-Lishui
section has been completed, a local source said.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang is an economically advantaged province, but poverty-
stricken areas still remain in part of the province where large
quantities of fruit and poultry cannot find a proper market
because of the lack of necessary transport facilities.
</P>
<P>
The new expressway will pass through poor areas in central
Zhejiang, including Wuyi and Lishui.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Wenzhou-Lishui section has also begun. The 9.3-
billion-yuan expressway will be put in operation in 2002, with
designed speeds up to 100 kilometers per hour.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality of Lanzhou Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The air in Lanzhou, one of the
country's most seriously polluted cities in northwest China, has
become clearer recently thanks to comprehensive measures taken to
reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Because Lanzhou lies on the Loess Plateau, its vulnerability to
frequent sandstorms once earned it the nickname "invisible city."
</P>
<P>
In the late 1980s, the city government of Lanzhou unveiled an
air-pollution control plan that will ultimately cost some 1.4
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The city has replaced six boilers with central heating in the
urban districts, resulting in the reduction of 2,320 tons of dust
and 354 tons of sulfur dioxide annually.
</P>
<P>
Over 100 pollutant-discharging enterprises have been ordered to
suspend operations, and 177 kilns and boilers are now equipped
with pollution-control devices.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 gas stations have begun to provide lead-free
gasoline to reduce auto emissions, and the city's bus company has
invested 20 million yuan to purchase hundreds of environment-
friendly buses.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the area of lawns in urban districts has expanded to
1,700 ha. Over 2.2 million trees have been planted along the
avenues.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Known as the Chinese "vegetable
basket" with an annual vegetable business of 2.8 billion kilograms,
Shouguang city of east China's Shandong province will boost the
development of its organic vegetable industry to tempt health-
conscious consumers.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Shouguang who are attending the
International Symposium and Exhibition on Fruit\Vegetable
Processing and Industrialization here have been seeking overseas
partners for organic vegetable production.
</P>
<P>
Xue Yanbin, assistant mayor of the city, said that though the
vegetables in Shouguang are well-known in China, the city should
strive to develop higher quality and healthier vegetables for
market sales so as to remain competitive in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Lin Yun, a businesswoman from the Yantai fruit wholesale market,
said, "Organic veggies are a little bit more expensive, but they
haven't been sprayed by chemicals and are good for the health.
More and more people would rather buy this kind of vegetable."
</P>
<P>
Liu Lianfu, chairman of China Organic Food Society who is
attending the ongoing symposium, said the popularity of organic
vegetables among Chinese consumers may be attributed to the fact
that fruit and vegetables are easily polluted with chemical sprays,
and the Chinese know it.
</P>
<P>
With China's improved living standard, Chinese people are
becoming more aware of the importance of a healthy lifestyle as
well as the need for environmental protection, and organic food
will thus have a special attraction, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> Organic Food for a Healthier Life (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The concept of organic food -- products grown in the optimal
ecological environment and subject to a thorough quality control
process -- first appeared in China ten years ago. Products and
processes are standardized and trademarked to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
Organic food has become an area of vigorous development in
China's agriculture and food production. The total output of China
's organic food was up to 8.4 million tons by the end of 1998. The
sales volume of last year was about 28.5 billion yuan (about 3.3
billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of China's organic food industry has
attracted the international attention. In 1998, the Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) of the United
Nations emphasized China's experiences of development and
management of organic food in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the future of the organic food industry, Liu
Lianfu said organic food has already become a rising market with
great potential. It is estimated that in the coming years, the
scale of the world's organic food market will reach 100 billion US
dollars and Europe, the United States and Japan will take the lead.
</P>
<P>
In China, the average consumption of fruit and vegetables is
still far behind that of developed countries, thus it has a good
opportunity to develop organic food, Liu said.

<HEADLINE> CAE Member Urges China to Improve Vegetable Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Though nowadays Chinese people
can choose from a variety of vegetables, and even buy some that
are more expensive than meat, the profits from vegetable
production have not been satisfactory for Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's vegetable production reached 345 million
tons, a total output of 250 billion yuan (about 28 billion US
dollars), second only to the grain production in the country.
</P>
<P>
Production based on traditional agriculture, however, is not
that profitable for Chinese farmers, said Fang Zhiyuan, member of
the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), who is in Yantai in
Shandong Province attending the International Symposium and
Exhibition on Fruit and Vegetable Processing and Industrialization.
</P>
<P>
This state of affairs can be attributed to small-scale unit
production, low quality products, unreasonable product structure,
and poor management of industrialization, explained Fang, adding
that technology is essential to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
He said that though vegetable production in China has made
great advances, the related technology is not advanced, and more
attention should be paid to research on fruit and vegetable
freshness-preservation technology.
</P>
<P>
Some sharp-eyed young farmers in Yantai have bought imported
high-quality seeds at the price of gold, and high-yield tomatoes
are now growing in their fields which sell at a price far higher
than that for common tomatoes. Gold seeds have brought gold
profits.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the product structure of fruit and
vegetables in Yantai is being optimized, and the planting and
processing technology is being improved, which directly resulted
in an 8 billion yuan (about one billion US dollars) income from
fruit and vegetables last year. One-third of the income for local
farmers now comes from fruit and vegetables production.
</P>
<P>
Fang, also director of the Institute of Vegetables and Flowers
under the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Science, suggested that
the key is to focus on selection and cultivation of high-quality
seeds and research on biological techniques.
</P>
<P>
Research on techniques for vegetable planting, the prevention
and cure of diseases, control of insect pests, and preservation
and processing should be strengthened in order to provide
technological support for optimal profits in China's vegetable
sector, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President's Accountability Speech Rejected by 4 Factions in Assembly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Poll winner Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle initiated the rejection of the
account of President B.J. Habibie's 16-month rule, bringing the
voting score on the speech to outright rejection by four factions,
while other seven remain undecided whether to accept or reject it.
</P>
<P>
Habibie presented on Thursday night his accountability speech,
a mandatory requirement for a president.
</P>
<P>
In his three-hour speech before the plenary session of the
People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), Habibie devoted a great deal
of his speech to elaborating on what his administration has done
to improve the economy, accelerate the democratization process and
carry out reform in other sectors.
</P>
<P>
All 11 factions of the MPR had presented their responses to
Habibie's accountability speech. Most factions acknowledged the
achievements of press freedom and political openness. However, all
underlined common subjects of concern -- the economy, human rights
and corruption.
</P>
<P>
During the general views meeting which ended on Saturday noon,
the factions of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, the
National Awakening Party, the Indonesian National Unity and the
Love the Nation Democratic Party outrightly rejected the
accountability.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar Party and other six factions gave ambiguous
conclusions as they questioned many aspects of Habibie's speech,
but at the same time highlighted several of his achievements.
Rather than presenting a definitive stance, they decided to
forward the issue for discussion with the Assembly commission.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Habibie will respond to the factions'
overviews on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Golkar has acknowledged that it will review its nomination
of Habibie if the MPR rejects his accountability.
</P>
<P>
Golkar General Chairman Akbar Tandjung pointed out that, should
the MPR reject the accountability, either by consensus or by
voting, Golkar would then be faced with a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
"Voting is made possible in case controversy arises in
evaluating the accountability. If that (rejection) becomes a fact,
we shall soon convene a leadership meeting to review it (Habibie's
nomination)," Akbar told reporters here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The process of the MPR in electing a new president began on
October 20. The three potential candidates are Habibie, General
Chairman of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle Megawati
Soekarnoputri and Abdurrahman Wahid, founder of the National
Awakening Party.

<HEADLINE> Symposium Held to Learn from Nuclear and Satellite Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 academicians from
the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) attended a symposium in
Beijing today to learn from the scientists who made China's first
atomic bomb, H-bomb and its first satellite.
</P>
<P>
The spirit of self-reliance and conscientiousness of the older
generation of scientists who helped develop the country's first
atomic bomb, H-bomb and its first satellite should be carried on,
said Lu Yongxiang, president of the CAS.
</P>
<P>
The unified management and cooperation between various
scientific institutes and government organizations which was the
key for those achievements should continue to be used in the
scientific research and economic development today, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
The progress of science and technology depends on the long-term
accumulation of experience, said Wang Daheng, an academician with
the CAS who was awarded a medal by the central government, along
with other 22 scientists who made China's first nuclear bomb and
satellite.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that scientists should focus on both scientific
research and experiments to solve scientific problems and try to
produce new ideas during experiments.
</P>
<P>
Five other medal recipients from the CAS also gave speeches at
the half-day symposium.

HONG KONG, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The Executive Council of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has approved the
introduction of the Protection of the Harbor (Amendment) Bill 1999
in further protecting and preserving the Victoria Harbor.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said Saturday that the Amendment Bill
will expand the geographical area of the harbor covered by the
existing Protection of the Harbor Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
"The presumption against reclamation will apply not only to the
central harbor as defined in the existing ordinance but also the
entire Victoria Harbor if the bill is enacted," the spokesman
explained.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government had clearly acknowledged the
importance of preserving and protecting the harbor as evidenced
under the reclamation proposed for the southeast Kowloon
development.
</P>
<P>
"The chief executive's policy address also reiterates that it
deserves our efforts to protect our harbor and make it more
beautiful and attractive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the Town Planning Board has recognized the
importance of protecting and preserving the harbor and has
formulated its "Vision and Goals for the Harbor," which is focused
on making the Victoria Harbor attractive, vibrant, accessible and
symbolic of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The amendment bill will be gazetted on October 22 before
introduction into the Legislative Council on November 3.

<HEADLINE> IMF Satisfied with Thai Economic Performance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is satisfied with Thailand's policies to tackle the economic
problems, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said
here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with an IMF representative, Supachai
said that the IMF Board of Directors had expressed satisfaction
over Thailand's Eighth Letter of Intent, which reported the
country's progress in implementing economic reform programs,
including those concerning resolutions to non-performing loans
(NPLs) in banks.
</P>
<P>
NPLs reached about 2.65 trillion baht (67.9 billion U.S.
dollars), accounting for about 47 percent of total outstanding
loans in the Thai banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said he discussed with Soko Ichi, the IMF
representative, on definitions and rules that might hinder the
country's NPL resolution process and agreed that the definitive
rules should be eased to comply with the real situation of the
country's economy and reflect realistic outlook and prospect.
</P>
<P>
Thailand adopted a stricter definition on NPLs after the
financial crisis in mid-1997 at the request of the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Ichi, who visited Thailand to review progress of the Thai
government's economic measures, cautioned that the eased measures
should be under the government's control so that they would not
lead to any financial disciplinary distortion, but facilitate and
speed up the debt restructuring process and the overall economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Friday, Director of the IMF's Regional Office for
Asia and the Pacific Kunio Saito forecast that the Thai economy is
likely to grow by four percent this year and even at a faster rate
next year.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman Blames Taiwan for Stymying Mainland's Earthquake Rescue Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese spokesman today said
that nobody can cut the ties of flesh and blood linking the
compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and no matter
what the Taiwan authorities do, the mainland will continue to
offer all possible aid for earthquake relief.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman with the Taiwan Work Office of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee and the Taiwan Affairs Office of
the State Council blamed some people in Taiwan for stymying
mainland rescuers and materials from entering the island which was
rocked by a strong earthquake on September 21.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at a time when both sides of the
Straits should join efforts for earthquake rescue, certain people
in Taiwan have continued to take a hostile attitude towards the
mainland and ignored the mainland's disaster relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
He said that immediately after the island was hit by the
earthquake on September 21, Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed sympathy to the Taiwan compatriots and the willingness
to offer any help needed.
</P>
<P>
The mainland has provided 300,000 U.S. dollars to Taiwan and
formed teams consisting of first-rate seismologists, medical
experts and hundreds of other rescuers, who are ready to head for
the island as soon as they are called.
</P>
<P>
The mainland-based Association for Relations Across the Strait
has also sent a message to the Taiwan-based Strait Exchange
Foundation expressing its willingness to offer help.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman said, some people in Taiwan have done
all they can to try to weaken the feelings of kinship between the
people across the Straits.
</P>
<P>
They have even distorted the facts by creating rumors to
mislead public opinion, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we have always adopted an active attitude towards
international disaster relief operations and given the green light
to any flights that carried materials and personnel to Taiwan via
Chinese airspace."
</P>
<P>
He said that "we have shown great restraint in not responding
to the destructive activities of certain people in Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He said that mainland's rescuers and materials are all ready
and can be sent to Taiwan immediately if the Taiwan authorities
agree.
</P>
<P>
He said that certain people with ulterior motives in Taiwan
should focus their energy on disaster relief and give up the
attempts to challenge the mainland's sincerity, which are indeed a
futile way to dodge Taiwan people's criticism of the Taiwan
Authorities' poor performance in the rescue operations.

<HEADLINE> Safe Passage Not to Open Sunday: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The southern safe passage will not
be opened Sunday as originally scheduled due to technical
problems, said Undersecretary of State for Palestinian Civil
Affairs Hisham Abu Zeidi Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has not received the magnetic cards needed
when Palestinians and foreign visitors want to travel through the
safe passage, said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
He added that there remained differences over the operating of
the joint Palestinian-Israeli office in charge of supervising the
use of the passage, and representatives of the two sides would
meet Saturday evening in search of a solution.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Civil Affairs Jamil Tarif had announced
last week that the safe passage connecting Gaza Strip to the West
Bank city of Hebron might be opened Sunday as required by the
Sharm Al Sheikh memorandum signed in September.
</P>
<P>
The safe passage, which leads across Israel from the northern
tip of the Gaza Strip, on the Mediterranean coast, to the southern
part of the West Bank consists of two routes. Individuals will be
allowed to travel from the West Bank village of Tarkoumiya to the
Erez Crossing in Gaza while the passage of goods will be allowed
to take the Karni-Tarkoumiya route.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian citizens are filing applications for cards to use
the safe passage.

<HEADLINE> UN Official on International Agricultural High-Tech Exchange and Cooperation </HEADLINE>

<P>
YANTAI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Technology exchange and transfer
with foreign countries will become an important means to
strengthen China's agriculture and build up the competitiveness of
China's farming products in the global market, said Adrianus Mooy,
Under-Secretary General of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"It will be very effective to update China with the latest
developments in agriculture and its related technology growth,
which will in turn benefit China's agriculture," Mooy said in an
interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Mooy, also Executive Secretary of the United Nations Economic
and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), said that
China needs to focus on developing new and advanced technology in
storing, freezing, and processing fruits and vegetables, which
will be the best way to bring global market attention to China's
farm products.
</P>
<P>
He said that lack of advanced technology and know-how has
created the biggest hurdle to the growth of agriculture sectors in
developing countries, including China.
</P>
<P>
"For example, China's Shandong province is a giant fruit
producer, but its customers are too far away in the west," the
official said, adding that inadequate storage facilities and
technology had encumbered their access to the global market.
</P>
<P>
Historically, even a mediocre harvest can mean disaster to
producers without comprehensive facilities and methods to keep
their products fresh with tasty, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mooy said that developing countries should make efforts to
introduce high technology from their developed counterparts, with
priority given to the use of medium-level technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are three levels in technology development
in the world, with developing countries possessing the lowest-
level and developed countries occupying the middle and highest
levels. Mid-level technology is out of use in developed countries,
but still advanced to developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should adopt mid-level technology and
adapt it to the development of the agriculture sectors in the
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that encouraging more inflow of foreign
investment into the agriculture sector will be another channel for
acquiring high and new technology from foreign, stronger players
in the global framing products market.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should open wider to woo more foreign
capital and technology to the agriculture field. That will
dramatically shorten their stride with developed countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mooy also called for more exchange and cooperation among
developing countries and suggested that more international
workshops on farming technology upgrading and related issues be
held.

<HEADLINE> New Poll Confirms Low Support for Quebec Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A new poll has pegged support
for Quebec sovereignty at 27 percent, the Ottawa Citizen newspaper
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Citing the Ekos polling company, the report said 63 percent of
the 1,001 respondents preferred that Quebec stay with Canada.
</P>
<P>
The report didn't mention the attitude of the remaining 10
percent of the people responding to the poll, which was conducted
between September 10 and October 14.
</P>
<P>
Ekos' findings came after another polling firm Sondagem said in
September that 68.2 percent of the 1,014 Quebec respondents were
opposed to the idea of another referendum on separation.
</P>
<P>
During the last referendum in 1995, 49.4 percent of Quebecers
voted for sovereignty compared to 50.6 percent voting against
secession.

<HEADLINE> Record Number Take China's Annual Bar Exam (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- A record 182,000 Chinese
flocked to more than 6,000 classrooms in almost every corner of
the nation today to take this year's an annual bar exam.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Justice Gao Changli said here today during an
inspection of exam sites that the number of participants in the
1999 exam represented a dramatic increase of 28 percent over last
year, and stands as the record high since the test was introduced
in China in 1986.
</P>
<P>
"The popularity for the legal profession is heating up again,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Gao also visited the eldest of the test-takers, 76-year-old
Zhao Fengxiang, who is chairman of the board of a communications
company.
</P>
<P>
"I know that a man over 79 is not eligible for a certificate to
practice law, but I'm not going to be a lawyer," he told the
minister. "All I want is to improve my knowledge of the law and
check my understanding of it, because China has worked out many
new laws these years, a businessman needs to know them well."
</P>
<P>
Based on previous experience, only about 10 percent of the
examinees are expected to pass the exam. Liu Jing, a 45-year-old
security guard at Tiantan Hospital, has failed the test seven
times.
</P>
<P>
He told Gao that if he doesn't pass this time, he'll give the
exam a ninth and even a tenth try.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the participants were young people: 73 percent
were below the age of 30; those above age 50 accounted for five
percent.

<P>
Minister Gao said later in an interview that the ever-
increasing number of participants is due to four factors:
</P>
<P>
-- China has constructed a stable and enlightened political
environment, and great progress has been made in the quest for
democracy and rule of law;
</P>
<P>
-- The national campaign to enforce the constitutional
principle of the rule of law has enhanced the awareness of the law
of the general public;
</P>
<P>
-- The establishment of the market economic order and
pluralization of economic entities are spurring demand for legal
services; and
</P>
<P>
-- Lawyers are playing a more important role in society, and
the legal profession has become one of the most coveted among the
younger generation.
</P>
<P>
Gao Zongze, chairman of the All-China Lawyers Association,
emphasized the importance of the bar examination, which has been
open to all members of society.
</P>
<P>
"It has helped to draw the most talented people to the legal
profession and improve the general quality of attorneys," he said.
</P>
<P>
Before 1978, lawyers had been barred from practice for 22 years
in China. Thanks to the bar examinations, China has built a
contingent of 110,000 practicing attorneys and 9,000 law firms,
and some Chinese law firms have opened branch offices in Hong Kong
and foreign countries.

<HEADLINE> Vajpayee Committed T0 Economic Reforms, Anti-terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- In his first address to the
nation since he took over as Indian prime minister, Atal Bihari
Vajapayee pledged Saturday evening to speed up economic reforms
and to fight terrorism and corruption.
</P>
<P>
In the address broadcast on the national Doordarshan Television
and All India radio, Vajpayee said that in the coming days, his
government would propose to "evolve a program for achieving fiscal
rectitude by improved expenditure management, deep tax reforms and
a new mechanism for speedier restructuring and disinvestment of
public sector units".
</P>
<P>
He unveiled a five-point economic agenda aimed at fiscal
consolidation and economic reforms to push rural and
infrastructure development to fulfill the promise of safe drinking
water, primary education, health to all, rural roads and housing
to rural homeless.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to introduce new laws for financial sector
reforms to keep pace with the rest of the world and to promote
foreign direct investment by adopting suitable measures and
removing bottlenecks that lead to costly delays.
</P>
<P>
"The new century demands a new mindset," he said, adding that
within days, his government proposed to "introduce new laws for
financial sector reforms and promote investment including foreign
by adopting suitable measures and removing bottlenecks".
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the buoyant economy would create
tremendous employment opportunities, saying he was also confident
that the focus on education and health would prepare today's youth
for tomorrow's challenges.
</P>
<P>
"Starting today, our government has set itself the task of
implementing our agenda for a proud, prosperous India, it is my
solemn pledge to all of you that nothing shall prevent us from the
task of good governance," the prime minister told his countrymen.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that one of his government's immediate tasks
would be to firmly put down terrorism in which it would be guided
by the principle of "zero tolerance".
</P>
<P>
The same principle would guide it in dealing with corruption
that had bred contempt for the law.
</P>
<P>
He urged political parties to put acrimony and bitterness of
the last couple of months behind and get down to the task of
nation building. "There is not a moment to lose," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee asked the opposition to cooperate with his government,
saying the rule of the opposition was no less important than that
of a government.
</P>
<P>
"Constructive criticism is an essential input for good polities
and programs. Consensus on national issues is necessary for
effective action," said the Indian leader.

<HEADLINE> Environmentalists Urge Protection for Near-Extinction Antelope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists said here that
wealthy Westerners fond of wearing luxurious "Shahtoosh" shawls
made of Tibetan Antelope fur are the root cause of the rare animal
's near extinction.
</P>
<P>
Officials and experts attending an international workshop on
protecting Tibetan antelope which ended here Friday said that the
huge demand for Shahtoosh in industrialized countries has
triggered widespread hunting on the Qinghai-Tibet plateau, the
home of Tibetan antelope.
</P>
<P>
"The root cause of the poaching is that the process and trade
of Shahtoosh still exists in certain countries and regions, as
poachers, processors and traders can make huge profits stained
with the blood of Tibetan antelope," said Ma Fu, deputy-director
of the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
Suresh C. Sharma, an official with the Indian Environment and
Forestry Ministry, said a large number of Shahtoosh shawls were
manufactured in India and exported to Britain, the United States,
France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
He said that in addition to spreading information on the
protection of Tibetan antelope among his countrymen, it is
critical that environmental awareness be promoted among Westerners
in order to put an end to the demand for antelope products on the
international market.
</P>
<P>
An official with the Secretariat of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora
said that the demand for Shahtoosh is increasing, and more
industrialized countries and regions have recently joined in the
consumer rush, including Japan, Singapore and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He urged industrialized countries to launch publicity campaigns
to educate people about the incorrectness of wearing Shahtoosh
shawls.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan antelope is a rare animal which mainly lives in
China. Since the 1980s, illegal hunting and smuggling have sharply
decreased the population of the species, which is under top state
protection.
</P>
<P>
China has repeatedly launched crackdowns on poachers and
traders but cannot curb the trend, according to officials, who
called for emergency international cooperation in protecting the
animal that is on the verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is regarded as the first bold step taken by the
international community to coordinate efforts in the fight against
rampant poaching and smuggling. Attending the workshop were over
80 representatives and experts from seven countries and some
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
These countries have jointly issued the Xining Declaration on
the Conservation and Control of Trade in Tibetan Antelope.

countries have been urged to play a more meaningful role in
fighting against hunger and ensuring food security in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a rally celebrating the World Food Day in Lusaka on
Saturday, Gana Diagne, representative of Food and Agriculture
Organization of the United Nations (FAO), said the role youth play
in agricultural production for food security is of paramount
concern.
</P>
<P>
Youth make up about 17 percent of the total global population,
he said, adding that in developing countries, they often represent
an even larger percentage of the total number of people.
</P>
<P>
By 2015, the world youth population will reach about 1.4
billion, who could be mobilized to fight hunger and to achieve the
World Food Summit goal of reducing by half the more than 800
million hungry and chronically undernourished people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The challenge, which thus faces our generation, is to ensure
that our youth, be they in developed or developing countries, play
a more meaningful role in ensuring food security," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said 85 percent of young people live in developing countries
and more than half in rural areas. Lacking education and
employment opportunities in the countryside, many rural young
people have migrated to the cities. As a result, the rural areas
are being deprived of a future while urban areas are overflowing
with young people unprepared for the rigors of city life and the
requirements of urban employment.
</P>
<P>
There is a need to organize groups of young people, as part of
the community empowerment process, to enable them to obtain access
to extension and other support services provided by governments,
non-government organizations and the private sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same function, Zambia's Deputy Minister of
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Y.J. Ngulube said that the Zambian
government would make full use of the farmer training centers and
institutions throughout the country to train farmers including the
youth in various agricultural subjects.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is placing particular emphasis on crop
diversification, conservation farming and better farming practices
in order to fight for higher yields and better resource
management.
</P>
<P>
With the theme "Youth against hunger", World Food Day 1999
focuses attention on the one billion people aged between 15 and
24, who are an important force for ending hunger.

<HEADLINE> Civil Servants Support Central Authorities' Decision on Falun Gong (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Civil servants across the
country today expressed their support for the central authorities'
latest decision on civil servants practicing Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
The response came after the General Office of the State Council,
China's highest governing body, issued a recent circular to local
governments as well as departments under the State Council, asking
them to properly deal with civil servants who have practiced Falun
Gong.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Guoru, deputy chief of Jilin Provincial Archives, said
today that civil servants should be leaders in safeguarding the
Constitution and the image of administrative bodies.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary for civil servants to adhere to the laws of the
state and governmental disciplines, said Zhong Zhenming, who is
secretary of Jilin province's Dehui City Committee of the Chinese
Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Yang Huaipeng, an official of Changchun Municipal Bureau of
Press and Publications, said that the central authorities have
made it clear that people who have been fooled and practiced Falun
Gong will not face any penalty if they correct their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
But those who stick to the wrong stand and continue to practice
Falun Gong should be sternly dealt with in line with the spirit of
the circular, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jinlian, an official with Beijing Municipal Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said that
the public support the central authorities' measures taken to
handle the Falun Gong issue because Falun Gong has disturbed
social order and posed a threat to social stability.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to educate civil servants who have been
practitioners of Falun Gong and help them return to the correct
perspective, Zhang said, adding that prompt and proper
disciplinary actions should also be taken against those who
continue to believe in the practices.

Yao Jinheng, a former Falun Gong practitioner who works in the
Construction Bureau of Qingxian county in Hebei province, said
today that he used to be afraid of the possible negative impact
his previous mistake could have on his future career, though he
has broken away from Falun Gong after being educated.
</P>
<P>
"But now I am not afraid of that any more since I have read the
circular," Yao said, adding that he will redouble efforts in his
work so as to better serve society and the people.
</P>
<P>
Jiao Lianhe, deputy director of Shandong Provincial Department
of Personnel, said that the circular has a major bearing on
improving the quality of civil servants, who should uphold the
nature of science, keep away from pseudo-science and never take
part in illegal activities like Falun Gong.

<HEADLINE> China to Ban Styrofoam Food Containers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 16 (Xinhua) -- The production and use of
Styrofoam food containers will be banned within a year, according
to Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
Pan Beilei, deputy director of the State Administration of
Light Industry, said that the Styrofoam food containers have
caused serious "white pollution" in China and will be replaced by
substitute products made of paper and natural fibers.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China uses 10 billion disposable
food containers annually, and the Styrofoam boxes account for
nearly 80 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Pan said that China has gained a capacity of manufacturing
three billion paper-made containers a year, and is planning to
expand its production capacity of biodegradable and
environmentally-friendly food containers.
</P>
<P>
The country will also work out standards for disposable food
containers to promote them as a replacement for Styrofoam.

TAMPERE, Finland, October 16 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU)
leaders closed their two-day summit on Saturday, saying they had
seen "milestones" made in the Finnish city of Tampere.
</P>
<P>
Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen told reporters after the
summit that the leaders of 15 EU governments have agreed on far-
reaching "milestones" in a bid to set up a "freedom, security and
justice" area in the EU.
</P>
<P>
Lipponen, whose country currently holds the EU presidency, said
the EU leaders agreed on a common EU asylum and migration policy,
a genuine European area of justice, and an EU-wide fight against
crime, as well as stronger external action. The Tampere summit was
very constructive and successful, the Finnish leader said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lipponen, the "milestones" include ten fields of
judicial coordination and cooperation: partnership with countries
of origin, a common European asylum system, fair treatment of
third country nationals, management of migration flows, better
access to justice in Europe, mutual recognition of judicial
decisions, greater convergence in civil law, preventing crime at
the level of the Union, stepping up cooperation against crime, and
special action against money laundering.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders said EU presidency conclusions included the
areas of freedom, security and justice and should be based on the
principles of transparency and democratic control.
</P>
<P>
"We must develop an open dialogue with society on the aims and
principles of this area in order to strengthen acceptance and
support by citizens," the leaders added.

<P>
ABU DHABI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Obeid Bin Saif Al Nasir,
minister of petroleum and mineral resources of the Untied Arab
Emirates (UAE), Saturday predicted that oil prices might rise
further in winter due to the high demand.
</P>
<P>
"Higher demand in the peak winter months will lead to an
increase in prices," the minister told reporters after opening
the Arab Oil and Gas Exhibition in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that compliance with the output cuts is
still high and that producers are serious about abiding by the
agreement, which has reversed the price slump since last March.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of all producers to show production
discipline," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Nasir indicated that the recent fluctuations
in crude prices are normal as the oil market is sensitive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the output curbs will be sustained until next
March, when oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries meet in Vienna to discuss the oil market
situation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices to Rise Higher in Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 16 (Xinhua) -- Obeid Bin Saif Al Nasir,
minister of petroleum and mineral resources of the Untied Arab
Emirates (UAE), Saturday predicted that oil prices might rise
further in winter due to the high demand.
</P>
<P>
"Higher demand in the peak winter months will lead to an
increase in prices," the minister told reporters after opening
the Arab Oil and Gas Exhibition in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that compliance with the output cuts is
still high and that producers are serious about abiding by the
agreement, which has reversed the price slump since last March.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the interest of all producers to show production
discipline," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Nasir indicated that the recent fluctuations
in crude prices are normal as the oil market is sensitive.
</P>
<P>
He said that the output curbs will be sustained until next
March, when oil ministers of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries meet in Vienna to discuss the oil market
situation.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 companies from over 20 countries are
participating in the current Arab Oil and Gas Exhibition which
will last until next Tuesday.
