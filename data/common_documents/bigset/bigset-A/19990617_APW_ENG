<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A day earlier than expected, Houston first base  
coach Jose Cruz returned to the Astros on Thursday night after 
treatment for an irregular heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz left the team after its May 9 game against the Montreal  
Expos to begin treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling a lot better and I would feel even better if we  
could have won tonight,'' Cruz said following an 8-5 loss to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Larry Dierker, who collapsed in the dugout Sunday,  
remains hospitalized following brain surgery Tuesday. He will need 
at least four weeks to recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Larry and Mac out, I just felt I needed to get back,''  
Cruz said. ``I'm taking less medication now, so I knew it was time 
to return.''

<HEADLINE> Senators Back Select Industry Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate supporters of a $1.5 billion loan  
program for U.S. steel, oil and gas producers made changes Thursday 
to ensure that funding would not come from Social Security 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	With those agreements, the Senate was expected Friday to pass  
legislation creating the program, which is aimed at helping to tide 
over those industries until their prices recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, and other conservatives criticized the  
$270 million in taxpayer spending needed to back the new loans, 
saying the money would come directly from Social Security 
surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	To address that criticism, the bill's backers agreed late in the  
day to remove the measure's ``emergency'' designation. By doing so, 
they guaranteed that lawmakers would have to cut other programs 
before they could pay for the loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators also agreed to other changes aimed at removing politics  
from the loan-approval process and requiring private lenders to 
share in at least 15 percent of the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the loans would help domestic steel producers  
unable to compete with low-priced imports and U.S. oil and natural 
gas industries struggling because of sagging prices. Officials say 
the three industries have suffered tens of thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have had a very grave time in the steel industry,'' said  
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``You can't compete against a (foreign) 
seller that will sell at any price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loan program for small oil and gas firms was attached at the  
insistence of Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. Some of the steel loans 
would be available for iron producers as well. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised to let the  
House vote on the measure. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., its chief 
architect, urged colleagues to reject amendments, saying any 
changes would make it harder for Hastert to keep his commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1 billion in steel loans, with companies  
eligible to borrow up to $250 million at market interest rates. 
U.S. oil and gas producers and service companies would be able to 
borrow up to $10 million each from a $500 million fund. As part of 
the agreement, supporters dropped provisions setting minimum loan 
amounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan measure was the first of several steel-related bills to  
reach the Senate floor. The full Senate could consider as early as 
next week a bill that would establish comprehensive quotas on 
foreign steel shipments.

<HEADLINE> Y2K Test Spills Sewage in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A water reclamation plant malfunctioned  
during a Y2K test and spilled 4 million gallons of sewage into a 
San Fernando Valley park. 
</P>
<P>
	The sewage welled up out of a manhole near the plant in Van Nuys  
on Wednesday night and flowed about 100 yards into the park, said 
Linda Aparicio, a spokeswoman for the city Public Works Department 
</P>
<P>
	Crews worked to vacuum up the spill, but health officials  
recommended a portion of the park remain closed for two days as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
	The spill happened while the plant was testing a Year 2000  
scenario in which the power failed. The emergency generator kicked 
in as expected, but a gate failed to reopen, Ms. Aparicio said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our computers did not tell us that gate was closed,'' she  
said. ``No one knew that sewage was backing up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said it was unclear whether the problem was related to the  
test or was coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
	The sewage system was back in operation by Thursday morning.

<HEADLINE> Authorities: Lighter Caused Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLINGHAM, Wash. (AP) -- Two boys playing with a lighter  
unwittingly ignited a stream filled with leaking gasoline, touching 
off a gigantic fireball that killed them and a fisherman last week, 
police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 277,000 gallons of gasoline gushed from a leaking  
underground pipeline owned by Olympic Pipe Line Co. on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	It ran down Whatcom Creek, which runs through residential  
neighborhoods and the downtown of this northwest Washington city of 
60,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The fuel caused several explosions, sent a black cloud six miles  
into the air and touched off a fireball that raced down the stream 
for a mile and a half. 
</P>
<P>
	Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson said Thursday said the  
10-year-old boys who died were ``unwitting heroes'' because the 
leak was bound to lead to a fire anyway. ``We're fortunate it 
occurred'' before it reached downtown Bellingham, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found the lighter near where the two boys had been  
playing, and witnesses and one of the boys also said the lighter 
sparked the fireball. The boy later died from burns. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the leak remained under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Wizards Welcome New Coach Gar Heard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Washington Wizards general manager Wes Unseld  
went with experience and leadership and ignored popularity in 
tapping Gar Heard as the team's coach. 
</P>
<P>
	The 51-year-old Heard was introduced Wednesday as the new coach  
of the struggling franchise, which was 18-32 last season and failed 
to make the playoffs for the second consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
	Heard reportedly agreed to a three-year contract worth between  
$1.5 million and $2 million a year. Pollin would not comment on 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The one interview I had with Gar Heard blew me away,'' owner  
Abe Pollin said. ``This is a man with great inner strength.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought this guy fit the bill best of all,'' Unseld said.  
</P>
<P>
	Asked about some of the ``bigger'' names the team reportedly had  
on its wish list -- former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, just 
hired by the Los Angeles Lakers, and former Detroit Pistons guard 
Isiah Thomas -- Unseld said money was not an issue. He said the team 
picked the coach it thought could win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been very easy for me to pick one of these  
high-profile guys and pay them whatever they wanted,'' Unseld said. 
But he said a coach has to be picked based on the team's needs and 
``not a popularity contest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heard replaces Jim Brovelli, who was hired as interim coach  
April 5 after Bernie Bickerstaff was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	An assistant with the Detroit Pistons last season, Heard said  
his own career as a player with Seattle, Chicago, Buffalo and 
Phoenix gave him an advantage in working and talking with players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not asking them to do things they're not capable of  
doing,'' Heard said. ``The guys have to believe in themselves, 
believe they can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heard was interim coach of the Dallas Mavericks in 1993,  
finishing with a 9-44 record. This time around, Heard said, he'll 
be putting his own philosophy into action rather than just filling 
in. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm starting from scratch,'' Heard said. ``I think we have the  
nucleus here to have a very good team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heard said he wants to focus on defense and rebounding, but his  
first priority is putting together a coaching staff and preparing 
for the draft. Heard also indicated he would like to re-sign free 
agent guard Mitch Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Tim Legler, who played for Heard in Dallas, said the new  
coach will help the team learn to play unselfishly and to 
communicate -- ``something the team desperately needs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel we have a lot of talent,'' Legler said, ``but the  
cohesion wasn't on the court last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team met with 15 candidates before creating a short list of  
four names. Heard was first interviewed three weeks ago in 
Baltimore and met last week with Pollin in Chicago. They talked for 
2 1/2 hours, mostly about Heard's coaching philosophy.

<HEADLINE> HaperCollins Buys Hearst Publishers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is buying the book  
publishing operations of Hearst Corp., consisting of William Morrow 
&AMP; Co. and Avon Books, for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale announced today, which had been rumored for some time,  
further solidifies the position of News Corp.'s HarperCollins, 
which has spent the last two years overcoming a severe profit 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	HarperCollins president and CEO Jane Friedman, who has received  
kudos for the turnaround, said the acquisition of Morrow and Avon 
will create ``a powerhouse in the industry with a diverse and 
impressive publishing program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avon and Morrow had operated together as the book publishing  
division of Hearst Corp., a major privately held media company with 
interests in television, newspapers, radio and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Avon and Morrow publish some 1,000 books each year and  
have a combined back catalog of nearly 6,000 titles. Morrow's 
authors include Sidney Sheldon, Beverly Cleary and Cokie Roberts, 
while Avon publishes Faye Kellerman, Johanna Lindsey and Elizabeth 
Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
	Several big publishers have merged in recent years, as companies  
seek to cut costs and gain market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG bought  
the biggest U.S. book publisher, Random House, from Advance 
Publications, for a price estimated by analysts at between $1.1 
billion and $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelsmann also bought Bantam Books in 1977 and owns Doubleday,  
Dell-Delacorte and Broadway Books. Also last year, Viacom Inc. sold 
the educational, professional and reference divisions of Simon &AMP; 
Schuster to the British media group Pearson for $4.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Greenpeace Protests in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Protesters from the environmental group  
Greenpeace rallied in front of the German Embassy on Thursday 
demanding that Germany refuse to finance new nuclear reactors in 
Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	The white-clad demonstrators held aloft a large banner that  
read, ``Save Energy! Don't build new Chernobyls!'' and distributed 
light bulbs they described as energy-saving. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second Greenpeace demonstration in as many days in  
Ukraine. On Wednesday, about a dozen Greenpeace activists blocked a 
road leading to the Rivne nuclear plant in western Ukraine with 
buses and chained themselves to the vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	The protests are linked to the upcoming weekend summit of the  
world's seven largest industrialized countries and Russia in 
Cologne, Germany, and debates in Germany about aid for Ukraine from 
those G-8 countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy-hungry and financially struggling Ukraine has been  
demanding G-8 loans to compensate for the planned closure of the 
Chernobyl nuclear plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident 
in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's government decided he  
should seek to block the loans when he chairs the summit. Schroeder 
has committed Germany to phase out its own nuclear plants, and many 
lawmakers in his coalition oppose nuclear power on principle. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenpeace said in a statement that Schroeder may ignore the  
votes of his own coalition and instead fulfill a 1995 promise by 
the industrialized nations to supply aid to Ukraine to help it 
close Chernobyl. The former Soviet republic pledged to shut down 
the plant by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ukrainian officials later said they could not close the  
plant before receiving aid to complete new reactors at the Rivne 
and Khmelnitsky plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Anti-nuclear groups such as Greenpeace and environmental  
organizations in Ukraine say the West should finance 
energy-efficient systems rather than new nuclear reactors. 
Greenpeace campaigner Jan Rispens said his group proposes building 
a steam gas power station in Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Energy-efficient technologies are what Western countries  
should finance, not the nightmare technology of the past,'' Rispens 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two reactors, whose construction was halted after the 1991  
Soviet collapse, are more than 80 percent ready and are of a more 
modern type than the one that exploded at Chernobyl. The cost of 
completing them has been estimated at $1.2 billion.

<HEADLINE> PacifiCorp Shareholders OK Takeover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Shareholders of PacifiCorp have approved  
what would be the first foreign purchase of an American utility -- a 
$7.9 billion takeover by ScottishPower. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the shareholders' vote were released Thursday at  
the company's annual meeting, just two days after ScottishPower 
shareholders approved the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced in December, would form one of the world's  
largest power suppliers, with 7 million customers and 23,500 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	PacifiCorp serves 1.5 million customers in six Western states.  
It also serves 560,000 customers in the Australian states of 
Victoria and New South Wales. 
</P>
<P>
	The takeover also cleared a major hurdle Wednesday when the  
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission gave its approval. Regulators 
in the United Kingdom and Australia have already signed off on the 
merger. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulatory agencies must give the final go-ahead.  
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Public Utility Commission has recommended against the  
takeover. ScottishPower says the takeover would cut corporate costs 
by $10 million a year, and the Oregon regulators say consumers 
should share those benefits.

	ASCOT, England (AP) -- It may be the sport of kings, but it's  
Queen Elizabeth II who's in the winner's circle.

buoyed by weaker-than-expected inflation data in the United States

</P>
<P>
	Sentiment throughout the region also was lifted by sharp gains  
in Asia's biggest market, Tokyo, where the key 225-issue Nikkei

<HEADLINE> Belgian Scare Hurts Coke Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With struggling foreign economies already hurting  
sales and its bottom line, Coca-Cola had enough headaches overseas 
before its soft drinks were linked to the hospitalization of dozens 
of people in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Now some Belgians say they're kicking their Coke habits for  
good. And publicity surrounding the scare threatens to tarnish the 
soft-drink giant's image worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say they don't expect permanent damage to Coke's  
image or its finances, largely because of the company's worldwide 
popularity and reputation for quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a brand with decades of good will behind it,'' said  
John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``It's not an 
accident that Coke sells so much of its product in these countries. 
It sells its product because it's been there a long time and people 
like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Belgium and France lifted bans on the sale of some of  
Coke's products. But sales of Coke, Sprite and Fanta remained 
banned in Belgium, pending further investigation into what caused 
the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke chairman M. Douglas Ivester expressed the company's regrets  
to European customers Wednesday in his first public statement about 
the scare. He said the company ``will not rest'' until consumers 
are assured of Coke's quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 113 years our success has been based on the trust that  
consumers have in that quality,'' Ivester said. ``That trust is 
sacred to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas expansion has been key to Coke's growth over the last  
decade. Coke, with brands including Diet Coke, Sprite, Bonaqua and 
Minute Maid fruit juices, now controls half the world's market for 
carbonated soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing that growth has been tough lately. Economic turmoil  
in Asia, Russia and parts of Latin America has hurt sales and 
Coke's earnings. Meanwhile, Coke's plans to expand by buying two 
foreign competitors have been bogged down by antitrust challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	These were Coke's major worries overseas before Belgian  
officials banned Coke products Monday after dozens of youths were 
hospitalized for vomiting, stomach pains and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg has also banned all Coke products, and other European  
nations have taken similar precautions. France ordered the 
withdrawal of all canned Coke products. And Spain on Wednesday 
froze a shipment of 8,000 bottles of Belgian-produced Coke and 
other Coca-Cola brands in the northern province of Zamora for fear 
of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke scrambled to get to the bottom of the health scare. It  
traced bad-tasting bottled drinks to a plant in Antwerp, Belgium, 
where the carbon dioxide used to inject fizz into drinks was 
substandard. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an offensive odor on some cans was traced to a plant in  
Dunkirk, France. The odor was caused by a fungicide on wooden 
pallets used to transport cans to Belgium, which accounts for fewer 
than 1 percent of Coke's sales worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Belgium said today it would reimburse the medical  
costs of anyone who could prove they had fallen ill through 
drinking its products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government also said today it is dropping its  
nationwide ban on some Coca-Cola soft drinks produced by Coca-Cola, 
including Nestea, Aquarius and Minute Maid fruit juices. But it 
ordered Coke, Fanta and Sprite to remain off shelves pending 
further investigation into what caused dozens of Coke drinkers to 
fall ill. 
</P>
<P>
	There was better news for Coke from Paris, where the government  
announced it was relaxing a ban on canned Coca Cola products to 
allow sales to resume from one of two Coke's French plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Paris, French President Jacques Chirac said he will  
propose creating an international council to monitor food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has become especially critical following two scandals  
in Belgium -- one involving Coca-Cola and the other dioxin-infected 
meat, eggs and dairy products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our people are increasingly concerned, worried,'' Chirac said  
at a joint news conference with President Clinton in advance of a 
meeting Friday in Germany of leaders of the world's leading 
industrial nations and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke spokesman Rob Baskin said the company is confident the  
problems have been solved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we're close to satisfying their needs for  
assurance,'' Baskin said. ``And we're hopeful they will allow us to 
resume distribution of our products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke should largely be able to wi back customers frightened by  
the health scare, said Ann Gurkin, an analyst for Davenport and 
Company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it impacting consumption,'' she said. ``I think it  
was two unusual events that hit at the same time. I think the 
company will do a great job at explaining what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But workers in Brussels said Wednesday they're not sure they'll  
continue drinking Coke even if Belgium lifts the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I've stopped drinking it, and I don't think I will start  
again,'' said Natalie Sinnodt, 23, a social worker. ``I should have 
stopped anyway for diet reasons, this makes it easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign markets account for 70 percent of Coke's worldwide case  
volume, an important industry indicator measuring sales of units of 
24 eight-ounce servings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has blamed slumping sales in turbulent foreign  
markets for recent losses. Profits fell 13 percent in the first 
quarter of 1999 and 14 percent for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to kickstart its foreign expansion, Coke has been trying  
to reach a $1 billion-plus deal to buy soft-drink brands owned by 
Cadbury Schweppes -- including Dr Pepper and Canada Dry -- outside 
the United States. But the deal has run afoul of regulators in 
Australia and several European countries who fear it would 
discourage competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Coke signed a $758 million deal to buy the brand  
Orangina from a French company after France had stalled the deal 
for 18 months.

<HEADLINE> El Duque Sued for More Child Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The former wife of New York Yankees pitcher Orlando  
``El Duque'' Hernandez is suing him for an increase in 
child-support payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Norma Manso, wants a minimum of $9,500 a month -- up from the  
current $2,000 -- and has filed a lawsuit asking the payments be 
retroactive to October, when she arrived from Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a divorce decree made in Cuba two years ago,  
Hernandez agreed to pay 60 pesos a month for both of his two 
daughters, the equivalent of $3. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Hernandez has become a millionaire, earning at least  
$1.85 million a year, according to the suit filed June 8. 
</P>
<P>
	El Duque, who defected from Cuba on a raft in December 1997,  
helped the Yankees win the World Series last year. He requested 
that his mother, ex-wife and daughters come to the United States to 
attend a ticker tape parade after the World Series victory. 
</P>
<P>
	He bought a $260,000 home in Miami for Manso and their two  
daughters, Yahumara, 9, and Stheffi, 3. He also bought his ex-wife 
a car worth about $20,000, pays for the private school tuition of 
his children, and covers their health and dental insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the documents filed, Hernandez had increased his  
monthly child support payment to $2,000 from $1,000 in January at 
his ex-wife's request but allegedly threatened to cut off payments 
and evict Manso and the children if she tried to obtain more money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Orlando has always taken care of the girls, but the money he  
gives me to support the girls isn't enough to live in this 
country,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Court documents state the family's expenses are $7,760 a month  
and they estimate vacation costs at $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents also state that Manso, a homemaker, doesn't speak  
English, is not qualified to obtain employment and has no income. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been able to find employment in this country, first  
because I don't have anyone to care for the girls, and second, 
because I don't know the language,'' she said. ``That's why we have 
to depend on him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manso's attorney, Robert Spiegelman, declined to comment to The  
Miami Herald for a report Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	So did Joe Cubas, Hernandez's agent.  
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez could not be reached for comment.

<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets rallied Thursday,  
buoyed by weaker-than-expected inflation data in the United States 
and the overnight surge in U.S. share prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Sentiment throughout the region also was lifted by sharp gains

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Associate May Be Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO RANCHO, N.M. (AP) -- Prosecutors intend to seek an indictment  
against an associate of Dr. Jack Kevorkian who allegedly helped a 
woman suffering from multiple sclerosis commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury will meet next month to consider assisted suicide  
charges against Dr. Georges Reding, a 74-year-old psychiatrist from 
Michigan's Kalamazoo County. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plans right now are to take it to a grand jury,'' District  
Attorney Mike Runnels said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Assisted suicide is a felony in New Mexico under a 1963 law and  
is punishable by 18 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially thought Donna Brennan, 54, of Rio Rancho,  
N.M., died of natural causes Aug. 30. But an autopsy showed Brennan 
was given a lethal dose of a sedative sometimes used on animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone and credit card records, along with a witness, place  
Reding at Brennan's house around the time of her death. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for Reding, Michael Schwartz, said Brennan had  
contacted the psychiatrist for counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence and no admission that Dr. Reding helped  
end her life,'' Schwartz told the Detroit News. ``It would be a 
foolish waste of time to seek an indictment of Georges Reding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Reding was charged in connection with three  
assisted-suicide deaths in Oakland County, Mich. Kevorkian also was 
charged. A prosecutor later dropped all the charges, saying there 
was insufficient evidence to win in court. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than two years later, Reding and Kevorkian were arrested on  
charges they resisted arrested and interfered with police while 
dropping a body off at a Royal Oak, Mich., hospital. Reding was 
acquitted; Kevorkian was convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian remains in jail since his conviction in April on a  
second-degree murder charge.

<HEADLINE> S.Williams Misses Wimbledon With Flu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WIMBLEDON, England (AP) -- Serena Williams has the flu and will  
miss Wimbledon. And sister Venus is also fighting the bug. 
</P>
<P>
	Serena's sudden withdrawal Thursday ended the possibility of a  
fourth-round showdown between the sisters and left Wimbledon -- 
which begins Monday -- without one of its marquee players. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has a terrible case of the flu,'' her father, Richard  
Williams, told the WTA Tour. ``I took her to the doctor this 
morning and he told her it was best to rest and take it easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serena wanted to go to Wimbledon and give it a try ... but the  
doctor said again it was better if she rested. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-year-old player, seeded No. 10, was replaced by Russia's  
Anna Kournikova, who was the highest ranked player without a spot 
in the top 16. Kournikova will take Williams' place in the draw as 
the 17th-seeded player. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago it was Kournikova -- another teen-age tennis starlet --  
who withdrew on the eve of the tournament with a sprained thumb. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Williams described No. 6-seeded Venus -- who turned 19 on  
Thursday -- as feeling ``a little sluggish'' but optimistic of being 
at full strength for the two-week grass-court classic. 
</P>
<P>
	WTA Tour officials were startled by the withdrawal after getting  
a statement from Wimbledon on Thursday, saying only that Williams 
was ill and would not play. 
</P>
<P>
	Reached later by the WTA Tour, Williams said both daughters had  
been fighting the flu but Serena's case was worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been sick for the last two or three days, but last night  
she had a bad fever and the doctor believes it will go on for at 
least a week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venus is a little sluggish because they hang out a lot  
together, but we're hoping she'll be all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't expect Serena to travel to England.  
</P>
<P>
	The Williams sisters also pulled out of doubles, where they were  
seeded No. 4. The sisters always play doubles together and Venus 
has been outspoken about not breaking up the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the last thing we needed, but we'll deal with it,''  
Wimbledon referee Alan Mills said. ``We've done it before.''

<HEADLINE> Nation's Tallest Lighthouse Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- Propped up on rollers in a technique  
borrowed from the ancients, the historic, 208-foot Cape Hatteras 
Lighthouse began its inch-by-inch journey to a safer spot inland 
Thursday, away from the crashing breakers of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	With a nudge from seven hydraulic jacks, the nation's tallest  
lighthouse silently moved 5 inches on the first push shortly after 
3 p.m. Cheers went up from those who gathered in a steady rain to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It rolled a lot easier than we thought,'' said Jerry Matyiko  
of Expert House Movers of Virginia Beach, Va., a project 
subcontractor. The contractors moved it 10 feet, 4 inches on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Threatened with destruction by the encroaching sea, the beloved,  
white-and-black barber-pole-striped landmark is being moved 2,900 
feet inland, a trip that will take four to six weeks at a pace of 
20 to 70 feet a day. The 4,800-ton brick tower is set to reopen 
next Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major milestone in this project to preserve a piece  
of America's heritage,'' said Bob Reynolds, superintendent of Cape 
Hatteras National Seashore. ``For many people, lighthouses in 
general and this lighthouse in particular is a symbol of people's 
romance with the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse once guided ships in the treacherous waters off  
Cape Hatteras, known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. But with the 
advent of electronic and satellite navigation, the beacon is seldom 
used. In preparation for the move, the light was extinguished March 
1 for the first time since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the move began, Terry Jennette Ponton of Philadelphia,  
granddaughter of the lighthouse's last full-time keeper, was 
permitted by National Park Service rangers to take a look around. 
She took a piece of foundation granite and some brick as mementos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's not the last time, but it's the last time in this  
place. It was bittersweet,'' she said. ``She's a graceful lady and 
she needs to be in a safe place. I wish her well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service is spending $10 million to move the lighthouse  
because it sits just 150 feet from the Atlantic, and the waves are 
getting closer all the time. When it was built, it was 1,600 feet 
away from the surf. It is moving 2,900 linear feet, but because of 
the curving shoreline, it will once more be 1,600 feet from the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was bitterly contested by many on Hatteras Island and  
elsewhere who feared the lighthouse would fall or become seriously 
cracked. They wanted the Park Service to instead construct jetties 
to catch sand and build up the beach in front of the lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dare County Board of Commissioners sued to try to stop the  
move, but a judge refused to stand in the way. A citizens 
opposition group, Save Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Committee, gave up 
about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a tragedy for the state,'' said chairman Hugh  
Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	The move employs both high technology and brute force.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, workers cut the lighthouse away from its  
foundation and raised it on hydraulic jacks onto beams and rollers. 
The lighthouse will move an average of only an inch or two a 
minute, with frequent stops for adjustments. Every 100 feet or so, 
the rollers the lighthouse has passed over will be picked up and 
put in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of sensors attached to the structure will measure tilt,  
expansion, temperature and vibration. Should a sensor detect a 
problem, all movement will halt. 
</P>
<P>
	The main contractor, International Chimney Corp. of Buffalo,  
N.Y., said it has moved lighthouses and other large structures 
without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	Project manager Joe Jakubik said the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is  
extremely well-constructed. During much of the move, he said, he 
will be underneath it, making sure there are no problems. ``That's 
how confident I am'' in its stability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakubic said the lighthouse will move so slowly that ``you  
actually have to line up the lighthouse with an object in the 
foreground to know it's moving.'' The occasional screech of the 
rollers also will signal movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The public can watch it happen on the Internet at witntv.com,  
courtesy of WITN-TV's ``lighthouse cam,'' which produces an image 
every two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin McCave, 43, of Buxton, one of the opponents of the move,  
rode his bicycle to the lighthouse to watch. ``I don't believe the 
lighthouse was meant to stand forever,'' he said. ``Once it moves, 
a lot of the history is gone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, McCave and his girlfriend are selling T-shirts  
commemorating the move. The price: $10.

<HEADLINE> Simplot Retiring From Micron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- J.R. Simplot, the billionaire who bankrolled  
what now is Idaho's largest employer, announced he will retire from 
computer chip maker Micron Technology Inc.'s board of directors on 
July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-year-old Simplot, who remains active and continued to  
snow ski until last winter, also said he would step down from the 
board of directors of personal computer maker Micron Electronics 
Inc. on the same day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I can say that I have put in my time,'' Simplot said  
Wednesday in a statement issued by Micron Technology. ``I have 
nothing but support for the company and its management. It 
certainly has been a pleasure to represent the shareholders and 
watch the company grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Micron and its subsidiaries, with 11,000 of their 15,000  
employees in Idaho, manufacture semiconductors, graphics 
accelerators, personal computer systems and radio frequency 
identification products. 
</P>
<P>
	Simplot was 71 in 1980 when he invested $1 million with twins  
Ward and Joe Parkinson on a 40-percent share of what would become 
Micron Technology. He later provided $20 million more to help 
Micron build its first chip fabrication plant and weather downturns 
in the cyclical computer market. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are grateful to Mr. Simplot for his many years of devoted  
service and support for this organization,'' Steve Appleton, Micron 
Technology's chairman and chief executive officer, said. ``He has 
provided valuable insight over the years and will be missed by all. 
We wish him well in his retirement from service with the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simplot's stake in Micron is down to less than 12 percent from  
more than 20 percent in 1995. And he said in an interview earlier 
this year with The Associated Press that he wanted to retire from 
the company's board after visiting chip plants in Italy and 
Singapore that Micron bought from Texas Instruments last fall.

<HEADLINE> American Indians Back Gamble Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After two years of friction, advocates of  
Indian gambling are praising a federal commission as it prepares to 
release its findings on gambling in America. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Gambling Impact Study Commission has had a rocky  
relationship with the National Indian Gaming Association. Yet the 
association offered advance praise for the commission's report on 
gambling in America, due out Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to acknowledge that (the commission) did recognize  
sovereignty'' and gambling's ``important role in healing our 
communities that have been hemorrhaging for decades,'' said Rick 
Hill, chairman of the Indian gambling association. 
</P>
<P>
	In anticipation of the report, the association has run  
advertisements in Capitol Hill periodicals this week calling Indian 
gambling ``moderate, responsible, regulated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal leaders who joined Hill at a press conference Thursday  
said they are most concerned with a controversial sentence in the 
report urging governments to consider a moratorium on more lottery 
games, casinos and slot machines. Though the word ``moratorium'' 
divided the commission, even pro-gambling commissioners agreed to 
call for ``a pause'' in the proliferation of gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	But Anthony Pico, chairman of the Viejas Band of Kumeyaay  
Indians in California, said even a pause would be ``devastating'' 
to Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Native Americans have had a pause on economic development for  
the last 150 years,'' he said, ``thereby putting us in a situation 
of extreme poverty and all the suffering that goes with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress created the commission to study the explosive growth of  
legal gambling in America. Nowhere has that growth been more 
dramatic than on Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-six states have reached compacts with Indian tribes  
allowing some form of gambling on their land, Hill said. The 
commission's report estimates there are 260 casinos or Bingo halls 
now operating on Indian reservations, compared with 70 in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-member commission received testimony from about 100  
tribal representatives and visited the Foxwoods Indian casino in 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet most tribes that run casinos refused to fill out a  
commission survey, saying the information was private. After 
briefly discussing issuing subpoenas to obtain the information, the 
commission considered calling for creation of a new panel, ``with 
full subpoena power,'' to look at Indian gambling. The idea was 
discarded after commission member Robert Loescher, an American 
Indian, objected to singling out tribal casinos. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some ups and downs'' with the commission, Hill said,  
``but I think the report is more of an up than a down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission report commission recommends that:  
</P>
<P>
	--Tribes use some gambling revenue as ``seed money'' to diversify  
their economies. 
</P>
<P>
	--Congress and the president strengthen federal laws to ensure  
regulatory oversight of tribal gambling finances. 
</P>
<P>
	--An ``independent, impartial decision-maker'' be brought in when  
states and Indian tribes deadlock over new casinos. Tribal leaders 
say they have long sought appointment of mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also says the panel received no evidence ``suggesting  
any viable approach to economic development across the broad 
spectrum of Indian country, in the absence of gaming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That has been a core argument for Indian gambling advocates.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the only thing that has worked for us,'' Hill said.

<HEADLINE> Silver Charm's Road to Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *AP Sports Writes    	
</P>
<P>
	The big, dappled gray horse caught the eye ... and the heart.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was such a noble horse,'' trainer Bob Baffert said. ``His  
presence was always felt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One November morning in 1997 during Breeders' Cup week at  
Hollywood Park, Baffert took Silver Charm to the track for a 
gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	He had not raced since his dramatic Triple Crown, in which he  
won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness and finished second in the 
Belmont Stakes, and he was not going to race in the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm quickly became the center of attention that  
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of his running style, his victories were always exciting  
-- his win in the 1998 Dubai World Cup was especially memorable -- 
and so were many of his defeats. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Saturday at Churchill Downs, Silver Charm started in the  
Stephen Foster Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
	When the 5-year-old horse turned for home, Baffert knew it was  
over. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had nothing,'' Baffert said. ``I thought, `Man, this is not  
our horse.''' He finished fourth, soundly beaten by Victory Gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	Owner Bob Lewis agreed with Baffert, and so after a fourth  
straight loss, Silver Charm was retired to breeding. 
</P>
<P>
	A ton of talent remains in Baffert's barn, despite a  
disappointing Triple Crown series this spring, but Silver Charm's 
retirement leaves a void. 
</P>
<P>
	Silver Charm was the trainer's pet.  
</P>
<P>
	``When I got to the barn, he's the first one I'd go to, and I'd  
give him his carrot,'' Baffert said. ``People would show up and ask 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horse racing, however, is not a yesterday sport. Anyone look who  
looks backward instead of ahead is in the wrong game. 
</P>
<P>
	So Baffert is busy getting some of his stars ready to race  
again. As he does, in the back of his mind is next year and the 
Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``I probably have 30 2-year-olds,'' Baffert said. ``Bob Lewis  
has two real good ones. One cost $1.8 million and the other 
$950,000 and are yet to start. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's 2-year-old filly, Chilukki, unbeaten in two starts and  
a winner over colts in one of them, will race in the Debutante on 
June 26 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	The trainer's other Derby-Preakness winner (1998), Real Quiet,  
left Churchill Downs on Wednesday for California and his next start 
June 27 in the Hollywood Gold Cup. In his last two races, the 
4-year-old colt won the Pimlico Special, then the Massachusetts 
Handicap at Suffolk Down. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, the 3-year-old filly who won 11 of 12 starts  
before finishing seventh in her debut against males in the Belmont 
Stakes, is set to start in the Monmouth Oaks on July 10 at Monmouth 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``She came out of the Belmont fine,'' Baffert said, then joked,  
``I'm going to put her back in cupcake races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, the filly who finished a good fifth in the  
Derby and was eased in the Preakness, is expected to race Sunday in 
the Princess at Hollywood Park. It was reported immediately after 
the Preakness that the filly had a breathing problem, but Baffert 
said, ``She just lost interest. She's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the colts General Challenge and Prime Timber were  
Baffert's two Kentucky Derby hopes after their 1-2 finish in the 
Santa Anita Derby. Prime Timber finished fourth in the Derby, won 
by Charismatic, and General Challenge finished ninth. Neither has 
raced since. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert said that when Prime Timber was reshod a couple of weeks  
after the Derby, a little crack on the sole of the left front foot 
was found, and while the colt is in training, it will be awhile 
before he races. 
</P>
<P>
	General Challenge, who will race in the Affirmed on June 26 at  
Hollywood Park, is called goofy by his trainer. ``He has a mind 
like Dennis Rodman's,'' Baffert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 3-year-old coming around for Baffert is Forestry, bought  
as yearling by Aaron and Marine Jones for $1.5 million. He has won 
four straight and has five victories in seven career starts.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT HOOD, Texas (AP) -- Marcy Palmer paces in the shade of a  
post oak tree. Two dozen people listen as she teaches the tenets of 
an ancient religion: 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe in the divinity of all things.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we are all of one life force.''  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we are one with nature.''  
</P>
<P>
	``Know thyself.''  
</P>
<P>
	Scenes like this have rankled one congressman and triggered a  
debate about religious freedom within the military. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because Ms. Palmer is a witch, the high priestess of a  
group that practices Wicca at Fort Hood with the knowledge and 
approval of the U.S. Army. Most in her group are active-duty 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including some Christian groups and Rep. Bob Barr,  
R-Georgia, say the Army's decision to permit Wiccan services at 
Fort Hood and four other posts is wrong. Barr tried unsuccessfully 
to attach a witchcraft-banning amendment to a Defense Department 
authorization bill last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it brings disrepute to the military and ought not to  
be allowed as something on par with the Judeo-Christian beliefs on 
which our country was founded,'' Barr told The Associated Press. 
``If in fact people want to practice this in their personal lives, 
that's one thing. But to allow it as a sanctified practice on 
military bases ... is nonsense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such sentiments are rooted in fear and false notions that  
witches worship Satan or sacrifice animals, said David Oringderff, 
head of the San Antonio-based pagan group that sponsors Ms. 
Palmer's Fort Hood Open Circle. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no accounting for fear and bigotry,'' Oringderff said.  
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 50,000 Americans practice Wicca, a form of  
polytheistic nature worship. Its core ethical statement, the 
``Wiccan Rede,'' states that if ``it harm none, do what you will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Open Circle has been meeting at Fort Hood for about two  
years. Lt. Col. Benjamin Santos, Fort Hood's spokesman, said 
witches who were members of the Army submitted their request for a 
meeting place in mid-1997. It was approved by the chaplain's office 
at U.S. Army Forces Command headquarters in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The military has since sanctioned similar groups at Fort  
Barrancas in Florida, Fort Wainwright in Alaska, Fort Polk in 
Louisiana and Kadena Air Force Base on Okinawa. 
</P>
<P>
	Santos said the Army's stance is simple: Identify soldiers'  
needs and serve them. That applies to spiritual needs as well as 
temporal needs served by six elementary schools, two commissaries 
and a bowling alley for the post's 71,500 residents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The post has nine chapels, but, Santos said, ``For us it's not a  
religious issue. It's a quality-of-life issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are 92 chaplains among the 42,000 Fort Hood soldiers. The  
inch-thick chaplain handbook includes a five-page primer on Wicca, 
described as ``a reconstruction of the Nature worship of tribal 
Europe.'' It is sometimes referred to as druidism, paganism and 
witchcraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Donald Troyer is the chaplain assigned as a liaison to  
the witches and to ensure the group complies with regulations. A 
Seventh-day Adventist, he has championed the group's right to 
exist, telling The Austin American-Statesman that ``we're 
responding to the First Amendment ... and we're glad to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The witches of Fort Hood meet at Camp Finlayson, a remote, hilly  
campground teeming with squirrels and birds. Despite the frequent 
rumble of low-flying Apache attack helicopters on training runs, 
the site feels peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
	They gather for ritual holidays, such as the summer solstice,  
and two evenings a week for ``classes'' led by Ms. Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
	On this 90-degree Monday night, about 30 people attend.  
Three-fourths are in the Army, but only one -- a sergeant in an 
airborne unit -- is in uniform. Some wear pentagram necklaces. There 
are former Catholics, Mormons, Baptists and Presbyterians. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean, a 30-year-old former soldier who served in an artillery  
unit deployed to Kuwait several years ago, said witches were in the 
Army long before they were sanctioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my particular unit we had several witches and we would all  
congregate in one room and discuss things,'' said Sean, who 
declined to give his last name. ``It helped us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sean, a deacon in the Open Circle, said the Army is ahead of  
society in its religious tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first sergeant was very much for it,'' he said of his  
faith. ``So was my chaplain. ... He even came out here a couple 
times to the circle and gave classes about his religion so we could 
all learn about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Palmer, a former military policewoman who now is a civilian  
Army hospital nurse, drills the class on Wiccan principles. She 
talks about the fine points of summoning spirits and how to design 
rituals. She discusses casting spells, by which Wiccans mean 
enlisting ``psychic energy'' to heal, protect or aid members in 
various endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
	Such practices are forbidden by the Bible, according to those  
who want the Fort Hood covens curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are 112 verses where God calls this not just sin but ...  
abomination,'' said the Rev. Jack Harvey, pastor of the Tabernacle 
Baptist Church in Killeen, just outside Fort Hood. 
</P>
<P>
	One verse he cites is Exodus 22:18: ``Thou shalt not suffer a  
witch to live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``God detests this,'' Harvey said. ``This is like homosexuality,  
which God also says is an abomination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, 13 conservative religious groups, including  
the Christian Coalition with 2.1 million members, called on 
Christians to boycott joining or re-enlisting in the Army until 
witchcraft is banned on posts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Open Circle, some soldiers groaned at such criticism.  
Others called it an opportunity for witches to come out of hiding 
and to defend the rights of all religions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they deny our right to worship ... then everybody loses,''  
Ms. Palmer said.

<HEADLINE> Compaq Delivers More Bad News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. delivered its second  
financial jolt in two months Thursday, projecting a quarterly loss 
as it struggles to recover from computer price wars and management 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the world's largest personal computer maker assuaged  
investors with $2 billion in cost cuts and a reorganization to 
accelerate sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq said it would lose up to 15 cents a share in the second  
quarter, compared to analysts' estimates of a 20 cents-a-share 
profit. The company said it would make additional cuts in its 
workforce beyond the 15,000 reductions made since last summer, 
</P>
<P>
	On April 9, the company disclosed that its first-quarter profits  
would be half of what Wall Street expected. That bad news was 
followed quickly by the ouster of its chief executive Eckhard 
Pfeiffer and the departure of a half-dozen other top managers. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq continues to be hammered by high costs and intense  
competition for corporate customers of PCs, with rivals 
aggressively bidding down prices. But the company has suffered more 
than others in part because of its management vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	Company executives said they are nearing a replacement for  
Pfeiffer, but did not name candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq's reorganization will combine its sales staff for big  
business computers with services, a unit that advises corporations 
how to set up and manage their computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two months since the change of management at the  
company, we have taken a deep look into the strengths and 
challenges of Compaq,'' said chairman Benjamin Rosen, who is acting 
as chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq said the new job cuts will be set in the next few weeks.  
The company will take a restructuring charge in the third quarter, 
but its size also was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the reductions apparently reassured edgy stock  
investors, who initially blanched at Thursday's disclosure. 
Compaq's stock fell 10 percent in early trading but recovered, 
gaining 25 cents to close at $22.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's story is shown in the figures. Compaq's share of  
global PC sales fell to 14.4 percent in the first quarter from 15.3 
percent in the last quarter of 1998, according to International 
Data Corp., a high-tech research firm. The company's growth lagged 
the industry, with sales increasing 16.3 percent in that period 
compared to an average of 22 percent for other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems have yet to let up. Compaq said its revenues will  
be flat to down in the second quarter from the first. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, they've been sitting still in a market that's been  
moving quickly,'' said Roger Kay, an IDC analyst. ``The new 
management team has been pretty frozen. Most of the initiatives 
that have come out since Rosen and his colleagues took over were 
programs already in the works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fresh warning reflected the company's persistent difficulty  
in competing against arch-foe Dell Computer Corp., boosting sales 
via the Internet and integrating its acquisition of Digital 
Equipment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq has had trouble increasing sales of its Alpha business  
computers which were made by Digital, the giant manufacturer it 
bought last year for $9 billion. And Compaq has stumbled in trying 
to emulate the more efficient sales model of Dell, which saves 
money by selling computers directly to customers, eliminating the 
markup charged by retailers.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Publish Dictionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is publishing an English  
dictionary, building on the success of the Encarta encyclopedia 
CD-ROM that has made the software company the nation's top 
encyclopedia publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft Encarta World English Dictionary will be published  
Aug. 4, in time for the back-to-school selling season, The Wall 
Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The new dictionary, developed from scratch, will be bundled into  
the Encarta Reference Suite 2000 with the encyclopedia, an atlas 
and access to an online service. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the Encarta encyclopedia, which is only available for  
computer use, the dictionary also will be published in traditional 
print form. St. Martin's Press will publish the American version, 
Bloomsbury Publishing PLC for the United Kingdom and Pan Macmillan 
Australia Pty. Ltd. for Australia, according to the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The multiple versions indicate Microsoft's efforts to make the  
Encarta dictionary a global reference book, particularly for 
English-speaking e-mail users who communicate with people from 
other countries where English words can have different meanings. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has not yet released a price for  
the new Encarta software package or the print version of the 
dictionary, but the company said it will be comparably priced to 
the current Encarta suite that is available for about $69 with 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft already offers an American Heritage dictionary in its  
Bookshelf 2000 software package.

<HEADLINE> Fans Root for Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Mikka Hansen was rising through the ranks of  
U.S. soccer, her father kept making a seemingly strange request. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you play for Denmark?'' he'd say.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, Dad, whatever,'' Hansen would tell her father, who was  
born in Denmark, making her eligible for the national team, even 
though Mikka was born and grew up in California. ``If you get in 
touch with them ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't serious because, well, Hansen intended to play in the  
World Cup for the United States. She progressed through the youth 
ranks and at Santa Clara, where Hansen was a college star forward. 
She played for the under-21 U.S. women's squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought I would get a chance with the U.S. team,''  
Hansen said Wednesday at a news conference to kick off the World 
Cup, which begins Saturday at Giants Stadium -- where Hansen and the 
Danes face the Americans, followed by Mexico vs. Brazil. ``I came 
up with the Olympic Development program and it helped me become the 
player I am. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once I was 22 and I knew the players who were in front of  
me, I felt maybe that was not an option. I'm a forward and the U.S. 
has Mia (Hamm, the international career goal-scoring leader) and 
Tiffeny (Milbrett). You get to the point where you realize there 
are other players for the U.S. to choose and I wanted to play on a 
national team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Hansen did, indeed, contact Danish soccer officials last  
October. By Christmas, they confirmed she could play professionally 
in their country. On Jan. 7, she headed to Denmark and, 10 days 
later, was in her first training camp with the national team. She 
accompanied the team to Portugal, where it finished fourth in a 
strong field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all happened pretty fast,'' Hansen said. ``It's been a  
dream come true for my father and my grandma, who was born in 
Denmark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Hansen, the toughest adjustment has been in communicating  
with teammates. Although everyone on the team speaks English, it is 
not the first language for anyone except Hansen. When she shouts 
out instructions or encouragement on the field, she needs to ``put 
the words in Danish, not English, and that takes time to think 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also notes that the Danes play a less-aggressive style than  
the Americans, and her timing has been off because of it. But coach 
Jorgen Hvidemose believes Hansen is making the necessary 
adjustments at a satisfactory pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to do what she is doing,'' he said. ``She  
wants to fit into the team, and contribute to the team, but she 
also has had to make some big changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen expects it will be awkward Saturday when she opposes such  
friends as Julie Foudy and Brandi Chastain and Carla Overbeck, 
veterans of the U.S. team who helped Hansen's career. But she isn't 
backing away from the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited,'' she said. ``I'm proud to be a part of this  
event. And in the last six months, the media in Denmark has been 
getting excited about covering the event and having a person who 
grew up in America playing on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hvidemose and the other players haven't really picked Hansen's  
brains about the U.S. team, mainly because the Danes are familiar 
enough with the Americans. Oddly, in the 1995 World Cup, where the 
Americans finished third as the defending champions, and at the 
1996 Olympics, where the U.S. squad won the gold, the opening 
opponent was Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danes eagerly have questioned Hansen about playing in the  
United States; Denmark also has games at Portland, Ore., and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny to be with a team that hasn't been in the U.S. very  
often,'' Hansen said. ``The things they point out, I never really 
thought about. They think everything is so glamorous and big, and 
maybe a bit overdone. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they are impressed by how the preparations have been  
handled so well for this event. We can't wait to get started.''

<HEADLINE> Air France, Delta May Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Air France has chosen Delta Air Lines as its  
partner to build a worldwide alliance, the daily economics 
newspaper Les Echos reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France has code sharing agreements with Delta and another  
American carrier, Continental Airlines, and had been negotiating 
with both carriers for a more formal bond to build a strategic, 
global alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of weighing the pros and cons of a major  
partnership with each airline, Air France settled on Delta, Les 
Echos said, citing unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France declined to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner said Thursday she hasn't heard  
whether Air France has chosen a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of those rumors and we are aware that Air France  
will pick a partner sometime this year. We hope it is us,'' she 
said from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	She said such a partnership would allow Delta an alliance as  
well as growth within the European market. 
</P>
<P>
	Les Echos attributed Air France's decision to its competition on  
U.S.-Europe routes with an alliance joining Continental with some 
other major European carriers, including Alitalia and KLM Royal 
Dutch Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France Chairman Jean-Cyril Spinetta has said recently that  
he would explain the company's choice by the end of the year. Les 
Echos said an announcement could come as early as Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Ways To Protect Women's Knees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It took just one wrong jump, and women's  
basketball star Rebecca Lobo was on the floor in agony, yet another 
victim of a torn knee ligament called the ACL. 
</P>
<P>
	The very day Lobo was writhing in pain last week, doctors were  
meeting to figure out how to battle a growing problem: Women are 
far more susceptible to this debilitating knee injury than men. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just a risk for professional female athletes, but for  
high school and college teams, and even women who like a little 
weekend skiing, soccer or hoops. 
</P>
<P>
	Anterior cruciate ligament injuries are notorious because  
they're so painful and can require months of treatment and 
rehabilitation. But they also can predispose people to serious knee 
arthritis later in life, said Dr. Joan McGowan of the National 
Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The good news: There are some ways women can protect their  
knees, lowering the risk of injury by strengthening their 
hamstrings and learning to crouch properly while jumping, concluded 
a consensus conference sponsored by the American Academy of 
Orthopedic Surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
	Now doctors' quest is to alert women.  
</P>
<P>
	``These injuries affect young people, and can affect the rest of  
their lives,'' said Dr. Letha Griffin, team physician at Georgia 
State University, who organized the meeting. ``We really need to 
... help the public know that there are injury prevention 
techniques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her message: ``If I'm doing jumping, pivoting, cutting sports, I  
really need to look into some of these prevention techniques.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the knee, two ligaments pass each other in the shape of a  
cross, connecting the upper and lower leg bones. The anterior 
cruciate ligament is the one in front, and it's important in 
pivoting. 
</P>
<P>
	Many sports fans connect ACL injuries to football's crunching  
hits. But experts say most ACL tears actually are noncontact 
injuries -- and studies show women suffer from them about five times 
more than men. 
</P>
<P>
	ACL injuries are particularly common with lots of jumping, quick  
deceleration and pivoting, like in basketball, soccer and skiing. 
But recreational athletes who run, take boxing classes, even do 
step aerobics can suffer, too, said McGowan. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists are studying everything from hormones to anatomy to  
explain the gender discrepancy. But neuromuscular factors seem to 
play the biggest role, and that's where women can lower the risk, 
Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamstrings, muscles behind the thigh, relieve stress on the ACL  
when the knee bends. If your hamstrings are too weak, they may not 
protect the ACL. 
</P>
<P>
	Men's hamstrings typically are 60 to 70 percent as strong as  
their quadriceps, muscles in front of the thigh. Women athletes may 
have strong quads, but they typically have significantly weaker 
hamstrings, said Dr. Thomas Lindenfeld of the Cincinnati 
Sportsmedicine Research and Education Foundation. So as they jump 
and pivot, the hamstrings don't do their job and the ACL tears. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, women jump and land differently than men -- more  
straight-legged and flat-footed. Men bend their knees more as they 
jump and land, a built-in shock absorption. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati foundation created a program called Sportsmetrics  
to strengthen hamstrings and train female athletes to jump with 
their knees properly bent and body correctly aligned so they don't 
land off-balance. 
</P>
<P>
	In a study of 1,200 high school athletes, the six-week program  
lowered girls' injury risk to equal boys' risk, Lindenfeld said. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation now sells a video that demonstrates the program,  
and dozens of high school and college teams already are adopting 
the techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, many ski shops carry pamphlets describing Vermont research  
on avoiding ACL injuries. Scientists videotaped ski accidents to 
show positions where skiers got so off-balance that the stress tore 
an ACL. Teaching skiers about those risky positions and how to 
regain balance on the slopes can reduce injuries, Griffin said. 
</P>
<P>
	This focus on injuries shouldn't scare off women -- exercise is  
key to good health and American women don't exercise enough, 
stressed McGowan, who led a related NIH meeting last week on women 
and sports. 
</P>
<P>
	But learning to prevent injuries in professional athletes could  
translate to a more fit general population, she said. It's 
important to know ``this is the kind of thing amenable to 
training.''

<HEADLINE> No Retry for Democratic Fund-Raiser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic fund-raiser Maria Hsia, accused of  
funneling money through Buddhist nuns, will not be retried in a 
separate tax fraud case that ended in a mistrial, a Justice 
Department spokesman said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors claimed Ms. Hsia did not file an income tax return  
for 1994, underestimated her income for 1995 and 1996, and assisted 
in filing a false tax return for her immigration consulting 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	She was charged with tax evasion, but a federal judge declared a  
mistrial last week after the jury said it was hopelessly 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
	``We assessed the results of the first trial and determined that  
it would not be in the best interests of the Department of Justice 
to retry the case,'' department spokesman Myron Marlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax charges were separate from accusations that Ms. Hsia  
funneled money through Buddhist nuns at a 1996 Clinton-Gore 
campaign fund-raiser. She has pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	Both cases were pursued by a Justice Department task force  
established by Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate 
allegations that illegal foreign and corporate donations were made 
in the 1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hsia claimed the government brought the tax case to pressure  
her to cooperate with the fund-raising probe.

<HEADLINE>  Greene Sets 100M Record of 9.79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Maurice Greene made a quick decision to  
enter the 100-meter invitational race. He then ran the fastest time 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene shattered the 3-year-old world record Wednesday, running  
away from an elite field for a clocking of 9.79 seconds. He has 
ambitions to run even faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene came to Athens planning only to run the 200 meters. When  
he saw the caliber of competition in the 100 -- including training 
partner Ato Boldon of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago -- he asked for a place in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `They can't have a party without me,''' Greene said.  
``I knew something was going to happen with this race. I wanted to 
be part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene calls Athens' Olympic Stadium a ``special place.'' In  
1997, he won the 100-meter world championship gold medal in the 
venue that will be the site of the 2004 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, on a sultry and near windless evening just before  
sundown, he again blasted away from the pack and smashed the 
previous record of 9.84 set by Donovan Bailey of Canada at the 1996 
Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected it,'' Greene said. ``I wanted to win it here ...  
This is only the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave the 24-year-old Greene a standing ovation as he  
hugged some other athletes and waved the banner of his track club 
HSI, which stands for Handling Speed Intelligently. He looked for 
an American flag, but there were none handy. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to tell his mother the news by phone, but she wasn't  
home. He simply left a message: ``I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he basked in the record, he was looking ahead. ``I can  
do better,'' he said, setting his next goal at 9.76. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a start, but not a finish,'' Greene, the world's  
top-ranked sprinter last year, said. ``It was a good race, but not 
a great race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The .05-second difference between Bailey's mark and Greene's is  
the biggest drop the record has taken since the first officially 
accepted electronic record of 9.95 by Jim Hines at the 1968 
Olympics in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	The last American to own the record was Leroy Burrell, who ran  
9.85 in 1994 at Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, who trains with Greene under coach John Smith, was awed  
by his friend's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very significant we came to the birthplace of  
track and field to break this record,'' said Boldon, who placed 
second in the special race at 9.86. Bruny Surin of Canada was third 
at 9.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon won the regular 100-meter race at 9.97.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month in Milan, Italy, Greene won the 100 at 10.16  
and insisted he was only concerned about the competition and not 
the clock. ``I am not obsessed with the world record,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 90 minutes after setting the record, Greene finished  
second in the 200 at 20.03, behind Boldon's winning time of 19.86. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1,500 meters, Noah Ngeny led a Kenyan sweep of the first  
three places in 3 minutes, 31.32 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Nezha Bidouane won the women's 400 hurdles at 53.54,  
more than a second ahead of world record-holder Kim Batten, who 
finished at 54.73. Batten set the world mark of 52.61 in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Suspect Said Confessed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- A granddaughter of a longtime suspect in  
a 1963 church bombing said she heard him admit planting the bomb 
that killed four black girls, WBRC-TV reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Teresa Stacy, 23, of Dallas, told a grand jury she heard her  
grandfather, Bobby Frank Cherry, admit his involvement in the 
Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing at a family gathering more 
than 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he helped blow up a bunch of folks in Birmingham,''  
she told the television station Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Ms. Stacy said, she didn't fully understand what he  
meant. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was really young back then so I didn't think too much about  
it 'til I got older and they reopened the case ... and then I found 
out about the little girls and it made me sick to my stomach,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Texas, has repeatedly denied any role in  
bombing the black church, an act of racist violence against the 
burgeoning civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims he had never set foot in the area where the bombing  
occurred. FBI investigators have repeatedly questioned Cherry and 
indicated they do not believe his alibi, but have never arrested 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Cherry, contacted Wednesday by The Associated Press, called his  
granddaughter a ``dope head'' and ``prostitute.'' He said he talked 
to her about 10 years ago, but never told her he was involved in 
the bombing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't happen and I didn't talk about it,'' he said. ``I  
don't understand why she would say anything like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Doug Jones and the FBI could not be reached for  
comment Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Sixteenth Street church were gathered for Sunday  
services on Sept. 15, 1963, when a dynamite bomb demolished an 
outside wall. Denise McNair, 11, and three 14-year-olds, Cynthia 
Wesley, Carole Robertson and Addie Mae Collins, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI investigated the bombing for about three years without  
filing charges. The state reopened the case in the 1970s, resulting 
in the murder conviction of Ku Klux Klan member Robert Chambliss, 
who later died in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators long ago publicly identified three other men as  
suspects: Herman Cash, who died in 1994, Tommy Blanton of 
Birmingham, and Cherry. Blanton also has denied involvement. An 
investigator has said they are targets of the current probe. 
</P>
<P>
	The current investigation is at least the fourth since the  
initial probe ended.

<HEADLINE> Ueberroth Group Buys Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A group that includes Arnold Palmer, Clint  
Eastwood and Peter Ueberroth agreed Thursday to buy the Pebble 
Beach golf course in California for $820 million, The Associated 
Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
	The group which Ueberroth, a former baseball commissioner, put  
together also includes former United Airlines chief executive 
Richard Ferris and General Electric Pensions. 
</P>
<P>
	A news conference was expected later Thursday, but details of  
the agreement were confirmed to the AP by a participant in the 
negotiations who spoke on the condition he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth's group becomes the fourth owner of the Pebble Beach  
Co. this decade. Bank America is providing financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Davis sold it in 1990 to Minoru Isutani for a price  
estimated at $850 million, and Isutani sold it two years later to 
The Lone Cypress Co., a Japanese golf resort company, for a price 
estimated at $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Perocchi, formerly involved with Ueberroth and Ferris in  
Doubletree Hotels, will become chief executive officer of Pebble 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's properties in the Monterey area include four golf  
courses -- the Pebble Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill Golf Course, 
The Links at Spanish Bay and Del Monte Golf Course -- along with The 
Lodge at Pebble Beach and The Inn at Spanish Bay. It also owns the 
17-Mile Drive that winds through Pebble Beach and nearby Del Monte 
Forest and plans to develop a new course and 300 homes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 99th U.S. Amateur will be played at Pebble Beach and  
Spyglass Hill on Aug. 16-22. 
</P>
<P>
	Pebble Beach was host to the U.S. Open in 1972, 1982 and 1992  
and is scheduled to be host to the 100th U.S. Open next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Eastwood is a former mayor of nearby Carmel, Calif.

<HEADLINE> Woods in Contention in U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- He laughed. He pouted. He smiled. He  
frowned. He pumped his arms. He seemed ready to toss his clubs 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	All in all, a most eventful day of golf for Tiger Woods.  
</P>
<P>
	Both erratic and brilliant during Thursday's opening round of  
the U.S. Open, Woods' enormous talent emerged triumphant by the 
time he walked off Pinehurst No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods finished with two straight birdies for a 2-under 68,  
leaving him just one shot behind main rival David Duval and three 
others sharing the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt nice to end that way,'' said Woods, who broke par for  
only the third time in 14 career U.S. Open rounds. ``To hit it the 
way I did today and steal a 68, that feels pretty good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His demeanor was quite a bit different on the front nine. His  
shoulders drooped when he throttled back to a 4-iron off the tee 
and still couldn't hit the fairway. Woods muttered to himself when 
he needed two shots to get out of a bunker. More than once, he 
seemed on the verge of slamming a club to the ground in anger, only 
to pull back at the last second. 
</P>
<P>
	The lowlight came at No. 5, when Woods missed a 6-footer for par  
and drew back his club like an ax, but stopped short of hitting the 
still-rolling ball. If Woods ever wants to take up a new career, he 
might consider becoming a lumberjack. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you saw me play today, you would say there's no way he  
could have shot the number he shot today,'' Woods said. ``It was 
not a pretty round, but I scored. And the name of the game is 
scoring. That's something I've always been able to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Woods came to the sandhills of North Carolina as a favorite to  
capture his second major title. He won his last two events against 
strong fields and Pinehurst -- with its short rough, spacious 
fairways and tricky greens -- seemed a perfect fit for his power and 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	But Woods struggled through the front nine with a 1-over 36,  
which could have been worse if not for a 10-foot bogey save at No. 
7, when he required those two shots to get out of the sand. After 
making the turn, he missed a 3-foot birdie try and with it, a prime 
opportunity to make up ground at the par-5 10th. 
</P>
<P>
	And just when he seemed headed for his seventh straight  
above-par round at the Open, the sun broke through the clouds. 
Woods' play -- and his demeanor -- also brightened. 
</P>
<P>
	At No. 11, he hit a 9-iron to within two inches of the flag, the  
ball nearly spinning back into the cup for an eagle. He seemed 
almost embarrassed by the shot, hiding a broad grin behind his 
right hand walking up the fairway alongside caddy Steve Williams. 
The gallery erupted in its first full-throated roar of Tigermania. 
</P>
<P>
	Five straight pars followed. Included were a 10-foot save at No.  
12 and a couple of up-and-downs where Woods used his 3-wood from 
the fringe of the green like a putter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried to manage my game and hang in there,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	At the par-3 17th, Woods produced another magnificent shot,  
hitting a 7-iron to within six feet and knocking in the putt for 
birdie. At 18, he striped his tee shot, outdriving playing partner 
Lee Westwood by 25 yards and the other member of the threesome, 
Corey Pavin, by 50. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was pin-high with a pitching wedge from 137 yards, leaving  
him 12 feet away. The putt curled slowly across the turtleback 
green, veering left at the last second -- and into the cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said that to win tournaments, you've got make sure  
your bad rounds are in the red,'' Woods said. ``I did that today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This time, he was smiling.

<HEADLINE> Bin Laden Suspected To Plan Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A week after the FBI put him on its 10 Most  
Wanted List, suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden is said by U.S. 
intelligence to be in the advanced stages of planning another 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the timing and location of the strike are unknown, a U.S.  
official said there have been indications in recent weeks that bin 
Laden has been moving unspecified materials that could be used in a 
terrorist operation, and that U.S. facilities in African nations 
such as Ghana or Mozambique could be targets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always said we expecting bin Laden to strike again,''  
deputy State Department spokesman James Foley said today. ``We take 
such threats seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blamed by the United States for ordering last year's bombings of  
U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, bin Laden is thought to be in 
Afghanistan, where the FBI said it is getting no help in bringing 
him to justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the difficulty of launching an operation at targets  
in the United States, bin Laden is expected to focus on targets in 
poorer countries where security is weaker, intelligence officials 
have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	But the official stressed that there is no clear intelligence on  
the timing or target of any impending attack. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official confirmed there has been a pattern  
of activities by the bin Laden network that indicate continued 
planning for a terrorist attack. But he, too, had no information on 
timing or location. There has been an upsurge recently in reports 
of such planning, much as there was before last Christmas, the 
official added. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, asking not to be identified, said terrorist  
threats have been received on all continents. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet said in February ``there is not the  
slightest doubt'' that bin Laden, ``his worldwide allies, and his 
sympathizers are planning further attacks against'' the United 
States ``at any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are anticipating bombing attempts ... but his operatives  
are also capable of kidnappings and assassinations,'' Tenet said. 
</P>
<P>
	ABC-TV quoted U.S. intelligence officials Wednesday as saying  
they believe bin Laden is suffering from Marfan's syndrome, an 
illness that would put him at risk of having a stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	But an official discounted the notion that any illness bin Laden  
suffers may be causing the exiled Saudi millionaire to accelerate 
his plans for any terrorist action. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden has openly declared his hostility to the United States  
for its support of Israel and for the presence of U.S. troops in 
the Persian Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets Cardiac Gene Therapy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- For the first time, doctors have injected  
genetically engineered DNA into heart muscles to help restore blood 
flow to clogged arteries by using a catheter without any 
anesthesia. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, the gene was injected into the heart during a  
two-hour surgery that required general anesthesia and several days 
of recuperation. 
</P>
<P>
	The new, minimally invasive technique will eventually allow  
patients to go home an hour after it's completed, said Dr. Jeffrey 
Isner, chief of cardiovascular research at St. Elizabeth's Medical 
Center in Boston. It could be a safer alternative to bypass surgery 
or angioplasty for high-risk patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Isner performed the procedure in about 30 minutes Tuesday on Sam  
Hart, 81, of Rome, N.Y. The early results have been encouraging to 
Hart, who underwent bypass surgery and an angioplasty operation, 
but has continued to have heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like someone who was waiting for the electric chair,  
and just found out I was going to be free,'' Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the new method, a catheter is inserted in the groin and  
directed to the heart by X-ray imaging. A needle is advanced out of 
the catheter and injects the DNA into the inner wall of the heart. 
That leads to production of the protein vascular endothelial growth 
factor, which stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nicholas Kipshidize, an assistant professor at the Medical  
College of Wisconsin, said it's too early to tell if the catheter 
method will he widely used. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know the overall success of this procedure,''  
he said 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers have two main concerns about the gene therapy. They  
fear it could nourish the blood supply of undetected cancers, 
causing tumor growth, and cause overgrowth of vessels in tissues 
such as the retina of the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Isner said retinal specialists found no changes in the eyes of  
about 60 diabetic patients who received the gene therapy through 
the traditional surgical procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that there hasn't been long enough follow-up to  
determine the risk of tumor growth, though no new tumors have been 
seen in patients, and animal data suggests the therapy isn't likely 
to develop tumors.

<HEADLINE> Allen's Co. Buys Into Oxygen Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cable mogul Paul G. Allen will make a $100  
million investment in Oxygen Media, the start-up cable and Internet 
company devoted to women, just as competition in the category grows 
through efforts by Time Warner Inc., Dow Jones News Service 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxygen said Wednesday that Vulcan Ventures Inc., Allen's  
investment group, would take a minority stake in Oxygen, a media 
company led by former ABC and Nickelodeon executive Geraldine 
Laybourne. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxygen will also enter into a carriage agreement with Charter  
Communications, a cable company also owned by Allen. Under the 
agreement's terms, Charter's cable systems will distribute Oxygen 
to their subscribers. Charter has 2.3 million subscribers and has 
entered into agreements to buy systems with another 3.6 million 
subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxygen expects to launch in early 2000, and has reached separate  
carriage agreements with AT&AMP;T Corp.'s Tele-Communications Inc. and 
MediaOne Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen is the co-founder of Microsoft Corp. and has taken several  
steps to amass a large cable presence. In a statement, Vulcan 
Ventures President William D. Savoy said Oxygen ``develops valuable 
new brands and builds on successful existing brands.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The infant operation already has several prominent minority  
owners. Oprah Winfrey's HARPO Entertainment Group, America Online 
Inc. and ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co., all hold minority 
positions, along with an entity formed by TV producers Marcy 
Carsey, Tom Werner and Caryn Mandabach. 
</P>
<P>
	The move comes as competition in the women's programming  
marketplace increases. Last week, Time Warner and Advance 
Publications said they would team up to create a new television 
network and Web site targeting women. Lifetime, a cable channel 
owned by Hearst Corp. and Disney, has spent the past several months 
beefing up its programming. 
</P>
<P>
	Advance owns Conde Nast Publications, a magazine group that  
includes Vanity Fair, GQ and the New Yorker. Time Warner operates 
its large Time Inc. magazine unit and owns a suite of Turner 
Broadcasting cable channels.

<HEADLINE> NBA Finals Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- If pressed, Marcus Camby reveals only a  
sliver of what makes his relationship with Jeff Van Gundy tick. 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to widespread belief, Camby said Thursday, the ticking  
is not of the time bomb variety. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a great working relationship,'' said Camby, the Knicks  
forward who was reportedly angry with his coach over playing time 
earlier this season. ``We understand each other. He trusts me, I 
trust him and we just go from there. Just in the postseason with my 
minutes, I'm definitely proving I can get the job done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby and Latrell Sprewell both denied a rift with Van Gundy,  
who was reluctant to give them the minutes they wanted until 
Patrick Ewing's season-ending Achilles' injury forced his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, Camby may have lacked the endurance to play extended  
minutes at the beginning of the lockout-shortened season. That has 
changed in the playoffs. Camby has been one of the saviors in New 
York's improbable drive to the NBA Finals, averaging 31 minutes as 
a reserve to help the Knicks beat the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Knicks prepared for Game 2 of the finals following an  
89-77 loss to San Antonio on Wednesday night, Van Gundy suggested 
the ``supposedly strained relationships between myself and Marcus 
and myself and Latrell are far overblown. ... If there's problems, 
then they have problems with me, because I don't have any problems 
with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell didn't become a regular starter until Ewing was lost  
for the year with an Achilles' injury after Game 2 of the Pacers 
series. On whether he wants to be traded, Sprewell said, ``I'd 
rather not talk about that. It's not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camby said he and Van Gundy talked twice about playing time  
early in the season, but ``we haven't had a problem since then.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TWIN TOWERS:* Many teams have tried to make a Twin Towers setup  
work. Few have achieved the success of the San Antonio Spurs with 
Tim Duncan and David Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	The Houston Rockets tried it with 7-footers Ralph Sampson and  
Hakeem Olajuwon. The New York Knicks tried it briefly with Patrick 
Ewing and Bill Cartwright. In Game 1 against the Knicks, Duncan and 
Robinson showed how it's supposed to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of it probably has been the roles being well defined,''  
said Robinson, who has gladly taken a secondary role in the Spurs' 
offense. ``When you have two 7-footers, the guys have got to know 
how they're going to work together. They've got to know what their 
roles are going to be on the floor. And it can be difficult 
sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're focused and you know what your job is night in and  
night out, then it's a lot easier to go do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Duncan carried the offensive load with 33 points on an  
assortment of unstoppable jumpers and layups in Game 1, Robinson 
concentrated on defense with three blocks and several altered 
shots. He also turned into a de facto point guard, a 7-footer who 
can catch the ball at the foul line and distribute it with 
efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I met David, I think he told me that there are  
going to be a lot of things that people are going to try to tell 
you throughout your rookie year and throughout your career,'' 
Duncan said. ``He said, `I'm going to be here for you. I'm going to 
help you if you want me to help you. But I'm not going to go out 
there and force things upon you.''' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DOUBLE SHOWDOWN:* It's a Texas vs. New York double in pro  
sports these days. 
</P>
<P>
	While the San Antonio Spurs tangle with the New York Knicks in  
the NBA Finals, the Dallas Stars and Buffalo Sabres are squaring 
off in the NHL championship round. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs lead the basketball series 1-0 after Wednesday night's  
89-77 victory. The Stars and Sabres were tied 2-2 heading into 
Thursday night's Game 5 of the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The only other time two states have had professional teams in  
two finals in the same year was 1973, when New York and California 
met in baseball and basketball. The Oakland Athletics defeated the 
New York Mets 4-3 in baseball's World Series. New York got even by 
beating the Los Angles Lakers 4-1 in the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LAYUPS:* Texans wasted no time gloating over the Spurs' victory  
in Game 1. On Thursday morning, a billboard already was erected 
alongside the highway leading from the San Antonio airport to 
downtown. It read, ``Spurs 1, Knicks 0.'' ... From the headline 
department, the back page of Thursday's New York Post: ''Big 
Trouble.''

<HEADLINE> Open Promises To Be Entertaining  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- For the fans who surround the greens at  
Pinehurst No. 2, this might be the most entertaining U.S. Open in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	It might also prove to be the most interactive.  
</P>
<P>
	``The gallery is going to get some business,'' Davis Love III  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While one shot common in recent Opens -- the sideways hack out of  
the rough -- was missing as play began today in the 99th U.S. Open, 
a hundred others figure to replace it in and around the sloping 
greens of Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	With players unafraid to go for the greens out of the relatively  
light rough, balls that once would be hacked back to fairways will 
instead be sent skyward with varying degrees of control toward the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	The result could be that those missing the fairway could pay  
even worse than in the deeper rough of past Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've done a great job of keeping the rough at a certain  
height where you can get aggressive,'' Greg Norman said. ``But that 
aggression could come out and bite you at some time during the 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what Open officials would like to see on a  
course suddenly more vulnerable to low scores after being softened 
by a few days of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	They envision players emboldened by tame lies in the rough  
ricocheting balls off of greens and into galleries, leaving them 
nearly impossible chips back toward the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players may be tempted to hit a long shot toward the putting  
green, and on that basis they have little or no control over the 
golf ball,'' said Trey Holland, who heads the Open for the United 
States Golf Association. ``Where it ends up is going to be 
anybody's best guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, for one, wants his shots to end up short, since  
being behind the Donald Ross-designed greens means almost certain 
bogey and possibly worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get the ball in the rough and have a hot lie, I think  
you've got to always be conservative and put the ball short,'' 
Woods said. ``You have to make sure if it does come out hot, it's 
not going to zip over the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Woods or any of the world's best golfers are  
complaining about the course after years of playing out of 
ankle-deep rough. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite the opposite, they're bordering on ecstatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best U.S. Open I've seen, and that's pretty much  
the word on the driving range and the putting green,'' Norman said. 
``It's going to be an Open that's more of an international Open. A 
lot more players could win this golf tournament than we've seen in 
the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot -- 156 to be exact -- will be trying as play began this  
morning under expected rainy conditions on the par-70 course 
stretched to 7,175 yards for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain that fell early Wednesday evening will make the  
course play even longer, but will also allow players to hit more 
approach shots with less fear of them bounding over the back of the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they were hoping we don't get a lot of rain because it  
will change the complexity of the course,'' said Payne Stewart, who 
led last year for three rounds before being overtaken by Lee 
Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen won his second Open last year at the Olympic Club in San  
Francisco, but that was on a more traditional Open layout with 
thick, wet rough and tight fairways that made it difficult to keep 
the ball in play. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen won by playing steady on the final day and staying out of  
the deep rough that lined the fairways and surrounded the greens. 
The winner at Pinehurst will most likely become the U.S. Open 
champion by figuring out the best way to get the ball up-and-down 
from the various shaved surfaces just off the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be real interesting to see how we choose to play  
different golf shots,'' Stewart said. ``I think that's what is 
really going to make the Open here at Pinehurst very special. 
There's just not one way to play a golf shot out there.''

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Alabama shortstop Andy Phillips thought he  
knew everything about ``The Andy Griffith Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he was grilled by Arizona Diamondbacks manager Buck  
Showalter. They chatted on a cellular phone as the Crimson Tide 
warmed up to play Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing he asked me was how many episodes they made,''  
Phillips said. ``I guessed 150. He told me there were 230-something 
episodes and he's got every one of them cataloged on video.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impromptu quiz started when ESPN analyst Harold Reynolds, a  
former major-leaguer, noticed in the Alabama media guide that 
Phillips considers himself a fan of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	And that made Reynolds think of Showalter, whose knowledge of  
Mayberry is storied in baseball circles. Reynolds dialed 
Showalter's home in Phoenix and handed the phone to Phillips behind 
the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few minutes, Phillips was humbled.  
</P>
<P>
	``He told me all kinds of things, like Floyd the barber got  
polio and they never let him walk again after the 110th episode,'' 
Phillips said. ``I usually watch every day but now I know I'm 
definitely not as big a fan as I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts as his Southeastern  
Conference-record 36-game hitting streak ended in Alabama's loss. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPECIAL VISITOR:* Former Southern California coach Rod Dedeaux  
was honored in a ceremony behind home plate just before the first 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the celebration surrounding Omaha's 50th year of  
playing host to the College World Series, Mayor Hal Daub gave 
Dedeaux a key to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedeaux led the Trojans to 10 of USC's 12 championships, more  
than any other school. His 60-16 record (78 percent) is the best 
among coaches who appeared in at least 20 games at Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ceremony, Dedeaux received a one-minute standing  
ovation. He watched both games from a front-row seat near the 
visitor's dugout. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LUCKY DOG:* The Hurricanes sure have a funny-looking good luck  
charm. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Eduardo Perez had been driving around Coral Gables,  
Fla., for several months with a small stuffed Chihuahua dog that he 
bought at a convenience store. Its head is mounted on a spring. 
</P>
<P>
	When the postseason began, he shared it with his teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always had good luck when it was in my car,'' Perez said.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the responsibility of right-hander Darryl Roque to bring  
the dog into the dugout and remove it after the game. When Miami 
needs a hit, Perez makes the dog's head bounce on its spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shakes out his good luck and gets us some runs when we need  
a little help,'' Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems to be working for the Hurricanes, who are unbeaten in  
eight postseason games and will play for the national title 
Saturday. Roque even brought it to the postgame interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Roque was asked if it really works.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want to ask him?'' Roque said, bouncing the head with  
his finger. 
</P>
<P>
	It nodded yes.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON SECOND THOUGHT:* Umpire Bill Davis changed his call on a  
close play in the second inning of the early game, when Alabama's 
Brent Boyd appeared to be out on a headfirst slide into first base. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened with a runner at second, one out and the score tied  
1-1. Boyd grounded to shortstop Bobby Hill, who threw to first. 
Kevin Brown stretched and bobbled the catch as Boyd arrived in a 
dust cloud. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis paused, then called Boyd out. The Crimson Tide players  
rushed from the third-base dugout, stopping after a few feet while 
coach Jim Wells kept running over from the third-base box to argue. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief talk, Davis walked down the baseline to consult  
with home plate umpire Ken Couch. Davis then turned around and gave 
the safe sign, bringing cheers from the Alabama bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jim Morris came out of his dugout to argue.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelley Gulledge took third on the play and scored to give  
Alabama a 2-1 lead when the next batter, Darren Wood, sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
	Replays showed Brown dropped the ball as Boyd arrived. Hill  
eventually was charged with a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT-SO-CLOSE CALL:* After Antonio Bostic made the last out on a  
force at second, he threw his helmet across the infield as Miami 
players celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Bobby Hill fielded a grounder from Derek Wigginton and  
stepped on the bag to force Bostic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was close, but not that close,'' Hill said. ``I was there  
in plenty of time.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Ratings Plunge 36 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The post-Michael Jordan era of the NBA Finals  
began with a thud when it comes to television ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio's 89-77 win over the New York Knicks got an 11.5  
rating and 21 share on NBC Wednesday night, down 36 percent from 
the 18.0 rating and 32 share for last year's opener between 
Jordan's Bulls and the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the lowest rating for the opening game of the Finals  
since NBC began televising the NBA in the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
	The rating is the percentage of TV households in the United  
States tuned to a program, and each point represents 994,000 homes. 
The share is the percentage tuned to a program among televisions in 
use on at the time.

<HEADLINE> Teen-Ager Charged in Motel Murder </HEADLINE>

<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- A 17-year-old girl was charged  
Thursday with killing a man whose body was found stuffed under a 
motel room bed after two tourists spent the night on it. 
</P>
<P>
	The identity of the girl, who is from New York City, was not  
released because she is a juvenile. She got into an argument with 
Saul Hernandez, 64, in his room at the Burgundy Motor Inn on June 8 
and stabbed him to death, Atlantic County Prosecutor Jeffrey Blitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two had just met, Blitz said. He would not say what the  
argument was about. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez's body lay undiscovered for two days, until two German  
tourists who rented Room 112 complained about the smell. They 
stayed overnight anyway, and they were moved to a different room 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	Housekeepers cleaned the room but couldn't eliminate the smell,  
prompting them to look under the bed, where the body was lodged in 
a wooden platform that supported the mattress and box spring.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg Co. Considers More Job Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- Kellogg Co. is considering closing  
part of its historic Battle Creek cereal plant and slashing up to 
700 of the plant's 1,100 jobs as part of an ongoing effort to boost 
its sagging market share. 
</P>
<P>
	The embattled company, which saw earnings drop 30 percent last  
quarter, is trying to retain its status as the nation's largest 
cereal maker. The announcement Thursday came just months after it 
hiked prices nearly 3 percent and cut 525 white collar jobs in its 
North American operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Streamlining our operations and avoiding future costs would  
help keep our North American cereal business cost-competitive going 
into the 21st century,'' chief executive Carlos M. Gutierrez said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the proposed move would offer limited relief to  
Kellogg, which despite recent sales' increases remains in a very 
competitive market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Battle Creek-based Kellogg owns eight of the world's top 10  
best-selling cereals, including Rice Krispies, Frosted Flakes and 
Special K, and has about 31 percent of the market, just ahead of 
rival General Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Kellogg has been battered by cheaper generic and  
store-brand cereals. Busy consumers have also left cereal for foods 
such as bagels and muffins that can be eaten on the run. 
</P>
<P>
	To counter this trend, Kellogg has attempted to streamline its  
operations while at the same time investing heavily in marketing 
its products. So far, it's had limited success: While revenue for 
the first three months of 1999 rose 8 percent, earnings dropped 30 
percent, including a charge for the previously announced job cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Future prospects remain uncertain, said analyst Christopher  
Jakubik of Warburg Dillon Read in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``You still have too many players. There's still very limited  
growth in the category.'' That will make it hard for any 
cereal-maker to make a decent return on investment, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were largely unfazed by Kellogg's announcement,  
pushing shares down 18 3/4 cents to $33.81 1/4 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference Thursday, Joseph Stewart, senior vice  
president of corporate affairs, said the closure recommendation was 
made because updating equipment at the aging plant -- parts of which 
date back to 1907 -- would have been too expensive. He said employee 
benefits and wages were not a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect an annual savings of $35 million to $45 million,''  
he said. ``Those funds can be reinvested in our business. ... We 
hope 1999 will be the beginning of a turnaround.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart said a final decision about the closing will not be made  
until later this year, when discussions with the union are 
complete. But he said Kellogg has no plans to replace any jobs cut 
with new positions at its other facilities, although equipment 
inside the plant may be moved to other plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Battle Creek, which makes Kellogg's Corn Flakes, is Kellogg's  
largest plant in North America -- it would drop to third if the cuts 
are made. The company invested $80 million in the facility two 
years ago, leaving many baffled about how the plant could still be 
considered outdated. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers at the plant were ordered to attend a meeting early  
Thursday, where a manufacturing vice president made a seven-minute 
presentation and told them to call a 1-800 number if they had any 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd seen it coming. The plant's been so mismanaged,'' said  
Rick Cameron, 46, who has cooked corn at the plant for 28 years. 
``They've got their mind made up. They're going to keep cutting and 
cutting.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Sentenced for Selling Software </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Two defendants were sentenced to more than two  
years in prison in a conspiracy to resell almost $20 million worth 
of computer software that had been stolen from a manufacturing 
plant in Plymouth. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Court Judge George A. O'Toole sentenced  
59-year-old Maxine Simons of Peabody to two years and nine months 
in prison and ordered her to pay $908,000 in restitution to 
Microsoft. Gerald Coviello, 62, of Woburn was sentenced to two and 
a half years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Both were convicted by a federal jury in March of conspiracy to  
transport stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
	Simons was also convicted on 15 counts of interstate  
transportation of stolen property, two counts of attempting to 
evade federal bank reporting requirements and one count of making a 
false statement to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	She was the president of Crazy Bob's, a discount computer outlet  
in Wakefield which she operated with her husband, Robert. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1994 and 1997, Crazy Bob's purchased computer products  
that had been stolen from KAO Infosystems, prosecutors said. 
Prosecutors say the stolen goods were sold by two former KAO 
employees, David LaPointe and John Costello. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest shipment of the stolen property consisted of 32,000  
Microsoft Office '97 Professional Edition CD-ROMs, each valued at 
$599. The store sold the disks to various outlets located in 
California and Great Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	LaPointe, Costello, Robert Simons and two Crazy Bob's employees,  
Mark Rosengard and William Simons, pleaded guilty to related 
federal charges. Earlier this week, Robert Simons, was sentenced to 
five years and 10 months in prison and William Simons was sentenced 
to 22 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The others await sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Baptists Rebuke Clinton on Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Homosexuality dominated the final day of the  
Southern Baptist Convention's annual meeting, as members criticized 
the appointment of the nation's first openly gay ambassador and 
cheered football great Reggie White for again condemning the gay 
lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	``God said it not Reggie White,'' the player-turned-preacher  
told the audience Wednesday. ``Leviticus 18.22 says, `Do not lie 
with a man as one lies with a woman.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The applause at the Georgia Dome was thunderous. Last year,  
White declared homosexuality a sin when he addressed the Wisconsin 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, members of the nation's largest Protestant  
denomination voted overwhelmingly to urge President Clinton to 
rescind James Hormel's appointment as ambassador to Luxembourg. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to speak out and say we do not want an avowed  
homosexual to represent the U.S.,'' said the Rev. Wiley Drake of 
Buena Park, Calif., who wrote the 1997 resolution calling on 
Southern Baptists to boycott Disney because of its gay-friendly 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormel, a former dean of the University of Chicago law school,  
used part of his family's meatpacking fortune to help create the 
Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay and lesbian 
political group. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators had held up Hormel's nomination since 1997, but Clinton  
appointed him while the Senate was in recess, angering religious 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	David Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, defended  
Hormel and called him a qualified and honorable man. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's become an annual convention event: devote a day to gay  
bashing,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention also rebuked Clinton -- who is a Southern Baptist  
-- for proclaiming June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous conventions have been marked by tension between  
moderates and conservatives and have produced controversial 
pronouncements like the Disney boycott and the decision to target 
Jews for proselytizing. 
</P>
<P>
	This meeting was far from contentious, as many moderates stayed  
home and the Rev. Paige Patterson, a conservative, was elected to a 
second one-year term as president without opposition. About 11,000 
of the nation's 16 million Southern Baptists attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Patterson said members -- who are mostly suburban and rural  
whites -- should increase recruitment in inner cities. Chicago, 
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Boston, Philadelphia and Seattle will be 
targeted over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Baptists also approved a resolution urging Congress,  
NATO and the United Nations to halt ``genocide and ethnic 
cleansing'' in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Nation's Tallest Lighthouse Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- Propped up on rollers in a technique  
borrowed from the ancients, the historic, 208-foot Cape Hatteras 
Lighthouse began its inch-by-inch journey to a safer spot inland 
Thursday, away from the crashing breakers of the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	With a nudge from seven hydraulic jacks, the nation's tallest  
lighthouse silently moved 5 inches on the first push shortly after 
3 p.m. Cheers went up from those who gathered in a steady rain to 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It rolled a lot easier than we thought,'' said Jerry Matyiko  
of Expert House Movers of Virginia Beach, Va., a project 
subcontractor. The contractors moved it 10 feet, 4 inches on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Threatened with destruction by the encroaching sea, the beloved,  
white-and-black barber-pole-striped landmark is being moved 2,900 
feet inland, a trip that will take four to six weeks. Engineers 
said at best they can expect to go 200 feet at a time. The 
4,800-ton brick tower, which is 128 years old, is set to reopen 
next Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major milestone in this project to preserve a piece  
of America's heritage,'' said Bob Reynolds, superintendent of Cape 
Hatteras National Seashore. ``For many people, lighthouses in 
general and this lighthouse in particular is a symbol of people's 
romance with the ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lighthouse once guided ships in the treacherous waters off  
Cape Hatteras, known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. But with the 
advent of electronic and satellite navigation, the beacon is seldom 
used. In preparation for the move, the light was extinguished March 
1 for the first time since 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the move began, Terry Jennette Ponton of Philadelphia,  
granddaughter of the lighthouse's last full-time keeper, was 
permitted by National Park Service rangers to take a look around. 
She took a piece of foundation granite and some brick as mementos. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it's not the last time, but it's the last time in this  
place. It was bittersweet,'' she said. ``She's a graceful lady and 
she needs to be in a safe place. I wish her well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service is spending $10 million to move the lighthouse  
because it sits just 150 feet from the Atlantic, and the waves are 
getting closer all the time. When it was built, it was 1,600 feet 
away from the surf. It is moving 2,900 linear feet, but because of 
the curving shoreline, it will once more be 1,600 feet from the 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was bitterly contested by many on Hatteras Island and  
elsewhere who feared the lighthouse would fall or become seriously 
cracked. They wanted the Park Service to instead construct jetties 
to catch sand and build up the beach in front of the lighthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dare County Board of Commissioners sued to try to stop the  
move, but a judge refused to stand in the way. A citizens 
opposition group, Save Cape Hatteras Lighthouse Committee, gave up 
about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a tragedy for the state,'' said chairman Hugh  
Morton. 
</P>
<P>
	The move employs both high technology and brute force.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, workers cut the lighthouse away from its  
foundation and raised it on hydraulic jacks onto beams and rollers. 
The lighthouse will move an average of only an inch or two a 
minute, with frequent stops for adjustments. Every 100 feet or so, 
the rollers the lighthouse has passed over will be picked up and 
put in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of sensors attached to the structure will measure tilt,  
expansion, temperature and vibration. Should a sensor detect a 
problem, all movement will halt. 
</P>
<P>
	The main contractor, International Chimney Corp. of Buffalo,  
N.Y., said it has moved lighthouses and other large structures 
without mishap. 
</P>
<P>
	Project manager Joe Jakubic said the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse is  
extremely well-constructed. During much of the move, he said, he 
will be underneath it, making sure there are no problems. ``That's 
how confident I am'' in its stability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jakubic said the lighthouse will move so slowly that ``you  
actually have to line up the lighthouse with an object in the 
foreground to know it's moving.'' The occasional screech of the 
rollers also will signal movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The public can watch it happen on the Internet at witntv.com,  
courtesy of WITN-TV's ``lighthouse cam,'' which produces an image 
every two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin McCave, 43, of Buxton, one of the opponents of the move,  
rode his bicycle to the lighthouse to watch. ``I don't believe the 
lighthouse was meant to stand forever,'' he said. ``Once it moves,

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Solicits Consumer Opinion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. has discreetly added a message  
to the Internet site visited by millions of people who use its 
Windows software urging them to write to Congress about the 
government's antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	The move suggests an intensified public relations campaign by  
Microsoft as trial testimony nears an end and pressure grows to 
resume settlement negotiations with government lawyers. It comes 
days after Microsoft's billionaire chairman, Bill Gates, testified 
before a sympathetic Senate panel and met privately with key 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The affected Microsoft Web site draws millions of visitors each  
month to update their copies of Windows, the operating system 
software that runs most of the world's personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	When Microsoft's lawyer showed the site to the trial judge  
during a courtroom demonstration last week, the message was not 
there. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, however, Microsoft added the note urging visitors to  
its ``Windows Update'' site to ``click here'' for details about how 
its legal fight with the Justice Department and 19 states might 
affect them and how to write about the lawsuit to their elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect ... they didn't want the judge to see this,'' said  
Justice Department lawyer David Boies. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft said Thursday it added the message to Windows Update  
in what it described as a routine change. It said it wasn't trying 
to prevent U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson from seeing 
it on the page during last week's demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it had anything to do with that,'' spokesman Jim  
Cullinan said. ``... I don't think there's anything conspicuous 
about this. This was being updated in the normal part of 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The message already had been included for at least six months on  
other Web pages within Microsoft's vast network, but fewer people 
than expected had subscribed to the company's occasional newsletter 
about the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to get the word out that this is available,''  
Cullinan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Government lawyers said the new message on the site was  
inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another of the many ways in which they use their market  
power to advance their own causes,'' said Stephen Houck of the New 
York attorney general's office, the lawyer for the states. 
``They're using a position they've obtained as a result of what we 
believe to be illegal acts to propagate a political message, and we 
find that troubling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trial testimony was expected to end next week after more than  
five months in the courtroom. The judge has privately encouraged 
the sides to try to settle before his verdict later this year, but 
negotiations have failed in at least two face-to-face meetings 
since the trial began. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft has described Windows Update as one of the most  
compelling features of the latest version of Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	When customers using Windows 98 visit the site using Microsoft's  
own Web browser, it automatically analyzes their computers and can 
install incremental improvements and important security patches 
with a few mouse clicks. The site can even notify customers 
whenever upgrades are available, typically a few times each month. 
It will not function if customers use other versions of Windows or 
another company's Web browser. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen Net Ratings, a New York-based research company that  
tracks the popularity of Internet sites, said Windows Update 
received more than 3.5 million visits last month, accounting for 
more than one-third the online traffic to all of Microsoft's 
corporate Web pages -- even though only customers with the latest 
version of Windows can access the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department also solicits comments from the public  
about the Microsoft trial, using an e-mail address published atop a 
Web page that includes links to its own court documents and trial 
evidence.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Bush Raises $15 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush has raised at least  
$15 million in his bid to capture the White House in 2000, his 
campaign spokesman, David Beckwith, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $15 million total is almost double the $7.6 million Bush had  
accrued as of April 1, more than any other Republican presidential 
hopeful. Candidates are scheduled to report July 15 how much money 
they have raised through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has not held many fund-raisers, relying instead on a  
network of volunteers to raise money for him. 
</P>
<P>
	When he has held fund-raising events, he's kept the costs low.  
At a $1,000-a-head event in San Antonio last month he served 
peanuts and pretzels. Little white cardboard signs read: ``Texas 
money will be saved for Iowa and New Hampshire.''

</P>
<P>
	JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Robert True Donnelly, who served for  
nearly a quarter-century on the Missouri Supreme Court and twice 
led it as chief justice, died Wednesday after a long illness. He 
was 74. 
</P>
<P>
	Donnelly was appointed to the Missouri Supreme Court in 1965 by  
then-Gov. Warren E. Hearnes. He served 23 years on the court and 
wrote 546 opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, Donnelly became the first chief justice to deliver a  
State of the Judiciary address to a joint session of the 
Legislature, now a yearly tradition. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, one of those addresses drew attention because Donnelly,  
as head of Missouri's judicial system, publicly questioned whether 
federal courts had reached too far in mandating social changes and 
overriding state legislatures and courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Donnelly published a book, ``A Whistle in the Night,'' in 1998.  
It recounted growing up in the Depression and his combat 
experiences in Germany during World War II.

<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Bernard D. Gress, a retired newspaperman  
and gambling aficionado, died Tuesday after an extended illness. He 
was 68. 
</P>
<P>
	He got into newspapers in 1960 as owner-publisher of Higgins  
News Publication Co. in Higgins, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	He later became advertising salesman for the North Platte Daily  
Telegraph, then owner of North Platte-based Central Nebraska 
Publishing Co., from 1968 to 1975. That company published the 
Central Nebraska Farmer-Stockman newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Gress wrote and published two books, ``Casino  
Oddities'' and ``Slots of Money,'' that became best sellers in the 
casino publishing industry.

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Cardinal Basil Hume, leader of the Roman Catholic  
Church of England and Wales and one of the most admired public 
figures in Britain, died Thursday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Hume held a position of remarkable influence and respect in  
Britain, where Catholics are a minority and the established church 
is Protestant. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple things like his moving prayers at the time of Princess  
Diana's death and his passionate support for the Newcastle United 
soccer team found him a place in many non-Catholic hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	A surprise choice as Roman Catholic Primate in 1976, he was  
abbot of Ampleforth Monastery and former head of its prestigious 
school, Ampleforth College. 
</P>
<P>
	After his selection as primate, in the space of just a few  
months, he was ordained a bishop, then Archbishop of Westminster 
and cardinal.

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Harold Kohn, an attorney who filed some of  
the earliest class-action lawsuits accusing corporations of 
price-fixing, died Monday. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Kohn became nationally known by winning a key case  
against General Electric, Westinghouse and two dozen other 
companies that the federal government had accused of illegal 
price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohn's case, brought on behalf of public utilities, was the  
first to go to trial and resulted in a $29 million verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, a jury awarded his clients $2 billion in a class-action  
suit against the timber industry. At the time, it was the largest 
verdict ever in an antitrust case.

oldest person in the world, died Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although she never had the records to prove her age, friends  
said they believed she was 118. And the nursing home where she 
lived since 1990 recorded her birthdate as being Jan. 15, 1881. 
</P>
<P>
	Had Mrs. Massey been able to prove her age, she would have held  
the Guinness Book of World Records' distinction of being the 
world's oldest person. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Massey was known for her high spirits and love of gospel  
music as well as listening to Bible passages on tape. She had been 
blind for about a decade.

</P>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Cecil Morgan, a leader of the group of state  
legislators that impeached Gov. Huey P. Long in 1929, died Monday. 
He was 100. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan and others started talking about impeachment after Long  
tried to impose a 5-cents-a-barrel tax on oil refined in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, dubbed ``the dynamite squad,'' accused Long of trying  
to arrange the murder of a political opponent, bribing lawmakers, 
carrying concealed weapons and demolishing the governor's mansion 
without authorization. 
</P>
<P>
	The House eventually voted to impeach Long on eight charges, but  
Long persuaded enough senators to sign a document promising to 
never impeach him. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan left the Legislature in 1934 after being elected judge in  
Shreveport. Two years later, he joined Standard Oil in Shreveport 
as general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan moved to Standard's corporate office in New York in 1954,  
taking the jobs of assistant to the chairman for public affairs and 
head of government relations. 
</P>
<P>
	He left Standard Oil in 1963 to become Tulane University's law  
school dean, a position he held for five years.

writer and winner of the 1963 National Book Award for his novel 
``Morte D'Urban,'' died Monday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers wrote three collections of short fiction and a second  
novel in 1998, ``Wheat That Springeth Green,'' for which he was a 
National Book Award finalist. Both novels follow the careers of a 
Minnesota priest, and much of his writing dealt with the conflict 
between spiritual and secular values in a materialistic society. 
</P>
<P>
	Powers also contributed regularly to The New Yorker and received  
fellowships from the Rockefeller and Guggenheim foundations.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- David Sutch, who brought a chuckle to British  
politics as leader of the Monster Raving Loony Party with the 
slogan: ``Vote for insanity -- you know it makes sense,'' was found 
hanged Wednesday in his home. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as Screaming Lord Sutch, he was Britain's longest-serving  
party leader. He never won a race, despite running in scores of 
them, but one of his party members was once elected mayor in a town 
in southwest England. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutch, who legally changed his name to add the ``Lord,'' founded  
the Monster Raving Loony Party in 1963 and first ran for Parliament 
in 1964. He went on to enter some 40 elections over more than 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign style of Sutch and his followers irritated more  
traditional candidates but delighted many British voters. And at 
least one of his policies -- all-day pub openings -- later became a 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutch also was a rock singer and until recently performed up to  
250 concerts a year throughout Europe.

<HEADLINE> Oregon Wants NRA Program in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- When Eddie Eagle spies children stumbling  
onto a handgun in an attic, the cartoon hero swoops down, raises 
his wing and squawks: ``STOP! Don't touch! Leave the area! Tell an 
adult!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon's Legislature this month passed a measure that would make  
the state the first to adopt the National Rifle Association's Eddie 
Eagle character -- in coloring books, videos and pamphlets -- as a 
mandatory part of the school curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents who don't necessarily have a problem with the  
message are leery of the nation's largest gun lobbying group being 
the messenger. They are urging the governor to veto the bill and 
spare schoolchildren from what they see as ``the Joe Camel of the 
gun industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inappropriate for a school to bring the NRA into the  
classroom to teach children about guns,'' said Democratic state 
Sen. Ginny Burdick. ``I've seen how the NRA has dealt with gun 
violence. They've opposed even the most basic laws to keep people 
safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon's Eddie Eagle bill was among a few gun measures that  
received extra attention in the wake of the Columbine High School 
massacre in Colorado. Said Republican Sen. Tom Hartung: ``We need 
to do everything possible to avert misuse of firearms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What makes this measure unique is that it goes beyond simply  
calling for some kind of gun education in schools and picks the 
NRA's Eddie Eagle specifically as the mandatory program. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled,'' said Kathy Cassidy, the NRA's Eddie Eagle  
program manager. ``Other states teach the program, but they haven't 
mandated it. The Oregon Legislature is in the forefront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some parents don't share that enthusiasm.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want my son learning about guns from the NRA,''  
Cynthia Nawalinski, parent of a Portland second-grader. ``I don't 
think that children should be talking about guns in school. Guns 
are in movies, on TV and the media all the time. I feel the more we 
talk about guns, the more the children will be attracted to guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. John Kitzhaber has not indicated whether he will veto the  
bill but has said through a spokesman that he is not fond of school 
mandates of any kind and is also troubled by choosing the NRA's 
Eddie Eagle out of the hundreds of gun safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Developed in 1988, the Eddie Eagle program has by the NRA's  
estimate reached 12 million youngsters in schools across the 
country. The message, according to the NRA's literature, ``neither 
offers nor asks for any value judgment concerning firearms. ... 
Just as Smokey Bear teaches children not to play with matches, 
Eddie Eagle teaches them that firearms are not toys, and should not 
be touched without adult supervision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program at no time involves the use of real guns, but  
coloring book exercises, rhymes and mini-dramatizations with a 
teacher in an Eddie Eagle costume to drive the message home to even 
preschoolers. 
</P>
<P>
	Traci Rees, a risk management specialist at the Sherwood School  
District near Portland, used Eddie Eagle in kindergarten through 
fourth grade this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had Eddie Eagle come dressed in costume -- a big full-body  
costume with the mask, fake fur,'' she said. ``The children loved 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Polish Bid Based on Olympic Ideals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAKOPANE, Poland (AP) -- Suffering from a dilapidated  
infrastructure and a lack of sports facilities, this faded resort 
is counting on a unique -- and iffy -- strategy to win the 2006 
Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``If no other factors than the Olympic charter and Olympic  
ideals decide, then Zakopane is one of the strongest candidates,'' 
Mayor Adam Bachleda-Curus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers of the Polish bid will stress the country's new  
democracy and Zakopane's tradition as a major European skiing and 
tourism destination before World War II when they get 60 minutes to 
persuade the International Olympic Committee this week in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy is to deflect attention from problems, such as poor  
transportation links, that make Zakopane a decided underdog against 
five challengers, led by favorites Sion, Switzerland and Turin, 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	A vibrant community of 30,000 at the foot of the picturesque  
High Tatras, surrounded by rocky, snowcapped peaks and magnificent 
lakes, Zakopane needs a lot of modern amenities after decades of 
neglect during communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
	It lacks sufficient sports facilities and lodging, while its  
roads and rail links need upgrading. Bachleda-Curus and other bid 
officials acknowledge the weak points, but argue that winning the 
games would help Poland improve existing facilities and build new 
sports complexes in Zakopane, nearby Nowy Targ and the historical 
city of Krakow, 60 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC changed the bidding rules in March in response to the  
bribery scandal that rocked the Olympic movement. New regulations 
barred visits by IOC members to bid cities -- a practice linked to 
bribery in the past -- and focused the procedure on each city's 
60-minute presentation in Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
	Bachleda-Curus said Zakopane has prepared a film and an  
unspecified artistic performance, presenting Poland and the bid 
city while emphasizing how the Olympic Charter calls for spreading 
Olympic ideals throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to show Poland's successes, the great achievements we  
can be proud of in the economy, culture and sports, to show that 
Poland is a country with a 1,000-year history, playing a big 
international role,'' Bachleda-Curus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrzej Bac, a senior campaign official, said the presentation  
will stress how Poland has changed since toppling communism 10 
years ago to become fully democratic, with one of Europe's 
fastest-growing economies. It belongs to NATO and is negotiating to 
join the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``This proves that all we presented in our project can be  
executed smoothly,'' Bac said. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC evaluation report published in January praised Zakopane's  
sports plan, but stressed that sports, accommodation and transport 
facilities need upgrading. It also raised questions about financing 
and objections from environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
	Bachleda-Curus said Zakopane reacted to the IOC report by moving  
the downhill skiing site to a new venue in Slovakia, just across 
the border. 
</P>
<P>
	The original site was at Kasprowy Wierch mountain in the Tatra  
National Park, designated a UNICEF nature reserve in 1992. 
Environmental groups and others criticized plans to cut down trees 
and make other changes to prepare the site for Olympic skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the government has promised money for sports  
facilities, improved rail links and a better highway from Zakopane 
to Krakow, the Renaissance city where figure skating and hockey 
events would be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Famous for its carved wooden houses and locals -- known as  
highlanders -- wearing woolen embroidered clothes, Zakopane was a 
leading European winter resort before World War II, playing host to 
World Nordic Ski Championships in 1929 and 1939. Development 
stopped under communist rule, but new shops, restaurants and hotels 
have opened in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	International sports events also returned, including ski jumping  
World Cups at Wielka Krokiew hill, a rare natural ski jump. 
</P>
<P>
	The High Tatras would be a new location for the Olympics, a  
point emphasized when Bachleda-Curus argues that only nine 
countries have hosted the 20 Winter Olympics to date. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it continues like this, then we could agree to have  
Olympics in Innsbruck every four years,'' he said, referring to the 
Austrian town with a rich Olympic history. ``But that would be 
against the Olympic Charter.''

<HEADLINE> Lolita's Story To Be Printed in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A retelling of ``Lolita'' from the nymphet's  
point of view will be published in the United States under an 
agreement with author Vladimir Nabokov's son, who had called the 
new book a rip-off. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal with new publisher Foxrock Inc., Dmitri Nabokov  
will write a preface, and author Pia Pera will write an afterword 
to the English-language U.S. edition. Both will receive 5 percent 
of royalties from the edition, The New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, publisher Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux had settled a  
copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Dmitri Nabokov by canceling 
plans to publish ``Lo's Diary'' this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, published in Italy and several other countries, can  
now be published in Britain and is set for an October U.S. 
publishing date. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also protects the copyright interests of Dmitri  
Nabokov in his late father's book, which has sold 50 million copies 
in 20 languages. 
</P>
<P>
	But because there was no legal ruling, the question of how far  
authors can go in using characters and scenes created by others 
remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	In her book, Ms. Pera, 42, parodies Nabokov's story of a  
middle-age professor sexually obsessed with a 12-year-old girl, 
writing the tale from the child's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit to block U.S. and British publication of ``Lo's  
Diary'' was filed in Manhattan federal court in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit claimed the book is ``inferior and amateurish  
merchandise'' that tarnishes the reputation of Nabokov's original 
work. ``Lolita,'' published in the United States in 1955 by Random 
House, is protected under copyright until 2050.

<HEADLINE> Entertainment Sector Lobbies House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anxious to defeat new violence labels and  
possible sales restrictions, entertainment industry lobbyists 
whipped up a First Amendment argument that found a sympathetic 
audience among a large number of House Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	A 48-hour lobbying blitz by the rich industry ended in success  
Thursday when the House defeated a legislative provision that would 
have required labeling of violent content in entertainment products 
such as video games. 
</P>
<P>
	Late Wednesday, the House also defeated a provision that would  
have curtailed youth access to explicit sexual or violent material 
in books, movies and other entertainment genres. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry lobbyists said they borrowed a page from gun lobbyists,  
who frequently appeal to the Constitution's Second Amendment right 
to bear arms to argue against gun control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that we say around here is if you like the  
Second Amendment, you're going to love the First Amendment,'' said 
Judith Platt, a spokeswoman for the Association of American 
Publishers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., who voted against the provisions,  
said the constitutional argument was effective among many 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the conservatives wanted to do something to keep these  
extremely violent videos and sexually explicit movies away from 
young people,'' Hutchinson said. ``But if we're having a battle to 
protect the Second Amendment, it's also about the First 
Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A coalition of media groups -- including the publishers,  
booksellers, broadcasters and movie studios -- used letters, phone 
calls and face-to-face meetings to make their pitch. The industry 
donates more than $7 million per election cycle to federal 
candidates and political parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``We worked it hard,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the  
Motion Picture Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for labeling video games and other forms of  
entertainment was advanced by Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., and Bart 
Stupak, D-Mich. Both argued that the government requires labeling 
on food, and should do likewise on sources of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are killing children,'' Wamp said. ``I've had enough  
of it. I'm going to side with parents today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Former Rep. Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo., who now heads the  
Association of American Publishers, signed a letter with Avin Mark 
Domnitz, head of the American Booksellers Association. She then 
sent the letter to all 435 House members, attaching a personal note 
to lawmakers she used to serve with. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter called the legislation ``a blatantly unconstitutional  
effort by Congress to address the problem of juvenile violence by 
destroying basic First Amendment rights of young people and 
adults.''

<HEADLINE> 76ers Owner Hurt in Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEPTFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Philadelphia 76ers owner Pat Croce was  
injured Thursday in a motorcycle accident shortly after beginning a 
planned coast-to-coast trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Rob Wilson said Thursday evening that Croce was  
undergoing surgery at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Center 
in Philadelphia for multiple fractures of his left leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital spokeswoman Roseann Thompson said he was listed in fair  
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police said the accident happened at 4:36 p.m. on Route  
55. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said Croce had pulled over to the side of the road and  
another motorcycle hit him. He didn't know if that biker was part 
of Croce's group. Several motorcyclists had embarked on the trip 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	The bikers had just set out from Croce's Ocean City home on what  
they envisioned as a coast-to-coast trip lasting about a week. None 
of the group continued on the trip after the accident, Wilson said.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Russia Move Toward Troop Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The United States and Russia struggled  
today to clinch an agreement giving Russia a peacekeeping role in 
Kosovo under NATO command. U.S. officials insisted Moscow not be 
given sole control over any part of the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have made quite clear there would not be a separate Russian  
sector,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told reporters as 
she arrived at the presidential palace to greet Finnish President 
Martti Ahtisaari and join the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials spoke optimistically of making substantial progress  
during the second day of talks. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon, 
who sat in on the negotiations, told reporters the United States 
had given the Russians ``a very detailed proposal on the last major 
remaining issue'' and was awaiting a Russian reply. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one of a number of proposals that has been traded back  
and forth,'' Bacon said, noting that ``differences have narrowed'' 
during the course of today's talks. He declined to identify the 
remaining obstacle, but other officials said it was U.S. and NATO 
resistance to Moscow's demand that its peacekeepers oversee a 
separate sector of Kosovo. NATO is resisting this out of fear it 
would partition Kosovo, a development that would undermine the 
allies' goal of permitting free movement of displaced ethnic 
Albanians throughout the province, where Serbs are a minority. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, former Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, who helped  
broker the Kosovo peace deal, told a news conference that serious 
differences remained, although he was not directly involved in the 
talks. ``We left no doubt that the Russian contingent will never be 
subordinate to NATO commanders,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading the negotiations in Helsinki were Defense Secretary  
William Cohen and Russian Defense Minister Marshall Igor Sergeyev, 
joined later by Albright and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told reporters as he left the negotiations for an  
afternoon stroll along the city's sun-splashed inner harbor that 
``creative arrangements'' were being pursued to resolve remaining 
disputes, but he refused to discuss any details. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not resolved all the remaining issues,'' Cohen said.  
``There can be no agreement until everything is agreed upon. 
Everything we have now is only tentative in nature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev said today's session started by summarizing the  
progress made in Wednesday's negotiations, which lasted past 
midnight, then focus on the remaining disagreements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shall try to do it today,'' Sergeyev said. Cohen said the  
talks could stretch into Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin said today that Russia won't back down  
on its demand that Russian peacekeeping troops in Kosovo control 
their own sector and he relayed that stance when he spoke by 
telephone from Moscow with Sergeyev. 
</P>
<P>
	``In principle, most of the issues have been resolved  
peacefully,'' Yeltsin said in comments broadcast on television. 
``But one question, which I would undoubtedly call the principal 
one, is sectors. In other words, they don't want to give Russia a 
sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the snag, President Clinton predicted a ``successful  
conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The atmosphere is pretty positive and pretty hopeful,''  
Clinton told reporters on the lawn of Elysee Palace after a meeting 
with French President Jacques Chirac. ``I hope and believe they 
will reach a successful conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, Clinton said the NATO allies would not abandon  
their insistence that all peacekeeping forces in Kosovo -- Russian 
or otherwise -- operate under a single command. The Russians have 
insisted that their troops not come under a NATO commander. 
</P>
<P>
	One approach being pursued is to assign the Russians their own  
``zone of responsibility,'' but to place it within one of the 
already established ``sectors'' overseen by one of five NATO 
countries -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The talks at the presidential palace appeared to have produced a  
preliminary understanding on joint use of the airport at Pristina, 
where about 200 Russian troops have been holed up since their 
surprise arrival Saturday ahead of NATO peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, asked whether he foresaw a final deal today, replied,  
``We hope so, but there are issues that remain to be resolved.'' 
Later, he told reporters the talks could drag on until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said that if a U.S.-Russian accord were reached in  
Helsinki, he would recommend its approval by NATO officials. He was 
due to travel to NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, on Friday, 
and then visit U.S. troops in the Balkans.

<HEADLINE> Open Promises To Be Entertaining  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- For the fans who surround the greens at  
Pinehurst No. 2, this might be the most entertaining U.S. Open in 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	It might also prove to be the most interactive.  
</P>
<P>
	``The gallery is going to get some business,'' Davis Love III  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	While one shot common in recent Opens -- the sideways hack out of  
the rough -- was missing as play began today in the 99th U.S. Open, 
a hundred others figure to replace it in and around the sloping 
greens of Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
	With players unafraid to go for the greens out of the relatively  
light rough, balls that once would be hacked back to fairways will 
instead be sent skyward with varying degrees of control toward the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	The result could be that those missing the fairway could pay  
even worse than in the deeper rough of past Opens. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've done a great job of keeping the rough at a certain  
height where you can get aggressive,'' Greg Norman said. ``But that 
aggression could come out and bite you at some time during the 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's precisely what Open officials would like to see on a  
course suddenly more vulnerable to low scores after being softened 
by a few days of rain. 
</P>
<P>
	They envision players emboldened by tame lies in the rough  
ricocheting balls off of greens and into galleries, leaving them 
nearly impossible chips back toward the hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players may be tempted to hit a long shot toward the putting  
green, and on that basis they have little or no control over the 
golf ball,'' said Trey Holland, who heads the Open for the United 
States Golf Association. ``Where it ends up is going to be 
anybody's best guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Woods, for one, wants his shots to end up short, since  
being behind the Donald Ross-designed greens means almost certain 
bogey and possibly worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you get the ball in the rough and have a hot lie, I think  
you've got to always be conservative and put the ball short,'' 
Woods said. ``You have to make sure if it does come out hot, it's 
not going to zip over the green.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Woods or any of the world's best golfers are  
complaining about the course after years of playing out of 
ankle-deep rough. 
</P>
<P>
	Quite the opposite, they're bordering on ecstatic.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the best U.S. Open I've seen, and that's pretty much  
the word on the driving range and the putting green,'' Norman said. 
``It's going to be an Open that's more of an international Open. A 
lot more players could win this golf tournament than we've seen in 
the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A lot -- 156 to be exact -- will be trying as play began this  
morning under expected rainy conditions on the par-70 course 
stretched to 7,175 yards for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy rain that fell early Wednesday evening will make the  
course play even longer, but will also allow players to hit more 
approach shots with less fear of them bounding over the back of the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they were hoping we don't get a lot of rain because it  
will change the complexity of the course,'' said Payne Stewart, who 
led last year for three rounds before being overtaken by Lee 
Janzen. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen won his second Open last year at the Olympic Club in San  
Francisco, but that was on a more traditional Open layout with 
thick, wet rough and tight fairways that made it difficult to keep 
the ball in play. 
</P>
<P>
	Janzen won by playing steady on the final day and staying out of  
the deep rough that lined the fairways and surrounded the greens. 
The winner at Pinehurst will most likely become the U.S. Open 
champion by figuring out the best way to get the ball up-and-down 
from the various shaved surfaces just off the greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be real interesting to see how we choose to play  
different golf shots,'' Stewart said. ``I think that's what is 
really going to make the Open here at Pinehurst very special. 
There's just not one way to play a golf shot out there.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft To Publish Dictionary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. is publishing an English  
dictionary, building on the success of the Encarta encyclopedia 
CD-ROM that has made the software company the nation's top 
encyclopedia publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Microsoft Encarta World English Dictionary will be published  
Aug. 4, in time for the back-to-school selling season, The Wall 
Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The new dictionary, developed from scratch, will be bundled into  
the Encarta Reference Suite 2000 with the encyclopedia, an atlas 
and access to an online service. 
</P>
<P>
	But unlike the Encarta encyclopedia, which is only available for  
computer use, the dictionary also will be published in traditional 
print form. St. Martin's Press will publish the American version, 
Bloomsbury Publishing PLC for the United Kingdom and Pan Macmillan 
Australia Pty. Ltd. for Australia, according to the Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	The multiple versions indicate Microsoft's efforts to make the  
Encarta dictionary a global reference book, particularly for 
English-speaking e-mail users who communicate with people from 
other countries where English words can have different meanings. 
</P>
<P>
	Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft has not yet released a price for  
the new Encarta software package or the print version of the 
dictionary, but the company said it will be comparably priced to 
the current Encarta suite that is available for about $69 with 
rebates. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft already offers an American Heritage dictionary in its  
Bookshelf 2000 software package.

<HEADLINE> New Mexico: Red or Green? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- Plenty of states have an official bird, or  
an official flower, but an official question? 
</P>
<P>
	``Red or Green?'' goes into effect Friday as New Mexico's  
official state question. 
</P>
<P>
	The query, which is estimated to be uttered between 175,000 to  
200,000 times a day in New Mexico, does not refer to the status of 
a traffic light. It's the kind of chili pepper restaurant customers 
desire on their New Mexico cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all part of tourism. It's all part of the allure of  
coming to New Mexico. We think we have the best chili in the 
world,'' Richard Buratti, executive vice president of the New 
Mexico Restaurant Association, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buratti says chili is part of at least 25 percent of the meals  
prepared at New Mexico restaurants. It's found on everything from 
eggs ranchero at breakfast and burritos at dinner, but with two 
kinds of chili, waitresses need to know which should be used. 
</P>
<P>
	Chili is grown in New Mexico and is one of its major crops,  
valued at $58 million last year. It is also one of two official 
state vegetables, the other being the pinto bean. 
</P>
<P>
	In another designation going into effect Friday, the state will  
now officially be known as ``The Land of Enchantment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1930s, New Mexico's unofficial nickname was the  
``Sunshine State.'' However, Florida adopted it. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Mexico tourism industry has used ``The Land of  
Enchantment'' moniker for years, but putting it into law should 
dissuade other states from stealing it, supporters said.

banking that pays their household bills. 
</P>

	The Lutheran Brotherhood insurance and service company, which is  
promoting this so-called ``simply giving'' program, said that 
Olivet Lutheran Church of La Crosse, Wis., has become the 1,000th 
congregation to opt for tithes automatically deducted from bank 
personal accounts.

	DEKALB, Ill. (AP) -- The Rev. Gregory Dell was elected from

the 2000 national conference of the United Methodist Church.

<P>
	Dell was elected even though he was convicted by a church court  
after conducting a blessing ceremony for a homosexual couple. The 
defiant Northern Illinois conference also recommended the national 
meeting drop its policy that ``the practice of homosexuality is 
incompatible with Christian teaching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the United Methodist News Service, local Bishop C.  
Joseph Sprague ruled that Dell was eligible for election because 
his suspension has not yet taken place, but he said he cannot be 
seated by the national conference if the suspension is in effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell is appealing his conviction. He is to be suspended from his  
Chicago parish assignment July 5. At that time he is to become 
staff leader of a pro-gay caucus backed by 1,430 Methodist clergy.

 *100 years for Newark Cathedral Basilica    	
</P>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The Cathedral Basilica of the Sacred Heart  
celebrated its centennial with a Mass attended by Archbishop 
Gabriel Montalvo, the Vatican's representative to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	The cathedral is taller than Notre Dame in Paris, Westminster  
Abbey in London and St. Patrick's in New York. Its stained-glass 
windows are among the largest in the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
	But for years it was overlooked by tourists because of its  
location in a rundown inner-city neighborhood. That changed in 1995 
with a visit from Pope John Paul II. He was so impressed that he 
made the cathedral a minor basilica, a papal honor associated with 
churches of great beauty or significance. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Pope's visit, ``thousands of people come through a  
year,'' said Rev. Armand Mantia, who has been giving tours of the 
cathedral for 18 years. ``The numbers have just skyrocketed.''

<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- A Yale-trained minister has been nominated to  
become president of the 1.4-million member United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
	The nomination of the Rev. John H. Thomas, a 1975 graduate of  
Yale Divinity School, was approved by church agency boards. It will 
now be sent before the annual General Synod in Providence, R.I., in 
July. The current UCC president, the Rev. Paul Sherry, is retiring 
in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas, 48, currently is the UCC ecumenical officer, directing  
contacts with other churches. He helped achieve the 1997 agreement

the Trinity Life Center property. And until it's cleared up, the 
church is divided: by a wide orange line painted across the parking 
lot and up the back of the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Businessman Shelcy Mullins Jr. painted the line to separate his  
claims from the church's. But Pastor John McCarroll says the 
interdenominational church, built in 1987, owns it all. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of the church Mullins claims includes a storage room for  
heat pumps, a nursery, the children's church and a large 
Sunday-school room. He has made no effort to stop the church from 
using those areas. But the congregation is parking elsewhere and 
walking a bit farther to worship. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Mullins nor his attorney, Freddy Adkins, would discuss  
the details of the land dispute. But Adkins said, ``We feel after 
all of this comes out, we'll show he's not the villain he's being 
made out to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarroll has asked the Wise County Circuit Court to intercede,  
and he put up a sign of his own inside the interdenominational 
church: ``The setbacks in life can only draw you closer to God.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak: Good Service or Free Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak is offering a deal it hopes few  
travelers can resist: Get good service or a free ride. 
</P>
<P>
	The national passenger rail company announced its service pledge  
Thursday as part on an effort to capture traffic from airplanes and 
autos. The pledge came on the same day airline companies announced 
voluntary steps to address growing complaints from passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak, which must wean itself from federal operating subsidies  
by 2003, hopes its planned service improvements -- such as flowers 
in bathrooms and entertainment for children -- will boost revenues 
by $85 million over three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Long-term success here has to do with doing it right, getting  
it right and increasing market share,'' said George Warrington, 
Amtrak's president and chief executive. ``The only way we can do it 
is to ensure a consistent set of standards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Central to winning customers' confidence is Amtrak's new pledge:  
Amtrak will offer dissatisfied passengers a refund voucher good for 
future travel. 
</P>
<P>
	That guarantee will take effect later this year, after the  
railroad completes other service initiatives, including training 
and incentives for all 24,000 employees, enhanced food-service 
options and improved onboard amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's major airlines are trying to negotiate voluntary  
protections to stave off passenger-rights directives from Congress. 
Among the improvements announced Thursday were plans to tell 
customers the lowest available ticket price and handle bumped 
passengers with fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak spokesman John Wolf estimated that only one out of every  
1,000 passengers will request a refund voucher. Amtrak is offering 
vouchers, instead of refunds on the current trip, to give itself a 
second chance to woo the customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak still faces hurdles, such as limited routes and  
schedules, in becoming a true alternative to airlines. But Wolf 
said the guarantees should help the railroad set itself apart from 
other travel modes. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Amtrak announced a high-speed service to lure  
travelers who now fly the lucrative Washington-New York-Boston 
shuttle route. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak also is developing other high-speed rail corridors  
elsewhere, including one linking Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan,

<HEADLINE> Kellogg May Close Part of Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- The nation's largest cereal maker  
announced today it is considering closing part of its historic 
Battle Creek cereal plant and eliminating up to 64 percent of the 
jobs at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, up to 700 of the current 1,100 jobs at the  
Kellogg Co. plant would be eliminated as early as the first quarter 
of 2000, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Streamlining our operations and avoiding future costs would  
help keep our North American cereal business cost-competitive going 
into the 21st century,'' new chief executive Carlos M. Gutierrez 
said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes seven months after Kellogg cut 525 jobs -- 21  
percent of its salaried workforce -- as part of a reorganization of 
its North American operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement is part of ``an ongoing thing with  
Kellogg,'' said analyst Christopher Jakubik of Warburg Dillon Read 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg has regained some of its sales volume recently but  
continues to find itself in a very tough business environment, 
Jakubik said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You still have too many players,'' he said. ``There's still  
very limited growth in the category.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Kellogg was off 50  
cents a share at $33.50 by early afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg will not say what percentage of its overall production  
comes from its Battle Creek plant, which makes Kellogg's Corn 
Flakes. It now is Kellogg's largest plant in North America, but 
would drop to third if the cuts are made. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Battle Creek-based cereal maker decides to close part of  
the plant, the company said some of the operations would be 
relocated to other Kellogg North America cereal plants for an 
estimated annual savings of $35 million to $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 700 jobs that would be cut would not be replaced at  
other plants, Joseph Stewart, Kellogg's executive vice president of 
communications, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of plant date back to 1907, the year after the Kellogg Co.  
made Battle Creek its headquarters, and the company cannot afford 
to keep it running because it's so inefficient, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was at one time a major tourist attraction. An  
estimated 175,000 people visited it each year before the tours 
ended in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a nonprofit group opened Cereal City USA in downtown  
Battle Creek. The company contributed millions to help build the 
attraction, which features exhibits on cereal history, a simulated 
cereal production line and a show featuring the characters used in 
Kellogg's advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg will make a final decision about the closure after  
discussions with the union that represents the plant's hourly 
workers. The company met will all employees this morning 30 minutes 
before making its announcement to reporters gathered for a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez said in April that although Battle Creek produces a  
lot of cereal, the plant would have to remain competitive and 
continue to improve its productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	And analysts have previously said Kellogg needs to do more if it  
is to regain its shrinking market share. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Kellogg reported a 30 percent drop in first-quarter  
earnings, but the cereal maker pointed to an increase in sales as 
an indicator of future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were in line with Wall Street estimates.

<HEADLINE>  War Crimes Evidence Is Studied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- U.N. war crimes investigators are studying what  
appears to be a Serb-run torture center in the Kosovo capital of 
Pristina, the Foreign Office said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Office Minister Geoff Hoon also said NATO now fears Serb  
soldiers and special police may have killed 10,000 of Kosovo's 
Albanian majority in more than 100 massacres as part of their 
campaign to ethnically cleanse the province. 
</P>
<P>
	Briefing reporters, Hoon said British paratroopers have sealed  
off a five-story concrete building that was the headquarters of 
departing Serb military police in Pristina where torture is 
reported to have taken place. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoon said British forces have found knives, rubber and wooden  
batons, baseball bats ``with Serb slogans carved into them,'' a 
wooden crate full of brass knuckles, and ``savage pornography and 
drugs, presumably used to sedate victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists taken to the building reported that one room, where  
Kosovar Albanian women were allegedly raped, contained boxes of 
condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The most chilling aspect, said Hoon, is that the building ``does  
not appear to have been a special holding center for the Serbs' 
victims. It seems to have been just an ordinary police 
headquarters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``In other words, the barbaric acts carried out in this building  
were probably almost a matter of routine. We can expect similar 
discoveries elsewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hoon said that outside the building ``there is a trail of  
charred paper leading to an incinerator,'' apparently indicating 
that the Serbs tried to burn evidence of their alleged crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoon said the further NATO peacekeeping forces penetrate as they  
move into Kosovo following last week's peace deal that ended the 
allies' 78-day air campaign, the higher they put the death toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``According to the reports we had gathered, mostly from the  
refugees, it appeared that around 10,000 people had been killed in 
more than 100 massacres,'' he said. ``The final total may be much 
worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Glasgow's Daily Record newspaper said two of its  
journalists and their Albanian interpreter were injured when gunmen 
fired at their car near the southern village of Stimjle. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Record said reporter Simon Houston, 30, suffered a  
grazed head and an injured arm and photographer Chris Watt, 29, who 
was driving, was also grazed by a bullet Wednesday night. 
Interpreter Xherdet Shabani was shot in the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were treated at the British army camp at Stimjle.  
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear who was responsible, but the  
newspaper said a rebel wing of the Kosovo Liberation Army may have 
mistaken the journalists for Serbs fleeing the province ahead of 
NATO troops. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, two journalists from the German newsweekly Stern were  
shot to death as they drove near Dulje. Their interpreter was found 
dead nearby.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Holds at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit held steady in April --  
though still at a record high -- amid early signs that U.S. 
companies are selling more products to foreign countries recovering 
from recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it cannot be said that the world's markets for U.S  
products is booming again, it certainly does look as if the bottom 
has been reached,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff 
Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	April's trade deficit of $18.9 billion matched a revised  
estimate of the deficit in March, the Commerce Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government originally had pegged the March deficit at $19.7  
billion. The new, lower March estimate, however, was still a record 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Global economic troubles that started nearly two years ago in  
Asia have hampered America's trade performance as overseas markets 
for U.S. products have dwindled and a flood of cheap imports causes 
stiff competition for domestic producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting how badly America's trade picture has deteriorated,  
the government released a separate report Thursday showing that the 
deficit in the current account -- the broadest measure of trade -- 
hit an all-time high of $68.6 billion in the first three months of 
this year. The current account covers not only trade in merchandise 
and services, which are reflected in the regular monthly report, 
but also investment flows and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	American exports have started to pick up this spring, however,  
as other countries have begun a tentative recovery from recession. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports, which had fallen for five previous months, staged  
a small comeback in April, rising 1.2 percent to $78 billion. The 
improvement touched all product categories from foods to consumer 
goods such as appliances, and industrial supplies including cotton 
cloth and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports also continued to rise, climbing 1 percent to $97  
billion in April, a record high. Nevertheless, there were several 
bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports from Japan dropped for the first time since November,  
pulling the sensitive deficit with the Asian economic powerhouse 
down 13.1 percent to $5.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the trade deficit with Mexico, a partner in the  
controversial North American Free Trade Agreement, also declined in 
April by 32.5 percent to $1.7 billion due to a sharp drop in 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	And imports of motor vehicles and parts declined in April by 5.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, National Association of Manufacturers president  
Jerry Jasinowski said that ``slow economic growth abroad is 
continuing to hurt manufacturers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with the 15-nation European Union increased by  
9.7 percent to $2.9 billion in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, imports from China rose to $5.8 billion, the highest since  
November. That helped push the U.S. trade deficit with China -- the 
second-biggest with any country behind Japan -- up by 15.7 percent 
to $4.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the April deficit with countries belonging to the  
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- which agreed this 
spring to limit production in the face of falling world demand for 
oil -- more than doubled in April to $1.8 billion, the most since 
October 1997. That was largely due to a sharp spike in oil and gas 
prices because of the production limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials have argued that while such a  
high overall trade deficit is not sustainable indefinitely, it has 
a positive side: As the only major economy doing well, the United 
States is playing a valuable role providing markets for other 
countries struggling to get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists also note that cheap imports have helped keep  
inflation low here during a period of unusually high employment and 
heavy spending by Americans.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Hostage Standoff in Second Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- Two nursing supervisors at the state's  
largest mental hospital were taken hostage by a fired employee, and 
they remained hostage this morning more than 24 hours after their 
ordeal began. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were negotiating by phone with Dennis Czajkowski, 40, a  
nurse who told authorities his dismissal from Norristown State 
Hospital in this Philadelphia suburb was unjust, Capt. Thomas 
LaCrosse said today. 
</P>
<P>
	LaCrosse said police had no plans to storm the building;  
instead, the plan was to wait him out. Police were working in 
shifts to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``As time wears on, it plays in our favor,'' LaCrosse said. ``We  
don't want him to do something rash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State police spokesman Robert Whitbeck said Czajkowski walked  
into Norristown State Hospital's Building 2, which houses nursing 
administration offices, at 10:45 a.m. Wednesday and fired his gun 
once into the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
	When three guards approached him, he fired four more rounds into  
the air, Whitbeck said. No one was hurt by any of the shots, but 
nursing supervisors Maria Jordan and Carol Kepner were taken 
hostage. They were in good shape and had not been physically 
abused, Whitbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Negotiations are still continuing in a positive manner. The  
goal at this point in time is to have the three individuals come 
out uninjured,'' Trooper Dave Lester said about 11 a.m., as the 
standoff entered its second day. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been some visual contact'' with Czajkowski, Lester  
said. He would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	The area is not near any patients in the sprawling hospital  
complex. Areas away from the nursing offices continued to operate 
normally today, with workers showing up for their regular shifts. 
</P>
<P>
	LaCrosse said the man had ordered pizza overnight. The power  
remained on in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said he was fired two months ago but did not say  
why. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia Inquirer today quoted unidentified  
law-enforcement officials as saying Czajkowski has an extensive 
history of mental illness and drug use, and was upset over a recent 
breakup with a girlfriend. There is a warrant for his arrest in 
Upper Merion Township, the newspaper reported, but police would not 
comment about that. 
</P>
<P>
	The 118-year-old hospital, situated on 233 acres, has a locked  
area where the worst of the criminally insane are kept, and also 
serves the chronically mentally ill. It has about 650 patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors have sought tighter security after dozens of patients  
walked away from the hospital without permission in the past two 
years.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Mixed on Gun Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democratic presidential candidate Bill  
Bradley said Thursday that the legislative amendment passed by the 
House allowing the posting of the Ten Commandments in schools may 
be unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential candidates had a broad range of reaction to the Ten  
Commandment amendment to gun control legislation. The amendment 
passed the House by a 248-180 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will have to be tested in the courts,'' said Bradley said  
of the amendment. ``My hunch is it's unlikely to pass 
constitutional muster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Gore, Democratic front-runner, said: ``It's a lot  
easier to childproof a gun than to bulletproof a child.'' Texas 
Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP front-runner, said states and 
localities should have the authority to make their own decisions 
about their own schools, said spokeswoman Mindy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP presidential candidate, Gary Bauer took partial credit for  
the measure, saying the amendment is ``a bill I helped draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe if more American children read the Ten Commandments  
and are taught what they mean, they will predictably engage in less 
crime,'' he said, noting the sentiment for religion in the schools 
after the recent student massacre in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to Littleton, Colo.,'' Bauer said. ``What you see are  
little handmade signs everywhere, 'Let our children pray,' and 
'Bring religion back in to our schools.' I think there's something 
stirring out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another GOP candidate, Steve Forbes, called the House's approval  
of displaying the Ten Commandments ``a positive thing. The Ten 
Commandments, we need to understand and adhere to. The more we see 
them, the better off we'll be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley was in Los Angeles to lay out his agenda on guns, which  
included a call for a ban on ``junk'' handguns, the inexpensive, 
cheaply made weapons most often linked to crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``These can explode in a user's hand,'' the former three-term  
senator from New Jersey said while holding up a Lorcin .380 
semiautomatic gun. ``They are dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley called the gun one of the 10 most often used in crimes  
and said that in Los Angeles alone there are 45 varieties of such 
guns. He quoted numbers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms that show 81 percent of the guns it links to crimes can be 
called junk guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The stance seemed a slight retreat from reports last month that  
Bradley was considering pushing a ban on the sale of all handguns. 
His aides say the ban on all handgun sales is a long-range goal, 
but they were announcing measures that could be pursued 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who is challenging Gore for the Democratic presidential  
nomination, said Thursday that he would support a ban on both the 
possession and sale of junk guns, also known as Saturday night 
specials. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley also proposed a one-per-month limit on handgun  
purchases, banning anyone convicted of domestic violence from 
owning a gun, restricting firearms dealers to commercial areas, 
bumping up the cost of licenses for gun dealers, requiring a 
registration process for handguns similar to auto registration, and 
requiring background checks on buyers at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Background checks are one of several issues in an expected  
Congressional showdown over a juvenile crime bill. Gun control 
advocates back a proposal by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-New York, 
saying that a background check may take up to three business days 
while some have argued for shorter waiting periods. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley supports the checks but gave no specifics on a waiting  
period, choosing instead to focus on the junk guns. Bradley also 
said he wants to require trigger locks for all handguns, a measure 
some gun manufacturers have already taken up voluntarily.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Road racing expert Boris Said, making his  
first start this year in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, won the 
pole position for Friday's Grainger 225 race at Portland 
International Raceway.

<HEADLINE> Man Says He Accidentally Killed Wife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A man accused of stabbing his wife 44 times and  
dumping her body in a swimming pool told jurors he was sleepwalking 
at the time and never would have consciously harmed her. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way I could do that, not intentionally,'' Scott  
Falater testified Wednesday at his capital murder trial. ``I loved 
her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falater, 43, doesn't deny killing his wife and stashing the  
knife before police arrived. He claims to have no memory of the 
attack, which his attorneys say took place during a sleepwalking 
episode that lasted 45 to 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Falater wept as he described a near-perfect marriage to his wife  
of 20 years, Yarmila, who was slain at their home in 1997. He said 
he adored his wife, a medical technician and basket weaver who gave 
up her medical career to stay home with their two children. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by his attorney, Michael Kimerer, what his reaction would  
be if someone had told him he would stab his wife 44 times, Falater 
replied: ``You're out of your mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falater dismissed the prosecution's suggestion that the couple's  
marriage was under strain. Several defense witnesses acknowledged 
that Mrs. Falater had complained about the demands of the Mormon 
Church, in which her husband was an enthusiastic member. 
</P>
<P>
	Falater, who was raised Catholic, noted that his wife also had  
converted to the faith and was active in church activities. 
</P>
<P>
	Falater, an electrical engineer, also denied being unfaithful to  
his wife, as the prosecution contends. His teen-age children 
testified their parents had a harmonious marriage that had never 
been marred by violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution contends Falater's sleepwalking claim is  
nonsense and that his actions were too deliberate to have been the 
work of a sleepwalker. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbor Greg Koons testified he watched over his back-yard  
fence as Falater went inside to wash his hands, ordered his dog to 
lie down, then rolled his wife's body into the pool and held her 
head under water.

<HEADLINE>  Despite Pleas, Texas Kills Canadian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- This time, there was no last-minute  
reprieve to keep Joseph Faulder from becoming the first Canadian to 
be executed in the United States in almost a half-century. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder, 61, avoided the Texas death chamber last December when  
the U.S. Supreme Court issued a reprieve 30 minutes before he was 
to be executed. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday evening, after losing a flurry of legal challenges  
that included support from the Canadian government and Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright, the former auto mechanic was executed by 
injection for killing a 75-year-old Texas woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``No statements,'' he replied when asked if he had anything to  
say. Six minutes later, he was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder didn't deny killing Inez Phillips, but his attorneys  
argued his conviction for the beating and stabbing death was 
tainted because he never was told after his arrest that he could 
seek legal help from Canadian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The right is specified under terms of the Vienna Convention on  
Consular Relations, a treaty signed by both the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	``These issues remain important ones for all Canadians who live,  
work and visit outside of Canada,'' said John Morrow, the 
Dallas-based Canadian consul. ``We deeply regret our request for 
executive clemency was not acted on, but the government of Texas 
has its laws and we respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the State Department, a spokesman aid officials tried a  
variety of appeals, including personal pleas from the Secretary of 
State. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas authorities said Faulder did nothing to inform them he was  
Canadian. He was carrying a Colorado driver's license and had 
applied for one in Texas. It wasn't until 15 years after his arrest 
that his family, who believed he was dead, and the Canadian 
government discovered he was alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder's case attracted wide attention in Canada, a country  
that outlawed capital punishment in 1976. The last execution of a 
Canadian in the United States was in the early 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was being held in Colorado in 1977 on unrelated charges when  
he was accused of murdering Mrs. Phillips during a burglary at her 
home in Gladewater, about 115 miles east of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	A maid found Mrs. Phillips' body with a 6 1/2-inch butcher knife  
embedded in her chest. Faulder's girlfriend, who had accompanied 
him to the house, testified against him.

<HEADLINE> Tour de Suisse Boots Four Cyclists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUESSNACHT AM RIGI, Switzerland (AP) -- Four cyclists were thrown  
out of the Tour de Suisse on Thursday when they flunked a pre-race 
drug test. 
</P>
<P>
	The four showed abnormal levels of red blood cells in tests  
given all 147 riders by the International Cycling Union before the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Gontchar of Ukraine was banned for having a level of red  
blood cells above 50 percent. Also bounced from the race were 
Austrian Harald Morscher, Italian Massimo Gimondi and Timothy Jones 
of Zimbabwe. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian Silvio Martinello won Thursday's third stage of the  
Swiss race. The 36-year-old was only inches ahead of his countryman 
Mario Traversoni and Swiss rider Markus Zberg at the end of the 
137-mile stage from Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	Frenchman Laurent Jalabert held on to the overall lead .  
</P>
<P>
	A high level of red blood cells is an indicator that a rider may  
have been using the banned hormone EPO. The drug allows more oxygen 
to get into the bloodstream, increasing athletic endurance. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the levels can also occur naturally and there is no  
accepted test for the drug. The UCI introduced the 15-day enforced 
rest periods in 1997 because of the danger to riders' health from 
high levels of red blood cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Doping has been a major issue in cycling.  
</P>
<P>
	Tour de France champion Marco Pantani was thrown out of the Tour  
of Italy a day before he would have won the race when his red cell 
count was abnormally high. 
</P>
<P>
	Drug use by the competitors plagued last year's Tour de France  
and resulted in several ejections.

<HEADLINE> Bar Accused of Hiring Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Preferring an Irish brogue to a heavy ``Bahstahn''  
accent for its Irish theme restaurant, a Hilton hotel has turned 
history upside down by allegedly saying only Irish need apply, 
provoking three waitresses to file a discrimination complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	In the last three decades, Gloria DiMartino, Dorothy Webb, and  
Jo Murray have worked at the Logan Airport Ramada, trying hard to 
calm anxious travelers and being happy to entertain a common 
request from tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all want to hear us say 'Pahk the cah in Hahvahd Yahd and  
chowdah,''' said Murray, a 71-year-old waitress and one of three 
who filed a complaint against Beverly Hills, Calif.-based Hilton 
Hotels Corp., which took over management of the Airport Ramada in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't care if they hire students from Ireland, but we  
should have first preference for those jobs,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In September the Hilton plans to open a new hotel and Kitty  
O'Shea's, an Irish theme bar. But the veteran waitresses say 
they're being pushed out of their old jobs by management's decision 
to recruit Irish natives to work in the pub -- a historical reversal 
from the start of the century when signs hung in Boston 
entranceways that read ``Irish Need Not Apply.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, the hotel chain said Thursday: ``Hilton has  
acted and will continue to act consistent with its collective 
bargaining agreement ... and applicable law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hilton spokeswoman Kathy Shepard refused to comment further.  
</P>
<P>
	The waitresses said the hotel is violating a collective  
bargaining contract that states employees with seniority have first 
preference for jobs in the new hotel, restaurant and pub. The women 
also said managers made it clear in a May staff meeting that first 
preference for Kitty O'Shea jobs would be given to employees with 
an Irish accent. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to push us out. And why? Because we don't speak  
with an Irish accent,'' said DiMartino, 55. ``It's discrimination, 
pure and simple.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women have filed a complaint with the Massachusetts  
Commission Against Discrimination and plan to stage protests if the 
hotel doesn't give them first choice of jobs in its planned 
restaurants and bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Managers at another Kitty O'Shea's pub -- unrelated to the  
planned airport pub -- say they hire qualified people, whether they 
have accents or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise McCool, a spokeswoman for the Irish Immigration Center in  
Boston, said Irish restaurants would better serve their patrons by 
teaching them about Irish history rather than focus on the staff's 
accents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the accent that makes a culture,'' McCool said. ``I  
wonder how many people know who Kitty O'Shea was because if they 
did they would know that she didn't stand for exclusion or 
discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kitty O'Shea was a married woman whose relationship with Irish  
nationalist leader Charles Stewart Parnell led to a scandal that 
ended Parnell's career and divided Irish public opinion. Parnell 
married O'Shea after her divorce.

<HEADLINE> Lamar Odom Wants To Return to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Deciding he's not ready for the pros  
after all, Lamar Odom wants to return for another season at Rhode 
Island, university officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'd like to return to URI next season to play basketball. But  
we have to iron out some legalities,'' said John Vanner, Rhode 
Island's assistant athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
	Those legalities are thorny ones.  
</P>
<P>
	Odom, who dropped out after his sophomore year, signed with Jeff  
Klein, an agent based in New York City. Under NCAA rules, anyone 
who signs with an agent is barred from returning to college play. 
Klein said he resigned as Odom's agent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But that break does not clear Odom, said Bill Saum, the NCAA's  
director of agent and gambling activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Signing a contract with an agent is significant,'' Saum told  
The Providence Journal. But he kept the door open, saying that if 
``there are mitigating circumstances, they are examined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The university is helping Odom prepare a long-shot appeal with  
the NCAA in an attempt to revive his collegiate eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear what arguments Rhode Island would use to justify a  
waiver. But Vanner made it clear that he believes Odom needs more 
time to mature, and that the best place to do it is in college. 
</P>
<P>
	``He needs another year to learn the world,'' said Vanner.  
</P>
<P>
	Rhode Island may also need Odom for another year. The 6-foot-10  
forward led Rhode Island in scoring (17.6) and rebounding (9.4) 
last season. He hit a 25-footer at the buzzer to help Rhode Island 
defeat Temple in the Atlantic 10 championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom announced a month ago that he was turning pro, much to  
Rhode Island's disappointment. But his commitment to moving up to 
the pros first came into doubt over the weekend, when he skipped a 
league-wide physical. He later missed a workout with the Charlotte 
Hornets. On Thursday, he did not show up for a workout with the 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the NCAA disregards Odom's contract with Klein, his  
academics may be an issue. He disappeared from campus for days at a 
time last semester, even during exams. University officials said 
Odom's grades are a private matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Vanner said he believes Odom was turned off by what he found out  
about the hustle and bustle of professional basketball in recent 
weeks, when he was courted not just by teams but also by companies 
eager for him to endorse products. 
</P>
<P>
	``During his time away, he realized he was just a piece of  
property,'' said Vanner.

<HEADLINE> Panel Urges Switch to Polio Shots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- A federal panel recommended Thursday that the  
oral polio vaccine that was first given to baby boomers on a sugar 
cube be abandoned in favor of the injected version to reduce the 
risk of contracting the paralyzing disease from the serum itself. 
</P>
<P>
	The oral vaccine, developed by Dr. Albert Sabin, has been used  
for nearly four decades and played a major role in the elimination 
of polio. But because it is made with a live virus, it causes about 
eight people in the United States each year to become infected with 
polio. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, the injectable vaccine developed by the medical  
pioneer Dr. Jonas Salk in the 1950s relies on a killed virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Salk had long insisted his injectable vaccine was safer.  
However, other scientists said it was not as effective at providing 
lifelong immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, however, a committee that advises the Centers for  
Disease Control and Prevention on immunizations decided that the 
benefits of the oral polio vaccine no longer outweigh the risks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If physicians universally take up these recommendations we  
will eliminate vaccine-associated paralytic polio in this 
country,'' said Dr. Paul Offit, chairman of the CDC's Advisory 
Committee on Immunization Practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the recommendations, which would go into effect next year,  
children would receive shots for all four doses of the polio 
vaccine. Currently, children receive two oral vaccinations -- a 
liquid squirted in their mouths -- and two injections. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's recommendations are usually adopted by the CDC,  
and most doctors generally follow CDC guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who had fought to eliminate the oral vaccine in the United  
States were happy with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a bittersweet victory to the extent that our children  
can't benefit from it, but we're happy about the fact that if this 
is implemented fully there will never be another case of polio from 
the vaccine in the United States,'' said John Salamone, whose 
9-year-old son contracted the disease from the oral vaccine in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Salk's vaccine was declared effective in 1955. Not long  
afterward, one manufacturer produced some tainted vaccine that 
infected 204 people, killing 11. The government ordered 
manufacturers to filter the vaccine, a step Salk said reduced its 
effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabin's oral vaccine, once administered on the familiar sugar  
cubes, began to replace Salk's injections in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's vaccine is a stronger version of the one developed by  
Salk. The committee's move Thursday somewhat vindicates the late 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	``His idea was right. At that time, the immunization rate in  
this country was low and the way it was manufactured was not 
perfect,'' Offit said.

<HEADLINE> NASA Discloses Space Station Blunder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A blunder by flight controllers  
prevented the new international space station from moving out of 
the way of dangerous space junk. The rocket debris ended up passing 
at a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA said the sequence of computer commands sent up by flight  
controllers to fire the station's engines over the weekend failed 
because of human error. It disclosed the incident Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the U.S. military organization that tracks objects in  
space predicted the rocket chunk would pass within two-thirds of a 
mile of the space station on Sunday. It ended up coming no closer 
than 4 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The debris was Russian in origin and fairly large, although its  
exact dimensions were not immediately known. A collision could have 
destroyed the empty outpost, which has been in orbit for only seven 
months. The first residents are not due to arrive until next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	At last count, the U.S. Space Command in Colorado Springs,  
Colo., was tracking more than 8,700 manmade objects in orbit, most 
of that junk. With an orbital speed of 17,500 mph, any one of them 
could do serious damage to the space station, which consists of 
only two compartments so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures already have been taken to prevent this from happening  
again, said Frank Culbertson, NASA deputy program manager for space 
station operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very glad we learned what we learned at this point in the  
mission before we have more hardware up there and before we have 
people up there,'' Culbertson said. But he noted that if astronauts 
had been aboard, they could have maneuvered the space station more 
easily than ground controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering command, drawn up by both U.S. and Russian  
engineers, was sent from the Russian control center outside Moscow 
on Saturday night. But the command contained faulty instructions, 
and the space station's computers rejected it. The station was left 
without motion control for an entire orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight controllers may not have factored in the changes in the  
space station's mass and center of gravity since shuttle Discovery 
delivered 2 tons of gear earlier this month, or else the changes 
were entered incorrectly. 
</P>
<P>
	Culbertson said it wasn't immediately clear whether Americans or  
Russians were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time flight controllers learned of their mistake, it was  
too late to send up a corrected command. ``But because the 
probability was low, we weren't too worried about it,'' Culbertson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, the Space Command soon revised the projected  
distance between the two objects from 0.6 miles to 4 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second time in less than three months that NASA has  
reported an erroneous station command. In late April, Russian 
flight controllers mistakenly ordered a motor to turn on and move 
the space station's solar wings; onboard computers detected the 
error and shut off power to the motor.

<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Players admitted their unfamiliarity with  
Pinehurst No. 2 could leave them somewhat in the dark in the U.S. 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The threesome of Jumbo Ozaki, David Toms and Brandel Chamblee  
were in the dark -- literally -- as they began the 99th Open at 6:30 
a.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Golf Association moved up the first tee time about a  
half-hour to get as much light as possible late in the day in the 
event of afternoon thunderstorms in the North Carolina Sandhills. 
</P>
<P>
	The fog-shrouded course was dark when the three arrived to warm  
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was out there before 6 and I was hitting but you really  
couldn't see the ground,'' Chamblee said of the driving range. 
``So, it was just, `How long are my arms?' and that's how I hit it. 
It was pretty dark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought they would have lights (on the range) because some  
of the places where we play early (on the PGA Tour) do, but I guess 
they just kind of wanted to be the Open,'' Toms said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toms and Chamblee said they awoke at 4 a.m. to get ready for the  
big day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I play early when I'm at home in Arizona because it's about  
140 degrees by noon, so I get up at 6 when it's only 100 and go out 
and play,'' Chamblee, who shot a 3-over-par 73, said. ``It was OK 
today as long as I didn't think about the West Coast time I was 
really on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I usually warm up for one hour. This was brevity,'' Chamblee  
added of his early-morning routine. ``It was just hit three or four 
shots. It was more like your warmups at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only a handful of fans were on hand to see the opening of the  
Open, but some photographers used flashes to get frames of the 
three. One even went off during the backswing on Toms' first drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Toms, who shot a 4-over 74, laughed about the incident.  
</P>
<P>
	``On the first hole the cameraman was probably as nervous as I  
was.'' 
</P>
<P>

	 *JACK'S NOT BACK:* Jack Nicklaus is back in a major after  
missing the Masters because of hip surgery, but the Golden Bear 
admitted his game left a lot to be desired Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in his 43rd Open, Nicklaus bogeyed the first three holes  
and five of the first six en route to an opening-round 8-over-par 
78. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine, I'm just not quite strong enough yet,'' said  
Nicklaus, whose only birdie came on No. 8. ``That was pretty 
obvious to me today. I was out there on a heavy (air) day trying to 
hit some shots out of the rough that I didn't have the strength to 
get through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus was so short off the tee Thursday that he used woods on  
four approch shots to par-4s. 
</P>
<P>
	``Length is a major factor for me these days,'' said the  
59-year-old Nicklaus, who has won four Opens in his illustrious 
career. ``I can do fine if the golf course is fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``These guys are playing 8- and 9-irons (into greens) and I'm  
playing 2- and 3-irons,'' Nicklaus added. ``That's hard to compete 
with, but I guess I'm getting a little bit of my own medicine. I 
had that a little bit the other ways for years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his high score, Nicklaus received the customary standing  
ovation as he walked to the 18th green. He tipped his cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``The USGA last year gave me a three-year exemption which was  
very, very kind of them, but I would much prefer to play better to 
deserve the invitation,'' Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DALY START:* John Daly's three straight birdies to begin his  
first round of the Open was a fast start, but not close to the 
tourney record. 
</P>
<P>
	That was set by Andy Dillard, who birdied the first six holes to  
begin the 1992 Open at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Dillard and George Burns hold the mark for consecutive birdies  
in an Open at six. Burns put together his hot streak at Pebble 
Beach (holes 2-7) in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	The official scorer on the fourth hole originally had Daly  
starting with four consecutive birdies, but he actually got a par-5 
on the hole. The score was corrected by Daly's caddie. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON TIME:* The USGA has been under the gun recently with slow  
play in the 156-player Open field. 
</P>
<P>
	But the first threesome of the day, teeing off at 6:30 a.m.,  
played in about four hours, and the last group of the day was off 
the first tee on time at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COLLEGE LEADER:* Andrew Barnes can always say he once led the  
U.S. Open -- even if it was for only a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes, a senior at Arizona, played in the third group off the  
tee Thursday and birdied Nos. 1 and 4 and was briefly alone atop 
the leaderboard. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was pretty neat,'' Barnes said.  
</P>
<P>
	It didn't last. Barnes bogeyed the fifth and seventh holes and  
carded a double-bogey on No. 8 on the way to a 4-over 74. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BEAT THE CLOCK:* Phil Mickelson, David Duval and Carlos Franco  
were put on the clock for slow play on the 11th hole. How did they 
know this? 
</P>
<P>
	If they didn't realize they were a full hole behind, they must  
have seen the USGA rules cart parked about 100 yards short of the 
11th green. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Reed, a USGA official, said the threesome was about four  
minutes behind schedule and he pulled out the stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't give warnings,'' he said. ``If they can see thunder  
and lightning, they can see us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They were back in position two holes later.

<HEADLINE> SLA Fugitive Appears in Minn. Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- Sara Jane Olson waved to her family today  
as she was in court to face accusations she is really Symbionese 
Liberation Army fugitive Kathleen Ann Soliah. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, Howard Bass, did not acknowledge that Olson and  
Ms. Soliah were the same person. But he argued that the crimes Ms. 
Soliah are charged with in California are not punishable by death 
or life in prison, and that bail should be set for his client. 
</P>
<P>
	``And those are only regarding the allegations against Kathleen  
Soliah. I haven't even addressed the issues with Sara Olson,'' Bass 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramsey County District Judge Kathleen Gearin said she could not  
decide on setting bail until she studied the California statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	County Attorney Susan Gaertner said California authorities were  
seeking extradition within 30 days. Olson did not waive her right 
to challenge the extradition request. Her next court appearance was 
set for July 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in an orange jail jumpsuit, Olson did not speak, but  
smiled and waved to her husband and three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson, 52, who lived with her doctor husband in an ivy-covered  
home in an upscale neighborhood, was active in community theater 
work, where her acting drew notice from local reviewers. 
</P>
<P>
	One singled her out as the strongest performer in a 1990  
production of ``King Lear.'' Another praised her ``vibrant'' 1993 
performance in ``All's Well That Ends Well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if the FBI is right, she is really Ms. Soliah, a onetime  
member of the SLA, the band of 1970s radicals who kidnapped 
Patricia Hearst. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents arrested the fugitive Wednesday after receiving tips from  
viewers of ``America's Most Wanted,'' which featured her in a 
recent broadcast. The FBI offered a $20,000 reward for Ms. Soliah 
last month, on the 25th anniversary of a Los Angeles shootout that 
killed six SLA members. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah has been wanted since 1976, when she was indicted in  
Los Angeles on murder conspiracy and explosives charges for 
allegedly placing pipe bombs under two police cars. The bombs did 
not explode. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal warrant drawn up this year, authorities said that  
in 1984 her husband was aware of her true name and fugitive status. 
It was unclear whether she was married at the time to her current 
husband, Gerald Peterson. They bought their St. Paul house in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said neither he nor his children had any inkling of his  
wife's double life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know nothing about that,'' he told the Los Angeles Times.  
``I'll tell you the truth, I'm totally shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one at the house would comment Wednesday. But Ms. Soliah's  
parents, Martin and Elsie Soliah of Palmdale, Calif., said Peterson 
knew his wife was wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	``She told him about her situation when they got serious,'' Mrs.  
Soliah told the Times. ``He understood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime in the late 1970s, Ms. Soliah arrived in the  
Minneapolis area, where she moved next door to Peterson, then a 
medical intern. Mrs. Soliah said the two lived for a number of 
years in Zimbabwe, where Peterson worked as a physician and her 
daughter taught drama and English. There, her daughter gave birth 
to the second of their three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah and her husband returned to the United States in the  
mid-1980s, the Soliahs said, settling in Minnesota after a brief 
stay in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said she took the last name of Olson, which is common in  
Minnesota because of the large number of people of Scandinavian 
descent. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives described Ms. Soliah as being surprised by her arrest  
-- and relieved at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a pretty good fingerprint identification that she's  
the person we're looking for,'' said James Burrus Jr., the agent in 
charge of the Minneapolis FBI office. 
</P>
<P>
	Her capture closes a chapter in one of the most sensational news  
stories of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLA, a band of anti-government radicals with a seven-headed  
snake as their symbol, kidnapped Ms. Hearst from her Berkeley, 
Calif., apartment in February 1974. She was 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The group demanded that the newspaper heiress' parents, Randolph  
and Catherine Hearst, distribute $2 million worth of food to the 
needy before it would discuss freedom for their daughter. The 
demand later climbed to $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But then Ms. Hearst changed into Tania, a member of the group  
that took her prisoner. Two months after the kidnapping, she was 
photographed carrying a carbine during an SLA holdup of a San 
Francisco bank -- the robbery for which she eventually was convicted 
and sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1974, as people across the nation watched on live TV, Los  
Angeles police trapped heavily armed SLA members in a house and 
riddled it with bullets. The group's leader, an ex-convict who 
called himself Cinque, and five other SLA members died. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah did not participate in the shootout or the Hearst  
kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hearst went underground and didn't emerge until 1975, when  
she was arrested in San Francisco. Although she claimed she was the 
victim of brainwashing, she was sentenced to seven years for the 
bank robbery. She served two years before President Carter commuted 
her sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, she is a married mother living in Connecticut, and a  
sometime actress and author. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all so old,'' she told WCBS-AM. ``I don't want to be  
drawn into all of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one other former SLA member is still at large: James  
Kilgore, Ms. Soliah's boyfriend in her SLA days. He was profiled on 
the same ``America's Most Wanted'' show as Ms. Soliah, but FBI 
spokeswoman Coleen Rowley said she wasn't aware of any leads on 
Kilgore.

<HEADLINE> Logistical Problems in Fugitive Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With the apparent capture of radical Kathleen  
Ann Soliah, prosecutors face the challenge of trying a 25-year-old 
case in which jurors might ask, ``What was the Symbionese 
Liberation Army anyway?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah, now 52, could be sentenced to life in prison if  
convicted, but legal experts said witnesses' faded memories and the 
easing of any public outrage could lead to a plea bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have successfully prosecuted cases older than this one,''  
said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	But she declined to say what evidence remains against Ms.  
Soliah, who allegedly placed two pipe bombs under two police cars 
in 1975 and then made a new life for herself in Minnesota as Sara 
Jane Olson, an actress, a doctor's wife and mother of three before 
she was captured on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She was ordered held without bail in Minnesota on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	``If she has lived an exemplary life, there will be sympathy,''  
said Laurie Levenson, associate dean at Loyola University Law 
School. ``No one is going to applaud her actions, but it is harder 
to prosecute a person who lives like the lady next door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other legal experts also said Ms. Soliah's chances depend on how  
much physical evidence links her to the two pipe bombs, which did 
not explode. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury that indicted Ms. Soliah in 1976 heard from 28  
witnesses, including a police bomb expert who has since died. It is 
unknown how many witnesses remain alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a physical evidence case it's easier,'' said San  
Francisco lawyer Stuart Hanlon, who has represented other SLA 
members. ``If it's a witness case, it's almost impossible to try it 
25 years later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah's lawyer, Howard Bass, told reporters on Thursday  
that his client would fight extradition ``because at this time 
there is no evidence that leads us to believe that Sara Olson is 
the person that California wants extradited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bass also did not say during court proceedings that Soliah and  
Sara Olson are the same person. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials say Soliah used ``Sara Olson'' as her alias.  
Spokeswoman Coleen Rowley said a fingerprint analysis concluded the 
Olson and Soliah are the same person. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fingerprints don't lie and the fingerprints do match,''  
Rowley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass did not return telephone messages left at his office  
Thursday and was not in his office after the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Other 1960s and '70s radicals who spent years as fugitives have  
received light treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernadine Dohrn, an alleged conspirator in bombings by the  
Weather Underground, was allowed to plead guilty to lesser counts 
and drew probation. Silas Trim Bissell, another group member, spent 
17 years in hiding after he was charged with trying to bomb a 
University of Washington ROTC building in 1970. He served 17 months 
in a federal halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the tougher sentences went to Katherine Ann Power, an  
antiwar radical implicated in a fatal bank robbery in Boston in 
1970. She took an alias and settled in Oregon, where she taught, 
worked as a chef, married and had a son. She surrendered in 1993 
and pleaded guilty to manslaughter. With continued good behavior in 
prison, she could be out in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1974, the SLA became front-page news when the radicals  
kidnapped newspaper heiress Patty Hearst. The case took a bizarre 
twist when Ms. Hearst sent word that she had become Tania, a member 
of the group that abducted her. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months after the kidnapping, she was photographed carrying a  
carbine during an SLA holdup of a San Francisco bank -- the robbery 
for which she eventually was convicted and sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1974 police shootout in Los Angeles killed six SLA members.  
When pipe bombs were found under two police cars in Los Angeles in 
1975, police traced them to Ms. Soliah and her then-boyfriend, 
James Kilgore, and assumed the attempted bombings were revenge for 
the shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Hearst was arrested in San Francisco in 1975, she was  
living with Ms. Soliah and her brother, Steven. 
</P>
<P>
	At her arraignment Thursday in St. Paul, Minn., Ms. Soliah,  
wearing an orange prison uniform, waved and blew a kiss to her 
family. Two of her three daughters were sobbing. Her husband, 
Gerald Peterson, put his arm around the youngest to comfort her. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Howard Bass, argued that she should be granted bail,  
but no ruling was made and another hearing was set for July 15.

<HEADLINE> Toyota, Ford Plants Most Productive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Car assembly plants operated by Toyota in  
Cambridge, Ontario, and Ford in Atlanta and Chicago were the most 
productive in North America last year, ousting the Nissan plant in 
Tennessee from the top spot it held for the previous five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Among light truck plants, Ford's Louisville, Ky., factory also  
edged Nissan's Smyrna, Tenn., plant in the annual productivity 
rankings released Thursday by Harbour and Associates Inc. The 
Nissan plant last year produced Altima sedans and Frontier pickup 
trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbour ranks plant productivity by the average number of labor  
hours it takes to build each vehicle. The Cambridge plant, which 
makes the Toyota Corolla sedan, ranked first at 17.66 hours, 
followed by Ford's plants that make the Taurus and Mercury Sable: 
Atlanta at 17.72 hours, and Chicago at 18.09. Nissan's plant ranked 
fourth at 18.97 hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's Louisville plant, which makes the Ranger pickup and  
Explorer and Mercury Mountaineer sport utility vehicles, ranked 
first among truck plants at 19.29 hours, followed by the Nissan 
plant at 19.77 and the GM-Toyota joint venture plant in Fremont, 
Calif., which makes the Toyota Tacoma pickup, at 19.81. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nissan plant cut production by about 25 percent last year to  
reduce inventories of unsold cars, but did not lay off any workers, 
which lowered its productivity rankings. It also shifted production 
of the Sentra sedan to Mexico. Production is expected to increase 
this year with the recent addition of the Xterra SUV, Nissan 
spokesman Fred Standish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Harbour, president of the consulting firm, said Smyrna was  
``still a very good plant'' in 1998, ``so the performances by 
Toyota and Ford were truly remarkable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When all North American assembly plants for each company were  
considered, the Japanese ``transplant'' automakers still remained 
well ahead of their Detroit competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan was on top at an average of 19.20 hours per vehicle,  
followed by Honda at 21.41, Toyota at 21.63, Ford at 23.87, General 
Motors at 31.58, and DaimlerChrysler at 32.33. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese automakers look better in the corporate average  
rankings partly because they have far fewer North American plants 
that tend to be more modern, while the Detroit automakers have 
dozens of plants, some far more efficient than others. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbour noted that some operations, such as Ford's Taurus-Sable  
plants, have adopted lean manufacturing techniques that make them 
competitive with the best of the newer Japanese plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem is the consistency across the company still isn't  
there, so there still is a gap'' between Ford and the Japanese 
plants, Harbour said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is well ahead of GM and DaimlerChrysler AG, in large part  
because it relies far less on unscheduled overtime to meet demand. 
Unscheduled overtime for such things as plant maintenance and 
repair of vehicles on the line can dramatically lower the 
productivity rankings, Harbour said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to give Ford credit in the discipline that they've  
had to meet their build schedule on straight time. It's really 
giving Ford a significant advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM and DaimlerChrysler assembly plants require more than 50  
percent more labor hours than Nissan and 30 percent more than Ford, 
Harbour said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbour estimates that if all of GM's North American plants --  
assembly, stamping and powertrain -- were as efficient as those 
operated by Toyota, it would need 40,041 fewer workers and save 
$4.9 billion a year. DaimlerChrysler would need 21,442 fewer 
workers and could save $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Productivity does not always equal profitability, however.  
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler was the most profitable major automaker on a  
worldwide basis last year, earning an average of $1,470 for each 
vehicle made, including Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Toyota was next at 
$1,348 a vehicle, followed by Honda at $993, Ford at $854 and GM at 
$317. Struggling Nissan lost $66 a vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Sabres, Stars Serve Up Cup Thrills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- At last, there's a competitive series in the  
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied 2-2 going into Game 5 tonight, the Buffalo Sabres and  
Dallas Stars have made it the best championship round in many 
years. The previous four seasons ended with 4-0 sweeps in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as tight a matchup as you'll find,'' Stars forward  
Brian Skrudland said. ``Both teams deserve a lot of credit for 
where they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not since the New York Rangers and Vancouver Canucks went seven  
games in 1994 has there been a Stanley Cup final that has lasted 
more than four. The New Jersey Devils, Colorado Avalanche and 
Detroit Red Wings (twice) have all swept the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the best-of-7 format began in 1939, only 10 finals have  
gone the limit. But no one is betting that this one won't go right 
down to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars and Sabres have each split games in each other's  
arena, and the teams have been tied or had a one-goal difference 
for all but 26 seconds of the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams feature a defensive style that has resulted in  
low-scoring games. Their 17 combined goals (Stars 9, Sabres 8) are 
the lowest four-game total in Stanley Cup finals history since the 
Montreal Canadiens outscored the St. Louis Blues 12-3 in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The last game of the Stars-Sabres series was typical, the Sabres  
winning 2-1 at Buffalo. The Sabres are 8-1 in one-goal games, and 
the Stars are 7-6 in this year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of these goaltenders are playing so great,'' said Stars  
defenseman Craig Ludwig, referring to Dallas' Ed Belfour and 
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek. ``One break here or there makes a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has the better stats between the two, having allowed only  
eight goals on 127 shots, but Belfour was the more spectacular in 
Tuesday night's victory for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just see this as two really competitive teams trying to  
win,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``(Stars general manager) 
Bob Gainey said to us last night on the airplane this is such a 
great series. You've got two teams with so much passion and 
character going at it. It's so good for the game of hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With their victory on Tuesday night, the Sabres cast an entirely  
new light on this series. A Stars victory in Game 4 would have 
given them a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 finals, making it a tough 
job for the Sabres to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one team since 1939 has come back to win the Cup after  
losing three of the first four games -- the 1942 Toronto Maple 
Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's victory was also important for another reason as  
far as the Sabres were concerned: They admittedly played their 
worst game of the playoffs in losing Game 3 by a 2-1 score on 
Saturday night. The Stars held the Sabres to 12 shots, tying a 
Stanley Cup finals record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought our team got away from the aggressive forecheck (in  
Game 3) and we wanted to get back to that,'' Sabres coach Lindy 
Ruff said. ``We wanted to get our (defense) involved. That was 
probably the thing that hurt us the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres scored first on Tuesday night, but that's not always  
a guarantee of anything in this series. Scoring first in two other 
games, the Sabres lost both. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be great if we got the first goal,'' Ruff  
said, ``but I don't think that one goal is the type of lead that 
causes them to start taking chances. Dallas is a very patient 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres don't expect Dallas to make the same kind of mistakes  
that helped them win Tuesday night. The Stars defense broke down 
twice, leading to Buffalo goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither team is going to give up many opportunities on  
mistakes now,'' Buffalo's Brian Holzinger said. ``We have to play 
almost a perfect game against them because of how smart 
positionally they are and what a veteran team they have.''

<HEADLINE> Co-Chairs of Universal Pictures Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Veteran Universal Pictures  
executives Stacey Snider and Brian C. Mulligan on Thursday were 
named co-chairmen of the movie studio that released such recent 
hits as ``The Mummy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The promotions came six months after the resignation of Casey  
Silver, who left in November after overseeing a series of box 
office disappointments that included ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``Babe: 
Pig in the City.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> IOC Members Resent Taking Blame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- An Olympic meeting became a stage for  
America bashing Thursday, with members venting their resentment at 
having to take blame for the games' biggest scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our marvelous, wonderful movement ... will always have been  
besmirched,'' Mexico's Mario Vazquez Rana told the IOC's general 
assembly. ``This is something that comes from that wonderful 
country that is the USA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vazquez Rana referred to the bribes-for-votes scandal  
surrounding Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games that 
resulted in 10 International Olympic Committee members losing their 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can assure you that the problem inherent to corruption was  
born from people in Salt Lake City,'' Vazquez Rana said on the 
first day of the IOC's 109th session, which was open to the media 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Knight, who heads Sydney's 2000 games, also got a tongue  
lashing. He was accused of acting like a school teacher for telling 
IOC members the Australian city was cutting its budget and 
eliminating many of their perks. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was the attack on Salt Lake by Vazquez Rana, a media  
magnate who heads the world's national Olympic associations, that 
created the biggest stir among IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members privately admitted that the Salt Lake City scandal  
has brought a backlash against the United States from colleagues 
who feel they have been unfairly painted as corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	The affair is being investigated by state and federal agencies,  
and three IOC members were questioned by the FBI when they attended 
a Coordination Commission meeting in Salt Lake. A fourth expects to 
be questioned. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitt Romney, who was named in February to replace the ousted  
head of Salt Lake's Organizing Committee, told the assembly the 
scandal stemmed from the actions of a few bid committee officials, 
not the people of the Utah capital. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share the concern, the sense of outrage that something as  
lofty as the Olympic spirit could be tarnished by the actions of a 
few,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dedicated to the principle that a few people cannot  
ruin anything so great as the Olympics. The people of Salt lake 
City ... did not take those inappropriate actions. A few people 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch suggested some IOC  
members might be reluctant to visit the United States for fear they 
might be subjected to questioning or even charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the IOC executive board plans to meet in Salt Lake  
next year, Samaranch said, ``I hope before this meeting, as soon as 
possible, these problems can be over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anita DeFrantz, an IOC vice president from Los Angeles, bemoaned  
Vazquez Rana's comments. 
</P>
<P>
	``Assigning blame is useless at this point,'' she said. ``We  
know what happened. It's time to get on to putting on the games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City was also criticized for underestimating the cost  
of the games when its bidding committee submitted its estimated 
budget, forcing the new organizing committee to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when we voted for Salt Lake four years ago, the  
budget was $790 million, not $1.45 billion,'' said Alex Gilady of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested Salt Lake and other bidding cities ``like to  
decorate'' their proposed budgets ``so we'll like it when we are 
voting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the reason Salt Lake's budget was so low was because  
``there is no effective equivalent of accounting principles passed 
from one games to the next.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight, making his first report to the IOC general assembly in  
18 months, said the corruption scandal had hurt Sydney's 
fund-raising efforts and forced the organizing committee to make 
budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said the IOC has to ``share some of the pain for the cuts  
we had to make,'' including in some of the perks and other 
hospitality services for IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Bach, a German board member, said Knight was making a  
show of cutting items which the IOC never requested in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC never asked for flowers,'' Bach said, referring to  
cuts in floral arrangements in Sydney.

<HEADLINE> Indians Bring Mark Langston Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Mark Langston is back with the Cleveland  
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians on Thursday recalled the left-hander from Triple-A  
Buffalo, where he was on a 30-day rehabilitation assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Langston had been on the disabled list since May 25 with bone  
spurs and inflammation in his pitching elbow. He has made 13 relief 
appearances for the Indians this season and has a 5.14 ERA in 21 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	To make room for Langston, the Indians designated right-handed  
reliever Dave Stevens for assignment. 
</P>
<P>
	Stevens came to Cleveland from Buffalo on May 28 and has an ERA  
of 10.00. He gave up three runs Wednesday night to the Oakland 
Athletics in one inning. The Indians beat Oakland anyway, 9-8.

<HEADLINE> Ban Proposed on Drugs for Suicides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senior Republican lawmakers proposed  
legislation Thursday to promote the use of restricted drugs to ease 
pain among the gravely ill while rejecting the use of those drugs 
to help patients commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure could directly affect doctors in Oregon, the first  
and only state to legalize physician-assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Alleviating pain for those with advanced and terminal diseases  
should be a public health priority, said Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., 
the second-ranked Senate Republican, who is sponsoring the bill 
with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we want to make sure we don't subsidize suicide,'' Nickles  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, first introduced last year with Oregon's legalized  
assisted suicide in mind, affirms that doctors may use federally 
controlled substances to alleviate pain, even if the use of the 
medication increases the likelihood of death. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also makes clear that the use of controlled drugs for the  
purpose of assisting in suicide is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would not overturn the Oregon assisted-suicide  
law, but it would bar doctors from using drugs listed under the 
federal Controlled Substances Act to help a patient die. Under 
Oregon's law, a doctor must state his intent when writing a 
prescription. 
</P>
<P>
	While modified this year to meet some objections to last year's  
bill, Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said he would again vigorously oppose 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, he said, is ``clearly aimed at overturning Oregon's  
law.'' Wyden said he voted against that law twice but ``I think it 
is wrong for a member of Congress, thousands of miles from the 
state of Oregon, to substitute his own personal judgment on a 
matter like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure gives the Drug Enforcement Agency no new regulatory  
authority, unlike the Nickles-Hyde bill last year that allowed the 
DEA the right to deny doctors registrations to prescribe controlled 
drugs if they participate in assisted suicides. 
</P>
<P>
	A proposed medical advisory board to review assisted suicide  
cases was also taken out of this year's bill. 
</P>
<P>
	David Simpson, board chairman of the National Hospice  
Organization, said the elimination of the oversight board, which he 
said would have a ``chilling effect'' on medical practice, was a 
major reason his group, which opposed last year's bill, now 
supports it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Barbara Coombs Lee, the sponsor of Oregon's initiative law,  
said in a prepared statement issued in Salem that Nickles' bill 
would allow the federal government for the first time to define a 
legitimate medical practice and permit law enforcers to investigate 
the intent of doctors in furnishing pain drugs to terminally ill 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997 Congress overwhelmingly passed and President Clinton  
signed into law a bill barring the use of federal funds to assist 
in suicide or euthanasia.

<HEADLINE> Police: Man Kills Wife and Two Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- A man despondent after accidentally  
suffocating his wife killed their two young children and then took 
his own life, police said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jennifer Gilbert, 25, apparently allowed her husband, Michael,  
27, to asphyxiate her, but he did not mean to kill her, Police Lt. 
Craig Van Schyndle said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears activities between them were consensual to her  
death,'' Van Schyndle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities would not elaborate, citing the ``sensitivity of  
these deaths.'' Asked whether Mrs. Gilbert's death was sex-related, 
police would not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities believe she died Sunday. Michael Gilbert, upset  
after his wife's death, killed 1-year-old Evangeline and 
2-month-old Ivan and then himself on Monday, Van Schyndle said. 
</P>
<P>
	The family's bodies were found Tuesday. The woman and the  
children died of asphyxiation, medical examiner Joe Grantham said. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Gilbert apparently tried to commit suicide several ways  
in the 24 hours after killing his family. He died of carbon 
monoxide poisoning, drugs or alcohol or some combination, Van 
Schyndle said.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds decreased by $2.23 billion to $864.56 billion, the 
Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category  
decreased by $1.72 billion to $716.81 billion for the week ended 
Wednesday, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said.

</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.454 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.466 trillion to

reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in  
the week ended Tuesday to 4.31 percent from 4.29 percent the 
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal 
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day

<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
59 days, up from 58 days, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts fell to 2.04 percent 
Wednesday from 2.07 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.

	MORAGA, Calif. (AP) -- Anna McCune Harper, who replaced Helen  
Wills Moody in 1930 as the top-ranked U.S. women's tennis player, 
died Monday. She was 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Harper won the mixed doubles at Wimbledon in 1931. She was

<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Harold Kohn, an attorney who filed some of  
the earliest class-action lawsuits accusing corporations of 
price-fixing, died Monday at the age of 85. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s, Kohn became nationally known by winning a key case  
against General Electric, Westinghouse and two dozen other 
companies that the federal government had accused of illegal 
price-fixing. 
</P>
<P>
	People who had bought the companies' electrical equipment filed  
hundreds of lawsuits. Kohn's case, brought on behalf of public 
utilities, was the first to go to trial and resulted in a $29 
million verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, a jury awarded his clients $2 billion in a class-action  
suit against the timber industry. At the time, it was the largest 
verdict ever in an antitrust case. 
</P>
<P>
	Kohn was also known for public interest cases taken on behalf of  
the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups. During the 
Vietnam War, he helped file a case that argued that the draft was 
unconstitutional because it excluded women. The Supreme Court 
rejected that argument in 1981.

90-63-13 record and winning six Mid America Intercollegiate 
Athletic Association championships. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 67-60 as basketball coach from 1944-1950.  
</P>
<P>
	Milner also coached track and field, golf and cross country.

</P>
<P>
	Powers was a writer in residence and English professor at St.  
John's University and the College of St. Benedict from 1975 to 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote three collections of short fiction and a second novel  
in 1998, ``Wheat That Springeth Green,'' for which he was a 
National Book Award finalist. Both novels follow the careers of a 
Minnesota priest, and much of his writing dealt with the conflict 
between spiritual and secular values in a materialistic society.

high-tech patents, including one for a component used in virtually 
all computer disk drives, died June 6 of colon cancer. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
	Sordello's electronic tachometer proved fundamental to disk

</P>
<P>
	He began his career at IBM in 1960, leaving to become co-founder

</P>
<P>
	From 1973 to 1975, Sordello served on a Commerce Department  
advisory committee on computer peripherals and components. In 1978, 
he helped establish one of the applied-research centers at Memorex

	LONDON (AP) -- David Sutch, who brought a chuckle to British  
politics as leader of the Monster Raving Loony Party with the 
slogan: ``Vote for insanity -- you know it makes sense,'' was found 
hanged Wednesday at his northwest London home. He was 58. 
</P>
<P>
	Known as Screaming Lord Sutch, he was Britain's longest-serving  
party leader. He never won a race, despite running in scores of 
them, but one of his party members was once elected mayor in a town 
in southwest England. 
</P>
<P>
	With his top hat and gold lame suit, Sutch blared his party's  
madcap policies through a rusty loudspeaker from one corner of the 
land to the other. 
</P>
<P>
	Sutch, who legally changed his name to add the ``Lord,'' founded  
the Monster Raving Loony Party in 1963 and first ran for Parliament 
in 1964. He went on to enter some 40 elections over more than 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign style of Sutch and his followers irritated more  
traditional candidates but delighted many British voters. And at 
least one of his policies -- all-day pub openings -- later became a 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to price him and other ``nonsense'' candidates out of  
the election scene by increasing the deposit from $240 to $800 
backfired in 1985 -- prompting even more carnival figures, clowns 
and self-described clueless ones to join his ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 1960s, Sutch was a rock singer and until recently  
performed up to 250 concerts a year throughout Europe.

<HEADLINE> Modell To Sell Share of Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Ravens owner Art Modell, eager to ease the debt  
of his financially strapped NFL team, is seeking an investor to buy 
a minority share of the club. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell plans to hire an investment banker within the next 30  
days to help procure a minority partner. Modell and his wife 
Patricia would maintain controlling interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Art has been talking privately about adding a minority partner  
ever since he bought out the minority partners in Cleveland,'' 
Ravens spokesman Kevin Byrne said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens went heavily into debt when Modell moved the team  
from Cleveland after the 1995 season. Two years ago, the Ravens 
took $185 million in loans and other forms of credit to help reduce 
the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell told The (Baltimore) Sun the new partner might receive a  
right of first refusal if the team were sold. But he insisted that 
the Ravens are not experiencing cash flow problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's far better than it was three years ago. We have never  
missed a payment,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ravens are trying to restructure part of the team's debt and  
have talked to the commissioner's office about taking out a loan 
from the NFL, Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the team's debt came from Modell paying more than  
$70 million to buy out his former partners in Cleveland. He also 
had to pay Ohio officials $12 million to settle a lawsuit over 
breaking the lease on Cleveland Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell, 73, said a new investor would also benefit the franchise  
in the distant future. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has legal advisors telling him to prepare his estate,''  
Byrne said. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell said he would make sure the new investor would have an  
appreciation of pro football. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should be in it for the love of the sport,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Modell Selling Part of Ravens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Baltimore Ravens owner Art Modell will sell  
part of the debt-ridden team to a new investor, The Sun reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell said the new partner will not have a controlling share of  
the Ravens, but could receive first refusal rights if the team is 
sold. The controlling share will remain with Modell's wife, 
Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like somebody who's a younger age than me, who can grow  
with the business, grow with my son, David. I want somebody that 
has a very strong interest in professional football,'' said Modell, 
who'll turn 74 in a week. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes his son, David, 37, the Ravens president, eventually  
will inherit the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Modell said taking on a new investor would help reduce debt,  
which the team incurred beginning in Cleveland. Because it is a 
private company, the team does not report its finances. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, the Ravens completed what was then a record  
restructuring that required league approval. The team took on $185 
million in loans and other forms of credit.

<HEADLINE> Engine Builder Dies After Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Engine builder Herb Porter, whose  
turbocharged Offenhausers dominated Indy-car racing in the 1960s 
and 1970s, has died from injuries suffered in a May 20 crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 84, died Wednesday in Methodist Hospital.  
</P>
<P>
	The crash on Interstate 74 west of Indianapolis which left  
Porter with broken legs and damaged lungs occurred a day before he 
was inducted into the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, who owned Speedway Engine Development, was a fixture in  
the open-wheel engine business for five decades. The company's 
engines power a half-dozen Indy Racing League cars. 
</P>
<P>
	A midget driver and motorcycle racer in the 1930s, Porter  
provided the powerplants that the Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co. used 
for its testing program in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last month with The Indianapolis Star, Porter  
said winning the Indianapolis 500 pole in 1971 was one of his 
greatest accomplishments. The other was winning the 1968 500 with 
Bobby Unser. 
</P>

	Funeral arrangements are incomplete.

	Serbs Accused of Killing 10,000  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Officials have discovered so many  
mass graves and killing sites in Kosovo and heard so many accounts 
of atrocities that they now estimate at least 10,000 people were 
killed in the Serb crackdown against ethnic Albanians. The mounting 
evidence is likely to add to calls for the arrest of Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic, who has been indicted by the 
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague. But President 
Clinton said Thursday that peacekeepers will take a ``wait and 
see'' approach toward Milosevic's arrest.

Philip Duran, 22, is accused of providing a gun to a minor, a 
charge that carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison. He is

<HEADLINE> Senators Back Steel Industry Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators sympathetic to the plight of U.S.  
steel, oil and gas producers hurt by low prices urged support today 
for $1.5 billion in federally guaranteed emergency loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The loans would be designed to tide the industries over until  
prices recover. But conservative senators criticized the $270 
million in taxpayer spending needed to back the new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, legislation creating the loan programs appeared to  
have enough votes for passage. The measure cleared a procedural 
hurdle Tuesday, 71-28. A vote on final passage was expected later 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this is a reasonable response to a terrible crisis  
that threatens more than just companies but whole communities 
across America,'' said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said the loans would help domestic steel producers  
injured by low-priced imports and U.S. oil and natural gas 
industries struggling because of sagging prices. Officials say the 
three industries have suffered tens of thousands of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised to let the  
House vote on the loan measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., chief architect of the loan  
provision, urged colleagues to reject amendments, saying any 
changes would make it harder for Hastert to keep his commitment. 
The measure would help a company in his state, Weirton Steel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate previously approved the steel-loan program as part of  
an emergency spending bill to pay for Kosovo operations, but 
supporters backed down during negotiations with the House when the 
provision threatened to sink the entire package. 
</P>
<P>
	During those negotiations, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., insisted  
that a similar program be set up for small oil and gas firms. As 
part of a compromise, the two programs were combined later into a 
separate bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would provide $1 billion in steel loans, with companies  
eligible to borrow $25 million to $250 million at market interest 
rates. U.S. oil and gas producers and service companies would be 
able to borrow up to $10 million each from a $500 million fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The loan measure was only the first of several steel-related  
bills to reach the Senate floor. The full Senate could consider as 
early as next week a bill that would establish comprehensive quotas 
on foreign steel shipments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, opponents in the Senate Finance Committee tried to  
quash the quota effort by offering to address the U.S. steel 
industry's long-term ability to compete. The committee approved its 
alternative bill, 16-3. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel-state lawmakers denounced the bill as too weak and said it  
offered little short-term relief. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Committee bill would initiate an investigation into  
unfair foreign marketing practices, including governments giving 
their producers subsidies and foreign companies flooding the U.S. 
market with products at prices below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation would also require the development of a  
comprehensive government strategy to eliminate those practices and 
would modify U.S. trade laws to ease U.S. companies' ability to 
prove injury in certain trade complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. William Roth, R-Del., the committee's chairman, said the  
bill was designed to ``address the real problem facing the steel 
industry, the worldwide overcapacity of steel.''

<HEADLINE> Ind. To Take Up SBC-Ameritech Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS -- The Indiana Supreme Court on Thursday agreed to  
take up a dispute about whether SBC Communications and Ameritech 
Corp. can merge into one giant telecommunications company. 
</P>
<P>
	In a rare move, the state's high court has granted the two  
companies' request to hear the case before the Indiana Court of 
Appeals does. The Supreme Court gets few such requests, and grants 
just a handful each year. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing before the court's five justices is scheduled for July  
13. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech sought the Supreme Court's quick entrance into  
the case, arguing in court documents that the Indiana Utility 
Regulatory Commission waited eight months before asserting their 
authority over a proposed merger that affects millions of 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for SBC and Ameritech contend the merger is not subject  
to Indiana approval because the transaction merely involves the 
transfer of stock and not Ameritech Indiana's entire system. 
</P>
<P>
	The IURC maintain that a transaction in which more than half of  
a public utility's stock is sold to a different company does fall 
under the state's authority. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC hopes to buy Chicago-based Ameritech in a  
stock swap that would create a communications company with 57 
million phone lines in 13 states, primarily in the Southwest and 
the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Company officials hoped to complete the merger, valued at $57  
billion when first announced in May 1998, by late July. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies are talking with IURC negotiators to reach an  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission still must approve the  
deal. Ohio regulators and the Justice Department have given their 
blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's Office of Utility Consumer Counselor, which represents  
consumers' interests in cases before the IURC, has questioned 
whether the reduced competition caused by the merger would help or 
harm consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the merger, which include telecommunications giants  
AT&AMP;T and MCI Worldcom, warn a larger SBC would be so big it would 
deter competition and hurt consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC and Ameritech say the merger will spur local phone  
competition and possibly lower prices, accelerate the roll-out of 
high-speed Internet access and data services and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The states affected by the proposed merger are Arkansas,  
California, Connecticut, Kansas, Missouri, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, 
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE>  Leader of British Catholics Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Cardinal Basil Hume, leader of the Roman Catholic  
Church of England and Wales and one of the most admired public 
figures in Britain, died Thursday. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
	Hume died just hours after his official spokesman announced that  
his cancer had reached its final stages. The cardinal had asked for 
renewed prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	A modest and humorous man, Hume held a position of remarkable  
influence and respect in this country, where Catholics are a 
minority and the established church is Protestant. 
</P>
<P>
	Simple things like his moving prayers at the time of Princess  
Diana's death and his passionate support for the Newcastle United 
soccer team found him a place in many non-Catholic hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was goodness personified, a true holy man with  
extraordinary humility and an unswerving dedication,'' Prime 
Minister Tony Blair said. ``He did much to inspire people of all 
faiths, and none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hume learned of his cancer in April and informed the archdiocese  
in typically direct manner that he wanted no fuss and would go on 
working as long as he could. He described himself as 
``uncharacteristically, calm and at peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was admitted to London's Hospital of St. John and St.  
Elizabeth at the end of May, but was able to go to Buckingham 
Palace on June 2 for a private meeting with Queen Elizabeth II. 
</P>
<P>
	She gave him the high honor of the Order of Merit, one of the  
few awards she bestows by her own choice, rather than the 
government's. It is given to people of ``exceptional distinction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The queen is deeply saddened to learn of the death of Cardinal  
Hume, whom she will remember for his outstanding contribution to 
the Christian life of this country,'' Buckingham Palace said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral mass was scheduled for June 25 at Westminster  
Cathedral, where his body will lie in state Monday through 
Wednesday next week. A memorial mass will likely be held in 
September, church officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he shepherded a flock of just 4.6 million, the cardinal's  
ability to cut through complicated moral arguments and get to the 
nub of the matter made his a voice heard beyond his own church. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal surprised some more dogmatic Christians in 1993  
when he affirmed the dignity of homosexuals, telling them ``not to 
develop a sense of guilt or think of themselves as unpleasing to 
God. On the contrary, they are precious to God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He believed in the value of priestly celibacy, but said he often  
regretted not having a wife. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a successful celibate has to regret he wasn't  
married,'' Hume told the BBC in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	George Haliburton Hume was born March 2, 1923, in Newcastle,  
northern England. He adopted the name Basil after taking his vows 
as a monk in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	A surprise choice as Roman Catholic primate in 1976, he was  
abbot of Ampleforth Monastery and former head of its prestigious 
school, Ampleforth College. 
</P>
<P>
	After his selection as primate, in the space of just a few  
months, he was ordained a bishop, then Archbishop of Westminster 
and cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not a position he had sought, and his friends said he had  
hoped one day to retire in the country, where he could pursue his 
love of fishing. 
</P>
<P>
	Some attributed Hume's influence with the largely Protestant  
establishment in part to the fact that he was upper middle class 
and English rather than Irish. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was more to it, wrote veteran journalist Lord Deedes,  
one of the more famous pillars of the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of Cardinal Hume's authority is derived from his  
humility,'' Deedes wrote in 1997. ``It is a quality that may stem 
from his years as a Benedictine monk ... it may be part of his 
faith, or it may just spring from goodness. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, with the Church of England in turmoil over  
ordaining female priests, some Anglican clergy and laymen turned to 
the Catholic Church. It was a delicate time for both churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one else could have played the careful balance of welcome  
toward those who sought entry into his church, and a sensitivity to 
those members of the Anglican Church left behind,'' said Graham 
Leonard, a retired Anglican bishop who converted to Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen, temporal head of the Church of England, took the very  
unusual step of attending a vespers service at Westminster 
Cathedral, Hume's seat, in 1995.

<P>
	But there was more to it, wrote veteran journalist Lord Deedes,  
one of the more famous pillars of the establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Much of Cardinal Hume's authority is derived from his  
humility,'' Deedes wrote in 1997. ``It is a quality that may stem 
from his years as a Benedictine monk ... it may be part of his 
faith, or it may just spring from goodness. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, with the Church of England in turmoil over  
ordaining female priests, some Anglican clergy and laymen turned to 
the Catholic Church. It was a delicate time for both churches. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one else could have played the careful balance of welcome  
toward those who sought entry into his church, and a sensitivity to 
those members of the Anglican Church left behind,'' said Graham 
Leonard, a retired Anglican bishop who converted to Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	The queen, temporal head of the Church of England, took the very  
unusual step of attending a vespers service at Westminster 
Cathedral, Hume's seat, in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Summers Says He'll Stay the Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence Summers, President Clinton's choice  
to be secretary of the treasury, told lawmakers today that his 
challenge will be to stay the administration's financial course, 
which has helped bring about the nation's current economic boom. 
</P>
<P>
	``At treasury the right course has been set. Our challenge will  
be to carry on,'' Summers told the Senate Finance Committee at a 
hearing today on his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Under outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin the nation's  
economy, powered by consumer spending, has grown 4.1 percent in the 
first quarter of this year. Unemployment is at a 29-year low. 
Consumer confidence is up and the stock markets have been rallying. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, 44, joined Treasury in 1993 as undersecretary for  
international affairs. He has served since 1995 as deputy to Rubin, 
who announced his resignation earlier this month and has said he 
would like to leave the post by July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finance Committee could vote on Summers' nomination next  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers is expected to win Senate approval. But some steel-state  
lawmakers including committee member Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., 
wants to talk to Summers about steps they want the Clinton 
administration to take to protect the U.S. steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	One day before Summers' nomination hearing, the Finance  
Committee approved a bill designed to address the U.S. steel 
industry's long-term ability to compete. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee took up the bill as an alternative to global  
quotas, which many panel members and the White House oppose. The 
steel industry has been battered by a flood of cheap steel imports 
coming into the U.S. from Japan, South Korea, Russia and other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	When Summers' nomination was announced last month, Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he saw no problems with 
the nomination. And, the Finance Committee chairman, Sen. William 
Roth, R-Del., said his panel had had a ``good working 
relationship'' with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., on Wednesday said he  
would no longer block pending White House nominations, including 
Summers, before the Senate because of an unrelated dispute the 
lawmaker had with the White House over a separate appointment.

<HEADLINE> Chain Gangs Come To Massachusetts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW BEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- They spent the day tethered together  
by chains shackled around their left ankles, painting an iron fence 
under the watchful eyes of armed guards. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 10 inmates didn't mind the work. They volunteered for  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been out for 15 months,'' said a 37-year-old man who  
asked to be identified as Scott. ``We just wanted the opportunity 
to be in the fresh air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chain gangs, once a symbol of pitiless Southern justice, have  
come to Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	In what is believed to be the state's first such work crew, the  
inmates Wednesday painted a fence at a New Bedford drug treatment 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson, who prefers the term  
``tandem work crews,'' scoffs at suggestions his crews are more 
about humiliation than rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Chain gangs were meant to break people down. My program is the  
complete opposite -- it builds self-esteem and self confidence, and 
helps them know they've accomplished something,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The prisoners, dressed in red shirts and pants, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it's humiliating at all,'' said Kevin, 39,  
serving 2 1/2 years on a probation violation related to 
drunken-driving convictions. ``It's more humiliating to sit behind 
the prison walls every day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chain gangs, largely black crews, broke rocks and built roads in  
the South in the late 19th century. By 1970, they had vanished in 
much of the country with the advent of civil rights and prison 
reform movements. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, chain gangs began to resurface, first in Alabama,  
followed by Arizona, Florida and Iowa. Maricopa County, Ariz., 
started one for women, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials insist today's chain gangs are far from the shackled  
crews that gained infamy in song (Sam Cooke's ``Chain Gang'') and 
film (``Cool Hand Luke''). 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be working quite well,'' said Gary McClelland, a  
prison supervisor in Wisconsin, where chain gangs went to work in 
1997. ``They work on community projects and it's been very 
well-received.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The program in Bristol County involves prisoners convicted of  
nonviolent crimes. Then why, critics ask, the chains and armed 
guards? 
</P>
<P>
	``These aren't hardened criminals,'' said Joshua Rubenstein,  
northeast regional director for Amnesty International USA. ``The 
chain gang is a form of gratuitous humiliation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of black state lawmakers said they will file legislation  
to ban the practice. And officials from at least two Massachusetts 
towns -- Fairhaven and Westport -- have declined to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it goes back to pre-civil rights days,'' said Winfred  
Eckenreiter, a Fairhaven selectman and former prosecutor. ``Most of 
us are happy we've gotten past that.''

<HEADLINE> Alleged Islamic Terrorist Charged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The reputed leader of the terrorists who killed  
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat was charged today in a conspiracy to 
kill Americans that included efforts to secure ``The Nuclear Bomb 
of Islam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ayman Al-Zawahiri was charged with conspiracy in the bombings of  
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, as was a second alleged terrorist, 
Khaled Al-Fawwaz. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictments raises to 15 the number of people charged in the  
Aug. 7 bombings that killed 213 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment, which supersedes a previous indictment, claims  
that three days before the embassy bombings, Al-Zawahiri threatened 
to retaliate against America for its capture of members of his 
group, Al-Jihad. 
</P>
<P>
	It also alleges that Osama bin Laden, accused of orchestrating  
the embassy bombings, issued a May 1998, statement titled, ``The 
Nuclear Bomb of Islam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said ``it is the duty of the Muslims to prepare as  
much force as possible to terrorize the enemies of God,'' according 
to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Zawahiri, believed to be with bin Laden in Afghanistan,  
allegedly leads Al-Jihad, an outlawed group that had claimed 
responsibility for the 1981 assassination of Egyptian President 
Anwar Sadat. It has been waging a bloody campaign since 1992 to 
topple Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's government and install 
strict Islamic rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Fawwaz is in custody in London awaiting extradition. Bin  
Laden was last known to be hiding in Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White said the charges ``show the reach of  
the worldwide terrorist network threatening civilized society 
today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said in Wednesday's court papers by February 1998,  
Al-Zawahiri had merged his group with bin Laden's terrorist 
organization, al Qaeda, to oppose non-Islamic governments with 
force and violence. 
</P>
<P>
	The two leaders then allegedly endorsed a fatwah or religious  
edict stating that Muslims should kill Americans, including 
civilians, anywhere they are found. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment described Al-Fawwaz as an al Qaeda member who  
repeatedly helped get messages from terrorism leaders to the media, 
including an August 1996 declaration from bin Laden against 
Americans meant to ``expel the heretics from the Arabian 
Peninsula.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said in 1994 he set up a media information office in London  
to publicize bin Laden's statement, recruit others, and obtain 
satellite telephones and equipment to improve communications among 
terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	In the hours before and after the U.S. embassy bombings last  
Aug. 7, claims of responsibility for the bombings were sent to and 
from a London office funded by al Fawwaz, the indictment said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of the 15 men charged in the indictment are fugitives.

<HEADLINE> Half of Marines' Harriers Grounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The Marine Corps has grounded about half of  
its AV-8B Harrier jump jets while it investigates two crashes in 
the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 84 planes were grounded. The planes have the same  
Rolls-Royce engine model as the aircraft involved in the crashes, A 
Marine spokeswoman told The Virginian-Pilot. However, the engine 
has not been identified as being at fault in either crash, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no estimate on how long the planes might be out of  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	The crashes involved Harriers based at Kadena Air Base in Japan  
and the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma, Ariz. The Kadena crash 
occurred June 4 as the plane was taking off on a training mission. 
The Yuma crash happened during a flight Monday over a training 
range near the base. 
</P>
<P>
	The pilots in both cases ejected safely.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani May Face GOP Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- While political circles are abuzz with talk  
of a possible Senate race between Hillary Rodham Clinton and 
Rudolph Giuliani, the New York City mayor may not have a clear path 
to the Republican nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	A little-known GOP congressman from Long Island, Rick Lazio,  
could be standing in Giuliani's way. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will be making an announcement sometime in the summer and I  
can't imagine right now that announcement is not going to be a 
positive one,'' Lazio, 41, said recently. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican primary, which would come just two months before  
next year's Senate election, could leave the mayor badly bruised 
and with a lighter bank account or even as a loser, according to 
some veteran New York politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real problem for Rudy,'' New York GOP consultant Jay  
Severin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people who vote in Republican primaries don't regard  
(Giuliani) as a conservative and they do regard themselves as 
conservatives,'' Severin explained. ``There is the 
'he's-not-one-of-us' mentality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The way you beat Rudy Giuliani is you run as the Republican,''  
Lazio said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Giuliani has earned high marks from Republicans and many  
Democrats for a crime-fighting, quality-of-life approach credited 
with making New York City more livable, New York's most powerful 
local GOP chairman, Nassau County's Joseph Mondello, said that 
``with rock-ribbed Republicans, there appears to be a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservatives complain about the mayor's support for abortion  
and gay rights, gun control and his opposition to President 
Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans, especially in traditionally Republican upstate  
New York, have not forgiven Giuliani for crossing party lines in 
1994 to endorse then-Gov. Mario Cuomo over George Pataki in a race 
won by the GOP challenger. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Lazio is considered a Giuliani threat in large part  
because of a widespread belief that Pataki and his political 
mentor, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, are behind the fresh-faced, 
four-term congressman. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki denies playing favorites, although aides to the governor  
have assisted the congressman in his recent travels across the 
state. Lazio says the governor and D'Amato ``have been very 
generous with their advice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Republican primaries are about organization and the people  
still remember what Giuliani said about Cuomo in 1994, so I can see 
a scenario where this kid could win,'' Lazio supporter Howard 
DeMartini, chairman of the congressman's home Suffolk County GOP, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He holds Giuliani even in the suburbs, beats him badly  
upstate, and there are not enough Republican votes in the city to 
make a difference,'' DeMartini said. 
</P>
<P>
	While New York City represents about 30 percent of the statewide  
vote in general elections, it contributes only about 15 percent of 
GOP primary voting. About one-third of Republican primary votes 
come from Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Also eyeing the Republican nomination is Rep. Peter King,  
another Long Islander. 
</P>
<P>
	``A popular Republican from Long Island is Giuliani's worst  
nightmare,'' said GOP pollster John McLoughlin, who has done work 
for both Lazio and King. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazio has been assiduously courting the state's tiny, but  
politically influential Conservative Party. Over the past 25 years, 
no Republican has won statewide office in New York without 
Conservative Party backing. But in a critical gun control vote 
Thursday night, he supported stronger gun controls over the 
objections of the Conservative Party's leader in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Given Giuliani's demonstrated ability to pull votes in heavily  
Democratic New York City, a potential boost for the GOP in the 
general election, ``Democrats will not be sorry if Rick Lazio is in 
the primary,'' veteran Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf said. 
``They will be very happy people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lazio thinks a primary victory over Giuliani could give him  
a big boost for a race against Mrs. Clinton. While the first lady's 
camp knows it could wind up facing a ``giant killer'' who comes 
across as more likable than the mayor, it also believes Lazio 
presents a starker conservative contrast for them than Giuliani 
would. 
</P>
<P>
	Giuliani aides say they're not worried about possible Republican  
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not worried about Peter King, Rick Lazio,'' Bruce  
Teitelbaum, who heads up the mayor's political operation, said. 
``We're focusing on the things we have to do to get ourselves ready 
should the mayor decide to run.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect Linked to Columbine Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A man who allegedly introduced the two  
Columbine High School killers to a man who sold them a 
semiautomatic gun has been arrested, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Duran, 22, is accused of providing a gun to a minor, a  
charge that carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison. He is 
also accused of possessing a dangerous or illegal weapon, which 
carries up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, stormed Columbine on  
April 20, hurling explosives and blasting away with four guns. They 
killed 13 people and wounded 23 students before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold used a semiautomatic TEC DC-9 that was  
purchased from Mark Manes, 22, in February, and three other guns 
that had been legally purchased by Klebold's girlfriend, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran worked with Harris and Klebold at a pizza parlor, and  
authorities said he is suspected of putting the two in contact with 
Manes at a gun show in January. Duran allegedly delivered part of 
the students' payment for the TEC DC-9 and collected $125 for 
helping them. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes is also charged with providing a weapon to a minor. His  
attorney has said Manes did not know why the students wanted the 
gun.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Slave Laborers Blast German Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- German companies agreed Thursday to review  
details of a promised fund to compensate Nazi-era slave laborers 
after victims harshly criticized a plan unveiled last week, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement followed talks in Bonn between Chancellor  
Gerhard Schroeder's chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, U.S. 
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, and attorneys 
representing former slave laborers in the United States and Germany 
who have filed class-action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Schroeder and German industry have pledged to have the fund  
running by September, but negotiations have dragged on for months. 
Last week, 16 German companies that profited from Nazi-era slave 
labor announced details of a promised compensation fund that aims 
to quash lawsuits by survivors of slave labor. 
</P>
<P>
	But victims' groups were enraged by provisions that payments  
would only be offered for six months of slave labor or longer, and 
that they would be based on average pensions and the cost of living 
in claimants' home countries, not back wages. That would mean 
former slave laborers living in poorer countries would be paid less 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's statement said there ``appeared to be wide areas of  
agreement'' on numerous issues, including ``need for a prompt and 
fair resolution,'' and ``need for legal closure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, it said, there were still areas of  
disagreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Also at the talks were representatives of the Jewish Claims  
Conference, Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Lothar Evers, head of a German group  
representing former Nazi-era slave laborers, said the victims 
should be at the negotiating table, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Former slave laborers were ``not being accepted as equal  
negotiating partners ... Instead they are being asked to apply as 
supplicants, as charity cases,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salvatore Bertorelli, who was forced to work for three months  
for a chemical company at a Nazi labor camp in Germany during World 
War II, said the time limit proposed by industry last week was 
arbitrary. 
</P>
<P>
	``This camp was so brutal that no one survived more than three  
months,'' Bertorelli, a British-Italian national, told a news 
conference.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Warns GOP of Gore Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Promising a major push to elect Republicans  
next year, Christian Coalition President Pat Robertson is urging 
Senate GOP leaders to stress a religious and pro-family agenda or 
risk ceding issues to Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he also used a series of meetings with top Senate  
Republicans on Thursday to ask for a ``Senate inquiry'' into the 
Internal Revenue Service for its ``selective enforcement'' in 
granting tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS recently denied that status to the Christian Coalition.  
Robertson said ``everybody you could name of the liberal persuasion 
seemed to have no problem'' getting tax-exempt status, including 
the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those Robertson met with were Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss.; Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla.; and Sen. 
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. He described the sessions in an interview, 
saying he received no commitments for votes or for an IRS inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he told the lawmakers the Christian Coalition  
intends to ``gear up very strong'' for next year's voting, which he 
said ``could be the most crucial election of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Christian Coalition isn't in the game, the Republicans  
are going to lose'' in 2000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson made his rounds on Capitol Hill a day after Gore  
formally announced his candidacy for president in remarks stressing 
family, values and faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore is in the process of co-opting a number of Republican  
issues,'' Robertson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he told Lott that with the votes lawmakers have taken so  
far this year, ``The average person doesn't understand what the 
Republican Congress is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he suggested votes on a proposed constitutional  
amendment that would protect religious Americans from 
discrimination, and on a GOP plan to reduce taxes on married 
couples, many of whom owe more than they would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition spokesman Mike Russell said Robertson also  
said the GOP should express its desire to win a veto-proof 
congressional majority for banning certain late-term abortions that 
opponents have labeled ``partial-birth abortions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Robertson had requested the meetings at this time,  
Russell said the Christian Coalition founder was disappointed by 
``the knee-jerk reaction'' of the Senate to the shootings at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved some restrictions on gun sales. Russell said  
Robertson believes that instead, Congress should address ``the real 
moral problems of this country'' by helping families and 
emphasizing faith. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has concluded that some Christian Coalition activities,  
such as its distribution of voter guides at churches across the 
country, were too partisan for it to enjoy tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had asked the GOP senators to intervene with the IRS  
on his group's behalf, Robertson said he did not have to because 
the ruling will ``only be a hiccup in our operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition officials have said the group is  
reorganizing to deal with the ruling. A new Christian Coalition 
International will engage in partisan activity, including candidate 
endorsements and political contributions. The Christian Coalition 
of Texas, a tax-exempt group, will be renamed Christian Coalition 
of America and will limit its activity to nonprofit ``voter

<HEADLINE> Jury Deliberates in Lewis Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Jury deliberations began Thursday in the  
malpractice case stemming from the death of Boston Celtics captain 
Reggie Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gilbert Mudge and two consultants, Drs. Mark Creager and  
Peter Friedman, are accused by the player's widow of misdiagnosing 
and mistreating Lewis' fatal heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	After nearly seven weeks of testimony, the jury received  
instructions from the judge Thursday morning. Jurors then were 
given a five-page questionnaire containing 16 questions about 
whether the doctors were negligent and, if so, whether that 
negligence contributed to Lewis' death. 
</P>
<P>
	If 13 of the 15 jurors answer ``yes'' to those questions, there  
are further entries where they must calculate damage figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna Harris-Lewis is asking for the money her husband would  
have earned playing basketball had he lived, estimated at as much 
as $75 million by plaintiff's attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated about four hours before going home for the  
day and was scheduled to resume Friday morning. The panel had one 
request Thursday, for a list of witnesses and designations of which 
were considered experts by the court.

<HEADLINE> No Charges Filed Vs. Indiana Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Bob Knight, more somber than angry, was  
hardly relieved by a prosecutor's decision not to charge him in a 
restaurant parking lot scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't any relief,'' the Indiana basketball coach said  
Wednesday, an hour after prosecutor Carl Salzmann agreed with 
Knight's contention he was provoked by another diner at the 
restaurant last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for his hot temper and seemingly at the center of one  
controversy after another throughout his career, Knight lashed out 
at Salzmann for taking so long to act and at the news media for, 
once again, being too willing to go along with a groundless 
accusation. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're accused of something that you didn't do, and when  
this is battered about pretty carelessly by a lot of different 
institutions ... there's no relief in this,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't appreciate being treated differently from  
anybody else in Monroe County. I don't care that my name happens to 
be Knight instead of Jones. I don't think that calls for any 
different treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other man, Chris Foster, said he overheard Knight make what  
he regarded as a racist remark as the coach talked with his wife 
and her two sisters during dinner at an Ellettsville restaurant on 
June 7. When he confronted Knight in the parking lot, the coach 
started screaming at him, grabbed him by the neck and choked him, 
Foster said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster scheduled a news conference in Indianapolis today.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Salzmann told reporters that Foster, a 38-year-old  
guitar-maker, initiated the confrontations inside and outside the 
restaurant. Red marks on Foster's neck may have resulted from being 
grabbed by the collar, which Knight admitted, but they certainly 
weren't choke marks, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the facts I have, including the medical records, my  
decision is not to file charges,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But that didn't satisfy Knight, who repeatedly criticized the  
prosecutor for letting the case drag for nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Monroe County prosecutor's office investigated Charles  
Manson, it still would be undecided,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without exception, these (misdemeanor) things are either  
immediately thrown out or resolved in two days. ... I'd like to 
refer to this whole thing as a real Mickey Mouse operation, but 
that would be an insult to Mickey Mouse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said it took so long to resolve because Foster hired a  
lawyer and did not make himself available for questioning until 
Wednesday morning. And Foster's dinner companion, who backed his 
friend's story in an earlier interview with the media, refused to 
talk to police altogether, Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until another restaurant patron and his wife came  
forward on Tuesday -- in support of Knight -- that the prosecutor 
felt he had enough information to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to make sure justice is done, based on the facts,''  
Salzmann said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Knight said there were at least three other people in the  
restaurant who gave statements that corroborated what he, his wife 
Karen and her sisters told police from the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	``The information that is available to the prosecutor's office  
at this moment was available to them no later than Wednesday of 
last week,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	He later hinted he might respond to the incident in another way.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where it goes from here, but I do know that there  
are avenues open that involve things that are relative to this 
thing that happened,'' Knight told Indianapolis television station 
WTHR. ``I'm going fishing, and if I get some kind of idea while I'm 
fishing, that's where I'm going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Knight said the accusation by Foster and lengthy  
investigation ``totally disrupted our lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, we have to have rights. We have to have a right  
to go out and have a family dinner and have a conversation with our 
family, a perfectly harmless conversation,'' she said. ``You should 
have some protection so somebody can't come up and continue to 
harass you until you are forced to respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her visibly weary husband said, ``Karen has been unbelievably  
good for me ... But the other night, Monday night, after the second 
postponement (of a decision by the prosecutor) she said, `You know, 
if you're ready to quit, I'm ready to go.' I've never heard 
anything like that from her before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight gave no indication that he ever considered resigning. He  
left immediately without taking questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Karen Knight's sister, Gina Vieth, also criticized the media.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Chris Foster has missed his calling. He shouldn't be a  
guitar-maker. He should be in the media, because you guys have a 
real knack for getting things wrong and taking things out of 
context,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Police Sgt. J.D. Maxwell also spoke at Knight's news  
conference and said witnesses confirmed no profanity or racial 
slurs came from Knight's table at the restaurant. He said they 
heard Knight talking about the old Negro baseball leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``The conversation was not racist. He said those players were  
cheated by not going into the same league white players were in. 
The main thing is, without a doubt, there was no profanity, no 
racial slurs. As sure as there's a God in heaven, I know Bob Knight 
is not a racist,'' Maxwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said Foster's actions were ``in the realm of  
provocation,'' but he would not charge Foster because of the 
relatively minor nature of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``Responsible men can differ on what is provocation,'' Salzmann  
said. ``But a criminal charge has to be proven beyond a reasonable 
doubt, and I don't feel that there needs to be any more time and 
resources spent in that regard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foster's attorney Kevin McGoff, said his client was relieved not  
to be charged, although he did not agree with the characterization 
that he provoked Knight in the restaurant.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Gains Support for UN Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke gained significant  
Republican support Thursday for his confirmation as the nation's 
U.N. ambassador after he apologized to senators for 
``carelessness'' that led to questions about his ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said he violated no laws, but acknowledged that he  
``may not have been careful enough about the appearances'' of his 
contacts with State Department officials abroad just months after 
leaving a top position with the agency in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, he was a private investment banker while also  
serving as an unpaid foreign policy adviser to the State 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,  
remained mum on his position toward the nomination despite 
beginning the first of three hearings with sharp criticism of 
Holbrooke's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	However, among the 10 Republicans on the 18-member committee,  
influential Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana said during the hearing 
that he would back the nominee -- and three other GOP members 
indicated they would also support Holbrooke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had said unless something comes out of the hearing ... that  
I don't know about, that I don't anticipate, then I think he is 
qualified and I'll vote for him,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., is ``likely to support the  
nomination,'' his spokeswoman Mary Healy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Holbrooke will be confirmed,'' commented Sen. Bill  
Frist, R-Tenn., adding, ``Obviously, that's where I'm leaning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were effusive in their support, pointing out that  
allegations of wrongdoing by Holbrooke began with an anonymous 
letter to the State Department inspector general, who proceeded 
without showing the nominee a copy. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke, the architect of the Bosnian peace accords, was  
contrite, saying, ``I apologize to the committee and its staff for 
any inconvenience'' his behavior caused. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said that in the meetings abroad where State  
Department officials were present, ``I would not discuss 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his employer, Credit Suisse First Boston, ``never gained  
from any of these meetings'' -- a policy he said he stuck to even 
though company officials ``were not happy'' about it. The meetings 
in question were from 1996 to this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms produced figures showing that Credit Suisse paid $21,805  
to cover Holbrooke's airfare, hotels and meals on many of the 
trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law imposes a one-year ``cooling-off'' period, designed  
to prevent lobbying of former co-workers. During that year, 
ex-government officials cannot discuss official matters with 
employees of their former agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Even beyond the one-year time frame, Holbrooke acknowledged he  
erred in not making it clear that the discussions were in his 
government role -- and concerned only U.S. foreign policy goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``With regret I must say that carelessness on occasion on my  
part contributed to these misconceptions,'' Holbrooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said in his opening statement that Holbrooke ignored legal  
advice that could have prevented conflicts of interest while he 
served in both roles. He also criticized the nominee's acceptance 
of $900,000 for speeches and articles about U.S. foreign policy. A 
federal law says even special employees cannot receive compensation 
for speaking and writing on subjects involved in their official 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Holbrooke could have avoided such conflicts of interest by  
seeking and following the advice'' of either Credit Suisse lawyers 
or State Department attorneys, Helms said. ``But time and again, 
the evidence shows Mr. Holbrooke either chose not to seek ethics 
advice or to ignore it when it was given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Helms said Holbrooke earned his honoraria by speaking and  
writing ``about the very issues that were a part of his duties'' as 
a State Department official. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton first announced his intention to nominate  
Holbrooke a year ago, and he was formally nominated in February 
after paying a $5,000 Justice Department fine for blurring his 
public and private roles during a trip to South Korea. Holbrooke 
said he settled the case so his nomination could move forward, and 
the State Department cleared him of any wrongdoing on the speaking 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's senior Democrat, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware,  
defended Holbrooke, saying: ``I believe strongly that none of these 
matters even approach the level where they should be considered 
disqualifying. I do not believe for one minute that Richard 
Holbrooke is an unethical person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke told the hearing that on visits to foreign countries  
``it was common courtesy to inform ambassadors'' of U.S. foreign 
policy goals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Holding KLA to Weaponry Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States will hold the rebel Kosovo  
Liberation Army to its pledge to surrender heavy weaponry as NATO 
forces take control in Kovoso province, a senior State Department 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our attitude toward the KLA is to hold them to their  
commitments,'' James Dobbins said Wednesday. Dobbins oversees U.S. 
policy in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Defense Secretary William Cohen planned a second day  
of discussions with his Russian counterpart aimed at defusing an 
embarrassing standoff between NATO and Russian forces in at the 
airport outside Pristina, the capital of the Serbian province. 
Russian peacekeepers rushed into Kosovo ahead of NATO last weekend, 
and continue to hold the key airfield. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA fought a guerrilla war against the Serbs in a drive for  
independence, but has so far mostly acquiesced in NATO's plan to 
leave Kosovo as a largely autonomous province within Serbia and 
greater Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	A peace pact negotiated between NATO and the Belgrade government  
of Slobodan Milosevic calls for the KLA to be ``demilitarized'' but 
not disarmed. That has been interpreted to mean the KLA may keep 
most small arms such as rifles but must relinquish mortars or other 
more powerful weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders of the ethnic Albanian insurgents have reaffirmed they  
will cooperate with NATO forces trying to keep peace in Kosovo, 
Dobbins said. But the KLA leadership may not be in control of every 
rebel unit to guarantee the weapons surrenders, Dobbins told a 
seminar at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a government-financed 
research group. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of their first peacekeeping activities, U.S. Marines took  
weapons from about 200 KLA fighters Wednesday. Rebels in the 
farming village of Zegra first refused to yield weaponry but 
relented when threatened by armored personnel carriers and Cobra 
attack helicopters, Marine Capt. David Eiland said in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Six leaders of the KLA group who were taken away in handcuffs  
were later released, a Pentagon spokesman said today. They were not 
charged, and no one was injured during the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate incident, American forces picked up three Serbs  
who were accused by locals of war crimes. A U.S. military spokesman 
in Macedonia, Capt. Paul Swiergosz, said military 
counterintelligence officers questioned the men and decided to 
release them. The Pentagon today confirmed the men's release. 
</P>
<P>
	An international war crimes tribunal indicted Milosevic and four  
senior associates for allegedly forcing some ethnic Albanians from 
their homes and massacring others. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Navy Capt. Mike Doubleday said NATO forces  
have come upon or heard about 90 suspected mass grave sites since 
seizing control of the Kosovo province from retreating Serbs in 
recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb forces were given an extra day to vacate central Kosovo  
because of logistical problems that included clogged roads, but 
Sunday's deadline for all Serb forces to vacate the province still 
holds, Doubleday said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Director Loyal to Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The IOC general assembly opened today  
with a senior administrator denying rumors of an in-house plot 
against President Juan Antonio Samaranch and pledging loyalty to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Carrard, director general of the International Olympic  
Committee, addressed speculation that he and other staff at IOC 
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, were working to oust 
Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been some rumors floating around,'' Carrard told  
the delegates. ``The entire administration and secretariat are 
fully dedicated to serving the institution, and we all totally 
support our president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard's statement came at the start of the 109th IOC session,  
whose deliberations were opened to the media for the first time in 
history. The proceedings were beamed to journalists via 
closed-circuit television feed. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of business was the swearing-in of new members,  
including Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, heir to the Dutch throne. 
The prince's IOC membership was questioned by Dutch 
parliamentarians following the Olympic corruption scandal, but the 
government gave its go-ahead when the IOC took steps toward reform. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Samaranch dismissed as ``rumors'' the recent  
published reports that IOC staff have plotted against him, and 
expressed support for Carrard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always we have rumors,'' he told reporters. ``I am not  
worried. Nothing has happened. ... In an organization like ours, we 
have to be used to rumors. But rumors are rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also reiterated he intends to complete the final two  
years of his term and declared the IOC won't rush into reforms to 
appease critics. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the opening ceremony of the assembly, Samaranch  
said the committee already had taken important steps toward reform 
following the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stressed the IOC would move at its own pace and on its  
own terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say `yes' to reforms necessary to consolidate the Olympic  
movement, without renouncing our convictions,'' he said. ``We say 
`no' to hasty reforms to please our critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``No to reforms which defend the interests of some at the  
expense of others. No to reforms based on personal and conflicting 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Samaranch sought to erase any further speculation  
that he might retire early. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is to leave to my successor, at the end of my term  
in 2001, an institution which is over 100 years old, solid and 
beyond reproach,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a breakfast meeting with a small group of reporters,  
Samaranch was eager to put across the same point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not leaving,'' he said. ``I have decided to go until the  
end of my mandate. The only thing that can stop me is if I don't 
have the confidence of IOC members or if I am ill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also refuted suggestions of a rift with IOC vice president  
Dick Pound, who has publicly speculated that Samaranch might retire 
after reforms are made at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980 and turns 79 next  
month, released a letter signed by the 10 members of the executive 
board -- including Pound -- endorsing his continued leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these difficult times of crisis wrought with danger, a  
strong, wise, trusted leadership is essential,'' the letter said. 
``We unanimously support you ... and ask you to continue to devote 
your time to the Olympic movement as president of the IOC, until 
the end of your present mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day IOC session will include progress reports from  
organizers of the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Winter Games in 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the IOC will elect the host city of the 2006 Winter  
Games. The six cities in the all-European race are Helsinki, 
Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Sion, 
Switzerland; Turin, Italy; and Zakopane, Poland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Open Glance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- A brief look at the first round of the  
U.S. Open, played on the 7,175-yard, par-70 Pinehurst No. 2 
course: 
</P>
<P>
	 *Leading:* David Duval, the world's top-ranked player, shot a  
3-under-par 67 and was tied for the lead with Phil Mickelson, Billy 
Mayfair and Paul Goydos. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Chasing:* Tiger Woods and John Daly were one shot off the lead.  
The group at 1-under included Vijay Singh, Justin Leonard, Jim 
Furyk and Hal Sutton. Davis Love fired a 70. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Key statistic:* The last time as many as four players were tied  
for the lead after the first round was 1984, when Mike Donald, 
Hubert Green, Hale Irwin and Jim Thorpe shot 2-under 68 at Winged 
Foot. Thorpe turned out to the highest finisher among that group, 
tying for fourth behind winner Fuzzy Zoeller, Greg Norman and 
Curtis Strange. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Note of the day:* Woods, ranked second in the world, and Duval  
each broke par in the opening round of a U.S. Open for the first 
time. Maybe they'll finally go head-to-head in a final round of a 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Quote of the day:* ``It's not worth the tournament,'' said  
Mickelson, vowing to return home if his pregnant wife, Amy, goes 
into labor. ``As important as the U.S. Open is to me and every 
other player in the field, this is the birth of my first child.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Key groups:* Duval, Mickelson, Carlos Franco (69), 11:50 a.m.;  
Woods, Lee Westwood (73) and Corey Pavin (74), 7:30 a.m.; Daly, 
Furyk and Darren Clarke (73), 8:30 a.m.; Leonard, Love and Greg 
Norman (73), 7:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Television (all times EDT):* Friday, Noon-3 p.m. (ESPN), 3-5  
p.m. (NBC), 5-7:30 p.m. (ESPN); Saturday and Sunday, 12:30-7 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Sr. Manager for a Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Sr., the Reds' manager for a day,  
was having fun before Thursday night's game with Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this all Jack does?'' Griffey joked as he sat in Jack  
McKeon's office and talked with reporters, as McKeon does before 
every game. 
</P>
<P>
	``You want a cigar to relax your nerves?'' asked pitching coach  
Don Gullett, referring to McKeon's stogie habit. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, the Reds' bench coach, was in charge for because McKeon  
had gone home to North Carolina to be with his wife, who had breast 
cancer surgery. McKeon was expected back Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The doctors said they were able to remove all of the cancer,  
and Carol is doing fine,'' McKeon said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, who wants to manage full-time someday, seemed  
embarrassed by the well wishers who kept calling him ``Skip.'' When 
Greg Vaughn greeted him at the batting cage, Griffey just rolled 
his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody has been congratulating me about being manager.  
That's a strange feeling,'' Griffey said. 
</P>
<P>
	His famous son, Ken Griffey Jr., offered no advice.  
</P>
<P>
	``He just said, `I hope you win,' '' dad said.  
</P>
<P>
	For his major league debut, Griffey gave umpires a lineup card  
filled out by McKeon. Gullett was expected to make the pitching 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone has their assigned jobs,'' Griffey said. ``We're  
going to work together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Griffey, 49, played 19 years in the big leagues and has spent  
nine years as a coach or instructor. He managed in the Arizona Fall 
League last year, and will manage the Santurce team next winter in 
the Puerto Rican winter league.

	Greenspan Gives Interest Rate Signal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with few signs of inflation, the Federal  
Reserve may take ``pre-emptive'' action to protect the U.S. economy 
from problems that could halt its spectacular run of growth, 
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress today. Economists called it a 
clear signal the Fed will raise interest rates soon -- the second 
such hint from Greenspan this week. But the market showed little 
adverse reaction, in part because traders already assumed the Fed 
will raise rates at least once. ``They had been worried that he 
would say something worse,'' said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells 
Fargo &AMP; Co.

	Compaq Issues Earnings Warning  
</P>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. dismayed Wall Street for a  
second time in two months today, disclosing an unexpected quarterly 
financial loss and a restructuring aimed at slashing $2 billion in 
annual costs that will include job cuts. Compaq tied its troubles 
to computer price wars, sluggish sales and a bloated cost 
structure. The company predicts it will report a loss of up to 15 
cents a share in the second quarter, compared to a profit of 20 
cents expected by analysts. The news sent Compaq's stock down as 
much as 10 percent before recovering. Compaq ended up 1/4 at at 22 1/2.

	Belgium Keeps Ban on Coke  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Belgian's government extended its ban  
on Coke but agreed today to allow sales of some of the company's 
other beverages to resume for the first time since Monday, when 
they were ordered from shelves after dozens of people became ill 
after drinking Coca-Cola products. And while France partially 
relaxed its ban on sales of Coca-Cola, Switzerland joined a move by 
other nations to block sales of Coca-Cola drinks produced in 
Belgium. In Belgium, the Heath Ministry said it will allow sales of 
Coca-Cola's Nestea, Aquarius, Bonaqua, Kinley, Lift and Minute Maid 
brands. But the ban was extended on Coke, Fanta and Sprite.

	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- The nation's largest cereal maker  
announced today it is considering closing part of its historic 
Battle Creek cereal plant and eliminating up to 64 percent of the 
jobs at the facility. Under the proposal, up to 700 of the current 
1,100 jobs at the Kellogg Co. plant would be eliminated as early as 
the first quarter of 2000, the company said. Kellogg will not say 
what percentage of its overall production comes from its Battle 
Creek plant, which makes Kellogg's Corn Flakes.

	Trade Deficit Holds at Record High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit held steady in April --  
though still at a record high -- amid early signs that U.S. 
companies are selling more products to foreign countries recovering 
from recession. ``While it cannot be said that the world's markets 
for U.S products is booming again, it certainly does look as if the 
bottom has been reached,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at 
Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. April's trade deficit of 
$18.9 billion matched a revised estimate of the deficit in March, 
the Commerce Department said today.

swift Senate approval as Treasury secretary, assured lawmakers 
today he will continue policies aimed at fostering economic growth. 
Summers now holds the No. 2 slot at the Treasury Department and is 
seeking to succeed Robert Rubin, who announced plans last month to 
leave the post. The Senate Finance Committee's chairman, William 
Roth, R-Del., said his panel expects to vote on and approve 
Summers' nomination on Tuesday. ``I think it would be 
overwhelming'' Roth said of the committee's support.

	Court Authority Over Assets Limited  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal judges generally cannot protect  
plaintiffs in lawsuits by barring defendants from spending or 
giving away their assets, the Supreme Court ruled today. In a 5-4 
decision, the justices said a New York federal judge could not bar 
a group of Mexican companies from transferring assets while they 
were being sued by U.S. investors. Traditionally, creditors must 
first win judgment in a case, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the 
court. Writing for the four, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said now 
that assets can be transferred almost instantly, courts should be 
allowed to keep defendants from ``making themselves 
judgment-proof'' by transferring assets.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prodded by Congress, the airlines today  
announced a package of voluntary measures to address growing 
complaints from consumers about poor service. Also today, Amtrak 
revealed a plan to win back disgruntled rail passengers, including 
enhanced food-service options and guaranteed refund vouchers to any 
dissatisfied passenger. The airlines' measures include ensuring 
that each airline will tell customers the lowest fare available, 
notifying customers of delays, supporting an increase in the 
baggage liability limit, allowing reservations to be held without 
payment for 24 hours and providing prompt refunds.

	Russia Rejects Bill To Get IMF Loan

<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Communist-dominated parliament frustrated  
the country's chances of winning crucial foreign loans by defeating 
a government-supported economic reform bill today. The bill, which 
would have imposed a new tax on gas stations, is part of a package 
of reforms designed to meet conditions for a $4.5 billion loan from 
the International Monetary Fund. Moscow wants the money to pay off 
old debts to the IMF. The lower house of parliament, the State 
Duma, voted 219-101 to reject the bill.

	Britain May Ban Some Tobacco Ads

<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Tobacco advertisements would be banned from  
billboards, newspapers and stores by the end of the year under a 
draft proposal announced today by the British government. The 
initiative also calls for ending tobacco sponsorship of major 
cultural and sporting events by July 2003. Formula One car racing 
and other events such as snooker, which are highly dependent on 
tobacco sponsorship, would be given an additional three years to 
find alternative sponsors. Tobacco advertising already is banned in 
Finland, France, Italy, Portugal, Sweden and Belgium.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Again Pushing Comp Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans on Thursday renewed a drive  
to let workers choose time off instead of overtime pay, saying 
their comp-time legislation should be part of the coming debate 
over raising the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would make it easier for employees to pick  
compensatory time off -- 1 1/2 hours for every hour of overtime work -- 
rather than the decades-long time-and-a-half overtime pay standard. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton vetoed the bill in 1996 because of concerns  
that employers could discriminate against workers who choose 
overtime pay instead of time off. Senate Democrats filibustered the 
measure in the last Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Working parents, especially mothers, need the flexible working  
hours to help balance the demands of their jobs with the needs of 
their families, said Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo. ``No matter where 
you are, unless you're in the government, which already has some of 
these programs, you find people suffering from this trauma,'' said 
Ashcroft, the bill's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Flexible job schedules could allow a working mother to leave  
work early on Friday for a child's doctor's appointment, and then 
make up the missed time the next week without suffering a loss of 
pay,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft said he has made changes to make the measure more  
palatable to Democrats. The bill sets up an 80-hour, two-week 
schedule, but unlike past proposals, it sets a 50-hour limit for 
any given workweek. Unused time off would be converted to cash at 
the end of each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft and Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., one of more than 30  
co-sponsors, said the approaching debate over boosting the minimum 
wage is an ideal setting for another attempt to pass comp-time 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, including Missouri Rep. William Clay and Sen. Edward  
Kennedy of Massachusetts, are pushing to phase in over two years a 
$1 increase in the minimum wage to $6.15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Frankly, I suspect that if there is a minimum wage proposal  
that is made, it would be appropriate to think about things like 
this in conjunction with it,'' said Ashcroft. 
</P>
<P>
	The last wage increase, 90 cents an hour, was implemented in two  
stages, in 1996 and 1997. Republicans are facing potentially 
unstoppable demands for another increase this year; House Majority 
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, conceded in April that Congress may act 
this year to raise the minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri senators have opposed previous wage increases, but  
on Thursday, neither ruled out the possibility of supporting a wage 
increase should it include a comp time provision. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kennedy's spokesman, Jim Manley, ruled out a compromise on  
the GOP measure, which he labeled ``an anti-labor poison pill.'' 
Even with the concessions, Manley said, employers could misuse it 
to undermine the traditional 40-hour workweek. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no choice in flex time,'' Manley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft, who was joined at a Capitol Hill news conference by  
Bond and Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas and Michael Enzi, 
R-Wyo., said the option would be voluntary and optional for 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashcroft said a Rutgers University survey released in March  
bolsters the cause by reporting that 87 percent of 1,000 adult 
workers rated flexible work hours or days as important.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky Court Voids Gambling Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- A man who ran up close to $400,000 in  
gambling debts at an off-track betting parlor does not have to pay 
up because of a nearly century-old law, the Kentucky Supreme Court 
ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	Because gambling was illegal then, the statute deemed all  
gambling debts void. In light of that, Justice Donald Wintersheimer 
said that when Kentucky Off-Track Betting took checks from James 
McBurney, the betting parlor was in effect loaning him money to 
gamble. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real issue presented here is whether one may collect money  
loaned or advanced to a person to bet while that person is actually 
engaged in betting,'' Wintersheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1994 and early 1995, McBurney was a regular customer at  
the KOTB parlor in Corbin. At one point, his debt neared $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
	McBurney, who wrote numerous checks to cover his losses, said he  
told KOTB there was not enough money in his account to cover the 
checks. KOTB, however, said they learned only later about the lack 
of funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In March 1995, McBurney signed a promissory note and agreed to a  
repayment schedule. He made several payments, then stopped with the 
tab still at $342,565. 
</P>
<P>
	The KOTB company, which was authorized by the General Assembly  
in 1992 and is owned by the thoroughbred race tracks in Kentucky, 
sued to force payment. 
</P>
<P>
	In its 5-2 decision today, the court said KOTB was out of luck.  
</P>
<P>
	``By accepting checks that it knew to be worthless in exchange  
for bets while McBurney was actually engaged in betting and by 
continuing to allow him to place more bets thereafter, KOTB clearly 
entered into a gambling transaction declared void by the plain 
language of (the law),'' Wintersheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	KOTB had argued that the turn-of-the-century law has been  
superseded by more recent legislation that actually promotes 
gambling, including that to create KOTB parlors. 
</P>
<P>
	But ``betting is legal, the lending of money by a betting  
facility in order to bet is not,'' Wintersheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Martin Johnstone, who wrote the dissenting opinion, said  
the ruling made no sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is preposterous that while it is legal to place a  
pari-mutuel wager on a horse race at an authorized facility, and it 
is legal to loan money, it is illegal to loan money to someone to 
place a legal wager on a horse race in this commonwealth,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Christian Bikers Battle Over Logo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- A court battle between bikers may require  
divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sons of God Motorcycle Club Ministry Inc. is suing the  
Chosen Sons of God Motorcycle Club Ministries for allegedly trying 
to take over its corporate identity through use of the name, and a 
logo showing Christ's head with a crown of thorns and the words 
``New Jerusalem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It symbolizes our identity and who we are,'' Sons of God  
President Thomas Douthat testified Thursday before U.S. Magistrate 
Michael Merz. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've chosen New Jerusalem as our territory, which is a future  
place,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bikers in leather jackets, ponytails and tattoos filled the  
courtroom for the trial. Included on the witness list are Happy 
Jack, Ring-a-ding, Stealth and Bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Douthat's group seeks $500,000 in damages and asks that the  
Chosen Sons of God be barred from using the name. 
</P>
<P>
	Sons of God is a non-profit corporation that serves as a  
Christian ministry. It has about 200 members in 17 chapters in 
about 10 states, including Pennsylvania, New York, North and South 
Carolina, Florida, Tennessee, Ohio and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of its members are ministers and pastors, and some are  
former members of outlaw motorcycle clubs who have abandoned their 
rough-and-tumble ways for a more spiritual life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The organization gave them a place to belong,'' said Douthat,  
who is known as Virginia Tom and is a minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Douthat said the dispute arose after ``Mountain Bill'' Hodge of  
Dayton was expelled from Sons of God for creating ``division and 
dissension'' after he lost a presidential election in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodge says the Chosen Sons are the true owners of the name and  
the Christ-head symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-jury trial was to continue Friday.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Scare Adds to Coke Headache </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- With struggling foreign economies already hurting  
sales and its bottom line, Coca-Cola had enough headaches overseas 
before its soft drinks were linked to the hospitalization of dozens 
of people in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Now some Belgians say they're kicking their Coke habits for  
good. And publicity surrounding the scare threatens to tarnish the 
soft-drink giant's image worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say they don't expect permanent damage to Coke's  
image or its finances, largely because of the company's worldwide 
popularity and reputation for quality. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a brand with decades of good will behind it,'' said  
John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``It's not an 
accident that Coke sells so much of its product in these countries. 
It sells its product because it's been there a long time and people 
like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke chairman M. Douglas Ivester expressed the company's regrets  
to European customers Wednesday in his first public statement about 
the scare. He said the company ``will not rest'' until consumers 
are assured of Coke's quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 113 years our success has been based on the trust that  
consumers have in that quality,'' Ivester said. ``That trust is 
sacred to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas expansion has been key to Coke's growth over the last  
decade. Coke, with brands including Diet Coke, Sprite, Bonaqua and 
Minute Maid fruit juices, now controls half the world's market for 
carbonated soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing that growth has been tough lately. Economic turmoil  
in Asia, Russia and parts of Latin America has hurt sales and 
Coke's earnings. Meanwhile, Coke's plans to expand by buying two 
foreign competitors have been bogged down by antitrust challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	These were Coke's major worries overseas before Belgian  
officials banned Coke products Monday after dozens of youths were 
hospitalized for vomiting, stomach pains and nausea. 
</P>
<P>
	Luxembourg has also banned all Coke products, and other European  
nations have taken similar precautions. France ordered the 
withdrawal of all canned Coke products. And Spain on Wednesday 
froze a shipment of 8,000 bottles of Belgian-produced Coke and 
other Coca-Cola brands in the northern province of Zamora for fear 
of contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke scrambled to get to the bottom of the health scare. It  
traced bad-tasting bottled drinks to a plant in Antwerp, Belgium, 
where the carbon dioxide used to inject fizz into drinks was 
substandard. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, an offensive odor on some cans was traced to a plant in  
Dunkirk, France. The odor was caused by a fungicide on wooden 
pallets used to transport cans to Belgium, which accounts for fewer 
than 1 percent of Coke's sales worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Belgium said today it would reimburse the medical  
costs of anyone who could prove they had fallen ill through 
drinking its products. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government is expected to announce today whether it  
will lift the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke spokesman Rob Baskin said the company is confident the  
problems have been solved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that we're close to satisfying their needs for  
assurance,'' Baskin said. ``And we're hopeful they will allow us to 
resume distribution of our products.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke should largely be able to win back customers frightened by  
the health scare, said Ann Gurkin, an analyst for Davenport and 
Company. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see it impacting consumption,'' she said. ``I think it  
was two unusual events that hit at the same time. I think the 
company will do a great job at explaining what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But workers in Brussels said Wednesday they're not sure they'll  
continue drinking Coke even if Belgium lifts the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I've stopped drinking it, and I don't think I will start  
again,'' said Natalie Sinnodt, 23, a social worker. ``I should have 
stopped anyway for diet reasons, this makes it easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign markets account for 70 percent of Coke's worldwide case  
volume, an important industry indicator measuring sales of units of 
24 eight-ounce servings. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has blamed slumping sales in turbulent foreign  
markets for recent losses. Profits fell 13 percent in the first 
quarter of 1999 and 14 percent for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to kickstart its foreign expansion, Coke has been trying  
to reach a $1 billion-plus deal to buy soft-drink brands owned by 
Cadbury Schweppes -- including Dr Pepper and Canada Dry -- outside 
the United States. But the deal has run afoul of regulators in 
Australia and several European countries who fear it would 
discourage competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Coke signed a $758 million deal to buy the brand  
Orangina from a French company after France had stalled the deal 
for 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Gore Chips Away At Wooden Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- On his second day as a full-fledged presidential  
candidate, Vice President Al Gore sounded as though he had been 
studying how to chip away at his oh-so-wooden image. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stump in Manhattan, he promised true equality for women  
and minorities, after-school programs for teens and pre-school for 
younger children. But perhaps just as importantly, he punctuated 
those pledges with sweeping gestures. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at our economic circumstances today compared to  
what they were seven years ago, the contrast is truly 
astonishing,'' Gore said while warming to about 800 supporters at 
the midtown campaign reception at The Pierre Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	He rattled off the statistics: budget surpluses instead of  
deficits, a rising stock market. And as the applause grew, so did 
his decibel level. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have higher wages, higher living standards, a better  
country!'' Gore shouted in a voice growing guttural with the 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled his mother, who was among the first women graduates  
of Vanderbilt University's law school, and his father, who spoke 
against poll taxes in the 1940s. He dedicated the coming 17-month 
campaign to their ideals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I begin this campaign with a pledge that the progress we've  
made in this century is only the beginning of what we're going to 
do in the 21st century for the equality of women,'' Gore said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	He credited his father -- former U.S. Sen. Al Gore Sr. -- with  
teaching him ``the meaning of political courage'' and again shouted 
louder than the crowd's cheers when vowing that ``the progress that 
we've made toward civil rights in America is only the beginning!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Gore was beginning to stake out his own record in the  
delicate job facing every vice president seeking the top spot: 
distancing himself from the White House while not seeming disloyal. 
</P>
<P>
	``To begin unshackling from the vice presidency is the key,''  
said campaign chairman Tony Coelho. ``We need to break free of the 
vice presidency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip through New York was part of a four-day, six-state  
campaign swing. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the nod he gave traditionally Democratic  
priorities like women's and minority rights, Gore has promised tax 
cuts targeted for small businesses and a doubling of the nation's 
investment in information technology. 
</P>
<P>
	He also weighed in for first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's  
potential U.S. Senate run in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said a bid by Mrs. Clinton would be ``a positive force''  
and generate Democratic enthusiasm throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm all for it,'' the vice president told reporters on Air  
Force Two as it flew to New York. ``It will generate enthusiasm 
here and around the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides were even more direct, saying likely Republican assaults  
on Mrs. Clinton would galvanize women voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are already honing charges that she's a  
carpetbagger, and are likely to revisit sex scandals at the White 
House and financial investigations in Arkansas.

	U.S., Russia Still Differ on Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- U.S. and Russian negotiators opened a  
second day of negotiations today on a Russian role in Kosovo 
peacekeeping that would leave NATO in charge. In Paris, President 
Clinton predicted a ``successful conclusion'' to the talks. ``The 
atmosphere is pretty positive and pretty hopeful,'' Clinton told 
reporters on the lawn of Elysee Palace after a meeting with French 
President Jacques Chirac. Nonetheless, Clinton said the NATO allies 
would not abandon their insistence that peacekeeping forces in 
Kosovo operate under a unified command. The Russians have insisted 
that their troops not come under a NATO commander.

	Kosovo Villagers Describe Massacre  
</P>
<P>
	POKLEK, Yugoslavia (AP) -- In a massacre that left blood dripping  
through the floorboards, Serb police slaughtered 62 ethnic 
Albanians two months ago by herding them into a room, tossing in a 
grenade and spraying survivors with machine-gun fire, villagers 
said today. The grisly events in Poklek, 20 miles west of Pristina, 
came to light as the first NATO troops moved into the area. 
Accounts of mass killings have been surfacing since Serb forces 
began withdrawing from Kosovo to comply with last week's peace 
deal. According to the villagers, the killings occurred April 17 
when Serb police and paramilitary men blocked a group -- mainly 
members of a single extended family -- from going to the adjacent 
town of Glogovac and sent them back to their family compound. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton To Wait and See on Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- President Clinton today advocated a  
``wait-and-see'' approach on seizing Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to stand trial for atrocities in Kosovo, saying NATO's 
first priority is to get the refugees home. The president spoke to 
reporters outside the Elysee Palace, where he and French President 
Jacques Chirac met today and agreed anew that Milosevic must be 
unseated before any international development aid goes to 
rebuilding Serbia from 78 days of NATO airstrikes.

	Clinton Seeks Mideast Peace Process  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- President Clinton gave a vote of confidence today  
to Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, saying the United 
States counted on his new government to revive a ``vigorous 
pursuit'' of the Middle East peace process. ``I don't believe that 
I will have to take any steps to revive the peace process,'' 
Clinton said in response to a reporter's question about the stalled 
peace process. The president spoke to journalists at the Elysee 
Palace.

	Pope Returns to His Birthplace  
</P>
<P>
	KRAKOW, Poland (AP) -- Pope John Paul II extended his pilgrimage  
to Poland by a few hours today to visit the country's holiest 
shrine, making up the stop he missed while he was ill earlier this 
week. The 79-year-old pontiff appeared revitalized today after an 
emotional return to his birthplace of Wadowice last night. Back on 
his feet after a bout of flu, John Paul said a private Mass for 
friends and seminarians today at Krakow's 14th century Wawel 
Cathedral, where he celebrated his first Mass upon becoming a 
priest in 1946.

	Indian Navy Said To Be on Alert

<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A Pakistani military buildup in the  
Arabian Sea has prompted India to put its navy on alert there, The 
Times of India reported today. The move also aroused fear that 
fighting in Kashmir between the two nuclear neighbors could spread 
to the seas. Indian soldiers are trying to cut off ammunition and 
food supplies to Islamic guerrillas entrenched on the snowy 
mountaintops on the Indian-held side of the disputed territory.

Knicks 89-77 last night in Game 1 of the NBA Finals, lead by Tim 
Duncan's 33 points. Duncan was virtually unstoppable all game, 
shooting 13-for-21 and grabbing 16 rebounds. Jaren Jackson had five 
3-pointers and scored 17 for the Spurs.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds French Bank Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The Court of Appeals on Thursday rejected a  
complaint filed jointly by French banks Societe Generale and 
Paribas against the Paris stock exchange regulator's approval of a 
hostile bid for the two banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The court conceded that the bid by the Banque Nationale de  
Paris, known as the BNP, for the two banks created uncertainty for 
investors. But it said this does not alter the validity of the 
tender offer. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP made an unsolicited $37 billion bid for both Societe  
Generale and Paribas on March 10, a month after the two banks had 
themselves announced a friendly merger to create SG Paribas. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks have been fighting off the bid. Should BNP  
succeed, it would create the world's first $1 trillion bank in 
terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Societe Generale sweetened its bid for Paribas  
shares, a move that will further delay the outstanding offers, 
likely until the end of July or even August. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe General has offered Paribas shareholders $78.96 in cash  
for every eight Paribas shares held. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer is in addition to Societe Generale's share offer of  
five Societe Generale shares for every eight Paribas shares, worth 
more than $19 billion. The new offer is worth $1.58 billion if all 
shareholders accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	Market watchers expect BNP to reply in kind. Third party  
counter-bids can be placed five days before the close of a tender 
offer. However, BNP has the right to improve its offer for Paribas 
and Societe Generale shares until one day before the close. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP is offering 11 BNP shares for eight Paribas shares, and 15  
BNP shares for seven Societe Generale shares.

<HEADLINE> Raiders Cut QB Heath Shuler </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) -- Quarterback Heath Shuler, a college star  
who has had little success in the NFL, has been waived by his 
second team in less than four months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oakland Raiders cut Shuler on Thursday on the eve of a  
three-day minicamp. Shuler was cut by the New Orleans Saints in 
late February and signed by the Raiders as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuler, who did not play last season because of a torn toe  
ligament, has been hobbled since crushing bones in his left foot in 
a game at Oakland on Nov. 9, 1997. He started nine games for the 
Saints in 1997, passing for 1,288 yards but throwing just two 
touchdown passes and 14 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuler, who finished second in the 1993 Heisman Trophy balloting  
after passing for 4,088 yards in two seasons at Tennessee, was the 
third overall pick of the 1994 draft by the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	But Redskins fans turned against Shuler because of his 13-day  
holdout while negotiating a $19 million contract with Washington, 
and because of his poor play and fumbles. A shoulder injury led to 
him losing the starting job to Gus Frerotte. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuler was traded to the Saints in April 1997 for two draft  
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders also announced Thursday that they have waived  
defensive tackle Ta'ase Faumui and signed defensive end Ferric 
Collons, who played for the Raiders in 1992-93 and for the New 
England Patriots in 1995-98.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. Buys Avon, Morrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest deal to reshape the U.S.  
publishing industry, Rupert Murdoch'sNews Corp. is buying two 
publishing houses from Hearst Corp. -- Avon Books and William Morrow 
&AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday, whose financial terms were not  
disclosed, brings two successful publishers under the wing of News 
Corp.'s HarperCollins, which has turned itself around from a dire 
situation two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Friedman, who came as president of HarperCollins in late  
1997, said that some consolidation of the acquired houses was 
inevitable, but she said it was too early to say what form it would 
take. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have all seen this industry shrinking as publishers  
consolidate, and we need two things: economies of scale and market 
share,'' Friedman said in an interview. ``They have a fantastic 
roster of authors that we felt would really complement what we 
have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avon is known for its successul mass-market paperbacks and  
children's books, and will join HaperCollins' stable of children's 
titles including works by the artist Maurice Sendak and the late 
Shel Silverstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Morrow publishes hardcover and trade paperbacks, representing  
authors like Sidney Sheldon, Faye Kellerman, and Cokie Roberts. 
They will join HarperCollins authors such as Barbara Kingsolver, 
Tony Hillerman and Wally Lamb. Morrow will also beef up 
HarperCollins' line of cookbooks with authors like TV cook Emeril 
Lagasse. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Avon and Morrow publish some 1,000 books each year and  
have a combined catalogue of nearly 6,000 titles still in print. 
They had operated together as the book publishing division of 
Hearst, a major privately held media company with interests in 
television, newspapers, radio and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal marked the latest merger in the U.S. publishing  
industry as companies seek to cut costs and gain market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann bought the  
biggest U.S. book publisher, Random House, from Advance 
Publications, for a price estimated by analysts at between $1.1 
billion and $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelsmann also bought Bantam Books in 1977 and owns Doubleday,  
Dell-Delacorte and Broadway Books. Also last year, Viacom Inc. sold 
the educational, professional and reference divisions of Simon &AMP; 
Schuster to the British media group Pearson for $4.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	HarperCollins has been coming back from a devastating period two  
years ago, when it took a $270 million charge against earnings, 
slashed more than 100 book contracts and laid off staff as it 
struggled to cope with a massive backlog of unsold books. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Friedman came on board, the company has bounced back with  
a big upswing in profits and 34 books on the New York Times 
bestseller list last year, including ``The Divine Secrets of the 
Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' by Rebecca Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	In the nine months ending in March, HarperCollins' operating  
profits rose 60 percent on a revenue increase of 9 percent.

<HEADLINE>  U.K. Official: Serbs Killed 10,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Gruesome accounts of almost routine  
torture and death emerged in Kosovo today, and a British official 
estimated that Serb forces killed more than 10,000 people during 
two months of war and ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Serbian civilians frantically followed Serb soldiers retreating  
from the province, and tens of thousands of ethnic Albanians 
streamed back into their homeland from refugee camps in Albania and 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials from Moscow and Washington met in Finland to try to  
resolve the role of Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo. Moscow is 
insisting on a separate sector for its peacekeepers; NATO says that 
won't happen though President Clinton predicted a ``successful 
conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10,000 ethnic Albanians -- and probably many more -- were  
killed by Serbs in more than 100 massacres even while NATO bombed 
Yugoslavia during the 78-day air campaign that ended last week, the 
British foreign office said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tragically, our estimates of the numbers of innocent men,  
women and children killed will almost certainly have to be revised 
upwards,'' Foreign Office Minister Geoff Hoon said in London. 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was hard to believe ``that our fellow human beings  
could be guilty of machine-gunning children, systematic rape of 
young women and girls, digging mass graves and burning bodies to 
try to conceal the evidence of murder. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this all happened in Kosovo,'' Hoon said.  
</P>
<P>
	Survivors of the Serb atrocities that started with a crackdown  
in February 1998 and continued even after NATO airstrikes began 
March 24 flooded into the open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hundreds of starving internally displaced people came down  
from hills near Serbka on 15 June, yesterday, when they spotted 
Western journalists. They were unaware that NATO had entered the 
province until they were informed by the journalists,'' NATO 
spokesman Jamie Shea said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``And on 14 June, a four-truck convoy sent by the World Food  
Program managed to reach 20,000 internally displaced persons hiding 
in the hills west of Pristina near Glogovac, and they were greeted 
by internally displaced persons coming out of the woods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Serbs straggle out of Kosovo and ethnic Albanians rush in,  
allied troops face a tricky dilemma: demilitarizing the Kosovo 
rebels, heroes to many of the refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians, who have historic and cultural ties to the Serbs,  
are pressuring NATO troops to dismantle the rebel army. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's U.N. ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, said NATO forces were  
being too ``complacent'' about the demilitarization. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Marines had some tense moments with rebels Wednesday in  
southeastern Kosovo. NATO had to threaten force, including sending 
in Cobra attack helicopters, before 117 rebels near Vladovo 
surrendered their weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 26,000 refugees have flooded back into Kosovo this week,  
but the security situation remains too precarious for organized 
returns by bus, the U.N. refugee agency said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Land mines that have killed at least two and injured several  
who've strayed off marked areas are among the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In refugee camps in the northern Albanian town of Kukes, UNICEF  
launched a mine awareness campaign, distributing leaflets and 
posters warning of the danger of mines. 
</P>
<P>
	But with up to 17,000 refugees returning to Kosovo every day --  
no one knows exactly since officials have given up counting -- 
Kukes, which now shelters about 80,000 refugees, could be empty in 
a week. Some 860,000 refugees fled Kosovo beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to educate the kids about the danger of the  
mines. They like to run around and play everywhere,'' said Alfonso 
Artico, a UNICEF spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO forces, Albanian policemen and Kosovo rebels struggled to  
control the thousands of refugees lining up today in battered 
trucks and tractors to go home, while international aid agencies 
urged the refugees to wait a few more days. 
</P>
<P>
	German troops were letting Kosovo Liberation Army rebels take  
their weapons with them, and rebel officials were helping them 
determine whether Albanian looters were mixed in with the crossing 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO forces appeared unprepared to deal with the flood of  
desperate people. At one point, a Danish policewoman shouted in 
English at cars and tractors crossing into the lefthand lane: 
``Stay on this side of the road!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Kosovo, Yugoslav soldiers crammed into trucks and  
buses and even hitchhiked to get out. Serb civilians followed, 
convinced the rebels would take revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, a spokesman for the allied force, said  
26,000 of the 40,000 or so Serb troops in Kosovo had left. Under 
the peace accord that ended the NATO campaign, all Serb forces are 
to be out of the province by Sunday night, and allied officials say 
the pullout is proceeding well. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, Russian and U.S. officials met today to hammer out  
the role of Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo. Some 200-300 Russian 
troops took control of Pristina's airport Saturday ahead of NATO 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, new evidence emerged of Serb atrocities.  
</P>
<P>
	Serb police slaughtered 62 ethnic Albanians -- most of them women  
and children from an extended family -- by herding them into a room, 
tossing in a grenade and spraying survivors with machine-gun fire, 
villagers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 17 massacre in Poklek, 20 miles west of Pristina, came  
to light as the first NATO troops moved into the area. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bruznik, central Kosovo, journalists were shown raw earth  
marked with wooden stakes and paper tags numbered one to 60. 
</P>
<P>
	In Berisht, just north of Pristina, residents said a shallow  
grave held the bodies of at least 60 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoon said NATO troops today also discovered an apparent torture  
chamber in the headquarters of the Serb military police in 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-story concrete building contained knives, rubber and  
wooden batons, baseball bats, brass knuckles, and ``savage 
pornography,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists taken to the building said one room, where Kosovo  
Albanian women were allegedly raped, held boxes of condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal will send its first team of  
investigators into Kosovo on Friday.

determine whether Albanian looters were mixed in with the crossing 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO forces appeared unprepared to deal with the flood of  
desperate people. At one point, a Danish policewoman shouted in 
English at cars and tractors crossing into the lefthand lane: 
``Stay on this side of the road!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In northern Kosovo, Yugoslav soldiers crammed into trucks and  
buses and even hitchhiked to get out. Serb civilians followed, 
convinced the rebels would take revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Col. Robin Clifford, a spokesman for the allied force, said  
26,000 of the 40,000 or so Serb troops in Kosovo had left. Under 
the peace accord that ended the NATO campaign, all Serb forces are 
to be out of the province by Sunday night, and allied officials say 
the pullout is proceeding well. 
</P>
<P>
	In Helsinki, Russian and U.S. officials met today to hammer out  
the role of Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo. Some 200-300 Russian 
troops took control of Pristina's airport Saturday ahead of NATO 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, new evidence emerged of Serb atrocities.  
</P>
<P>
	Serb police slaughtered 62 ethnic Albanians -- most of them women  
and children from an extended family -- by herding them into a room, 
tossing in a grenade and spraying survivors with machine-gun fire, 
villagers said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 17 massacre in Poklek, 20 miles west of Pristina, came  
to light as the first NATO troops moved into the area. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bruznik, central Kosovo, journalists were shown raw earth  
marked with wooden stakes and paper tags numbered one to 60. 
</P>
<P>
	In Berisht, just north of Pristina, residents said a shallow  
grave held the bodies of at least 60 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoon said NATO troops today also discovered an apparent torture  
chamber in the headquarters of the Serb military police in 
Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-story concrete building contained knives, rubber and  
wooden batons, baseball bats, brass knuckles, and ``savage 
pornography,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists taken to the building said one room, where Kosovo  
Albanian women were allegedly raped, held boxes of condoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yugoslav war crimes tribunal will send its first team of  
investigators into Kosovo on Friday.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Touts 'Real Compassion' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- One day after Texas Gov. George W. Bush  
and his ``compassionate conservatism'' left New Hampshire, former 
Vice President Dan Quayle came for a look at what he called ``real 
compassion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle visited a privately funded home for mothers battling drug  
addiction. He said the work done there is a good example of the 
compassion conservatives have shown for years. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a shot at Bush, who has made ``compassionate  
conservatism'' the theme of his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conservatives are compassionate,'' Quayle told reporters in  
Concord. ``We care deeply about our friends and neighbors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Quayle did not change his game plan in light of  
Bush's first visit to the state with the earliest presidential 
primaries. However, the timing did help Quayle highlight 
differences he sees between himself and the Texas governor -- namely 
that he considers himself a conservative alternative to Bush, the 
darling of the moderate Republican ``establishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Addressing about 50 state legislators at a luncheon, Quayle said  
he would ``shape up those Republicans in Congress,'' encouraging 
them to cut taxes and ``take on the education bureaucracy.'' It was 
a subtle jab at Bush, who has garnered endorsements from more than 
half of the 222 Republicans in the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Quayle listened as women who had overcome cocaine and  
alcohol addiction recounted their stories to a chorus of ``Amens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle said private, faith-based programs such as the New Life  
Home for Women and Children have long been doing a better, more 
compassionate job than government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Carole Cadieux, 35, who used cocaine intravenously for six years  
before joining New Life, said Quayle's message was right on target. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without God, you can't change,'' Cadieux said. ``I never could  
have done it on my own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing a theme Bush struck in his recent visits to Iowa and New  
Hampshire, Quayle said that while such groups have done fine on 
their own, they should have the option of getting federal money. 
Federal grants would not violate the First Amendment separation of 
church and state, any more than federal loans to students at 
religious colleges, a top aide said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Concord, Quayle picked up an endorsement from state Rep. Fran  
Wendelboe of New Hampton, who resigned from Elizabeth Dole's 
campaign after Dole said she supported some types of gun control. 
Wendelboe said Bush and others recruited her after she split with 
Dole, but she and Quayle saw eye to eye on every issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The endorsement could sway many state representatives to  
Quayle's side, Rep. Phyllis Woods of Dover said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's well-respected,'' Woods said. ``And Quayle has got the  
experience and the right message.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle won applause from legislators at several points,  
especially when he criticized President Clinton's foreign policy. 
He said Clinton has gotten bogged down in Yugoslavia when the real 
foreign policy challenge -- China -- has received little attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can ill afford another president who needs on-the-job  
training when it comes to foreign policy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Parliament Rejects IMF Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's Communist-dominated parliament today  
rejected a pivotal part of a reform bill package that the 
government says is needed to help get crucial foreign loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislature's lower house, the State Duma, voted 219-101 to  
defeat a bill that would have imposed a new tax on gas stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is part of a package of reforms designed to meet  
conditions for a $4.5 billion loan from the International Monetary 
Fund. Moscow needs the money to pay off old debts due this year to 
the IMF and avoid a potentially disastrous default. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Russia's economy crashed last August, the country has  
defaulted on several large foreign debt payments and has been 
unable to secure new loans from international lenders. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the gas station tax said it would be used as an  
excuse to raise gasoline prices, which in turn would touch off 
price increases for other goods. Observers had warned that 
lawmakers wouldn't pass the bill and risk antagonizing voters 
before parliamentary elections set for December. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the rejection comes after representatives of the Duma and  
the Cabinet worked out a compromise version of the bill, stoking 
hopes that lawmakers would approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duma now has until the end of next week to consider a new  
version of the bill before breaking for its summer recess. It 
wasn't clear when the legislature would take up the reworked 
version of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has urged the Duma to approve the reforms before  
going on vacation. But so far, only 2 of the 30 bills have received 
even tentative approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin warned lawmakers that if they  
fail to approve the bills, he might call a confidence vote in his 
new Cabinet. If lawmakers vote no-confidence, then President Boris 
Yeltsin could disband the Duma -- a prospect lawmakers want to 
avoid. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also tried to cajole lawmakers by promising to  
block significant increases in gasoline prices. The Cabinet had 
secured a pledge from Russia's main energy companies Wednesday to 
limit price hikes through the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media immediately suggested that the move signaled a  
return to Soviet-style price controls and economic planning -- 
something that liberals have feared since the onset of economic 
crisis in August. 
</P>
<P>
	But Stepashin told a Cabinet session today that he had no plans  
for setting strict limits on prices and that such an attempt would 
fail anyway, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin also sought to prevent the dispute over the bill from  
developing into a new round of confrontation between the Kremlin 
and its Communist opponents in the Duma. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin told his envoy to the house, Alexander Kotenkov, ``under  
no circumstances to go into confrontation where compromise is 
possible,'' Interfax reported.

<TEXT>
<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- German industrial group Siemens AG and  
Japan's Fujitsu Ltd. plan to combine most of their European 
computer businesses in a move that would create one of Europe's 
largest personal computer vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	The two companies, which have cooperated for six years, signed a  
memorandum of understanding Thursday on the combination and plan to 
develop, manufacture and market a full range of information 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	Siemens said it expects the new venture to generate sales of  
more than $7.4 billion in fiscal 2000. Independent market 
researchers said the new venture would be second only to Compaq 
Computer Corp. in the European market for personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Siemens and Fujitsu will cooperate in PCs,  
server and mainframe computer systems with ambitions of becoming 
one of the world's three leading computer manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest step in an overhaul by Siemens aimed at  
improving earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	A new company called Fujitsu Siemens Computers will start  
operation Oct. 1, pending regulatory approval. Siemens said the 
headquarters may be located in the Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> Trash-Receiving States Seek Limit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regional tensions tugged at a Senate committee  
Thursday as unwilling trash-receiving states asked for permission 
to restrict out-of-state garbage deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	``How would you react if your neighbor began dumping tons of  
trash in your back yard?'' said Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., whose 
state's landfills took in 2.8 million tons of out-of-state waste 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What if he said there was nothing you could do to stop it and  
that he planned to increase the amount he dumped in your yard every 
day, and expected you to pay for it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bayh, who along with Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, is seeking  
congressional authority for states desiring to limit garbage 
imports, said the issue should be dealt with before New York City's 
only garbage dump closes in two years, forcing 5 million tons of 
trash onto trucks or barges bound for other states' landfills. 
</P>
<P>
	Any legislation, though, must pass muster with Environment and  
Public Works Committee Chairman John Chafee, R-R.I., and he was 
clearly unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee said he understood the concerns of garbage importing  
states which ``don't want to become, or perceived as, the dumping 
grounds for New York City's or anybody's trash.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, he added, the waste-disposal industry had a valid argument  
when it points to the monitoring wells, extra layers of liners and 
other environmental improvements installed in the huge megadumps 
built to accept the traveling trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers, in this case solid-waste generators, should have  
the freedom to send their waste to the best, most economically 
efficient facilities available, whether in-state or out-of-state,'' 
said Chafee, whose committee has jurisdiction over both the 
Voinovich-Bayh waste-importing bill and a competing version offered 
by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The differences between the competing bills, however, was not as  
stark as the senators' differing perspectives on interstate garbage 
commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	As the hearing opened, two of the senators made references to  
unrelated state-to-state problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevada Sen. Harry Reid said he agreed that ``if you make a mess  
you should clean it up yourself, not just toss it into your 
neighbor's yard,'' but also said Congress should be consistent when 
the subject is nuclear waste, not kitchen waste. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do not dismiss lightly the similarities between forcing states  
to accept unwanted trash from other states and the desire of many 
in this body to force Nevada to accept waste from America's nuclear 
reactors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A tension of a different sort tinged the comments of Sen. Frank  
Lautenberg, D-N.J., a garbage-exporting state, who noted that New 
Jersey doesn't like taking in the trash that flows eastward in the 
air, and has complicated waste-management problems of its own. 
Eastern states blame coal-burning utilities from the Midwest for 
contributing to their air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in heavy muddle, as they say,'' said Lautenberg.  
</P>
<P>
	Virginia officials, meanwhile, commented on both sides of the  
traveling-trash issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. John Warner, R-Va., and Chuck Robb, D-Va., said their  
state needs the ability to impose reasonable controls, while an 
official from one of that state's poorest counties praised 
out-of-state garbage as a financial savior. 
</P>
<P>
	Floyd H. Miles Sr., chairman of the board of supervisors of  
Charles City County, said his community had few options when it was 
forced to replace its old, unsafe landfill, and every option was 
too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the county decided to build a landfill big enough to  
hold not just its own garbage but trash from elsewhere, as well, 
with the goal of gaining much-needed revenue from a 
state-of-the-art disposal site. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were willing to trade off the handling of other people's  
trash in return for having such a safe facility,'' said Miles. ``We 
did not discriminate at that time between the trash from the city 
of Richmond or northern Virginia and the trash of Newark or New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he said, the county has an environmentally safe landfill,  
new schools, new county offices and lower taxes, thanks to its $40 
million profit on waste accepted since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of Virginia has leaking, antiquated landfills and a  
political debate over ``the quality of New York trash versus 
Richmond trash and what state is number one, two or three in terms 
of handling out-of-state trash,'' Miles complained.

<HEADLINE> Social Security Compromise Sought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With fresh encouragement from Speaker Dennis  
Hastert, Republicans and Democrats on a key House committee agreed 
Thursday with Clinton administration officials to continue 
searching for a compromise Social Security rescue plan. 
</P>
<P>
	After huddling briefly behind closed doors with 25 members of  
the Ways and Means Committee, Hastert emerged to tell reporters 
that the bipartisan session was a signal that Social Security 
reform is still possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've encouraged them to keep at it,'' said Hastert, R-Ill.  
``Starting to work on a bipartisan basis is very important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although no decisions were made, the fact that Republicans and  
Democrats were privately talking compromise together -- even 
inviting Social Security Commissioner Kenneth Apfel to participate 
-- was itself unusual on such a politically charged issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said  
both sides did agree to ``expend every effort'' at achieving reform 
for the retirement program, which faces insolvency by 2034 as the 
big baby boom generation grows older. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the process of determining how we begin to move this  
forward ... with the cooperation of the administration,'' said 
Archer, R-Texas. ``I believe there is goodwill on all sides and a 
genuine desire to solve this problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Archer spoke to reporters standing shoulder-to-shoulder with  
Rep. Charles Rangel, senior Democrat on the Ways and Means 
Committee. Rangel said that Hastert and House Minority Leader Dick 
Gephardt, D-Mo., have asked the committee ``to try to work together 
to come up with a bill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rangel, D-N.Y., said that although there remain major  
differences on the approaches to saving Social Security, ``there 
are no differences in us recognizing we have to come up with 
something that we can sell to the House Republicans and the House 
Democrats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that were successful, Archer added, there would be enough  
political momentum ``that the Senate would be put in a position 
where they would have to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several rank-and-file lawmakers echoed the positive nature of  
Thursday's session, but many cautioned that the panel is not yet 
ready to begin the tough job of hashing out an actual compromise 
bill. Major decisions would have to be made on such things as 
whether proposed retirement accounts would be under government or 
individual control and whether they could fit within the existing 
program's structure. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not yet at the point where we're ready to sit down and  
hammer out differences,'' said Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich. ``We have 
a considerable ways to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Apfel said there appears to be some agreement in broad  
terms between the White House and both parties in Congress: on the 
need for more retirement savings, that projected budget surpluses 
should be used for Social Security and that investment in stocks or 
other equities are needed to boost the rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look very much forward to continuing active three-way  
discussions,'' Apfel said. ``It's an optimistic start.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Higher / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Overnight gains on Wall Street helped push the  
major barometer for Japanese stocks to a 20-month high today. The 
dollar was slightly lower against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 17,470.45  
points, up 260.27, or 1.51 percent from Wednesday -- its highest 
since Oct. 22, 1997, when the Nikkei closed at 17,687.61. On 
Wednesday, the Nikkei had dropped 71.82 points, or 0.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mood has brightened,'' said Hiroichi Nishi, a deputy  
general manager at Nikko Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising share prices boosted sentiments for the yen and sent the  
dollar lower. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.04 yen by late afternoon, down 0.20 yen  
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 120.43 yen overnight. During the day, it ranged from 119.75 yen 
to 120.50 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, Tokyo share prices were sharply higher  
following the overnight rally in U.S. stocks on consumer price data 
indicating that inflation was under control, traders said. That 
means the U.S. Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  
gained 189.96 points, or 1.8 percent, closing at 10,784.95. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many investors are very optimistic, both for the U.S. economy  
and the domestic economy in Japan,'' said Tsuyoshi Nomaguchi, a 
strategist at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange finished up 16.00 points, 
or 1.16 percent, to 1,399.17. The TOPIX ended down 1.90 points, or 
0.14 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section was estimated at 703.85 million  
shares, up from 691.9 million shares Wednesday. Advancing issues 
outnumbered retreaters 733 to 452, while 120 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the U.S. currency was moving  
narrowly on fears of more dollar-buying intervention by the Bank of 
Japan to keep the greenback from falling further against the yen, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Bank of Japan sold yen and bought dollars to halt  
a sharp rise in the Japanese currency which was feared could 
threaten emerging signs of economic recovery here. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 123.90 yen, down from 125.18 yen late  
Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.700 percent from 1.630 percent late Wednesday, 
driving its price down to 97.43 yen from 98.02.

<HEADLINE> Most Poor Kids Have Working Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's child poverty rate is declining  
with the strong economy, while more of the children still poor have 
at least one parent who works but earns too little to lift them out 
of poverty, a university study says. 
</P>
<P>
	The report provides fresh evidence that welfare reform is moving  
many families into jobs that pay very little, researchers said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Welfare reform has done better at moving families off the  
rolls than it has at moving families out of poverty,'' said 
Lawrence Aber, director of Columbia University's Center for 
Children in Poverty that conducted the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the percentage of children under age six who were poor  
fell to 22 percent in 1997, down from 23.2 percent in 1996, 
according to the center's analysis of Census data. 
</P>
<P>
	Since 1993, the rate of young children in poverty has fallen by  
16 percent after rising 52 percent between 1978 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	That isn't good enough for Bill Bradley, a Democratic  
presidential hopeful who happened to be addressing the issue 
Thursday in Los Angeles. Child poverty rates have changed little 
during President Clinton's administration, he said, adding, ``But 
what have they done? They've tinkered around the margins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Children are considered poor if their family's income is below  
the federal poverty line. For a family of four, that meant earning 
less than $16,400 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, there were about 5.2 million poor young children,  
including 2.5 million who were ``extremely poor,'' living below 
half the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to Social Security, poverty rates among seniors have  
fallen, making young children the most likely in America to be 
poor. They tend to be poorer than older children because their 
parents are younger and less established in the job market. Also, a 
parent is more likely to stay home and not work when children are 
young. 
</P>
<P>
	The report found that 65 percent of poor young children had a  
parent who worked at least part-time -- a 20 percent increase since 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	That's partly because welfare changes have pressured parents  
into low-income jobs, researchers said. But it's also because the 
strong economy has more jobs available, meaning parents who might 
not have worked otherwise did, said Martha Zaslow of Child Trends, 
a private research group. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jobs being available is part of the picture,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The report also found:  
</P>
<P>
	--Most poor kids still live in rural or urban areas, but the  
suburban rates have grown over time, and in recent years have 
fallen more slowly than those in urban and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
	--Racial differences are narrowing. The young-child poverty rate  
among blacks and Hispanics is three times as high as for whites but 
in recent years, poverty has fallen more quickly among these 
minority groups than among whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also suggested an increased need for parents to have  
a college degree. Over time, poverty has increased markedly for 
children whose parents' education ends at high school. Researchers 
have known for a long time that children of high school dropouts 
were likely to live in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's increasingly apparent that a college degree is necessary  
for parents to provide a buffer against poverty,'' said Neil 
Bennett, the report's chief author. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was good news, too, the report said. The Earned Income  
Tax Credit, which gives refunds to the working poor, has lifted 
many families out of poverty. Without it, the report said, the 
young-child poverty rate would have been 24 percent higher. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the federal credit, 10 states have their own  
similar programs. And more than a dozen are considering them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't take (high rates) as an excuse to throw up our  
hands in despair and say nothing can be done,'' Bennett said.

<HEADLINE> HaperCollins Buys Hearst Publishers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. is buying the book  
publishing operations of Hearst Corp., consisting of William Morrow 
&AMP; Co. and Avon Books, for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale announced today, which had been rumored for some time,  
further solidifies the position of News Corp.'s HarperCollins, 
which has spent the last two years overcoming a severe profit 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
	HarperCollins president and CEO Jane Friedman, who has received  
kudos for the turnaround, said the acquisition of Morrow and Avon 
will create ``a powerhouse in the industry with a diverse and 
impressive publishing program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Avon and Morrow had operated together as the book publishing  
division of Hearst Corp., a major privately held media company with 
interests in television, newspapers, radio and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Together, Avon and Morrow publish some 1,000 books each year and  
have a combined back catalog of nearly 6,000 titles. Morrow's 
authors include Sidney Sheldon, Beverly Cleary and Cokie Roberts, 
while Avon publishes Faye Kellerman, Johanna Lindsey and Elizabeth 
Lowell. 
</P>
<P>
	Several big publishers have merged in recent years, as companies  
seek to cut costs and gain market share. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG bought  
the biggest U.S. book publisher, Random House, from Advance 
Publications, for a price estimated by analysts at between $1.1 
billion and $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertelsmann also bought Bantam Books in 1977 and owns Doubleday,  
Dell-Delacorte and Broadway Books. Also last year, Viacom Inc. sold 
the educational, professional and reference divisions of Simon &AMP; 
Schuster to the British media group Pearson for $4.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Small Businesses Hit by Phone Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission is alerting small  
businesses to a scam that promises them a free trial Web site but 
delivers unauthorized charges to their phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of small business owners have lost millions of dollars  
in the past two years after responding to a phone call from firms 
offering to design a Web site for them during a free 30-day trial 
period, the FTC said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, business owners were charged for  
the service even though they hadn't agreed to purchase it at the 
end of the trial period or had canceled their order. Many never 
received notice telling them their 30 days were in effect and were 
shocked when charges from the firms appeared on their phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took me a long time to figure out what it was,'' said  
Colleen Cord, owner of Security Mortgage and Investment Corporation 
in Bowie, Md., who received a phone bill with charges from a Web 
site provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Cord said one of her employees was called about a promotion for  
setting up a Web site and agreed to the free trial period but later 
canceled. Weeks later, Cord saw the charges on her phone bill for 
the service. When she pressed the firm for evidence that it had in 
fact created a Web site for her business, she got no response. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission says this is just the latest variation of firms  
fraudulently ``cramming'' unauthorized charges onto phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	In its third annual report to Congress on fraud, released  
Thursday, the FTC says cramming has become the fifth largest source 
of consumer complaints in the last 18 months. Since October 1997, 
the FTC has received 10,000 complaints about cramming. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission warns that telephone billing has become open to  
abuse, since a number of service providers can now put their 
charges on the phone statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC also warned small businesses to review all phone bills  
carefully as soon as they arrive, document all purchases and buy 
services from companies they have worked with before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only a few years ago, most consumers would not have considered  
the possibility that they might be charged for anything beyond the 
transmission of telephone calls on their telephone bills,'' the 
report said. ``Now, the injury caused by cramming has been a rude 
wake-up call for consumers, and may undermine confidence in the 
integrity of the billing system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the old days, when local phone companies produced their  
own bills that also covered long- distance company charges, phone 
companies today often hire outside firms to prepare the bills. Then 
other firms -- usually in some way related to phone service, such as 
Internet use -- contract with the bill preparers to include their 
charges on the phone bills. Some phone companies have been taking 
steps to limit the inclusion of these other charges on their bills. 
</P>
<P>
	In three cases announced Thursday, the FTC said con artists  
preyed on small businesses to sneak illegitimate charges onto their 
phone bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``These operations rely on the fact that small businesses, in  
particular, may not have the rigorous ordering, accounting and 
bookkeeping procedures that larger businesses have put in place,'' 
said Jodie Bernstein, director of the commission's bureau of 
consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission has filed cases against Wazzu Corporation, based  
in Fountain Valley, Calif., in U.S. District Court in Southern 
California; WebViper (doing business as Yellow Web Services), based 
in Montgomery, Ala., in U.S. District Court in Montgomery; and 
Shared Network Services, (doing business as 1st Page), based in 
Lodi, Calif., in U.S. District Court in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Waldfogel, chief operating officer of Wazzu, said he was  
pleased the commission was looking into unscrupulous Internet 
businesses, but defended his company's practices as meticulous with 
careful quality control measures in place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that an objective look at our own practices will show  
that we serve as an excellent model for what all of us in the 
industry should be doing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Westbrook, president of Shared Network Services, said 1st  
Page has a third-party verification system in place to make sure 
customers understand all the terms of the deal. In cases where 
people do receive unauthorized charges, the company immediately 
credits them, Westbrook said. But he stressed that ``this is not a 
standard occurrence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No one could be reached at WebViper.

<HEADLINE> 7 Schools Join ECAC Lacrosse League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- With the NCAA ready to give conference  
champions automatic invitations to its national lacrosse 
tournament, seven East Coast schools have formed a Division I men's 
league that will begin play next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown, Maryland-Baltimore County, Massachusetts, Navy, Penn  
State, Stony Brook and Rutgers will play in ECAC Lacrosse. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams will play each other once in the regular season to  
determine a champion. A postseason tournament will not be held. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you are going to form a conference you might as well go for  
the top,'' Rutgers coach Tom Hayes said in a telephone interview. 
``This is going to be a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The schools, which belong to other conferences in other sports,  
have occasionally played each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stony Brook has to be considered the new kid on the block, but  
it's going to be a very competitive league,'' Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgetown, Navy and Maryland-Baltimore County were in the NCAA  
tournament this season, with Georgetown advancing to the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in a new league will force Rutgers to change some  
opponents on its schedule, Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still going to play Syracuse, Army, Princeton and Yale,  
teams we've been playing the last 60 or 70 years,'' Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result will be a more difficult schedule for a team that was  
4-10 this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're used to a tough schedule,'' Hayes said. ``We think this  
will be great for our program and great for our fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The catalyst for the formation of the league was the decision by  
the NCAA men's lacrosse committee to implement automatic 
qualification for conference champions effective with the 
championship in 2000, the ECAC said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It took about a year to form ECAC Lacrosse, Hayes said.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole: I Want To Win Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Republican White House hopeful Elizabeth  
Dole insists she is running for president, not vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am in it to win,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	She has formed a presidential exploratory committee but has not  
formally announced her intention to seek the White House, as the 
GOP front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, did last weekend and 
Vice President Al Gore did Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me set the record straight: you do not go through this  
process, which is a rigorous one, to be vice president,'' she told 
reporters before a speech here Wednesday, trying to kill 
speculation that she really is seeking the second spot on the GOP 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you enter the process, which I have, you do it to win.''  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole never stopped smiling as she described the trials of  
the campaign trail for an audience of about 300 Rotary Club 
members. At the same time, she offered a rationale for running. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am on the road right now for nine days, if you can imagine --  
one little suitcase and one little ... bag,'' she said. ``You can't 
check your luggage because you'd never get there on time for your 
appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a rigorous process, but I love it, because it gives me a  
chance to share views and share my passion on a lot of things and 
hear from you,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Los Angeles Times Poll released Wednesday showed Mrs. Dole  
trailing Bush 50 percent to 13 percent among California voters, but 
she dismissed all such surveys as meaningless. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't be distracted by polls. It is early. Only five percent  
of people are even thinking about the year 2000 right now,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole offered a litany of promises relating to the high-tech  
industry. She said she would press for a permanent federal research 
and development tax credit, something the Silicon Valley industry 
has long sought. 
</P>
<P>
	She backed legislation passed by the U.S. Senate on Tuesday that  
would curb Y2K-related lawsuits, and warned that the ``Clinton-Gore 
administration'' has threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	And she called for increasing the cap on the number of highly  
skilled workers allowed into the country under so-called H-1B 
visas, something companies here have asked the federal government 
for. 
</P>
<P>
	Her pitch was tailored to computer industry employees, and she  
was the latest in a growing list of presidential candidates making 
pilgrimages to Silicon Valley. Republican Sen. John McCain, her 
rival for the nomination, will tour a nearby computer company on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There were few high-tech workers in Mrs. Dole's audience,  
however, because the Rotary Club limits how many members from one 
industry can join, said Dan Orloff, a club spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Aussie McDonald's Burgers Withdrawn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A McDonald's subsidiary has decided to  
stop selling grilled chicken burgers at hundreds of restaurants in 
Australia after a consumer group challenged the way they were being 
cooked. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's Australia Ltd. said Thursday it would stop  
advertising the burgers as ``grilled'' after the Australian 
Competition and Consumer Commission found that grilling was not 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also said it would withdraw the burger from the  
menus of its more than 640 fast-food restaurants when stocks run 
out. But it said that had nothing to do with the complaint but with 
weak sales. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to complaints from consumers, the government-funded  
commission examined the cooking process and found that consumers 
were being misled, possibly illegally. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission said that the chicken patties were being  
precooked in steam ovens. The brown marks suggesting the meat was 
seared by a grill were applied by a machine called a ``heat and 
control rotary brander.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The patties were then frozen and transported to restaurants,  
where they were thawed and cooked in a two-sided hot plate before 
being served. 
</P>
<P>
	Professor Allan Fels, the commission chairman, said extensive  
advertising of the burger by McDonald's as grilled constituted 
misleading or deceptive conduct in a breach of Australia's Trade 
Practice's Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their claims (must) match reality,'' Fels said.  
</P>
<P>
	John Blyth, a McDonald's Australia spokesman, said he understood  
the cooking process and was ``content to describe it as grilling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, the company has given the commission  
``court-enforceable undertakings'' to drop the word grilled from 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Blyth said the decision to discontinue sale of the patties was  
``based on the level of sales ... and had nothing to do with the 
ACCC's inquiry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission is responsible for enforcing legislation that  
guards against anti-competitive and unfair market practices. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's Australia is a subsidiary of McDonald's Corp., based  
in Oak Brook, Ill.

<HEADLINE> IOC's 2006 Vote To Be Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A Santa Claus roams the hotel  
corridors lobbying for votes, a fitting symbol of virtue for an 
Olympic movement trying to recover its ideals. 
</P>
<P>
	As the International Olympic Committee prepares to choose the  
host city for the 2006 Winter Games, the process has become as 
important as the result. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday's vote is the first site-selection since the Salt Lake  
City vote-buying scandal broke six months ago, plunging the IOC 
into the worst crisis of its 105-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the IOC voted on a Winter Olympic site, in 1995,  
Salt Lake City won the 2002 games in a landslide. As it turned out, 
the victory was aided by more than $1 million in inducements to IOC 
members, 10 of whom have resigned or been expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, six European cities are vying to be the winter stage  
in 2006: Helsinki, Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, 
Slovakia; Turin, Italy; Sion, Switzerland; and Zakopane, Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Their bids, however, have been overshadowed by the scandal, with  
only a slight buzz of suspense building the last few days. 
</P>
<P>
	Sion has been the front-runner from the start and remains the  
favorite, ahead of Turin, Helsinki (and its Santa Claus mascot) and 
Klagenfurt. Slovakia and Poland aren't given much of a chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidding rules were changed halfway through the race to eliminate  
any hint of corruption. The most significant: IOC members were 
banned from visiting the cities. Virtually all contact was 
forbidden, cutting out the wining and dining and gift-giving that 
tainted the process in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	The selection procedure has been slightly modified. On Saturday  
morning, a 15-member panel will whittle the field to two finalists. 
Then the full general assembly -- 89 members in this case -- will 
choose the winner by secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must not have any question marks at all about the 2006  
selection,'' British IOC member Craig Reedie said. ``It's always 
been very important that the process is seen to be as fireproof as 
you can possibly get it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not everybody is happy with the process.  
</P>
<P>
	Bidders say they were penalized by not being able to show off  
their cities to the IOC delegates. They resorted, instead, to 
mailing brochures and video cassettes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The IOC told us in January, `You are victims and have to make  
the sacrifice,' '' said Turin bid leader Evelina Cristillin. ``It's 
been very frustrating, but you do the best you can in the 
circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Italians have complained that the ban on site visits gives  
an unfair advantage to Sion, which hosted more than 60 IOC members 
during an unsuccessful attempt to land the 2002 games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Swiss say they, too, were hurt by the new rules because  
they couldn't show members the vast improvements made since the 
previous bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The closest view many members will get will come Friday when the  
bidders make one-hour presentations to the IOC assembly. 
</P>
<P>
	But Saturday's vote could be more heavily influenced by a  
written report issued in January by a special IOC inspection panel 
that evaluated the merits of each bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Many IOC members believe the system is flawed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now we have to rely on a book,'' Russia's Vitaly Smirnov said.  
``You have to see and feel the spirit of the city. Can you fall in 
love with a woman just reading about her? No, it's not possible. 
It's the same without seeing the bid cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marc Hodler, the Swiss member who blew the whistle on Olympic  
corruption in December, disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is it worth to see a ski course somewhere from a  
helicopter?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hodler himself could be a factor in the result.  
</P>
<P>
	There has been widespread speculation that some IOC members  
might vote against Sion, and presumably for Turin, to punish Hodler 
for escalating the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is possible,'' Hodler said. ``But I have many (members)  
testifying that they appreciate what I have done. They have sent me 
many letters. They don't like to be in a club that has a bad 
reputation. I hope this vote can restore some dignity to the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many believe the race will come down to a contest between a  
small Alpine town (Sion, 26,000) and a large industrial city 
(Turin, 2.2 million). 
</P>
<P>
	The Swiss have looked confident all week, but the Italians have  
been working the lobby hardest. Then there's Helsinki, which could 
also be a finalist. 
</P>
<P>
	That would suit Sion, which would rather face Helsinki than  
Turin in the final, considering Italy's strong influence in the 
IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	But nothing is ever certain in IOC voting.  
</P>
<P>
	Look back to 1988. In the same hotel in Seoul where the IOC is  
meeting this week, a little-known Norwegian village -- Lillehammer -- 
came out of nowhere to win the right to stage the 1994 Winter 
Games.

<HEADLINE> Video Health Care Aids Rural Clinics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Suppose sickness strikes, and it's too far  
to reach the hospital. Now there's video medical care for such 
crises. 
</P>
<P>
	New high-tech equipment at University of South Alabama hospitals  
will allow a live image of a patient at a rural clinic to be 
projected into the hospital 100 miles away or more. 
</P>
<P>
	The university's ``Telemedicine'' program, unveiled Tuesday,  
will begin operating July 1. It will be the first of its kind in 
the state, said USA President Gordon Moulton. 
</P>
<P>
	USA-based specialists will be able to offer medical testing,  
diagnoses and drug prescriptions to rural patients using high-speed 
telecommunications lines, video-conferencing and the latest medical 
equipment, such as a tiny ear scope that can send a live image of 
an eardrum for a specialist to view. 
</P>
<P>
	Often, residents living in rural areas do without much-needed  
specialty care because of transportation problems, Moulton said.

	``The best medical treatment in the world is useless if the  
people who need it can't get to it,'' he said. ``This combination 
... is a real boost for area health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also suggested its use in state prisons. Moulton said  
university officials will be talking with the state about the 
possibility of saving money by using the video system to treat 
inmates at correctional centers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new service, four ``health stations'' will be set up  
so specialists can reach patients in outlying areas: Mostellar 
Medical Centers in McIntosh and Bayou La Batre; and the Mobile 
County Health Department clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Future remote sites also are being proposed for Baldwin, Clarke,  
Conecuh, Monroe, Montgomery and Wilcox counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The stations will link up with USA Medical Center, USA  
Children's and Women's Hospital, USA Knollwood Park Hospital, the 
pediatric and adult clinics on Springhill Avenue and the USA Health 
Services building. 
</P>
<P>
	Units at each of the four health stations will include two  
cameras and examination equipment to give the consulting physician 
the opportunity to conduct a thorough examination. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the four stations will have access to all services  
offered by the USA Health Network, including dermatology, 
cardiology, gastroenterology, neurology, OB/GYN, pediatrics, 
surgery and trauma services. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping finance the program is a $2.7 million federal grant from  
the U.S. Department of Health's Office for the Advancement of 
Telehealth.

	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Alabama shortstop Andy Phillips thought he  
knew everything about ``The Andy Griffith Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he was grilled by Arizona Diamondbacks manager Buck  
Showalter. They chatted on a cellular phone as the Crimson Tide 
warmed up to play Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing he asked me was how many episodes they made,''  
Phillips said. ``I guessed 150. He told me there were 230-something 
episodes and he's got every one of them cataloged on video.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The impromptu quiz started when ESPN analyst Harold Reynolds, a  
former major-leaguer, noticed in the Alabama media guide that 
Phillips considers himself a fan of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	And that made Reynolds think of Showalter, whose knowledge of  
Mayberry is storied in baseball circles. Reynolds dialed 
Showalter's home in Phoenix and handed the phone to Phillips behind 
the batting cage. 
</P>
<P>
	After a few minutes, Phillips was humbled.  
</P>
<P>
	``He told me all kinds of things, like Floyd the barber got  
polio and they never let him walk again after the 110th episode,'' 
Phillips said. ``I usually watch every day but now I know I'm 
definitely not as big a fan as I thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts as his Southeastern  
Conference-record 36-game hitting streak ended in Alabama's loss. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SPECIAL VISITOR:* Former Southern California coach Rod Dedeaux  
was honored in a ceremony behind home plate just before the first 
pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the celebration surrounding Omaha's 50th year of  
playing host to the College World Series, Mayor Hal Daub gave 
Dedeaux a key to the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Dedeaux led the Trojans to 10 of USC's 12 championships, more  
than any other school. His 60-16 record (78 percent) is the best 
among coaches who appeared in at least 20 games at Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ceremony, Dedeaux received a one-minute standing  
ovation. He watched both games from a front-row seat near the 
visitor's dugout. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LUCKY DOG:* The Hurricanes sure have a funny-looking good luck  
charm. 
</P>
<P>
	Left-hander Eduardo Perez had been driving around Coral Gables,  
Fla., for several months with a small stuffed Chihuahua dog that he 
bought at a convenience store. Its head is mounted on a spring. 
</P>
<P>
	When the postseason began, he shared it with his teammates.  
</P>
<P>
	``I always had good luck when it was in my car,'' Perez said.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the responsibility of right-hander Darryl Roque to bring  
the dog into the dugout and remove it after the game. When Miami 
needs a hit, Perez makes the dog's head bounce on its spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shakes out his good luck and gets us some runs when we need  
a little help,'' Perez said. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems to be working for the Hurricanes, who are unbeaten in  
eight postseason games and will play for the national title 
Saturday. Roque even brought it to the postgame interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Roque was asked if it really works.  
</P>
<P>
	``Do you want to ask him?'' Roque said, bouncing the head with  
his finger. 
</P>
<P>
	It nodded yes.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ON SECOND THOUGHT:* Umpire Bill Davis changed his call on a  
close play in the second inning of the early game, when Alabama's 
Brent Boyd appeared to be out on a headfirst slide into first base. 
</P>
<P>
	It happened with a runner at second, one out and the score tied  
1-1. Boyd grounded to shortstop Bobby Hill, who threw to first. 
Kevin Brown stretched and bobbled the catch as Boyd arrived in a 
dust cloud. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis paused, then called Boyd out. The Crimson Tide players  
rushed from the third-base dugout, stopping after a few feet while 
coach Jim Wells kept running over from the third-base box to argue. 
</P>
<P>
	After a brief talk, Davis walked down the baseline to consult  
with home plate umpire Ken Couch. Davis then turned around and gave 
the safe sign, bringing cheers from the Alabama bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami coach Jim Morris came out of his dugout to argue.  
</P>
<P>
	Kelley Gulledge took third on the play and scored to give  
Alabama a 2-1 lead when the next batter, Darren Wood, sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
	Replays showed Brown dropped the ball as Boyd arrived. Hill  
eventually was charged with a throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT-SO-CLOSE CALL:* After Antonio Bostic made the last out on a  
force at second, he threw his helmet across the infield as Miami 
players celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortstop Bobby Hill fielded a grounder from Derek Wigginton and  
stepped on the bag to force Bostic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was close, but not that close,'' Hill said. ``I was there  
in plenty of time.''

<HEADLINE>  Greene Sets 100M Record of 9.79 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Maurice Greene made a quick decision to  
enter the 100-meter invitational race. He then ran the fastest time 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene shattered the 3-year-old world record Wednesday, running  
away from an elite field for a clocking of 9.79 seconds. He has 
ambitions to run even faster. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene came to Athens planning only to run the 200 meters. When  
he saw the caliber of competition in the 100 -- including training 
partner Ato Boldon of Trinidad &AMP; Tobago -- he asked for a place in 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `They can't have a party without me,''' Greene said.  
``I knew something was going to happen with this race. I wanted to 
be part of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greene calls Athens' Olympic Stadium a ``special place.'' In  
1997, he won the 100-meter world championship gold medal in the 
venue that will be the site of the 2004 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, on a sultry and near windless evening just before  
sundown, he again blasted away from the pack and smashed the 
previous record of 9.84 set by Donovan Bailey of Canada at the 1996 
Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I expected it,'' Greene said. ``I wanted to win it here ...  
This is only the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd gave the 24-year-old Greene a standing ovation as he  
hugged some other athletes and waved the banner of his track club 
HSI, which stands for Handling Speed Intelligently. He looked for 
an American flag, but there were none handy. 
</P>
<P>
	He wanted to tell his mother the news by phone, but she wasn't  
home. He simply left a message: ``I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even as he basked in the record, he was looking ahead. ``I can  
do better,'' he said, setting his next goal at 9.76. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a start, but not a finish,'' Greene, the world's  
top-ranked sprinter last year, said. ``It was a good race, but not 
a great race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The .05-second difference between Bailey's mark and Greene's is  
the biggest drop the record has taken since the first officially 
accepted electronic record of 9.95 by Jim Hines at the 1968 
Olympics in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
	The last American to own the record was Leroy Burrell, who ran  
9.85 in 1994 at Lausanne, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, who trains with Greene under coach John Smith, was awed  
by his friend's performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's very significant we came to the birthplace of  
track and field to break this record,'' said Boldon, who placed 
second in the special race at 9.86. Bruny Surin of Canada was third 
at 9.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon won the regular 100-meter race at 9.97.  
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month in Milan, Italy, Greene won the 100 at 10.16  
and insisted he was only concerned about the competition and not 
the clock. ``I am not obsessed with the world record,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 90 minutes after setting the record, Greene finished  
second in the 200 at 20.03, behind Boldon's winning time of 19.86. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1,500 meters, Noah Ngeny led a Kenyan sweep of the first  
three places in 3 minutes, 31.32 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Morocco's Nezha Bidouane won the women's 400 hurdles at 53.54,  
more than a second ahead of world record-holder Kim Batten, who 
finished at 54.73. Batten set the world mark of 52.61 in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Soar / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices soared Thursday, pushing the yield  
on the 30-year Treasury bond back below 6 percent, as comments by 
Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan were interpreted to mean 
the central bank would only slightly increase interest rates at its 
meeting later this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 9/32  
point, or $12.81 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.96 percent from 6.06 percent 
late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress,  
Greenspan said that when possible, Fed policy-makers should be 
``pre-emptive'' in fighting inflation. With the market 
well-prepared for a tightening, many felt Greenspan's comments 
indicated that the Fed can and will raise rates at the upcoming 
meeting beginning June 29. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the same time, Greenspan hinted that rate hikes could be  
limited, easing market concerns that policy-makers would initiate a 
series of rate increases, reversing all three rate cuts made last 
year. ``Modest pre-emptive actions can obviate the need of more 
drastic actions at a later date,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's comments came a day after the Labor Department  
reported that May consumer prices, excluding the volatile energy 
and food categories, rose a modest 0.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The markets had been anxiously awaiting the report as a  
barometer of inflation after a surge in April helped prompt the 
Federal Reserve to warn last month that it might boost interest 
rates to slow the economy's growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader bond market, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were up 1/8 point, and intermediate maturities were up 
between 3/16 point and 11/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.63 percent as the  
discount fell 0.02 percentage point to 4.51 percent. Six-month 
yields were 4.94 percent, as the discount fell 0.06 percentage 
point to 4.75 percent. One-year yields were 4.92 percent as the 
discount fell by 0.04 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.69 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.75 percent from 4.69 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose to 120 5/32 from 119 5/16. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.46 percent from 5.50 percent late 
Wednesday.

	US, France Agree on Serb Aid Terms

	PARIS (AP) -- President Clinton today advocated a  
``wait-and-see'' approach on seizing Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic to stand trial for atrocities in Kosovo, saying NATO's 
first priority is to get the refugees home. The president spoke to 
reporters outside the Elysee Palace, where he and French President 
Jacques Chirac met today and agreed anew that Milosevic must be 
unseated before any international development aid goes to 
rebuilding Serbia from 78 days of NATO airstrikes.

	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- Agreemeent on a Russian role in the  
NATO-led Kosovo peacekeeping operation appeared within reach today. 
U.S. and Russian officials were back at the negotiating table to 
discuss whether Russian peacekeepers would patrol a separate sector 
of Kosovo. The United States and NATO oppose the idea, fearing that 
it would lead to a partitioning of Kosovo and undermine efforts to 
stabilize the province. Asked whether he foresaw a final deal 
today, Defense Secretary William Cohen replied, ``We hope so, but 
there are issues that remain to be resolved.'' In Paris, President 
Clinton predicted a ``successful conclusion'' to the talks.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Announce Service Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prodded by Congress and the Clinton  
administration, the airlines industry on Thursday announced a 
package of voluntary measures to address growing complaints from 
consumers about poor service. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures, detailed at a Capitol Hill news conference, will  
stave off, for the moment, congressional passage of stronger 
consumer protection legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, said Gerald Greenwald, chairman and CEO of United  
Airlines and chairman of the Air Transport Association Executive 
Committee, was deeply troubled by the ``perception, maybe even a 
groundswell,'' that the airlines don't care about customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard the bell ring, we have felt the whip,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, Amtrak revealed its plan to win back the  
hearts of disgruntled rail passengers. It includes training and 
incentives for all 24,000 employees, enhanced food-service options 
and improved onboard amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is also guaranteeing refund vouchers for future travel to  
any dissatisfied passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Several key congressional players, including Senate Commerce  
Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sens. Slade Gorton, 
R-Wash., and John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., gave qualified 
endorsements to the airlines' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But others, including Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who co-sponsored a  
passenger bill of rights bill with McCain, said it fell short. 
``This voluntary program consists mostly of stuff they are already 
required to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., author of a House bill, said he  
would continue to seek mandatory measures. ``The flying public has 
seen these promises made and then broken time and time again and 
won't be fooled by the latest blast of hot air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Department Secretary Rodney Slater, in a  
statement, said the steps, while short of what the administration 
sought in a plan outlined last fall, were welcomed, ``but real 
performance will be closely monitored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the department was formally acting Thursday to double to  
$2,500 the minimum liability on lost, damaged or delayed baggage. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures in the airlines' plan include ensuring that each  
airline will inform customers of the lowest fare available, 
notifying customers of known delays, supporting an increase in the 
baggage liability limit, allowing reservations to be held without 
payment for 24 hours, providing prompt refunds, accommodating 
disabled passengers and meeting customer needs during long 
on-aircraft delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure to take such steps came after much publicized incidents  
during a storm last winter when passengers were forced to sit seven 
or more hours on runways without food and other services. Congress 
held several hearings in which passengers related horror stories 
about their experiences with air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Transport Association President Carol Hallett said the  
picture of uncaring airlines was not accurate, but ``we all need 
and want to do a better job'' and ``when Congress gets our 
attention that's when we really do react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The package was the result of several months of negotiations  
involving the administration, Congress and the industry. It was 
scheduled to be announced last week, but a news conference was 
called off at the last minute because of unresolved issues. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said that still unsettled was his demand that airlines  
notify passengers when a plane is overbooked. He said he would also 
seek legislation requiring the Transportation Department inspector 
general to periodically check to see that the industry was 
complying with the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said he was involved in negotiations going late Wednesday  
night, which he said ended with the industry still balking on the 
overbooking issue, on making public all the fares on a flight and 
on issues of redeeming frequent flyer miles. ``This was the airline 
industry asking the passengers to accept a wink and a nod,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Ruden of the American Society of Travel Agents said he was  
concerned that the industry, by promising to give the lowest 
available fare over each airline's telephone reservation system, 
was trying to induce customers to deal directly with them rather 
than through travel agents, which now handle 80 percent of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Hudson of the Aviation Consumer Action Projection, a group  
founded by Ralph Nader, said the industry was mainly agreeing to 
obey existing laws ``and in return the Senate is ready to kill 
their already weak passenger rights legislation.''

<HEADLINE> Carter Criticizes Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Carter says the United  
States' approach to solving conflicts in other nations run by 
dictators too often hurts the people who live under their 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	In an address to a group of international fellows Thursday,  
Carter lamented what he called dwindling U.S. support for foreign 
aid to assist people in developing nations. Instead, the United 
States has ended up punishing those people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has become unpopular in our country to talk about even  
humanitarian aid, and we concentrate maybe too much on resolving 
conflicts by imposing punishment on people of a nation who already 
are suffering under an oppressive dictator,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited Cuba as an example, saying U.S. trade sanctions have  
hurt the people of the island, but have made a hero out of Fidel 
Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have not contributed to democratization or freedom,''  
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter added that even when the United States does appropriate  
foreign aid, it often ends up in the wrong hands, rather than being 
directed toward building houses or improving schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of our foreign aid goes to people who would buy weapons  
from our gun manufacturers,'' Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The former president did not discuss recent events in Kosovo at  
great length. He did note that while the United States spends 
billions of dollars on missiles in Kosovo and other hot spots in 
the former Yugoslavia, it has ignored crises throughout the 
continent of Africa that have resulted in a far greater number of 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	``The superpowers of the world should be the ones with our great  
wealth to use our enormous economic and military and political 
influence for the alleviation of suffering in the third world,'' 
Carter said.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Go Home Facing Elimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- If the Buffalo Sabres are going to win the Stanley  
Cup, they're going to have to do it the hard way. 
</P>
<P>
	A 2-0 loss to the Dallas Stars Thursday night put the Sabres on  
the brink of elimination for the first time this postseason. 
Buffalo trails 3-2 in the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Only three of 15 teams which have lost Game 5 of a tied finals  
have rebounded to win the championship, none since the 1971 
Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Sabres to do it, the seventh-seeded team from the East  
must win two straight, beginning with Game 6 Saturday night in 
Buffalo. The Sabres are 8-1 at Marine Midland Arena in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo had chances early as Dallas committed many of the same  
mistakes it made in the Sabres' 2-1 victory in Game 4. But the 
Sabres rarely challenged Stars goaltender Ed Belfour -- and when 
they did, he was sharp. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay McKee and Geoff Sanderson each got good looks as they were  
flying across open ice, but Belfour saw the shots all the way and 
caught both. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo create traffic in front of Belfour with about six  
minutes left, but didn't have a player in the right place at the 
right time. 
</P>
<P>
	One shot deflected just wide of the post, and Belfour went  
behind the net to make a save when the puck came off the boards. 
Shortly thereafter, he let a rebound squirt into the zone but he 
dove on it before any Sabres arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek kept his team within a goal for  
more than 55 minutes until getting faked out of position on a 
2-on-1 and allowing a goal by Pat Verbeek. It gave Dallas a 
two-goal lead for only the second time this series, the only other 
being the final 26 seconds of Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres trailed 1-0 early in the second period on a  
power-play goal by the Stars. Buffalo had overcome a similar 
deficit in Game 1 when Dallas tried playing keep-away to protect 
its lead. The Stars didn't make that mistake this time and the 
Sabres weren't able to slow their aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo had just two power plays in the game, one in each of the  
first two periods. The Sabres didn't get off a shot on the second. 
</P>
<P>
	This is only the third time Buffalo has trailed a series in the  
playoffs. The Sabres were down 1-0 to Boston in the second round 
and were in a 2-1 hole against the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Buffalo had not been shut out this postseason. The Sabres are  
8-2 in one-goal games, with the losses coming to the Stars in Games 
3 and 5.

<HEADLINE> Tests: SUV Bumpers Crumple Easily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Sport utility vehicles may look like the Rambos  
of the road, but their bumpers are dainty when it comes to a crash, 
a new study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety recently tested six  
1999 model midsize sport utility vehicles. Four of the six racked 
up a repair bill of more than $5,000 after hitting an obstacle four 
ways at 5 miles per hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is very different from the rugged image utility vehicle  
manufacturers are selling,'' said Adrian Lund, the institute's 
senior vice president. ``Instead of rugged, a more appropriate 
description for the bumpers on these vehicles is flimsy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for one automaker, however, said the bumper tests  
don't show how safe an SUV is to drive. Those high-speed crash 
tests are due out in several weeks, said Sheila Gruber McLean, 
spokeswoman for DaimlerChrysler AG at the company's U.S. 
headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The institute previously tested 1996 models of the Jeep Grand  
Cherokee and Land Rover Discovery. Both got poor scores. The 1999 
models tested had been largely redesigned and had a slightly better 
performance than the 1996 models, the institute said. But they 
still racked up more than $5,000 in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the six models tested, the Mercedes ML 320 scored the best,  
with $2,918 in total repairs needed from the four tests. The Lexus 
RX 300 racked up $3,293 in repairs; the Jeep Grand Cherokee, 
$5,107; the Dodge Durango, $5,153; the Land Rover Discovery, 
$5,226; and the Mitsubishi Montero Sport, $6,282. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Land Rover said it is satisfied with the  
Discovery's performance, especially since repair costs on the 1999 
Discovery were nearly $2,000 lower than repairs costs on the 1996 
Discovery. 
</P>
<P>
	In its tests, the institute drove the SUVs four ways: forward  
and backward into a flat barrier, forward into an angled barrier 
and backward into a pole. During the pole test, the Dodge Durango's 
tailgate opened during impact. The company redesigned the bumper, 
which stood up better in the second test. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean said the low-speed tests don't address whether the  
Durango and Grand Cherokee are safe in high-speed crashes, which 
she contends they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``The important thing for customers to remember is this (bumper  
test) is not a safety issue,'' she said. ``We're confident that in 
real-world experience, our vehicles provide adequate protection to 
occupants and drivers, which is the most important thing for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kyle Bazemore, spokesman for Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America  
in Cypress, Calif., said the automaker is working on reducing the 
cost of repairs, but stands by the Montero Sport's overall safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each vehicle that our company sells in the United States meets  
or exceeds federal safety standards,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``While our engineering emphasis is on the overall protection of  
the occupants in our vehicles, we recognize that there is room for 
improvement in reducing the cost of repair. ... We've provided the 
(test) results to the appropriate engineers so the performance of 
our products can be improved in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason sport utility vehicles had such high repair costs is  
that they aren't subject to any government requirements to prevent 
damage in low-speed impacts, the institute said. Car bumpers have 
to meet federal standards for 2.5-mph impacts, and most have 
energy-assorbing foam to cushion the crash. Some of the SUVs do 
not. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, SUV bumpers tend to cost more than car bumpers. The front  
bumper on the Land Rover Discovery is a one-piece system that must 
be completely replaced at a cost of $600, even if the crash damaged 
only one side, the institute said. 
</P>
<P>
	McLean said the institute did not take into account that SUVs  
are designed to be driven off-road, which cars are not. That 
demands a different bumper, she said.

<HEADLINE> Court Authority Over Assets Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal judges generally cannot protect  
plaintiffs in lawsuits by barring defendants from spending or 
giving away their assets, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 5-4 decision, the justices said a New York federal judge  
could not bar a consortium of Mexican companies from transferring 
assets while they were being sued by U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, creditors must first win judgment in a case,  
Justice Antonin Scalia wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Allowing them to get a court order beforehand ``could radically  
alter the balance between debtor's and creditor's rights,'' Scalia 
said, and ``might induce creditors to engage in a race to the 
courthouse ... which might prove financially fatal to the 
struggling debtor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Any such change in judges' authority should be made by Congress,  
not the courts, Scalia said. His opinion was joined by Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, 
Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter  
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the four, Ginsburg said such orders may not have  
been needed in a long-ago ``age of slow-moving capital and 
comparatively immobile wealth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But now that assets can be transferred almost instantly, courts  
should be allowed to keep defendants from ``making themselves 
judgment-proof'' by transferring assets during a lawsuit, she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal appeals court had upheld the New York federal judge's  
order issued against Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo. 
</P>
<P>
	The consortium participated from 1990 to 1994 in the Mexican  
government's program to develop an intercity highway network. When 
road toll revenue fell below expected levels, Grupo Mexicano sought 
to raise money by selling notes, including $75 million to 11 U.S. 
investment funds. 
</P>
<P>
	The consortium defaulted on an interest payment on the notes in  
1997, and the Mexican government promised to provide about $309 
million in notes. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. investors sued in federal court in New York. The  
investors told the judge the consortium already had assigned some 
of the $309 million to other creditors in Mexico and that if it 
continued to do so, the U.S. investors might not be able to collect 
any judgment they won. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge issued a preliminary order barring Grupo Mexicano from  
transferring or assigning its right to the Mexican government 
notes, and the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that order. 
The judge later awarded $82.4 million to the U.S. investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court on Thursday, acting on the Mexican  
consortium's appeal on the asset transfer ban, reversed the appeals 
court's ruling.

<HEADLINE> IOC Director Loyal to Samaranch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The IOC general assembly opened today  
with a senior administrator denying rumors of an in-house plot 
against President Juan Antonio Samaranch and pledging loyalty to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Francois Carrard, director general of the International Olympic  
Committee, addressed speculation that he and other staff at IOC 
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland, were working to oust 
Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been some rumors floating around,'' Carrard told  
the delegates. ``The entire administration and secretariat are 
fully dedicated to serving the institution, and we all totally 
support our president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carrard's statement came at the start of the 109th IOC session,  
whose deliberations were opened to the media for the first time in 
history. The proceedings were beamed to journalists via 
closed-circuit television feed. 
</P>
<P>
	The first order of business was the swearing-in of new members,  
including Crown Prince Willem-Alexander, heir to the Dutch throne. 
The prince's IOC membership was questioned by Dutch 
parliamentarians following the Olympic corruption scandal, but the 
government gave its go-ahead when the IOC took steps toward reform. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Samaranch dismissed as ``rumors'' the recent  
published reports that IOC staff have plotted against him, and 
expressed support for Carrard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always we have rumors,'' he told reporters. ``I am not  
worried. Nothing has happened. ... In an organization like ours, we 
have to be used to rumors. But rumors are rumors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch also reiterated he intends to complete the final two  
years of his term and declared the IOC won't rush into reforms to 
appease critics. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech at the opening ceremony of the assembly, Samaranch  
said the committee already had taken important steps toward reform 
following the Salt Lake City bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	But he stressed the IOC would move at its own pace and on its  
own terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``We say `yes' to reforms necessary to consolidate the Olympic  
movement, without renouncing our convictions,'' he said. ``We say 
`no' to hasty reforms to please our critics. 
</P>
<P>
	``No to reforms which defend the interests of some at the  
expense of others. No to reforms based on personal and conflicting 
interests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the speech, Samaranch sought to erase any further speculation  
that he might retire early. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is to leave to my successor, at the end of my term  
in 2001, an institution which is over 100 years old, solid and 
beyond reproach,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a breakfast meeting with a small group of reporters,  
Samaranch was eager to put across the same point. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not leaving,'' he said. ``I have decided to go until the  
end of my mandate. The only thing that can stop me is if I don't 
have the confidence of IOC members or if I am ill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also refuted suggestions of a rift with IOC vice president  
Dick Pound, who has publicly speculated that Samaranch might retire 
after reforms are made at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who has been president since 1980 and turns 79 next  
month, released a letter signed by the 10 members of the executive 
board -- including Pound -- endorsing his continued leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	``In these difficult times of crisis wrought with danger, a  
strong, wise, trusted leadership is essential,'' the letter said. 
``We unanimously support you ... and ask you to continue to devote 
your time to the Olympic movement as president of the IOC, until 
the end of your present mandate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The four-day IOC session will include progress reports from  
organizers of the 2000 Sydney Olympics and 2002 Winter Games in 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the IOC will elect the host city of the 2006 Winter  
Games. The six cities in the all-European race are Helsinki, 
Finland; Klagenfurt, Austria; Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia; Sion, 
Switzerland; Turin, Italy; and Zakopane, Poland.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Holds at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit held steady at a  
record high in April, with some signs that U.S. companies may be 
seeing relief from a global financial crisis that has depressed 
overseas markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said today that the April trade deficit  
was $18.9 billion -- matching a revised estimate of the deficit in 
March. The government's original estimate had pegged the March 
deficit at $19.7 billion. The new, lower March estimate, however, 
was still a record that was tied in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Global economic troubles that started nearly two years ago in  
Asia have continued to hamper America's trade performance. The U.S. 
trade deficit is running at an annual rate of $218.1 billion, 
compared to the all-time high of $169.3 billion set last year. 
</P>
<P>
	During the international financial crisis, overseas markets for  
American products have dwindled and a flood of imports from 
troubled countries trying to unload their own goods here at 
discount prices has given American manufacturers stiff competition. 
</P>
<P>
	However, since other countries began a tentative recovery from  
recession this spring, American exports have started to pick up 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports, which had fallen for five previous months staged a  
small comeback in April. Exports rose 1.2 percent to $78 billion, 
including all categories from food to toys to cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports, however, have also continued to rise, climbing 1  
percent to $97 billion in April, a record high. Imports of foods, 
feeds and beverages reached a record $3.5 billion and imports of 
consumer and industrial goods were also up. 
</P>
<P>
	Among several bright spots, imports of motor vehicles and parts  
declined in April by 5.9 percent. Also, imports from Japan 
declined, pulling the sensitive deficit with Japan down 13.1 
percent to $5.6 billion, the first drop since November. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit with Mexico, a partner in the North American  
Free Trade Agreement, also declined in April by 32.5 percent to 
$1.7 billion due to a sharp drop in imports. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the April deficit with countries belonging to the  
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- which agreed this 
spring to limit production in the face of falling world demand for 
oil -- more than doubled in April to $1.8 billion, the most since 
October 1997. That was largely due to a sharp spike in oil and gas 
prices because of the production limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, imports from China rose to $5.8 billion, the highest since  
November. That helped push the U.S. trade deficit with China -- the 
second- biggest with any country behind Japan -- up by 15.7 percent 
to $4.8 billion in April. 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with the 15-nation European Union, meanwhile,  
increased by 9.7 percent to $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration argues that the overall trade deficit  
has a positive side: As the only major economy doing well, the 
United States is playing a valuable role providing markets for 
other countries struggling to get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists also note that cheap imports have helped keep  
inflation low here during a period of unusually high employment and 
heavy spending by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department issued a separate report today showing that  
low U.S. unemployment is continuing. The number of Americans filing 
new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 28,000 last week to 
297,000. A more closely watched four-week moving average of 
first-time jobless claims also dropped, by 750 to 308,250 in the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is worried that too big a trade deficit could  
cause American industries to pressure Congress for protectionist 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Already, the steel industry has won a vote in the House to  
impose global quotas on imports despite a presidential veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Commerce Department said steel  
imports fell by 8.6 percent in April, less than the 14 percent the 
government had first estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration says the United States cannot sustain such  
high trade deficits and that other economic powers, such as Japan 
and Europe, must do their part by boosting growth at home.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds Va. Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court upheld a Virginia murderer's  
death sentence today, ruling that state prosecutors did not violate 
Tommy David Strickler's rights by withholding evidence he said 
would have helped his case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 7-2 decision means Virginia authorities are free to schedule  
an execution date for Strickler. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickler ``has not shown that there is a reasonable probability  
that his conviction or sentence would have been different had these 
materials been disclosed,'' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickler, from New Market, and Ronald Lee Henderson of Frost,  
W.Va., were convicted in the 1990 murder of 19-year-old Leanne 
Whitlock, a sophomore at James Madison University in Harrisonburg, 
Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickler's Supreme Court appeal focused on certain helpful  
evidence -- statements to police by an eyewitness to Whitlock's 
abduction from a Harrisonburg shopping mall parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and prosecutors had not disclosed before trial the  
testimony to be offered by eyewitness Anne Stoltzfus. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of decisions dating back to 1965, the Supreme Court  
has ruled that the Constitution requires prosecutors to disclose 
all material evidence favorable to criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Material evidence is defined as that which probably would have  
changed a case's outcome if it had been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision was based on the facts of Strickler's case, and  
did not appear to alter the previous Supreme Court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitlock was last seen alive Jan. 5, 1990. Her body was found  
eight days later in a wooded area of Augusta County. Police said 
her head had been struck four times with a 69-pound boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Stoltzfus testified at Strickler's trial that she saw him  
and others abduct Whitlock from the mall parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickler's lawyer later learned that reports held by local  
police indicated that Stoltzfus initially had been unable to 
identify Strickler, and that she gave police the license tag number 
on Whitlock's car only after seeing it in an impoundment lot. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time that information was learned, Strickler's conviction  
and death sentence had been upheld on direct appeals to the 
Virginia Supreme Court and the nation's highest court. 
</P>
<P>
	He sought help from a federal trial judge, who overturned his  
conviction and death sentence. But the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of 
Appeals last year reinstated both, ruling that Strickler had given 
up his right to raise the undisclosed-evidence issue in federal 
court by failing to raise it in his state court appeals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court disagreed with that point but said Strickler  
must lose anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``Notwithstanding the obvious significance of Stoltzfus'  
testimony, (Strickler) has not convinced us that there is a 
reasonable probability that the jury would have returned a 
different verdict if her testimony had been either severely 
impeached or excluded entirely,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justices David H. Souter and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.  
Writing for the two, Souter said, ``I believe there is a reasonable 
probability ... that disclosure of Stoltzfus' materials would have 
led the jury to recommend life, not death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Strickler vs. Greene, 98-5864.

<HEADLINE> Good Samaritans To Receive Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When 18-year-old Jean-Dominique Catchings was  
attacked four years ago by seven young men fulfilling a gang 
initiation rite, he decided to focus on solutions rather than 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Catchings of Winter Park, Fla., realized that many crimes  
perpetrated by young adults could be prevented if other youths came 
forward with information they had about potentially dangerous or 
violent situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest problems is that teens have information but  
are scared to speak out,'' said Catchings, nicknamed Jo-Jo. He 
created the Speak Out Hotline Program, which enables youths to 
report crimes, without fear of retribution. Since the incident, 
Catchings also began a singing group, Chivalry, which focuses on 
using non-violent and non-vulgar lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just had to take what happened to me and turn it toward  
something positive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Catchings will join 40 other private citizens in  
Washington, as they are honored for looking toward the positive 
with contributions to public service. They are recipients of the 
Jefferson Awards, sponsored by the American Institute for Public 
Service, which salute individuals who through personal -- and often 
ingenious -- efforts have tried to improve the lives of others. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Magee Jr., a plastic surgeon in Norfolk, Va.,  
traveled to the Philippines in 1981 to operate on children with 
cleft lips and other facial deformities. There were so many 
children with the deformity, which can render it impossible for 
them to speak or eat, that hundreds had to be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
	Magee and his wife then founded Operation Smile, an organization  
which sends volunteer doctors to perform the reconstructive facial 
surgery for children worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't a strategic plan,'' said Magee. ``It was just a  
matter of emotion and passion to make sure children didn't have to 
live this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The group, which already has treated 50,000 children worldwide,  
also trains doctors in other nations to perform the procedure. 
Magee hopes to use satellite technology in the future, so he can 
teach a greater number of medical professionals the necessary 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Several award recipients describe how they were drawn into  
public service by formative moments in their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Ramona Tascoe was horrified as she watched the carnage on  
television when two U.S. embassies in East Africa were bombed last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tascoe was not satisfied to watch from continents away, even  
after the State Department rejected her offer to assemble a 
delegation of physicians and travel to Kenya and Tanzania. Instead, 
she tapped several willing donors and in less than two weeks was on 
her way with a private group of doctors and $300,000 worth of 
medical supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt it was important for the Kenyans to know there were  
Americans who were hurting because of their pain,'' said Tascoe, a 
San Francisco resident and a faculty member at the University of 
California at Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	She helped treat some 5,000 people injured by the blasts,  
looking for both physical and emotional scarring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had anticipated on making one trip,'' the doctor said.  
Instead, she has been back to Nairobi seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was so well-received. There was such a hunger for someone  
from the U.S. to offer a degree of compassion that was genuine,'' 
Tascoe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Four national figures also are being recognized for their  
service. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., will be honored for his  
work on Social Security and welfare reform; presidential contender 
Elizabeth Dole for her leadership of the American Red Cross; 
Millard Fuller, founder of Habitat for Humanity International, for 
establishing an organization that builds homes for the poor, and; 
Anthony Kennedy Shriver, for heading Best Buddies International, a 
group that works with mentally disabled youth. 
</P>
<P>
	Nominations are solicited by newspapers and television stations  
that ultimately determine the finalists. The service institute was 
founded in 1972 by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, former Sen. Robert 
Taft Jr. and Sam Beard.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Women Bring Same Style </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They're good, they're flashy, they're popular.  
And they can samba as well as any of their male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	There will be plenty of dance moves in the stands and lots of  
flamboyant maneuvers on the field whenever the Brazilian women play 
in the World Cup that begins Saturday. This team doesn't carry 
anywhere near the credentials of their countrymen, who have won 
four world titles, but they might be just as entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	And without the pressure that always accompanies Brazil's men,  
who are favorites in nearly every event they enter, these women 
just might go far in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be one of the surprises of the World Cup,'' coach  
Wilson de Oliveira promised as his team prepared to play Mexico in 
the second game of a Saturday doubleheader at Giants Stadium. The 
United States faces Denmark in the opener, with perhaps 75,000 fans 
on hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are preparing ourselves for our goal of Olympic qualifying  
by being one of the last eight teams in the World Cup. But we 
really believe we can aim for the top four and then see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Brazil has an illustrious history in the men's game, it is  
a relative newcomer to the top level of women's soccer. Indeed, the 
men had won their first three World Cups and were headed for their 
unprecedented fourth before a national women's squad was in place. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, coach Eurico Lira started the Radar team and, in  
general, gave birth to women's soccer in Brazil. Lira is as much a 
hero to the Brazilian women as Pele is to all Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
	``He fought for the girls,'' said defender Elane, who played for  
Radar for five years. ``He fought for the local games and local 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``In 1988, he got us all the equipment and uniforms and he went  
to the Brazil confederation to let them know of the women playing 
soccer. He asked for their support to go to China for a pre-World 
Cup tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lira got the federation's approval, if not its financial  
backing. He paid the team's expenses, and with 16 of the 18 players 
from his Radar club, Brazil wound up third in the event. 
</P>
<P>
	``He passed away, sadly, several years ago,'' Wilson said. ``But  
his memory lives on, because he founded women's soccer in Brazil 
and the team is progressing in his memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil didn't fare well in the inaugural Women's World Cup in  
1991, finishing ninth. It didn't do any better at the 1995 
tournament, again finishing ninth. 
</P>
<P>
	But with clubs sprouting throughout the nation, under the  
confederation's leadership and financial support, the women's game 
began to flourish in the South American soccer powerhouse. Although 
the Brazilians did not qualify for the Atlanta Olympics, they were 
invited when England dropped out. They took advantage, tying world 
champion Norway and Germany to make the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	They wound up fourth.  
</P>
<P>
	``Brazil might be the most improved team in the world,'' U.S.  
coach Tony DiCicco said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pretinha, the team's most dangerous scorer and one of the best  
players in the world, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our success is very important for women in Brazil to able to  
get a job and get paid as a player,'' she said. ``So we strive to 
get much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As they improve, the Brazilians also become more popular. When  
Pretinha walks down the street back home, people notice her and 
call her name. They ask for autographs. They take pictures. 
</P>
<P>
	``After the Olympics, I couldn't walk anywhere, because it would  
create a mob,'' she said. ``I love it. It's an acknowledgment of 
me, and of our team, and of women's soccer.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Civic Health Said Rebounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Crime rates are down. Confidence in government  
is up. Americans are getting more involved -- short of going to the 
polls. A new report says the nation's civic health is rebounding 
after a 10-year slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``That troubling decline has at least been arrested,'' said  
William Galston, executive director of the National Commission on 
Civic Renewal, which spent 18 months studying the state of 
citizenship in American life. ``Stay tuned, but I think this is an 
important beginning of a rejuvenation process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the commission, chaired by William Bennett, a  
Republican and former education secretary, and former Sen. Sam 
Nunn, D-Ga., issued a report that decried Americans' disengagement 
from government and community work. ``In a time that cries out for 
civic action, we are in danger of becoming a nation of 
spectators,'' the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	An update released by the commission on Thursday says civic  
activity is on an upswing. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's national index of civic health, a compilation  
of data on political participation, trust, family strength, group 
membership and personal security, fell by more than 20 percent 
during the decade ending in 1994. After that, the index began to 
rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The index for 1997, the last year the commission has data to  
track all the trends, says more people trust the government, feel 
safer in their neighborhoods and participate in politics. 
</P>
<P>
	The new index says the percentage of adults who trust the  
federal government rose to 38 percent in 1997, up from 29 percent 
in 1994. Americans' perception of how well the government is going 
its job often improves in times when crime rates are declining and 
the economy is robust, Galston says. 
</P>
<P>
	The index says the number of crimes reported per 1,000 people  
fell from 51 percent in 1994 to 39 percent in 1997. The index also 
says fewer people are afraid to walk near their home at night -- 38 
percent in 1997, down from 47 percent in 1994. Declining crime 
rates and community policing practices that move police officers 
from their squad cars to street corners may be responsible, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The index also reveals that more people are becoming politically  
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1994 and 1997, the percentage of adults who attended a  
rally or speech rose from 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The number 
who worked for a political party increased from 2.7 percent to 3.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the report says the percentage of adults who vote fell to  
43 percent, down from 47 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Levine, deputy director of the commission, says the  
question now is whether the index will continue to rise. Will 
citizens' trust in government, for instance, withstand President 
Clinton's impeachment? Will more people feel safe walking near 
their homes at night after the recent school shootings? He wonders.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Posting of 10 Commandments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Searching for a way to curb youth violence,  
the House bestowed its blessing Thursday on displaying the Ten 
Commandments in schools and other state-owned facilities and braced 
for a showdown over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 248-180 for a proposal by Rep. Robert Aderholt to  
allow states to display the commandments. Critics said the 
provision was unconstitutional, but the Alabama Republican 
countered that it would ``promote morality and work toward an end 
of children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, in a second victory for the entertainment industry  
in as many days, the House rejected a proposal to require labeling 
of violent content in entertainment products such as video games. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate marked the House's attempt to fashion a response to  
the shootings at a Colorado high school and elsewhere in recent 
months, and prompted lawmakers in both parties to lament cases of 
``children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions, approved on Wednesday, would call for tougher  
penalties for juvenile offenders, make it easier to try some 
juveniles as adults and require federal prosecutors to devote 
increased time and money to pursuing gun-related crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Those votes served as a prelude to the gun issue, the focus of a  
pitched political and lobbying battle for the past two weeks 
between the forces of the White House and gun control on one side 
and the National Rifle Association on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, leading the charge for  
greater gun control, paid grudging respect to the work of the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in admiration of what they're able to do,'' he said at a  
news conference, referring to an organization that has poured an 
estimated $14 million into political campaigns in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got members (of Congress) who are looking at a big  
independent expenditure that can be run against them, at votes that 
can be implemented against them'' if they defy the organization's 
wishes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the NRA issued a letter to members of the House  
detailing its position on a variety of proposed amendments. It said 
it ``very strongly supports'' a provision advanced by Rep. John 
Dingell, D-Mich., which it said ``does not include any gun control 
provisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell's proposal would curtail existing requirements for sales  
at gun shows, partly by redefining a gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative, backed by the White House, would retain the  
provisions approved by the Senate last month. They would require 
mandatory background checks for all purchases at gun shows, closing 
what supporters said was a loophole left in the 1993 Brady Bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, votes were expected on proposals to require that a  
safety device be sold with all handguns, to raise the minimum age 
for purchase of a handgun from 18 to 21 and to ban the importation 
of high capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and aides in both parties agreed the outcome was  
virtually impossible to predict, and that in the end, it was 
possible that nothing would command a majority on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	As an indication of the uncertainty, Dingell told reporters that  
even if his NRA-backed gun show proposal passed, he would probably 
oppose final passage of the measure if it contained any other gun 
control provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if those additional provisions fail in the House, he said  
``I might'' vote against his own bill on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the Ten Commandments was largely along party lines,  
with 203 Republicans and 45 Democrats in favor and 164 Democrats, 
one independent and 15 Republicans against. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt said the commandments ``represent the very cornerstone  
of Western civilization and the basis of our legal system here in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., countered that the proposal sought  
``to elevate one particular religion over all others,'' an effort 
that he said was ``blatantly unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky state law that required  
posting the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom, 
ruling that the postings would violate the constitutionally 
required separation of government and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt's amendment gives states permission to decide whether  
the commandments can be displayed in public facilities. It comes 
several years after a celebrated case in Alabama in which a local 
judge tried to hang the commandments in his courtroom but was 
ordered to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for labeling video games and other forms of  
entertainment was advanced by Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., and Bart 
Stupak, D-Mich., both of whom argued that the government requires 
labeling on food, and should do likewise on sources of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are killing children,'' Wamp said. ``I've had enough  
of it. I'm going to side with parents today. I'm going to side with 
children today, not some big special interest with a bunch of 
money,'' he said in a reference to the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote against the labeling proposal was 266-161.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the entertainment industry successfully turned  
back a proposal by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to curtail access of 
youth to explicit sexual or violent material in books, movies and 
other forms of modern-day culture.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Dunston Drops Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shawon Dunston of the St. Louis Cardinals  
dropped his appeal and began serving a three-game suspension 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston was penalized for charging the mound and starting a  
brawl against Los Angeles on May 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston, 36, said at time it wasn't the first time he charged  
the mound. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not fun and it's not something to brag about,'' he said.  
``But some things you have to do to protect yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston charged after he was hit in the back by a fastball from  
Dodgers rookie Jamie Arnold. He was the third Cardinal hit by a 
pitch in the game, the second in that inning.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Rangers turned their first triple play in 22  
years, and just the second since the franchise moved to Texas, on 
Thursday night against the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	With Tino Martinez on second and Paul O'Neill on first, Aaron  
Sele ran a full count on Chili Davis. Yankees manager Joe Torre 
sent the runners, and Davis hit a liner to second baseman Mark 
McLemore, who threw to shortstop Royce Clayton for the second out. 
</P>
<P>
	Clayton threw to first baseman Rafael Palmeiro to complete  
Texas' first triple play since Aug. 8, 1977 against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first triple play hit into by the Yankees since Steve  
Balboni lined into a 6-4-3 triple play against Baltimore on June 
15, 1989. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mayfield Chases Second Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONG POND, Pa. (AP) -- Jeremy Mayfield hadn't finished  
celebrating the first win of his career when the rain fell in 
torrents. 
</P>
<P>
	Was this an omen?  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps not.  
</P>
<P>
	But a year after the abbreviated ceremony in the winner's circle  
at Pocono International Raceway, he is still looking for victory 
No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never forget your first win, but we were hoping it would  
be one of a blur of Victory Lane memories by now,'' Mayfield said. 
``It's time to win again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll try to do that Sunday, when he defends his title in the  
Pocono 500. If anything, he is more anxious now than he was as a 
winless driver on the Winston Cup circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a lot of people tell me the first win was the hardest,  
but I wonder about that,'' Mayfield said on the eve of qualifying 
for the race. ``Right now, the second win is the hardest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayfield is confident, not only because he's back at the scene  
of his only triumph in six years on the circuit. He figures he's 
ready to break out, and finds this portion of the schedule to his 
liking. 
</P>
<P>
	After some difficult times -- which resulted in the departure of  
crew chief Paul Andrews and his replacement by Peter Sospenzo -- the 
Penske-Kranefuss Ford team is showing signs of renewed vigor. 
</P>
<P>
	After winning a year ago, Mayfield was leading in the points  
race before fading to finish eighth. This season, after climbing 
two positions in three races under Sospenzo, he is 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	``The top-10s are starting to come consistently again,'' said  
Mayfield, who finished among the elite in a non-points race, The 
Winston, then followed with similar efforts in the Coca-Cola 600 
and the MBNA 400 before a late pit stop cost him a top-10 spot last 
Sunday in the Kmart 400. ``We're on some good tracks for me and for 
this team like Pocono, Dover, Michigan and Daytona.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 2 1/2-mile Pocono triangle suited Mayfield well last year, when  
he led this race for 122 of 200 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	So, Mayfield is hungry for victory. But Mark Martin and Jeff  
Gordon -- who combined to win 20 of 33 races last season -- also are 
anxious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should be strong at Pocono,'' said Martin's crew chief,  
Jimmy Fennig. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Pocono is one of only four tracks on which Martin has  
not won, he has 16 top-10 finishes in 24 starts. After seven 
victories last year, Martin has only one in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may be fourth in the points now, but hope to move up before  
long,'' Fennig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has farther to go than Martin if he wants to reach the  
top of the standings. Despite three victories, Gordon is sixth -- 
349 points behind leader Dale Jarrett -- because of accidents and 
mechanical failures. 
</P>
<P>
	But Pocono has been good to Gordon, a two-time winner of the  
event who also took the second of the two annual races on the 
mountaintop last year. He led 164 laps in the Pennsylvania 500. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to worry about running good and winning races,''  
said Gordon, who figures that's the only way to transform what now 
seems like an insurmountable deficit into a legitimate run at a 
record-tying third straight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, a two-time Pocono winner, has earned his spot at the  
top with 11 top-five finishes in 14 races. Although he's coming off 
a rout of the field last Sunday in Brooklyn, Mich. -- Jarrett's 
second victory this season -- his plan for a championship run is 
based on consistency. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy,'' he said. ``We just have to stay away from those  
bad days. Whenever problems occur, we just have to stay away from 
the 15th- and 20th-place finishes.''

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Amateur Pick Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Josh Hamilton, the No. 1 overall pick  
in this month's amateur baseball draft, remained hospitalized a 
second day Wednesday with a stomach ailment after arriving for the 
start of his rookie league season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton accompanied his new teammates on a 14-hour bus trip  
Monday from St. Petersburg, Fla., to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' 
Class A affiliate in Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	But by Tuesday morning, he was vomiting and had a slight fever.  
He was taken to Princeton Community Hospital, where he remained 
Wednesday night. A nursing supervisor said he had gastroenteritis, 
a stomach and intestinal disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's teammates Tuesday began workouts at Hunnicutt Field a  
half-mile away in preparations for Friday's Appalachian League 
season opener against the Bluefield Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 18, was the first high school player to be taken with  
the first pick since Seattle selected Alex Rodriguez in 1993. 
Hamilton batted .529 with 13 homers and 35 RBIs in 25 games as a 
senior at Athens Drive High in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton agreed to a $3.65 million signing bonus, the largest  
ever given to a drafted amateur player who signed with the team 
that selected him. In rookie ball, however, he'll earn less than 
$1,000 a month and be given $20 a day in meal money on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite going 18-3 as a pitcher the last two seasons, Tampa Bay  
plans to develop him as a right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's status for the opener is uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an honor to be able to work with a kid like  
that,'' said Princeton batting coach Mike Tosar.

<HEADLINE> Pope Extends Trip to Poland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KRAKOW, Poland (AP) -- Seemingly revitalized after sharing  
boyhood memories with thousands in his hometown, Pope John Paul II 
extended his pilgrimage to Poland by a few hours today -- and hinted 
he'd be back. 
</P>
<P>
	Many have speculated that the trip may be the frail, 79-year-old  
pontiff's last to his native land, a fear compounded by health 
troubles during his stay. 
</P>
<P>
	And as the crowd in Gliwice, a southern town in the industrial  
and mining region of Silesia, implored him to stay longer, he 
responded playfully: ``The next time, we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With only a short notice, workers hurriedly put a stage and  
throne back together for John Paul, back on his feet after a bout 
of flu on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 500,000 faithful flocked to the site where John Paul was  
originally scheduled to say prayers Tuesday night, when the pope 
was forced to stay in bed with a fever. 
</P>
<P>
	``May God reward you for your saintly patience,'' he told the  
crowd after brief prayers. ``I would never stand such a pope. He's 
coming, he's not coming, then he does come ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Never mind,'' the crowd chanted.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad you say it doesn't matter,'' he replied. ``I'll go  
back to Rome with a clear conscience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he flew by helicopter for a previously unscheduled stop in  
Czestochowa, where Poland's holiest shrine, the Black Madonna, is 
kept at the Jasna Gora monastery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to stay but they tell me I have to go,'' the rushed  
pope told 250,000 people gathered there. 
</P>
<P>
	His planned departure today for Rome was pushed back to 6:15  
p.m. (12:15 p.m. EDT) to allow for the sidetrips. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, the pope said a private Mass for a few dozen friends  
and guests at Krakow's 14th century Wawel Cathedral, where he 
celebrated his first Mass upon becoming a priest in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
	As in his past trips, he also stopped at Rakowicki cemetery,  
where his parents and elder brother are buried. Shielded from a 
light rain by a white umbrella, he lighted a candle by the graves 
and prayed on his knees for five minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday night, John Paul departed from his prepared text to  
share a flood of memories with thousands in Wadowice, a small town 
where he grew up outside Krakow. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in the market square renamed in his honor, he reminisced  
about his past, from happy times sharing sweets with school chums 
to the dark days when the town lost its Jews during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	His recollections sometimes brought tears to people's eyes, as  
when he recited the inscription on a sundial he saw outside his 
window every day: ``Time flies, eternity awaits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, he recalled his family's Jewish landlord. ``I don't know  
what happened to him. I think he is dead,'' he said somberly.

<HEADLINE> Minister Comments on Cox Marriage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Some might compare a Hollywood marriage  
to living in a fish bowl, but Courteney Cox's childhood minister 
believes hers will be different. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Douglas Carpenter, who married Cox and David Arquette  
in San Francisco last weekend, said he compared the couple to ``a 
light on a hill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things I said in my sermon is that so many people  
know them and will be looking at them,'' said Carpenter, pastor of 
St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Cahaba Heights. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they see what a great marriage they have, it will help.  
Hollywood has a reputation of not taking marriage seriously, but 
these two are taking it seriously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Cox, 35, star of TV's ``Friends,'' grew up in Mountain  
Brook, a suburb of Birmingham, and has known Carpenter since she 
was 10. Arquette, 27, is an actor best known for his role in the 
``Scream'' films.

<HEADLINE> Jackson Finds Niche in San Antonio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Jaren Jackson is no stranger to the back  
roads of the CBA or the benches of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson played for the Wichita Falls Texans and the La Crosse  
Catbirds. He was cut by the New Jersey Nets during a road trip. He 
did a brief stint in France, where he struggled to speak French. 
</P>
<P>
	A journeyman willing to go wherever his love for basketball  
takes him, the San Antonio Spurs guard looks fondly upon the 
lessons he's learned as a traveling man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Always have a nice luggage set,'' Jackson said. ``I've been to  
the little towns and the big cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now as a trusted reserve for the Spurs, Jackson has found some  
career stability. He's provided San Antonio with solid shooting in 
the playoffs and was a key to the Spurs' 89-77 victory over the New 
York Knicks in Game 1 of the NBA Finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said Jackson's 17 points, including  
five 3-pointers, hurt New York more than Tim Duncan's 33 points 
Wednesday. Duncan is expected to have a big game. But Van Gundy 
doesn't want to let the Spurs' supporting players do the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to find a way to keep the other guys out of the  
game. We did that with some of the guys. We didn't do a good enough 
job on Jaren Jackson,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson made half of his 10 3-point attempts. His biggest basket  
came with 8:10 left in the game after the Knicks closed to 74-68. 
</P>
<P>
	Closely guarded in the corner, with the shot clock running down,  
Jackson hit a 3-pointer as he nearly tumbled out of bounds. It sent 
the 39,514 fans in the Alamodome into an uproar and stopped New 
York's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been told a long time ago, when in doubt, let it go. I  
wasn't sure, so I didn't want the clock to go down on me,'' Jackson 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson joined the Spurs before the 1997-98 season after having  
played for seven other NBA teams. He played college basketball at 
Georgetown, graduating in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson wasn't drafted by an NBA team. New Jersey signed him as  
a free agent shortly after college and waived him a few months 
later. Then he played in the Continental Basketball Association 
with Wichita Falls in Texas and La Crosse in Wisconsin, winning a 
championship with each team. 
</P>
<P>
	He also played in Pittsburgh and Fort Wayne, Ind., in the CBA  
and for the Dayton Wings in Ohio in the WBL, a small summer league. 
</P>
<P>
	Four times in the CBA he reached the league finals. So when some  
Spurs players talk about their NBA championships, Jackson listens 
with respect, but he's won titles, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had success in other leagues, and I remember those days.  
I was going through playoff series. It wasn't in the NBA, but that 
helped me as far as my outlook on the playoffs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once he established himself in the minor leagues, Jackson began  
to land contracts in the NBA. He played for Golden State, Portland, 
Philadelphia, Houston, Washington and the Los Angeles Clippers. He 
was signed by Chicago before the 1993-94 season, but was waived 
before the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson and fellow Spurs guards Mario Elie and Avery Johnson  
often joke about their lengthy resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody knows the story about how A.J. was cut by the Spurs  
once, the Spurs twice. We try to joke about that moment when the 
coach is telling you you're gone,'' he said. ``If it happens, 
you've got to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said he's thrilled for Jackson that  
the situation in San Antonio has worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to respect the fact that he continued, that he never  
stopped trying to get it right,'' Popovich said. 
</P>
<P>
	If basketball hadn't been an option, Jackson said, he never  
doubted he could make a living in the ``real world.'' He earned a 
degree in finance. His wife, Terri, also a Georgetown graduate, is 
a lawyer. An avid reader, Jackson said he enjoyed school and that 
he would like to eventually return for more education. 
</P>
<P>
	He always dreamed of playing in the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
	``Deep down, I've always felt that I can play in this league  
just as well as any of these guys,'' Jackson said. ``Even through 
all those times of getting cut, you just have to believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Spurs, Jackson became a starter last season and had the  
same role early this season before Popovich replaced him with Elie 
and decided Jackson would be more effective off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the Spurs are anchored by big men Tim Duncan and David  
Robinson, the squad needs outside shooters like Jackson more so 
than a smaller team might, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
	It helps that his teammates are unselfish with the ball and are  
confident enough to let him shoot, Jackson added. 
</P>
<P>
	``You rarely find that in the league,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who becomes a free agent after this season, said he  
enjoys San Antonio and finally feels at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I did feel a little bit that way in Washington. I felt a  
little bit that way in other places, too,'' he cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Jackson is concentrating on helping the Spurs win a  
championship. Whether he has a future with the Spurs isn't 
definite. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, his luggage is waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm keeping the situation with a level head, not too  
overconfident,'' he said. ``I'm not going to count my chickens 
yet.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles Agree With 1st Draft Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Larry Bigbie still has the photograph of him and  
Harold Baines after batting practice when he was just 5 years old. 
Now he's got a new one to put on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
	Bigbie, the 21st pick overall in this month's amateur draft,  
became the first of the Baltimore Orioles' four first-round draft 
picks to sign, agreeing Thursday to a minor league contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he still has a physical to pass, the outfielder from  
Hobart, Ind., joined the team at Comiskey Park before their game 
against the Chicago White Sox. 
</P>
<P>
	Bigbie got a uniform, met Cal Ripken and the rest of the guys  
and took batting practice. He also took that new picture with 
Baines. 
</P>
<P>
	``No other experience like that, taking BP with the big  
leaguers,'' Bigbie said, a huge smile on his face. ``Everybody 
treated me like I was at home. It was great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meeting Ripken made the biggest impression, especially when he  
saw all the youngsters who came out to the ballpark early hoping 
for an autograph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can remember when I was one of those kids, and now I'm on  
the field with him,'' Bigbie said. ``It was somewhat of a dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bigbie watched the game from the press box, wearing an Orioles  
jacket and cap. He'll fly to Baltimore on Friday for a physical and 
then report to Bluefield in the Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to be getting started,'' he said. ``I was ready to  
get (negotiations) over with from the get-go. I didn't want to 
string it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bigbie was the Orioles third of four picks in the first round.  
The left-handed hitter finished his career at Ball State as the 
school's all-time leading hitter with a .386 average, and he was 
the Mid-American Conference Player of the Year his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Baltimore's other three first-round picks were: Clemson  
right-hander Mike Paradis (13th overall), left-hander Richard Stahl 
from Newton (Ga.) High School (18) and Providence outfielder Keith 
Reed (23).

<HEADLINE> Spurs Want Postseason Win Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- The San Antonio Spurs have a chance to do  
something that the greatest teams in NBA history -- even Bill 
Russell's Boston Celtics and Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls -- never 
accomplished: 12 consecutive postseason victories. 
</P>
<P>
	And on the day between Games 1 and 2 of the NBA Finals, they  
couldn't have cared less. 
</P>
<P>
	``That playoff winning streak record is not important  
whatsoever,'' Spurs center David Robinson said Thursday. ``Nobody 
in our locker room has talked about it or even cared about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs were more concerned about maintaining their mental  
edge and staying hungry for Game 2 Friday night against the New 
York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Their Game 1 victory was a product of the same winning formula  
they've used all year: plenty of production from Tim Duncan; 
support on offense and defense from Robinson; timely shooting by 
one of their outside specialists, in this case Jaren Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite an 11-game winning streak, the Spurs have run into  
trouble in Game 2s during each of their playoff series. In the 
first round, they lost to Minnesota. In the second round, they 
needed two late missed free throws by Kobe Bryant to beat the Los 
Angeles Lakers. In the third round, they trailed Portland by 18 
before winning on Sean Elliott's incredible tippy-toe 3-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not just this team, it's any team,'' said Steve Kerr, a  
veteran of three NBA Finals with the Bulls. ``You see a team win 
Game 1 in the finals and there's a natural tendency to let down a 
little bit. The other team is angry and comes out and plays a lot 
better, and all of a sudden it's 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had some trouble in Game 2s, so it'll be important for  
us to come out strong early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, it was the Knicks who came out strong, only to falter  
in the second quarter when they got into foul trouble. New York was 
still within striking distance, trailing by six early in the fourth 
quarter, but Jackson's two big 3-pointers deflated the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, who had five 3-pointers in scoring 17 points, was the  
one player who ruined the Knicks' strategy of letting Duncan get 
his points while trying to contain everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks used to use the same strategy against Jordan,  
although it usually came up short then, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way Duncan's played, there's not one man on the planet  
that can stop him,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I've been 
watching this year, and he's the best player in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't think his 33 beat us as much as the foul trouble  
that he and Robinson forced upon us, and Jackson's 17.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan said the only thing about the Knicks' defense that  
surprised him was that he wasn't immediately double-teamed in the 
low post. Sometimes the Knicks used one defender, and other times 
waited until Duncan dribbled before sending reinforcements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't really like to double, we prefer to play straight  
up,'' New York's Kurt Thomas said. ``But we're going to have to 
double at times and mix it up. If we don't double him, he might get 
60.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the wrinkles the Spurs threw at the Knicks was a  
double-team on Latrell Sprewell when New York tried to run 
isolation plays. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell shot just 9-for-24, including 1-for-8 in the fourth  
quarter when San Antonio sent two defenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think demoralized would be the right word. Obviously  
they were disappointed and discouraged,'' Robinson said. ``They 
really brought their `A' game, they were genuinely excited. With 
the way we fought back, I think they were a little surprised that 
we were able to take over the game like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Making matters more bleak for the Knicks were an assortment of  
new injury worries. Larry Johnson said his knee was very sore after 
his surprise start, Marcus Camby had a sore knee or thigh and Chris 
Dudley hyperextended his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	New York is already playing without Patrick Ewing, who has a  
torn Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	The only bright spot for the Knicks was the play of Thomas, who  
had 13 points and 16 rebounds off the bench. Camby, limited to 23 
minutes because of foul trouble, had only 10 points and six 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with San Antonio is you may get by the first shot  
blocker, but then there's the next shot blocker. It's very 
difficult to get quality shots,'' Van Gundy said. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio is tied with the 1988-89 Los Angeles Lakers for the  
longest playoff winning streak for one season, and Friday will mark 
the 38th day since the Spurs last lost a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Kerr said he wouldn't pick these Spurs over last year's Bulls,  
even though he is impressed by this long run of victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the Bulls, we won eight or nine in a row a couple of  
times,'' Kerr said, ``but this is as good a roll as there's ever 
been in this league. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out of those 11 games, there were two of them that we got a  
little lucky with. So, yeah, we got a couple of breaks, but that's 
part of the game.''

<HEADLINE> Family Goes Online After Flooding / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- Kent and Ali Bahl cannot reach most of  
their north-central North Dakota farmland by tractor to plant their 
spring crops. More than 12 inches of rain since May 1 have made 
that impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bahls have created access to their flooded land in a  
different way. It's an Internet page showing aerial pictures of the 
flooding, and it has sparked worldwide interest from people 
intrigued by the overwhelming amount of water. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sit out here in rural North Dakota, and we've had responses  
from Geneva, Switzerland; Buenos Aires, Argentina; a lot of heads 
of state agencies,'' Kent Bahl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bahls hope their Web page will help people understand the  
devastation facing families in the flooded area. The site has 
received more than 4,500 hits in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ali Bahl designs Web pages from the family farm nine miles south  
of the Canadian border in Renville County, about 20 miles from 
Mohall, N.D. 
</P>
<P>
	Her business, Ali's Creative Home Page Design, has been mainly a  
hobby. But it could be a source of income this year, given the 
sorry state of the family's waterlogged fields. The Bahls hope 
their Internet site will generate money from advertisers and 
business from prospective Web page customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to keep shoes on the girls' feet. It will butter  
our bread,'' said Ali Bahl, a self-taught computer buff and mother 
of two. The Bahls are expecting a third child in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Bahl was going out Thursday to seed 100 acres -- a crop he  
concedes probably won't reach maturity by the time the ground 
freezes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like going up to the ... dice table and throwing the dice  
and not knowing what's going to happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's more of an addiction than anything,'' he added. ``We  
gotta have something. It's a long time until the next payday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bahl said his fields are so wet that he will plant only about  
800 acres this year. In normal years, he plants 4,000 acres -- 
mostly durum and spring wheat, sunflowers and canola. 
</P>
<P>
	He said an 80-acre field across the road normally contains two  
sloughs. At the peak of the torrents last month, he counted 38 
pools of water that had gobbled up farmland. ``My dad is 80, and 
he's never seen not being able to farm,'' Bahl said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bahls aren't alone. Farmers throughout the region have been  
flooded this spring. The situation is worse to the east, in 
Bottineau and Rolette Counties. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Albright, executive director for the Renville County Farm  
Service Agency, estimates between 33 percent and 40 percent of the 
county's farmland will go unplanted this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahl and other swamped farmers are using a crop insurance method  
called ``prevented planting'' to stay in business. Farmers have the 
option of not planting the crop and receiving crop insurance 
payments that are less than what they would get if they planted a 
crop that later was wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers say the flooding effects will trickle down to rural  
economies already struggling because of low commodity prices and 
crop disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's total devastation, and the trickle-down effect is going  
to be unbelievable,'' Bahl said. ``We love to spend money if we 
have it, but if we don't, the checkbook is shut.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Faiths Eyed in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Christianity and Islam, and what happens  
between them, will set the shape of the next century more than 
nations will, says Francis Cardinal George, the Roman Catholic 
Archbishop of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a Library of Congress conference on ``Frontiers of  
the Mind in the 21st Century,'' he foresaw a decline in the 
importance of national governments. 
</P>
<P>
	```In the next millennium,'' the cardinal predicted on  
Wednesday, ``as the modern nation state is relativized and national 
sovereignty is displaced into societal arrangements still to be 
invented, it will be increasingly evident that the major faiths are 
carriers of culture...'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he added:  
</P>
<P>
	``The conversation between Christianity and Islam is not yet far  
advanced, but its outcome will determine what the globe will look 
like a century from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His view of Islam's importance was endorsed by Algerian-born  
Mohammed Arkoun, a retired professor of the history of Islamic 
thought at the Sorbonne in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	``Islam is important by its human dimensions,'' he said in an  
interview. `It covers many societies, from Indonesia and the 
Philippines to Morocco, from the Caucasus and Tajikistan to South 
Africa. Islam is everywhere. Islam and Christianity are the only 
two religions which spread all over the world. Judaism didn't 
spread. Buddhism spread in Asia... 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why it's so essential that a special dialogue, a  
special exchange exist between these two religions without of 
course neglecting the other religions...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Fishbane, who teaches Jewish studies at the University  
of Chicago, criticized what he saw as too much emphasis on 
Catholicism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It unfortunately divides up the globe between Islam and  
Catholicism,'' he said after the session. ``It doesn't take into 
account Taoism, all forms of Confucianism, all types of 
Christianity that exist in China and will emerge in the next 
century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinal George denounced what he called the ``divorce of  
freedom from truth'' in the western democracies. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the millions of abortions annually,'' he said, ``the  
divorce of human reproduction from the embrace of human love, the 
increased application of the death penalty, the practice of 
euthanasia, the conviction that handicapped people are better off 
dead, the seemingly indiscriminate and sometimes disproportionate 
use of the military, the gun violence in the streets of our cities 
and the corridors of our schools -- in all these we see the fruits 
of what the Pope has called `the culture of Death'... ''

<HEADLINE> GoTo.com Plans IPO As Market Cools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Fledgling Web search engine company  
GoTo.com Inc. plans to go public Friday, hitting the market just as 
investors appear to be losing their appetite for Internet stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	GoTo.com executives hope the initial public offering raises a  
windfall of cash, as stock offerings have done for other Internet 
companies over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the big, easy money from IPOs may be a thing of the past,  
analysts say. A steady slide in Internet stocks suggests investors 
have begun to look askance at sky-high valuations and are deciding 
that some stocks aren't a good bet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have become more discriminating in their choice of  
IPOs,'' said Youssef Squali, an analyst with Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; 
Co. ``We're in the process now where we will continue to see 
successful IPOs, but nothing compared to what we've seen in the 
past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GoTo.com plans to sell 5 million shares at $13 to $14 per share  
in a bid to raise up to $70 million for the company that emerged 
last year from idealabs!, the Pasadena, Calif., incubator founded 
by Bill Gross. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many Internet companies, GoTo.com has yet to turn a profit.  
In filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company 
said it has lost $21 million since it was founded in 1997 and will 
continue to lose money for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues have grown, however, jumping in the first quarter of  
1999 to $1.4 million from $38,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	SEC rules prohibit company officials from commenting in the  
period before an IPO is launched. 
</P>
<P>
	IPOs have provided big initial returns for other companies that  
have yet to make money. Just last month, Santa Monica, Calif.-based 
eToys Inc. raised $166 million with an offering in which the share 
price jumped from $20 to $85 as investors snapped up the company's 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
	But since its hefty opening, eToys has fallen more than 50  
percent from its high, trading Thursday at $40 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Other high-profile Internet stocks, including Amazon.com Inc.  
and Priceline.com Inc. have taken a beating in recent weeks. 
National Discount Brokers Group, an online stock brokerage, on 
Tuesday canceled its plans to sell 2.6 million new shares because 
of market conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet stocks did get a slight bounce this week, sending the  
Dow Jones Internet Index up 22 percent on Wednesday. The market was 
up slightly in trading Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But even with the jump, the index was down 36 percent since  
peaking on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are likely to remain cautious in the long term, said  
Jack Staff, chief economist at Zona Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``What you're finding now is the Internet is starting to  
mature,'' he said. ``We have long said that as soon as some of the 
Internet companies start to make their first profits, there will be 
a softening in the Internet sector as a whole because Internet 
stocks will go from being stocks of possibility to stocks of 
reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are indications GoTo.com's pay-for-play business model may  
be working. In GoTo.com's system, clients bid a price they are 
willing to pay for a high ranking on results pages. The name of the 
highest bidder appears at the top of the page, with others ranked 
in descending order according to their bid. 
</P>
<P>
	A note attached to each link on GoTo.com's results page tells  
users how much a company paid to be there. For example, a search 
for ``books'' turned up Best Buy at the top of the list; it paid 57 
cents for the placement. (Amazon.com was second -- it paid 56 
cents). 
</P>
<P>
	This system contrasts with most other search engines, which make  
money from selling ads that appear on their Web pages. 
</P>
<P>
	Users don't seem to mind. Between Jan. 1 and April 30, searches  
via GoTo.com increased 85 percent to more than 1 million per month, 
and the clientele of paying advertisers grew 150 percent to more 
than 7,500. 
</P>
<P>
	During April, GoTo.com attracted 7.2 percent of all Web surfers,  
placing it 10th among search engines, according to Media Metrix. 
</P>
<P>
	In its IPO, GoTo.com has an advantage in its connection to the  
entrepreneur Gross, said Squali. His idealabs! was home to other 
successful startups, including eToys, CitySearch and PetsMart. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now I think the Internet companies that can still make it are  
companies that are relatively dominant in their niche market or 
companies that have strong backing from well-known venture 
capitalists or have a very strong management team,'' said Squali. 
``I think GoTo.com falls in the second category.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Pitches High-Tech Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called today for  
tax cuts for businesses which invest in high-tech research and told 
a crowd in a state that is politically crucial and home to a 
growing high-tech industry that he'd ``invest aggressively'' to 
create information-age jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be talking about my economic ideas in real  
specifics,'' Gore said, at an ``issues forum'' in New Hampshire, 
moving to build on his front-runner status in the Democratic 
presidential fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore brought his economic message to New Hampshire, site of the  
nation's first presidential primary. The centerpiece of Gore's 
economic proposals focused on incentives for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will craft these tax cuts specifically to help the small  
businesses and startups that are crucial to our high-tech future,'' 
Gore said. He pledged to ``double our investment in information 
technology over five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals came as Gore opened his first full days as an  
officially declared candidate for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, speaking with about 300 people jammed into a college 
gymnasium for a detailed policy discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides hope to contrast the opening of Gore's campaign with that  
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner often 
criticized for being vague on the issues. In the process, Gore was 
sketching out his own agenda apart from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to avoid the false assumption that we can keep  
the good times going just by wishing it would be so and not trying 
to be proactive,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's event was interrupted briefly by a group of protesters  
who chanted and waved signs urging greater assistance for AIDS 
victims in Africa. ``I respect our tradition of free speech,'' Gore 
said, as protesters were hustled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore pointedly scheduled the first two events of his campaign in  
important early test states, Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very lengthy list of specific and hard-hitting  
proposals to make this country a better place,'' Gore said. ``I 
haven't heard any of the others support this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters if he was seeking a contrast with Bush, Gore  
said: ``That is a conclusion that is almost impossible to avoid, 
but I'll let you reach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore officially kicked off his run for the White House in his  
hometown of Carthage, Tenn., on Wednesday, with a theme of ``the 
family crisis in America.'' He also called for individual 
responsibility in a speech in which he also began to distance 
himself from the scandals that have plagued President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our lives we have to master if we are going to remain as  
role models for our children,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore repeatedly insisted that parents must ``master their own  
lives'' before lamenting tragedies like school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to New  
Hampshire, Gore was asked if that applied to Clinton as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It applies to every single American,'' he said. ``I'm sure  
that you heard when you were a child what I heard when I was a 
child, that what you do speaks louder than what you say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore followed the Carthage announcement with a town-hall meeting  
in Iowa, where about 1,000 activists cheered an abbreviated 
announcement speech, and asked a few carefully scripted questions 
about bolstering schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he also was heading to New York, and then to California to  
show the flag in states that could help settle the nomination by 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Democratic fight, Gore faces a challenge only from former  
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. He holds a wide lead in the polls, 
and some strategists argue that -- absent an unforeseen event -- the 
nomination is Gore's to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore aides said the dynamic of the Democratic race bodes well  
for Gore, because Bradley must demonstrate fairly quickly an 
ability to win, not simply compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a two-person race,'' said Gore campaign manager Craig  
Smith. ``He (Bradley) has got to find somewhere where he can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been little battling between Gore and Bradley, and  
Bradley aides said the announcement changes nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really change how we're coming at things,'' Bradley  
aide Eric Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gore far ahead among Democrats, and with Bush leading among  
Republicans, there was a clear effort in Gore's camp to begin 
drawing contrasts with Bush, looking past the primary season. Some 
Democrats are worried by early polling showing Gore losing that 
matchup, and Gore was clear in trying to begin the process of 
offering contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring the seriousness with which they take Gore, top  
Republicans bought newspaper ads and staged events welcoming Gore 
to the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't respond to it,'' said Gore campaign chairman Tony  
Coehlo, ``because we thought it was too cute.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Internet Users Climb to 92M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The number of people over 16 in the United  
States and Canada using the Internet has climbed to 92 million, 
with almost as many women as men online, according to a new survey 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by Nielsen Media Research and CommerceNet also shows  
dramatic increases in the number of women who made at least a 
single purchase using the Internet, rising 80 percent over nine 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly the types of products you can purchase online are so  
much more diverse than in years past, said Jerome Samson, one of 
the study's coordinators. ``The only thing you could purchase 
online were hardware, software, things that mainly appealed to a 
male audience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most popular items for women to buy on the Web were books,  
CDs and videos with 9.6 million purchases of those items taken 
together. But in a twist, the number of women buying computers over 
the Internet climbed fastest at 160 percent to 1.3 million during 
the past nine months. 
</P>
<P>
	Men also bought mostly books, CDs and videos but also bought far  
more computers -- 4.1 million -- than women. 
</P>
<P>
	Among both men and women, online purchases of software remained  
flat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nearly half of North America uses the Internet,'' said Mark  
Resch, executive vice president at CommerceNet. ``We use it to 
communicate, to learn, to shop and to buy. It is as integral a part 
of our lives as the telephone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, based on interviews with more than 7,200 people in  
North America, said 54 percent of people on the Internet are men -- 
although men still represent a slightly higher proportion, 62 
percent, of all online buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The study distinguished online buyers from online shoppers, who  
merely research and compare prices and features among products and 
services, even if they don't ultimately make a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	It said that among shoppers, men most typically look at  
information about cars and car parts while women most often look 
for details about clothing and books. 
</P>
<P>
	The same study last August showed 79 million people over 16 on  
the Internet in North America -- with 43 percent of them women. The 
study in September 1997 counted 58 million, also with 43 percent 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	But last year's study also showed that more than 71 percent of  
Internet purchasers were men. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest study also said 72 million people use the Internet  
from home, while 46 million use it from work and 28 million from 
school. The rest use it from other locations, such as a library or 
a friend's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen and CommerceNet said the results of its latest study  
were statistically representative of North America's population of 
225 million people over the age 16.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Cautious on Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve officials are keeping a wary  
eye on signs the economy could soon begin to overheat as U.S. 
consumers continue their buying binge and other countries begin to 
recover from two years of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, scheduled to appear  
today before Congress, warned earlier this week that recent 
increases in American workers' productivity, which have so far held 
down inflation, cannot last forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists saw that as a strong hint the Fed will increase  
interest rates either at its next meeting June 29-30 or later this 
year. Many anticipated a more explicit warning when Greenspan talks 
about monetary policy today before the Joint Economic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	When interest rates go up, borrowing becomes more expensive,  
consumers and businesses tend to spend less and thus the economy 
eventually slows. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Fed policymakers said they were leaning toward  
raising interest rates at future meetings because of ``the 
potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some long-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates, already  
have begun to climb a bit on their own because of expectations that 
the Fed will raise short-term rates. But further complicating the 
matter, the government reported Tuesday that inflation remained 
tame in May. That caused investors to relax slightly. The Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks rose 190 points following the 
inflation report Wednesday, and open-market interest rates fell 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	But most economists warned they still expected the Fed to  
increase short-term rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong consumer demand has kept the U.S. economy growing even as  
some foreign countries have suffered through two years of 
recession. Now those countries -- especially Japan -- seem to be 
recovering and thus increasing their demand for U.S. products, 
taxing production capacity and thus, perhaps, leading to higher 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen strong domestic demand continue, and now we're  
seeing increasing foreign demand pressures,'' said David Jones, 
chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the United States, the Fed's latest survey of regional  
economies also found hints that economic growth is becoming unruly. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a construction boom spurred by brisk home sales has  
resulted in shortages of labor and materials, pushing building 
costs up in some parts of the country including around Chicago and 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	And employers in more regions are feeling pressures to raise  
wages, which can eventually lead to inflation: Factories in the St. 
Louis area are having trouble finding enough skilled workers to 
keep up with resurging demand, and Boston and New York stores are 
increasing wages to recruit new workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with students looking for summer jobs, temporary employment  
firms have been unable to fill job openings. ``Anyone that can 
operate a personal computer can get a job,'' one employment agent 
in northern Virginia told Fed bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger is if the Fed allows the economy to continue to  
grow at this strong a pace, eventually ... it's going to cause some 
upward pressure on wages and prices,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed hasn't raised U.S. interest rates in more than four  
years. Last fall, it enacted three rate reductions in a successful 
effort to keep the global slowdown from disrupting the U.S. 
economy.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Posting of 10 Commandments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Searching for a way to curb youth violence,  
the House approved legislation Thursday night permitting the Ten 
Commandments to be posted in schools and other state and local 
facilities and moved toward a showdown over gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was 287-139 for the anti-violence measure, which  
includes a variety of get-tough provisions related to juvenile 
crime as well as the declaration permitting states to display the 
Biblical commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics said that measure was unconstitutional, but its sponsor,  
Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., countered that it would ``promote 
morality and work toward an end of children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, in a second victory for the entertainment industry in  
as many days, the House rejected a proposal to require labeling of 
violent content in entertainment products such as video games. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second night in a row, lawmakers worked late into the  
evening debating a response to the shootings at a Colorado high 
school and elsewhere. Repeatedly, lawmakers in both parties 
lamented cases of ``children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other provisions in the bill would toughen penalties for  
juvenile offenders, make it easier to try some juveniles as adults 
and require federal prosecutors to devote increased time and money 
to pursuing gun-related crimes. The legislation envisions the 
federal government spending $1.5 billion over the next three years 
in grants to states to help combat juvenile crime. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the measure explicitly permits religious symbols to  
be included in the design of a memorial on any public school campus 
to commemorate anyone slain there. That provision was offered by 
Rep. Thomas Tancredo, a Colorado Republican who represents the area 
where this spring's shootings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Passage led immediately to debate of a companion bill on gun  
control, the focus of a pitched political battle between the forces 
of the White House and gun control on one side and the National 
Rifle Association on the other. 
</P>
<P>
	House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt, leading the charge for  
greater gun control, paid grudging respect to the work of the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm in admiration of what they're able to do,'' he said at a  
news conference, referring to an organization that has poured an 
estimated $14 million into political campaigns in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got members (of Congress) who are looking at a big  
independent expenditure that can be run against them, at votes that 
can be implemented against them'' if they defy the organization's 
wishes, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	For its part, the NRA issued a letter to members of the House  
detailing its position on a variety of proposed amendments. It said 
it ``very strongly supports'' a provision advanced by Rep. John 
Dingell, D-Mich., which it said ``does not include any gun control 
provisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dingell's proposal would curtail existing requirements for sales  
at gun shows, partly by redefining a gun show. 
</P>
<P>
	An alternative, backed by the White House, would retain the  
provisions approved by the Senate last month. They would require 
mandatory background checks for all purchases at gun shows, closing 
what supporters said was a loophole left in the 1993 Brady Bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, votes were expected on proposals to require that a  
safety device be sold with all handguns, to raise the minimum age 
for purchase of a handgun from 18 to 21 and to ban the importation 
of high capacity ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and aides in both parties agreed the outcome was  
virtually impossible to predict, and that in the end, it was 
possible that nothing would command a majority on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	As an indication of the uncertainty, Dingell told reporters that  
even if his NRA-backed gun show proposal passed, he would probably 
oppose final passage of the measure if it contained any other gun 
control provision. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if those additional provisions fail in the House, he said  
``I might'' vote against his own bill on final passage. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the Ten Commandments was largely along party lines,  
with 203 Republicans and 45 Democrats in favor and 164 Democrats, 
one independent and 15 Republicans against. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt said the commandments ``represent the very cornerstone  
of Western civilization and the basis of our legal system here in 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Robert Scott, D-Va., countered that the proposal sought  
``to elevate one particular religion over all others,'' an effort 
that he said was ``blatantly unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court struck down a Kentucky state law that required  
posting the Ten Commandments in every public school classroom, 
ruling that the postings would violate the constitutionally 
required separation of government and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt's amendment gives states permission to decide whether  
the commandments can be displayed in public facilities. It comes 
several years after a celebrated case in Alabama in which a local 
judge tried to hang the commandments in his courtroom but was 
ordered to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal for labeling video games and other forms of  
entertainment was advanced by Rep. Zach Wamp, R-Tenn., and Bart 
Stupak, D-Mich., both of whom argued that the government requires 
labeling on food, and should do likewise on sources of violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Children are killing children,'' Wamp said. ``I've had enough  
of it. I'm going to side with parents today. I'm going to side with 
children today, not some big special interest with a bunch of 
money,'' he said in a reference to the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote against the labeling proposal was 266-161.  
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the entertainment industry successfully turned  
back a proposal by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., to curtail access of 
youth to explicit sexual or violent material in books, movies and 
other forms of modern-day culture.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Higher; Dow Gains 56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks pushed higher Thursday after Federal  
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that only a modest 
interest rate hike may be needed to keep inflation well-tamed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 56.68 at 10,841.63,  
building on a nearly 190-point climb Wednesday when consumer prices 
showed little sign of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indexes also advanced. Shrugging off early  
disappointing news from Compaq Computer, the technology-dominated 
Nasdaq composite index gained 26.32 to 2,544.15. On Wednesday, the 
index rose 103.16 -- its largest one-day point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 9.49 Thursday to 1,339.90.  
</P>
<P>
	In his most direct recent comments on interest rates, Greenspan  
told Congress that while inflation remains in check, the Fed should 
consider taking pre-emptive action to avert any threat to continued 
economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	To the markets' relief, the Fed chairman said a modest increase  
now could eliminate the need for more severe moves at a later date. 
The Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's 
interest rate policy, meets June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has warned recently it might raise interest rates to  
guard against a surge in inflation. The annual rate of inflation 
felt by consumers so far this year is 2.6 percent, compared to a 
1.6 percent rise for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	After early jittery fluctuations, financial markets advanced  
most of the day in a continuing response to Wednesday's Labor 
Department report on consumer prices and on sheer relief that 
Greenspan had showed the Fed's hand so clearly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets were relieved that the Fed is finally going to do  
something, but it won't be too drastic,'' said Eugene G. Mintz, 
financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also didn't issue any dire warnings about the stock  
market, as he has done in the past, added Mintz. 
</P>
<P>
	In his testimony, Greenspan said that while it is unclear that  
the stock market's current high prices represent a speculative 
``bubble,'' an end to Wall Street's long ride needn't have 
catastrophic consequences for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Other news Thursday underscored the country's economic growth.  
The Labor Department reported the number of Americans filing new 
claims for unemployment benefits fell by 28,000 last week to 
297,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's trade deficit, meanwhile, held steady at a record  
high of $18.9 billion in April, matching the March figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq shares initially stumbled, affecting other technology  
stocks, after the computer maker predicted it would lose up to 15 
cents a share in the second quarter, compared to a profit of 20 
cents expected by Wall Street analysts. The company also announced 
a restructuring. But Compaq went on to recover, ending up 3/8 at 22 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Other technology stocks were mixed. Dell Computer rose 11/16 to  
36 1/2 but IBM fell 1/2 to 120 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Internet stocks, At Home rose 3 15/16 to 51 5/16, while  
eBay fell 2 to 146 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered declining by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 1,845 up, 1,199 down and 520 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE composite volume totaled 854.28 million shares, vs. 968.94  
million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.90 to 636.07, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 3.77 to 768.69.

<HEADLINE> Tom McKnight's Excellent Adventure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Call this ``Tom McKnight's Excellent  
Adventure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In April, the 44-year-old father of three took his bag to  
Augusta National. A couple of weeks ago, he teed it up at Royal 
County Down in Northern Ireland. Today, he tries to cope with the 
treacherous greens at Pinehurst No. 2. In August, he'll feel the 
Pacific breeze at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've taken a whole list of courses you might want to play in a  
lifetime,'' said McKnight, taking part in his first U.S. Open, 
``and I've done them all in one year,'' 
</P>
<P>
	All of this was made possible by his runner-up finish in the  
U.S. Amateur championship last year. Taking on a bevy of big, young 
hitters, McKnight defeated Spanish phenom Sergio Garcia in the 
semifinals before losing to Hank Kuehne in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight earned an automatic bid to the Masters, where he  
surprisingly made the cut. He took his first trip to the British 
Amateur, held at Royal County Down. He qualified for a spot in this 
week's U.S. Open at Pinehurst. He'll make a return trip to the U.S. 
Amateur at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's been a dream of mine to play here,'' said  
McKnight, who joined a practice round foursome that also included 
Ben Crenshaw, Curtis Strange and Mark Calcavecchia. ``The man 
upstairs has smiled on me a lot this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A one-time professional hopeful, McKnight's career on the links  
seemed doomed when he fell on his left arm during a pickup 
basketball game in 1980. He was carried off the court on a 
stretcher and spent a couple of days in the hospital. A bone was 
shattered, his elbow dislocated. 
</P>
<P>
	To this day, the results of the injury are still clearly  
evident. 
</P>
<P>
	``See how crooked it is,'' he said Wednesday, holding out his  
disparate arms to reveal a limb that looks like a twisting road on 
a map. ``I still can't turn it all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors told McKnight that he would never have the flexibility  
to compete at an elite level. So, he reclaimed his amateur status 
in 1984 and took over his father's business, running a petroleum 
distributorship and a string of convenience stores in his native 
Virginia and North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight continued to play a lot of golf, competing in 14 U.S.  
Amateurs -- he defeated both David Duval and Stewart Cink in 1988 
before losing in the third round -- and nine Mid-Amateur 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been playing the last 10 to 15 years against all these  
young kids who were coming through on their way to the pros,'' 
McKnight said. ``It's nice to be able to compete at that level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He finally broke through last year, beating Sergio Garcia 3 and  
1 after the Spanish teen-ager knocked off defending U.S. Amateur 
champion Matt Kuchar in the quarterfinals. McKnight lost to Kuehne 
2 and 1 in the finals at Oak Hill, but the second-place showing was 
still good enough for a Masters invitation. 
</P>
<P>
	For two nights at Augusta, he bunked in the famed Crow's Nest  
like a college freshman, joined by Kuehne and Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just looked at it as three golfers up there,'' said  
McKnight, whose senior child, 20-year-old Tee, is a year older than 
Garcia. ``I don't think they looked at me like their dad or 
something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After finishing up his practice round, Kuehne said he looks at  
McKnight like any other promising amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom is a great friend of mine,'' said Kuehne, who plans to  
turn pro on Monday. ``He is a great player, that's all there is to 
it. He hits it down the middle and makes a lot of putts. He's had a 
lot of success lately because he's been playing courses that fit 
his game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tee McKnight was planning to handle the bag for his dad during  
today's opening round, then he'll pass off the duty to his 
17-year-old brother, Jay, on Friday. If dad makes the cut, they'll 
split up the duties on the weekend, just like they did at the 
Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is awesome,'' said Tee McKnight, a senior at the  
University of Virginia, borrowing a line from Bill and Ted. 
``People are realizing now how good he is. The Amateur did wonders 
for his confidence. That's why he's playing so well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McKnight has thought about resuming his professional career on  
the Senior Tour when he turns 50, but he hasn't made that decision 
yet. While his children -- he also has a 14-year-old daughter, Tara 
-- all will be grown, he's got to consider the demands on his 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only time will tell,'' McKnight said. ``Just because I've had  
a few good tournaments at the right time is not going to change the 
way I look at things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No need to ruin an Excellent Adventure.

<HEADLINE> Rivera Declares Drug War Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's not hard to find NBC's $5 million man,  
Geraldo Rivera, on television. You just have to know where to look. 
</P>
<P>
	Try the ``Today'' show, where Rivera's action-packed reports on  
the Kosovo Liberation Army first aired this month. But don't try 
the ``NBC Nightly News,'' where a Rivera report has never been 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
	Try prime time this Sunday, when Rivera's documentary, ``Drug  
Bust, The Longest War,'' airs at 8 p.m. But don't try ``Dateline 
NBC,'' where Rivera believes he's not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Better yet, try cable, where MSNBC repeatedly ran the Kosovo  
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A year and a half into his lucrative new contract with NBC, the  
former syndicated talk-show host still doesn't feel completely 
accepted at the Peacock Network. He may get more camera time than 
anyone else in the company, but he yearns for the time he doesn't 
get. It's a strange dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the drug special.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the third special report to emerge from Rivera's  
documentary unit, and he reaches the pointed conclusion that the 
decades-long war on drugs was in large part a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lost the war on drugs,'' he said. ``It's like Vietnam.  
At some point we've got to say we have lost and no one has had the 
courage to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera talks to a veteran drug smuggler and a U.S. Customs  
inspector about efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the 
country. ``Drug Bust'' also examines why addicts who want help have 
an easier time finding drugs than treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the war on drugs was declared in 1971, it has cost $300  
billion of taxpayer money, and drugs remain readily available, 
Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A generation of politicians has been corrupted,'' Rivera said.  
``This has been a cancer on the souls of the supplier nations. 
America is this huge, voracious vacuum cleaner sucking up all the 
illicit narcotics the world can produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike news reports, documentaries generally take a clear point  
of view. ``Drug Bust'' is particularly provocative. Rivera's 
eagerness to say how he feels -- also shown in his spirited defense 
of President Clinton during the impeachment trial -- probably has 
something to do with the arms-length relationship he has with some 
of NBC's old guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera doesn't think his opinionated nature is all that unusual  
in network news. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't think the reporters at NBC had opinions during  
the impeachment crisis, the vast majority of them in diametric 
opposition to mine, then I don't think you were watching,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since signing his NBC deal in November 1997, Rivera has been  
rankled at not having any reports aired on ``NBC Nightly News,'' 
the network's flagship show anchored by Tom Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Brokaw said of Rivera: ``He does what he does,  
and I do what I do. There's very little common ground between us. 
That doesn't mean he doesn't have the right to do what he does.'' 
Brokaw hasn't talked much about his colleague since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Rivera's feelings were hurt anew by the treatment of his  
Kosovo reports. He hoped they were good enough for ``Nightly'' to 
seek them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The writing is on the wall, the sky and the ground,'' Rivera  
said. ``It's just not going to happen. I don't think it will ever 
happen. If that piece didn't get on, I don't think they'd use 
anything. I know that `Dateline' and `Nightly' are like the country 
club in my neighborhood. I'm not allowed in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network's only comment: ``Each NBC News program makes its  
own editorial decisions,'' said spokeswoman Alex Constantinople. 
Privately, NBC executives note that ``Dateline NBC'' has run 
Rivera's work in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera said frustration with his situation is partly why he's  
considering a daily radio talk show. ``The motivation, honestly, 
was, `OK, you don't want me, I know a lot of other people who 
do,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If his role at NBC continues to evolve, Rivera said, he'd be  
much less inclined to seek out the radio job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a real need for an aggressive, populist  
alternative to the Rush Limbaughs and Oliver Norths of the world,'' 
he said. ``It's time for liberals to stop being embarrassed about 
their political philosophy. Having said all that, I probably don't 
have the time to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>

	VANISHED: ABC News tonight begins a six-week summer series,  
``Vanished,'' that traces true stories of mysterious 
disappearances. In tonight's debut, Connie Chung reports on Jay 
Carsey, a college president, who walked out on a stagnant marriage 
and budget crisis at work, telling no one where he was headed. He 
ended up buying a bar in El Paso, starting a new life, and then 
recently disappeared again. Future episodes deal with a woman's 
10-year search for her missing son, revisits the kidnapping of 
Charles Lindbergh's infant son, and traces the fate of the boat 
featured in Sebastian Junger's best-selling book, ``The Perfect 
Storm.'' The program airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. EDT.

	House OKs Posting of 10 Commandments  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House voted today to allow the Ten  
Commandments to be posted in schools and other government 
buildings. By 248-180, lawmakers approved Rep. Robert Aderholt's 
amendment to a juvenile crime bill that would allow states to 
decide whether to permit such displays on government property. The 
amendment, Aderholt said, was a ``first step'' for government in 
reinstilling the value of human life in children influenced by 
violent culture.

	U.K. Official: Serbs Killed 10,000  
</P>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Gruesome accounts of almost routine  
torture and death emerged in Kosovo today, and a British official 
estimated that Serb forces killed more than 10,000 people during 
two months of war and ethnic violence. At least 10,000 ethnic 
Albanians -- and probably many more -- were killed by Serbs in more 
than 100 massacres even while NATO bombed Yugoslavia during the 
78-day air campaign that ended last week, the British foreign 
office said. Officials from Moscow and Washington met in Finland 
again today to try to resolve the role of Russian peacekeepers in 
Kosovo. Moscow is insisting on a separate sector for its 
peacekeepers; NATO says that won't happen though President Clinton 
predicted a ``successful conclusion.'' Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright joined the Finland talks today.

state has been conducting propulsion tests on a long-range 
Taepodong-2 missile, Japanese national broadcaster NHK reported,

operating subsidies by 2003, hopes planned service improvements 
will hike revenues by 85 million in a three-year period. ``We will 
treat our customers as valued guests..., so they will choose to 
ride our trains over and over again,'' said George Warrington,

that his cancer had reached its final stages. The cardinal had 
asked for renewed prayers. Hume, widely respected by people of all 
faiths, became one of the most influential figures in British 
public life after his appointment as Archbishop of Westminster in

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Belgian government said today it  
was dropping its nationwide ban on some soft drinks produced by 
Coca-Cola Co. but keeping the ban on Coke, Fanta and Sprite pending 
further investigation into what caused dozens of Coke drinkers to

flawless 3-under 67 in the rain at Pinehurst No. 2 today to tie 
playing partner Phil Mickelson for the early lead in the U.S. Open. 
Showing no ill effects from burns he suffered on his hand last 
week, Duval didn't make a bogey all day and birdied two of the last 
four holes to pull even with Mickelson and share the clubhouse 
lead. Mickelson, seeking his first major championship while 
anxiously awaiting the birth of his first child, made five birdies 
and made a 10-foot par putt on the last hole to retain his share of 
the lead.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grains and soybean futures were mostly lower  
Thursday on the Chicago Board of Trade as investors awaited 
additional details on harvesting and growing weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybeans early in the session were supported by private

	House Exploring Social Security Plan

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The public political conflicts that often  
block efforts to fix Social Security can be avoided if Republicans 
and Democrats work out their differences behind closed doors, a 
leading GOP lawmaker says. The House Ways and Means Committee is 
meeting in private tomorrow to begin exploring possible compromise, 
said the panel's chairman, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas. Earlier this 
week, he said the bipartisan caucus is a real breakthrough that 
could lead to action this year on Social Security.

a crowd in a state that is politically crucial and home to a 
growing high-tech industry that he'd ``invest aggressively'' to 
create information-age jobs. Gore brought his economic message to 
New Hampshire, site of the nation's first presidential primary. The

	NEW YORK (AP) -- A retelling of ``Lolita'' from the nymphet's  
point of view will be published in the United States under an 
agreement with author Vladimir Nabokov's son, who had called the 
new book a rip-off. Under the deal with new publisher Foxrock Inc., 
Dmitri Nabokov will write a preface, and author Pia Pera will write 
an afterword to the English-language U.S. edition. Both will 
receive 5 percent of royalties from the edition, The New York Times 
reported today. In November, publisher Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux had 
settled a copyright infringement lawsuit filed by Dmitri Nabokov by 
canceling plans to publish ``Lo's Diary'' this summer.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told  
Congress today that inflation remains in check, but he also voiced 
worry that forces of imbalance in the economy could stunt its 
continuing growth. In order to keep the economy growing, ``it is 
useful to preempt forces of imbalance before they threaten economic 
stability,'' Greenspan said. Sometimes that is not possible because 
the future ``can be too opaque to penetrate,'' the Fed chairman 
said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit held steady at a

seeing relief from a global financial crisis that has depressed 
overseas markets. The Commerce Department said today that the April 
trade deficit was $18.9 billion -- matching a revised estimate of 
the deficit in March. The government's original estimate had pegged 
the March deficit at $19.7 billion. The new, lower March estimate, 
however, was still a record that was tied in April.

his pregnant wife began going into labor, made three birdies in his 
first five holes and held the early lead with about a third of the 
field on the course at 2-under after seven holes. Jack Nicklaus, 
playing in his first Open since having hip replacement surgery, 
bogeyed five of his first six holes, while Japan's Jumbo Ozaki took 
a quadruple bogey on the 11th hole and was 10-over through 13.

<HEADLINE> Bank Opposes Filipino Airline Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- The U.S. Export-Import Bank asked  
Manila's Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday to reverse 
its approval of Philippine Airlines' rehabilitation plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan for the ailing carrier was approved by the SEC on May  
17 and upheld on June 7 after airline chairman Lucio Tan 
successfully raised $200 million in fresh capital for the airline -- 
a key condition of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline owes the Ex-Im Bank $350 million, or 16 percent of  
the airline's total debt of more than $2.2 billion, making the U.S. 
financial institution its second biggest creditor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ex-Im Bank has been a critic of the rehabilitation plan and  
of PAL's present management, led by Tan, one of the Philippines' 
richest men. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ex-Im Bank initiated moves in May to try to recover four  
Boeing 747-400s it helped finance for the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In its motion Thursday, it said the SEC has not shown proof that  
it secured the approval of a majority of the airline's creditors 
for the recovery plan. 
</P>
<P>
	It also questioned the legal procedures adopted by the SEC in  
handling the carrier's rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Philippine National Bank also asked the SEC to  
dismiss its approval of PAL's rehabilitation plan, arguing that 
foreign investors were treated more favorably than their local 
counterparts in terms of loan repayments. 
</P>
<P>
	PNB, one of the country's largest banks, has the biggest  
exposure of any of the airline's domestic creditors. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for some token payments, PAL has been unable to service  
its debt since June 1998, when a pilots' strike and the 
debilitating effects of Asia's financial crisis crippled its 
operations.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Linked to Columbine Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A man who allegedly introduced the two  
Columbine High School killers to a man who sold them a 
semiautomatic gun has been arrested, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Duran, 22, is accused of providing a gun to a minor, a  
charge that carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison. He is 
also accused of possessing a dangerous or illegal weapon, which 
carries up to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran was released Thursday night after posting $15,000 bond.  
His lawyer did not return telephone messages. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, stormed Columbine on  
April 20, hurling explosives and blasting away with four guns. They 
killed 13 people and wounded 23 students before committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris and Klebold used a semiautomatic TEC DC-9 that was  
purchased from Mark Manes, 22, and three other guns that had been 
legally purchased by Klebold's girlfriend, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duran worked with Harris and Klebold at a pizza parlor, and  
authorities said he is suspected of putting the two in contact with 
Manes at a gun show in January. Duran allegedly delivered part of 
the students' payment for the TEC DC-9 and collected $125 for 
helping them. 
</P>
<P>
	Manes is also charged with providing a weapon to a minor. His  
attorney has said Manes did not know why the students wanted the 
gun.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Hearings Open Anew </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House committee opened a new round of  
campaign finance hearings Thursday, but Democrats criticized them 
as a ``sham'' designed to delay adoption of proposals most 
lawmakers endorsed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are we doing? Why are we here?'' asked Maryland Rep.  
Steny Hoyer, senior Democrat on the House Administration Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The House passed a campaign finance bill last August after  
numerous hearings and more than 50 hours of floor debate, Hoyer 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
	He said additional hearings, planned into July, will waste time.  
``It is time for us to move on and not to further delay addressing 
this critical issue,'' Hoyer said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. John Boehner, R-Ohio, who chaired the hearing, said it  
was an ``important first step in the orderly committee process that 
will help fulfill the speaker's promise to bring campaign reform 
legislation to the House floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised a vote on the issue  
in September. But supporters of a proposal passed last year by the 
House fear that it won't leave the Senate enough time to act before 
Congress retires for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats are rounding up support for a petition to bypass the  
committee and force the issue to the floor for a vote. The effort, 
which requires signatures from 218 members, has been signed by 202, 
including six moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two dozen reform proposals are pending.  
</P>
<P>
	Last August, the House voted 252-179 in favor of a bill that,  
among other changes, would eliminate what is known as ``soft 
money'' -- unlimited and unregulated donations that the political 
parties solicit to finance political activities. The bill also 
would have regulated issue advertising and expanded disclosure 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on that bill, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays,  
R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., came only after a similar 
petition neared the 218 signature mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, however, failed to reach a final vote in the  
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan criticized the new hearings as an ``insult'' to the  
American people, saying that ``this bill has literally been talked 
to death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boehner countered that Democrats were ``trying to silence  
meaningful examination of the campaign reform issue by rushing it 
to the floor.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Keeps Vietnam Crypt Empty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Tomb of the Unknowns will probably never  
again contain a symbolic victim of the Vietnam War, the Pentagon 
said Thursday. A new inscription on the crypt will instead honor 
those who remain missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen ``has determined not to inter  
remains in the Tomb unless and until it can be assured in 
perpetuity that the remains of the American serviceman would be 
forever unidentifiable,'' said Rudy de Leon, undersecretary of 
defense for personnel and readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific advances, particularly the use of DNA matching  
techniques, makes it at least possible to eventually identify all 
the remains the United States has collected so far, de Leon said. 
That means there are no suitable unknown remains to substitute for 
those of a pilot whose exhumed body was identified last year, 
defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vietnam War crypt at the Tomb of the Unknowns at Arlington  
National Cemetery has remained empty since the body of Air Force 
1st Lt. Michael J. Blassie was removed in May last year. The Tomb 
was opened under pressure from Blassie family members who believed 
his was the body laid to rest there 14 years earlier as a symbolic 
unknown war victim. 
</P>
<P>
	Blassie's body was identified using DNA technology, and he was  
reburied by his family. 
</P>
<P>
	On National POW/MIA Day Sept. 17, Cohen will dedicate a new  
inscription on the crypt cover that will read: ``Honoring and 
keeping faith with America's missing servicemen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are still more than 2,000 Americans listed as missing from  
the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 sets of bones, teeth and other remains await  
identification in the Army's Central Identification Laboratory in 
Hawaii, and the United States continues to receive new remains from 
the Vietnam War, as crash sites are excavated and the Vietnamese 
government hands over recovered bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that as long as there are living relatives of some of  
our missing men, there will always be a hope that remains that are 
now at the lab will be identifiable at some point,'' de Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tomb also holds remains of unidentified soldiers from World  
War I, World War II and the Korean conflict.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Exploit Microsoft Flaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A small software company is giving away a tool  
that lets computer hackers exploit a major security flaw in a 
Microsoft program that runs about 1.4 million Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The security threat could expose personal data such as credit  
card numbers to thieves, although no such attacks on Web sites have 
yet been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's antagonist, a company called eEye, said it released  
the tool on the Internet because Microsoft wasn't acting fast 
enough to fix the problem. But Microsoft and many people discussing 
the controversy on the Internet Thursday decried the tactic as a 
dangerous publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people have a problem with Microsoft that is one thing, but  
don't arm the hackers with tools to vandalize Microsoft's 
customers,'' said Michael Spencer, a contributor to an Internet 
message board who identified himself as a programmer in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft's Windows NT Internet Information Server runs Web  
sites by Disney, barnesandnoble.com, the Nasdaq Stock Market and 
many others. It is one of three major programs, along with rival 
products from Netscape and Apache, that are used on the vast 
majority of Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The security problem was deemed serious enough to prompt a  
warning on the Internet Wednesday by the Computer Emergency 
Response Team at Carnegie Mellon University, the same 
government-sponsored group that battles computer viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	eEye reported the flaw to Microsoft last week. Microsoft began  
developing a remedy, but released a temporary ``patch'' to 
deactivate the defect on Tuesday when eEye publicized its discovery 
and posted the hacking tool. Microsoft said Thursday a permanent 
repair for the program was ``imminent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The flaw involves a mechanism that allows people to change their  
passwords for using Web sites, and could be exploited by computer 
hackers with only basic programming ability to take control over or 
crash a site. 
</P>
<P>
	No such intrusions, however, have been reported to either  
Microsoft or the Pittsburgh-based Computer Emergency Response Team. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers have only recently grown comfortable giving credit  
card numbers over the Internet following assurances by Web 
merchants that they are safe. As a result, online shopping has been 
booming since the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts noted Thursday that confidential data gathered by many  
Web site operators is usually scrambled and stored on a different 
computer than the one that runs a site. 
</P>
<P>
	``If someone is running a vulnerable version of (the program),  
it's possible that any transaction taking place over the Web could 
be observed by an intruder, altered by intruder, or denied by 
intruder,'' said Shawn Hernan, a member of the Carnegie Mellon 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this vulnerability doesn't allow someone to go and get all  
the information'' a consumer may be providing, said Hernan. Still, 
he added, ``this software is widely deployed, and that makes this a 
serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	eEye said on its Web site that ``This is a very serious hole and  
needs to be given the attention it deserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending its decision to go public and release the hacking  
tool, the company said, ``If our team starts hiding the facts, 
we'll be no better than a software vendor that rushes insecure 
products to market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft expressed dismay at eEye's moves, saying it was  
standard protocol in the software industry to wait until a full 
remedy is ready for distribution before making a security risk 
public. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know why they did that. All it does is put an  
extraordinary number of people at risk,'' said Jason Garms, the 
lead product manager for Windows NT security. 
</P>
<P>
	``I vehemently reject the notion that we were dragging our heels  
on this. The absolute minimum expected to fix these things is two 
weeks,'' said Garms. The eEye tool ``enabled even nontechnical 
person to attack any Web site running this software.''

<HEADLINE> Knicks Fall to Spurs, Foul Trouble </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Maybe what Larry Johnson should have done was  
come out, hit a couple of shots and take the rest of the night off, 
the way Willis Reed did for the New York Knicks in another NBA 
Finals 26 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Knicks' wounded star picked up two quick fouls in  
the first 2 1/2 minutes of Game 1 against San Antonio, touching off a 
player rotation crisis for coach Jeff Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Knicks already short-handed because of Patrick Ewing's  
season-ending torn Achilles' tendon, Van Gundy's substitution 
pattern follows precise guidelines. In Wednesday's 89-77 loss, it 
was thrown out of whack by whistles. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, nursing a sprained right knee, was a non-factor,  
playing just 21 minutes and getting as many fouls (five) as points. 
He took just three shots and had only one rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought gave us a good effort,'' Van Gundy said. ``He gave  
us what he could. We just have to fight this as far as injuries and 
come back strong on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as quickly as Johnson got his two personals, Marcus Camby  
had three. With their playing time limited by foul trouble, the 
Knicks were caught in a corner. They managed just 10 points in the 
second period, the second-lowest single quarter total in NBA Finals 
history. That took them from six points ahead to eight behind and 
they never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into foul trouble early, something I'm not used to,''  
Camby said. ``I picked up my first foul in seven seconds. Then they 
seemed to be coming and coming. I got some cheap fouls. I know my 
teammates need me to be on the court, so I've got to use better 
judgment on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston, who scored 19, said he thought the Knicks were a  
little frantic, especially in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just kind of lost our poise a little bit on the offensive  
end instead of passing the ball to each other, being a little more 
unselfish and taking the shots we need to take,'' he said. ``I 
think we lost a little rhythm, we got some guys in foul trouble. We 
weren't able to stay disciplined on the defensive end and we lost 
our poise on the defensive end, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Thomas gave New York a lift with 13 points and 16 rebounds.  
He thought the two quick fouls on Johnson had set a negative tone 
for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to keep our heads up,'' he said. ``It's just one  
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also the first time in this season's playoffs that the  
Knicks have lost the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it makes us more hungry,'' Houston said. ``You can't  
expect to go out and win every Game 1 just because it's been done 
in the past. It's still a seven-game series and I think we're even 
more hungry to go out Friday and learn from what we did wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Duval's Burns Make Headlines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- No matter how hot his golf game gets,  
David Duval does not want to open the newspaper this weekend and 
see headlines about him ``burning'' up the course at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Also high on his list of banned phrases: ``Duval strikes while  
irons are hot.'' And especially: ``Duval wakes up to smell the 
coffee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a reason why, although Duval doesn't find it  
particularly funny. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Friday, while boiling water for coffee, Duval reached for a  
teapot on a gas stove and burned his right thumb and forefinger. It 
might have been the most embarrassing domestic boo-boo by an 
athlete since baseball's Glenallen Hill turned up on the disabled 
list with carpet burns, bumps and bruises. Hill's explanation? He 
dreamt he was being chased by spiders and fell down some stairs 
while sleepwalking. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval didn't have to own up to anything nearly that silly, but  
he is understandably tired of telling the story. And yet, even 
while insisting the burns were a non-issue, he still had tape on 
both fingers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some tenderness in my forefinger,'' he said, ``but  
nothing bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	We can probably take Duval at his word, especially since he  
backed it up with a 67 over Pinehurst No. 2 that left him in a 
four-way tie for the opening-day lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The round was typical Duval in at least one other sense. Not  
only was it largely free of physical pain, by missing just four of 
14 fairways and hitting 15 greens, Duval made sure that stress 
wasn't much of a factor, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pretty pleased with all of it today,'' he said. ``I  
drove the ball well and hit my iron shots where I was trying to. 
I'd be very content to do that for three more days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forget the fingers for a moment. What made Duval's round seem  
even more impressive were the distractions going on around him. His 
threesome included father-to-be Phil Mickelson, who had a beeper 
stashed in his golf bag alongside the scoring clubs he cleverly 
wielded while cobbling together a 67 of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try not to have to do those things,'' Duval said, apparently  
referring to Mickelson's scrambling and not his impending 
fatherhood. ``I find it to be less stressful. To accomplish that, 
obviously you have to hit the ball well and I did that today. So I 
very much enjoyed the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether he really expected to do so, Duval wouldn't say. The  
burns prevented him from practicing during the weekend and limited 
him to working on his short game Monday. Then along came Tom Loss, 
a Seattle doctor who moonlights as a U.S. Golf Association rules 
official, who convinced Duval to lance the blisters on both 
fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Good thing, that. Because while Duval came to Pinehurst without  
expectations for his play, he might have been the only one. He's 
won 11 tournaments in the last 17 months, which makes him the 
hottest player in the game at the moment. But since none of those 
wins has come in major championships, it also makes Duval, along 
with Mickelson and Scotsman Colin Montgomerie, a contender for best 
player never to win a major. 
</P>
<P>
	If Duval hadn't been able to compete here -- let alone practice --  
because of a brush with a teapot, he would have never been able to 
live down the embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	It would have been comparable to Irish miler Eamonn Coghlan  
pulling out just before the 1980 Olympics because a dog bit him 
during a training run in a Dublin park. Or former Mets pitcher Bob 
Ojeda missing most of a season after severing a finger (later 
reattached by doctors) while trimming a hedge. Or even boxer Julio 
Cesar Chavez getting head-butted by his 4-year-old son just days 
before a scheduled fight with Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	And yet, despite the 67, Duval could not make talk of the burned  
fingers go away completely. 
</P>

stoves.''

<HEADLINE> US Olympic Cup for American Audience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- For many U.S. Olympic hopefuls, the road to  
Sydney will include a welcome pit stop this summer at San Diego's 
arenas, pools, beaches and fields. 
</P>
<P>
	A year before the Summer Games, part of the world will come here  
for the inaugural U.S. Olympic Cup Sept. 9-12. Americans will face 
top international competition in women's basketball, men's and 
women's swimming, women's softball, boxing and men's and women's 
beach volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a great opportunity for us American athletes to be  
able to race the best athletes from around the world, in a venue in 
our back yard,'' swimmer Ashley Tappin said Thursday during a news 
conference announcing the Olympic preview. ``You can't beat that. 
One year out from the Olympics, we'll pretty much take any 
opportunity we can. 
</P>
<P>
	``Secondly, I'd like to say it's also a great opportunity for us  
American athletes to be able to show the American audience just how 
strong we're going to be this summer and next. Because we're going 
to whup on 'em this summer, and we're going to do it even more in 
12 months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tappin, 24, was on the winning 400-meter freestyle relay team at  
Barcelona in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Cup replaces the U.S. Olympic Festivals, which  
folded after 1995 because they became too unwieldy and costly to 
the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``This event may be a little shorter in quantity but richer in  
quality than those U.S. Olympic Festivals in the past,'' said Dave 
Ogrean, a USOC marketing executive. ``This is going to be a big 
step on the road to Sydney for a lot of our athletes. This is an 
event that is really, really needed by our athletes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the expected highlights: WNBA players fresh off their  
season jumping into international competition, U.S boxers fighting 
the Russians and the United States versus Australia in softball. 
The United States, which won the first Olympic softball tournament 
in 1996, will have picked its team the previous weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	The beach volleyball tournament includes a previously scheduled  
Olympic qualifier. Karch Kiraly, the only volleyball player to win 
three Olympic gold medals, likely will compete as the top eight 
American teams play the top eight international pairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The women's basketball field will include Australia, Brazil and  
Poland, while Canada and New Zealand are the other softball teams 
due to compete. Japan and Canada are tentatively scheduled to 
compete against the United States in swimming, while boxers from 
Mexico and Ukraine are due to join the Russians in fighting 
Americans in eight weight classes. 
</P>
<P>
	Basketball, swimming and softball will be held at UC San Diego,  
boxing at the Concourse downtown and beach volleyball at Mission 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a great event for the U.S. boxers,'' Larry Mosley, a  
19-year-old welterweight from Los Angeles, said. ``We've been 
getting dominated by Cuba and Russia, so this is a great 
opportunity to get the experience that we need for 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 336 athletes are expected, and ESPN2 is scheduled to  
televise 6 1/2 hours of competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who can't go to Sydney for the Olympics, come here and  
watch this,'' Tappin, who lives in Laguna Beach, said. ``It's going 
to be a mini-Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Airlines Announce Service Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Buffeted by customer complaints and threatened  
by congressional action, the airlines industry today announced a 
package of voluntary measures to improve passenger service. 
</P>
<P>
	They include ensuring that airlines tell customers of the lowest  
available price, notify people of delays and cancellations, provide 
prompt ticket refunds, handle bumped passengers with fairness and 
meet customers' essential needs during long on-aircraft delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard the bell ring, we have felt the whip,'' said Gerald  
Greenwald, chairman of United Airlines and of the Air Transport 
Association Executive Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures were prompted by several highly publicized  
incidents last winter when passengers were made to sit on runways 
for hours without access to food or restrooms. They followed 
several months of negotiations among the industry, the Department 
of Transportation and members of Congress who had introduced 
legislation that would have mandated airline companies to take 
steps to improve service. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Commerce  
Committee and sponsor of a ``passenger rights'' bill, said the 
industry had taken ``some very significant steps.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said they have yet to work out the issue of notifying  
passengers of overbooking and he would still seek legislation 
requiring the Transportation Department's inspector general to 
monitor the industry to make sure they were complying with their 
promises. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., co-sponsor of the passenger rights  
bill, said the industry measures were inadequate and he would still 
push for legislation. ``This was the airline industry asking the 
passengers to accept a wink and a nod,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Transportation Committee chairman, Rep. Bud Shuster,  
R-Pa., said the airlines' approach was a ``step in the right 
direction and I will take a serious look at their proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he added: ``I don't believe airline service will improve  
dramatically until we have real competition in the airline 
industry.''

<HEADLINE> L.A.'s Perez Doesn't Regret Tantrum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- If only Carlos Perez got his hits on the  
field. 
</P>
<P>
	After getting booed off the field, the Los Angeles pitcher  
picked up a bat and took 13 severe swings Wednesday night that 
destroyed a couple of water coolers in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the first time it's happened,'' Perez said Thursday,  
a night after the Dodgers' 6-5 win over Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez left after walking the bases loaded in the fourth inning.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you get mad like that and everything goes away, so I  
just grabbed a bat and hit a cooler. I felt better and I slept 
good. I also talked to my family, and that made me calm down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, 2-8 with a 7.38 ERA in 11 starts and one relief  
appearance, will have some extra time to calm down. The Dodgers are 
off Monday, and manager Davey Johnson is skipping his turn in the 
rotation. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as I get my mechanics back, I know I'm going to get my  
fastball back,'' said Perez, who signed a $15.5 million, three-year 
contract during the offseason. ``And that's one of the big problems 
I have right now. I've been watching the video for the last year 
and my delivery has been fine, but right now there's a big 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perez, who met privately with Johnson on Thursday, said he has  
no regrets about venting his frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're going to hit something, grab a bat,'' Perez said.  
``I remember a couple of years ago when John Wetteland and I were 
in Montreal. He kicked the garbage can, broke his finger and missed 
almost two months. And that's not going to happen to me. I'm not 
going to use my hands or my legs, because I don't want to get 
hurt.''

<HEADLINE> Differences on Commandment Wording </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Both Jews and Christians have Ten Commandments, but there is no  
agreement on what wording and numbering to follow. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bible itself contains two versions, one in Exodus 20:1-17  
and a slightly different one in Deuteronomy 5:6-21. There are also 
various English translations from the original Hebrew to choose 
from. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover, there are five numbering systems because the  
denominations differ on what to include in the First and Tenth 
Commandments. 
</P>
<P>
	Judaism counts ``I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of  
the land of Egypt ...'' as No. 1, while most Christians consider 
that a preface and list Judaism's No. 2 as their No. 1: ``You shall 
have no other gods before me.'' Other Christians say No. 1 consists 
of both clauses. 
</P>
<P>
	Next comes the commandment against idolatry (``graven image''),  
which Jews combine with an admonition about ``no other gods,'' as 
do Catholics and Lutherans but not other Christians. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the next seven commandments -- taking the Lord's name in  
vain, keeping the Sabbath, honoring one's mother and father, 
killing, adultery, stealing, and bearing false witness -- all groups 
divide up them up identically but apply different numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tenth Commandment of Jews and most Protestants is the entire  
``thou shalt not covet'' passage. But Catholics and Lutherans list 
two ``thou shalt not covet'' commandments: one against coveting 
your neighbor's wife, and one against coveting your neighbor's 
property.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls on Greenspan Comments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against most major currencies  
Thursday as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments 
suggesting an interest rate increase may be coming were in line 
with market expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0339, up  
from $1.0305 late Wednesday. The dollar fell to 119.25 Japanese yen 
from 120.43 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan testified before Congress and suggested that the  
central bank was still considering raising interest rates despite 
few signs of inflation. Just a day earlier, the government reported 
that the consumer price index held steady in May after a 0.7 
percent rise in April. But Greenspan said the Fed may take 
``pre-emptive'' action to protect the economy from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
	The currency markets have already been expecting a modest rise  
in rates at the Fed's policy-making meeting later this month, and 
the inflation report relieved some observers who feared larger rate 
hikes were coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Gargano, managing director of currency derivatives at First  
National Bank in Charlotte, N.C., said Greenspan's comments 
suggested a modest rate hike of perhaps a quarter percentage point 
is likely. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said a new private survey of business sentiment  
in Germany was unexpectedly strong and suggested the German 
manufacturing sector may be improving. That helped the euro recover 
as it traded as low as $1.0288 during the day, only slightly above 
its record low of $1.0260 set June 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Against other currencies, the dollar was quoted at 1.5427 Swiss  
francs, down from 1.5483, and 1.4632 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4599. The British pound rose to $1.5926 from $1.5883. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8918 
German marks, down from 1.8979; 6.3452 French francs, down from 
6.3654; and 1,872.66 Italian lire, down from 1,879.70.

<HEADLINE> Cards Option Drew, Disable Painter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The St. Louis Cardinals optioned rookie  
outfielder J.D. Drew, healthy after a rehab stint, to Triple-A 
Memphis on Thursday to allow him to continue to work on his stroke. 
</P>
<P>
	The Drew move was one of several on another busy day for the  
Cardinals. The team also announced that Shawon Dunston had dropped 
his appeal of a three-day suspension for charging the mound in Los 
Angeles earlier this season and placed left-hander Lance Painter on 
the 15-day disabled list with a strained shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunston had a meeting scheduled Friday with NL president Leonard  
Coleman from the May 23 incident that led to a bench-clearing 
brawl, and had been seeking to have the suspension reduced to two 
games. He began serving his time Thursday, perhaps because he's 
battling lingering hamstring problems anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``That might have something to do with it,'' manager Tony La  
Russa said. 
</P>
<P>
	Drew has recovered from a quadriceps injury and was batting .300  
with eight RBIs in 13 games at Memphis. He began the year hitting 
second in the order ahead of Mark McGwire and batted .230 with two 
homers and nine RBIs in 25 games with the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the team decided to skip Painter's scheduled  
Friday start due to a shoulder injury suffered in a checked swing. 
Painter, 0-4 with a 5.55 ERA, said the injury was not serious 
enough to put him out for 15 days, except that the Cardinals are 
now a bit shorthanded. 
</P>
<P>
	The team recalled right-hander Curtis King from Triple-A  
Memphis. King has pitched with the Cardinals parts of the last two 
seasons, and was 2-0 with a 3.53 ERA and two saves in 36 games last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a little vulnerable unless we get some innings from our  
rotation,'' La Russa said. ``Even without that, if we had gotten 
five straight complete games, we wouldn't have sent Paint out 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Mercker made his first start since May 11 Thursday night  
against the New York Mets and Juan Acevedo had his turn moved back 
a day to Friday because he dropped a 45-pound weight on his right 
toe after his last start. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really not as bad as what people would think,'' Painter  
said. ``I understand the reasoning behind it. It's really not a 
15-day injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Painter warmed up on Wednesday and threw fastballs and changeups  
without pain, but had some pain when he tried to throw breaking 
balls. He also developed a blister on his pitching thumb in his 
last start.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bush: Slicksters Made-for-TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore and George W. Bush entered the  
presidential sweepstakes this week with slick, made-for-television 
inaugural campaign trips that improved their footing atop the 
crowded field of White House candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Both accomplished their No. 1 goals.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore, the Democratic front-runner, distanced himself from his  
boss' personal transgressions while claiming credit for the Clinton 
administration's economic record. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the Republican governor of Texas, showed a deft hand at  
working crowds and issues -- easing doubts about his readiness as a 
candidate and potential president. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good week for both of them,'' said Stephen Hess of  
the Brookings Institute, a Washington think tank. ``They did well 
by doing no harm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their efforts left other presidential campaigns starving for  
attention as Gore and Bush solidified their money-raising and 
poll-rating prowess. 
</P>
<P>
	And it could get worse for the other candidates.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush supporters are predicting he will raise as much as $20  
million by the end of June, which would be 10 times as much as some 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the media, Gore and Bush seem more fixated on each other  
than their intra-party rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore alluded to Bush repeatedly in his Wednesday address,  
accusing a certain Republican of trying to ``duck the issue'' of 
abortion, doling out ``crumbs of compassion'' and shielding gun 
manufacturers from lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush poked fun at Gore for claiming the Internet as his  
invention. The Clinton administration ``did not invent 
prosperity,'' Bush said, ``any more than they invented the 
Internet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates' campaigns had some similarities.  
</P>
<P>
	Both men spoke briefly in Spanish to crowds that were almost  
exclusively white and English-speaking. Hispanics are a key voting 
bloc for 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	They both promoted the use of government money to help charities  
ease social problems such as hunger and housing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore explained the concept in clunky, bureaucratic terms,  
calling for a ``true politics of community by working more closely 
with faith-based organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a lyrical flourish, Bush ditched the phrase ``faith-based  
organizations'' for ``a quiet river of goodness and kindness that 
cuts through stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On style, the early edge went to Bush. He courted voters with a  
playful grin, a quick wit and a flirtatious style. 
</P>
<P>
	To say Bush shook hundreds of hands doesn't capture his first  
campaign foray. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider his visit to an Iowa charity. Bush was sitting in a  
circle of local women discussing their plight when one of them, 
Ruby Myles, stretched her hand toward the governor. Bush accepted 
her hand into his, squeezed it and didn't let go until the event 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	In New Hampshire, he spotted a baby in one crowd and alerted  
news photographers. ``I've always been a sucker for baby 
pictures!'' he shouted. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking the baby from his mother, Bush planted a big kiss on a  
chubby check. ``One more kiss!'' a photographer shouted. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush obliged.  
</P>
<P>
	``Turn around!'' another photographer instructed.  
</P>
<P>
	Bush obliged.  
</P>
<P>
	``Hold him up!''  
</P>
<P>
	Bush obliged.  
</P>
<P>
	The next day, Gore was in his hometown of Carthage, Tenn., when  
a small group of supporters coaxed him to the edge of a security 
area to shake hands. He made his way down a line of greeters until 
he reached a woman holding a baby. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore reached across the metal barrier.  
</P>
<P>
	And shook the baby's hand.  
</P>
<P>
	On policy, Gore brings a record of achievement as vice president  
and a fluency in topics ranging from Social Security to Russian 
politics. Bush's stump speech is less substantial than Gore's, and 
he is prone to stumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor called residents of Timor ``Timoreans'' in an  
interview between campaign stops with The New York Times. The 
proper term is Timorese. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet the Texas governor nimbly handled several difficult  
questions at a New Hampshire news conference. He put to rest some 
doubts, including those harbored by supporters, about his campaign 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also met with reporters, using a series of interviews to  
condemn President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He 
also predicting that he would not hesitate to disagree with the 
president in public. 
</P>
<P>
	Voicing a sentiment that could apply to Bush or Gore, the vice  
president said: ``Everything changes ... when I become a 
candidate.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices advanced in morning trading  
Friday, buoyed by gains on Wall Street. The dollar was lower 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 121.84 points,  
or 0.70 percent, to 17,592.29 by the end of the morning session. On 
Thursday, the index gained 260.27, or 1.51 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.66 yen in early dealings, down 0.38 yen  
from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 
119.25 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices rose on continued bullish  
sentiment supported by gains in U.S. stocks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although foreign investors have been actively buying, domestic  
institutional investors remain sellers of Japanese stocks,'' said 
Kunihiro Hatae, general manager at Tokyo Securities Co. ``It may 
take some time ... but the key index could try the 18000 level as 
early as next week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose  
56.68 points to close at 10,841.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks there were boosted on remarks by U.S. Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan, who indicated to Congress that only a 
modest interest rate rise may be in order to keep inflation 
well-tamed. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said that while inflation remains in check, the Fed  
should consider taking pre-emptive action to avert any threat to 
continued economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's  
interest rate policy, meets June 29-30. The Fed has warned recently 
it might raise interest rates to guard against a surge in 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was up 7.46 points, or 
0.53 percent, to 1,406.63. The TOPIX finished up 16.00 points, or 
1.16 percent, the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, fears of further market intervention by  
the Bank of Japan following its aggressive dollar-buying operation 
earlier this week kept the U.S. currency from falling further, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But they said investors were likely to test the dollar's low  
intra-day of 119.10 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 123.61 yen, down  
from 123.90 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was  
down to 1.6950 percent Friday morning after finishing Thursday with 
a yield of 1.725 percent, pushing its price up to 97.47 yen from 
97.22 yen a day earlier.

come out, hit a couple of shots and take the rest of the night off, 
the way Willis Reed did for the New York Knicks in another NBA 
Finals 26 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the Knicks' wounded star picked up two quick fouls in  
the first 2 1/2 minutes of Game 1 against San Antonio, touching off a 
player rotation crisis for coach Jeff Van Gundy. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Knicks already short-handed because of Patrick Ewing's  
season-ending torn Achilles' tendon, Van Gundy's substitution 
pattern follows precise guidelines. In Wednesday's 89-77 loss, it 
was thrown out of whack by whistles. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, nursing a sprained right knee, was a non-factor,  
playing just 21 minutes and getting as many fouls (five) as points. 
He took just three shots and had only one rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought gave us a good effort,'' Van Gundy said. ``He gave  
us what he could. We just have to fight this as far as injuries and 
come back strong on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost as quickly as Johnson got his two personals, Marcus Camby  
had three. With their playing time limited by foul trouble, the 
Knicks were caught in a corner. They managed just 10 points in the 
second period, the second-lowest single quarter total in NBA Finals 
history. That took them from six points ahead to eight behind and 
they never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got into foul trouble early, something I'm not used to,''  
Camby said. ``I picked up my first foul in seven seconds. Then they 
seemed to be coming and coming. I got some cheap fouls. I know my 
teammates need me to be on the court, so I've got to use better 
judgment on defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Houston, who scored 19, said he thought the Knicks were a  
little frantic, especially in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just kind of lost our poise a little bit on the offensive  
end instead of passing the ball to each other, being a little more 
unselfish and taking the shots we need to take,'' he said. ``I 
think we lost a little rhythm, we got some guys in foul trouble. We 
weren't able to stay disciplined on the defensive end and we lost 
our poise on the defensive end, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurt Thomas gave New York a lift with 13 points and 16 rebounds.  
He thought the two quick fouls on Johnson had set a negative tone 
for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to keep our heads up,'' he said. ``It's just one  
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also the first time in this season's playoffs that the  
Knicks have lost the opener. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it makes us more hungry,'' Houston said. ``You can't  
expect to go out and win every Game 1 just because it's been done 
in the past. It's still a seven-game series and I think we're even 
more hungry to go out Friday and learn from what we did wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Bald Eagle Is Off Endangered List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The American bald eagle, once near extinction,  
has made such a powerful comeback it will soon be removed from 
federal protection, perhaps formally on the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
	America's national bird, the bald eagle almost didn't survive as  
a species, killed off by ranchers and farmers and the pesticide 
DDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Interior Department officials said Thursday the eagle has  
recovered to the point that it soon will be taken off the list of 
species protected by the Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to take the bird off. The eagle is at a point  
where it's made a full recovery,'' said Interior spokesman Jon 
Wright. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have been discussing de-listing the  
eagle in a Fourth of July celebration at the White House, although 
a final decision has not been made. 
</P>
<P>
	The eagle, adopted as America's national symbol shortly after  
the Revolutionary War, was near extinction by the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	During much of this century, large numbers of eagles were killed  
by ranchers and farmers, who believed them to be marauders 
targeting their chickens and domestic livestock. But their biggest 
enemy eventually became DDT, the pesticide that accumulated in 
fish, one of the eagles' favorite meals. 
</P>
<P>
	By the late 1960s, fewer than 450 eagle pairs were believed to  
exist in the lower 48 states. Wildlife experts think as many as 
75,000 nesting bald eagles may have existed when the eagle became 
America's national bird in 1782. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, more than 5,000 nesting pairs of bald eagles are believed  
to roam the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
	But 60 years ago, the bald eagle's plight was such that Congress  
in 1940 enacted the Bald Eagle Protection Act, which made it 
illegal to kill, harass, possess or sell the bird. Still, thousands 
died largely because of exposure to DDT, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1967, the eagle was declared an endangered species, six years  
before the Endangered Species Act became law. But not until after 
1972, when DDT was banned, did the bird begin to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1995 its numbers had grown to a point where its status was  
changed from ``endangered'' to ``threatened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt marked the  
occasion at a refuge outside Washington, where an eagle named 
Freedom was symbolically released. Ironically, the bird was 
immediately attacked by an osprey and plummeted into the water. 
Although injured, Freedom was rescued and recovered to be set free 
again.

<HEADLINE> Fans Root for Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As Mikka Hansen was rising through the ranks of  
U.S. soccer, her father kept making a seemingly strange request. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you play for Denmark?'' he'd say.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sure, Dad, whatever,'' Hansen would tell her father, who was  
born in Denmark, making her eligible for the national team, even 
though Mikka was born and grew up in California. ``If you get in 
touch with them ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	She wasn't serious because, well, Hansen intended to play in the  
World Cup for the United States. She progressed through the youth 
ranks and at Santa Clara, where Hansen was a college star forward. 
She played for the under-21 U.S. women's squad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always thought I would get a chance with the U.S. team,''  
Hansen said Wednesday at a news conference to kick off the World 
Cup, which begins Saturday at Giants Stadium -- where Hansen and the 
Danes face the Americans, followed by Mexico vs. Brazil. ``I came 
up with the Olympic Development program and it helped me become the 
player I am. 
</P>
<P>
	``But once I was 22 and I knew the players who were in front of  
me, I felt maybe that was not an option. I'm a forward and the U.S. 
has Mia (Hamm, the international career goal-scoring leader) and 
Tiffeny (Milbrett). You get to the point where you realize there 
are other players for the U.S. to choose and I wanted to play on a 
national team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Hansen did, indeed, contact Danish soccer officials last  
October. By Christmas, they confirmed she could play professionally 
in their country. On Jan. 7, she headed to Denmark and, 10 days 
later, was in her first training camp with the national team. She 
accompanied the team to Portugal, where it finished fourth in a 
strong field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all happened pretty fast,'' Hansen said. ``It's been a  
dream come true for my father and my grandma, who was born in 
Denmark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Hansen, the toughest adjustment has been in communicating  
with teammates. Although everyone on the team speaks English, it is 
not the first language for anyone except Hansen. When she shouts 
out instructions or encouragement on the field, she needs to ``put 
the words in Danish, not English, and that takes time to think 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also notes that the Danes play a less-aggressive style than  
the Americans, and her timing has been off because of it. But coach 
Jorgen Hvidemose believes Hansen is making the necessary 
adjustments at a satisfactory pace. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to do what she is doing,'' he said. ``She  
wants to fit into the team, and contribute to the team, but she 
also has had to make some big changes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hansen expects it will be awkward Saturday when she opposes such  
friends as Julie Foudy and Brandi Chastain and Carla Overbeck, 
veterans of the U.S. team who helped Hansen's career. But she isn't 
backing away from the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very excited,'' she said. ``I'm proud to be a part of this  
event. And in the last six months, the media in Denmark has been 
getting excited about covering the event and having a person who 
grew up in America playing on the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hvidemose and the other players haven't really picked Hansen's  
brains about the U.S. team, mainly because the Danes are familiar 
enough with the Americans. Oddly, in the 1995 World Cup, where the 
Americans finished third as the defending champions, and at the 
1996 Olympics, where the U.S. squad won the gold, the opening 
opponent was Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Danes eagerly have questioned Hansen about playing in the  
United States; Denmark also has games at Portland, Ore., and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's funny to be with a team that hasn't been in the U.S. very  
often,'' Hansen said. ``The things they point out, I never really 
thought about. They think everything is so glamorous and big, and 
maybe a bit overdone. 
</P>
<P>
	``But they are impressed by how the preparations have been  
handled so well for this event. We can't wait to get started.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Ill. Deaths Linked to Rail Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Texas (AP) -- A suspected serial killer, a drifter  
known to hop freight trains, may be linked to the slayings of two 
more people found near railroad tracks in Illinois. And he may be 
responsible for even more deaths, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafael Resendez-Ramirez has been wanted in connection with five  
Texas killings and one in Lexington, Ky., since August 1997. All of 
the victims were beaten to death near railroad tracks. On 
Wednesday, authorities in southern Illinois identified him as a 
suspect in the killings this week of a man and his daughter in a 
home 100 yards from a rail line. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of George Morber, 80, and Carolyn Frederick, 52, were  
found Tuesday in Gorham, Ill. A truck missing from the scene was 
recovered Wednesday from a school parking lot in Cairo, about 60 
miles south of Gorham. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoever is killing these people is certainly a very brutal,  
brutal individual,'' said Texas Department of Public Safety 
spokesman Mike Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday afternoon, FBI agents and Cairo police were  
circulating photographs of Resendez-Ramirez to residents of Cairo, 
at the southern tip of Illinois and just over the Ohio River from 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't not consider him a suspect, but I can't say that he's  
my prime suspect, either,'' Jackson County Sheriff Bill Kilquist 
told The Southern Illinoisan newspaper in Carbondale. 
</P>
<P>
	In Texas, meanwhile, authorities determined late Wednesday that  
a man at first thought to be Resendez-Ramirez was not their man 
after realizing that a snake tattoo identified with the suspected 
rail-riding killer was on the wrong arm. 
</P>
<P>
	Computerized fingerprint comparisons between Resendez-Ramirez  
and the man who was taken into custody also did not match. The FBI 
will do its own fingerprint tests sometime today, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as we're concerned, at this point it's not  
Resendez-Ramirez,'' Cox said. ``I suppose there is still a click of 
a possibility, but there's not much of one at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The man in custody, who has not been identified, was arrested  
along with four other people while riding a Union Pacific freight 
train between Round Rock and Hutto in Williamson County, about 30 
miles north of Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the southern Illinois killings, authorities say  
fingerprints and other forensic evidence link Resendez-Ramirez to 
five Texas killings -- two in the Houston area and three near 
Weimar, 80 miles west of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Resendez-Ramirez is also considered a suspect in the East Texas  
slaying of an 87-year-old woman two months ago. Police say the 
victim was robbed and beaten to death in her home near a railroad 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	And he is wanted for questioning in the 1997 slaying of a  
21-year-old University of Kentucky student who was struck in the 
back of the head as he and his girlfriend took a shortcut along 
some railroad tracks in Lexington. 
</P>
<P>
	An FBI task force composed of local, state and federal officers  
has been hunting for Resendez-Ramirez since authorities began 
connecting the killings last week.

<HEADLINE> Controversial 'Buffy' Finale Airing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The season finale of ``Buffy the Vampire  
Slayer,'' yanked last month by WB because of scenes of high school 
violence, will air July 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to delay the episode, the conclusion of a two-part  
finale, was both praised and condemned, said Jamie Kellner, the TV 
network's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we erred, it was on the side of caution,'' Kellner said  
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The episode was to have been shown May 25, a month after the  
shootings at Colorado's Columbine High School that left 15 people 
dead. The ``Buffy'' finale also would have coincided with thousands 
of school graduations nationwide, WB noted. 
</P>
<P>
	In the fantasy drama, a solar eclipse turns a town's mayor into  
a serpent who attacks students during graduation. The youngsters 
defend themselves with stakes, bows, arrows and other implements. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Michelle Gellar stars as Buffy, a teen-ager who teams with  
vampire Angel (David Boreanaz) to fight the forces of evil.

<HEADLINE> Kellogg May Close Part of Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) -- The nation's largest cereal maker  
announced today it is considering closing part of its historic 
Battle Creek cereal plant and eliminating up to 64 percent of the 
jobs at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, up to 700 of the current 1,100 jobs at the  
Kellogg Co. plant would be eliminated as early as the first quarter 
of 2000, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Streamlining our operations and avoiding future costs would  
help keep our North American cereal business cost-competitive going 
into the 21st century,'' new chief executive Carlos M. Gutierrez 
said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The news comes seven months after Kellogg cut 525 jobs -- 21  
percent of its salaried workforce -- as part of a reorganization of 
its North American operations. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Battle Creek-based cereal maker decides to close part of  
the plant, the company said some of the operations would be 
relocated to other Kellogg North America cereal plants for an 
estimated annual savings of $35 million to $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the 700 jobs that would be cut would not be replaced at  
other plants, Joseph Stewart, Kellogg's executive vice president of 
communications, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Parts of plant date back to 1907, the year after the Kellogg Co.  
made Battle Creek its headquarters, and the company cannot afford 
to keep it running because it's so inefficient, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant was at one time a major tourist attraction. An  
estimated 175,000 people visited it each year before the tours 
ended in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, a nonprofit group opened Cereal City USA in downtown  
Battle Creek. The company contributed millions to help build the 
attraction, which features exhibits on cereal history, a simulated 
cereal production line and a show featuring the characters used in 
Kellogg's advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Kellogg will make a final decision about the closure after  
discussions with the union that represents the plant's hourly 
workers. The company met will all employees this morning 30 minutes 
before making its announcement to reporters gathered for a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Gutierrez said in April that although Battle Creek produces a  
lot of cereal, the plant would have to remain competitive and 
continue to improve its productivity. 
</P>
<P>
	And analysts have previously said Kellogg needs to do more if it  
is to regain its shrinking market share. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Kellogg reported a 30 percent drop in first-quarter  
earnings, but the cereal maker pointed to an increase in sales as 
an indicator of future growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were in line with Wall Street estimates.

<HEADLINE> Gore Balances Clinton Loyalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Loyal to a political fault, Vice President Al  
Gore is out to show his independence -- without breaking allegiance 
with the boss he is campaigning to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	That is the balancing act required of the No. 2 man when he runs  
for No. 1. For Gore, it means boasting about policy successes while 
rebuking, more forcefully than before, President Clinton's personal 
misconduct and deceptions in the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	It means claiming joint sponsorship of the economic steps Gore  
credits for ``our strongest economy in the history of the United 
States,'' while promising more from a new Democratic 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we must build on that foundation,'' Gore said Wednesday in  
Carthage, Tenn., as he formally announced what he's been doing, 
running for president in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A vice president or former one has been a major party nominee  
for president in all but two of the past 10 elections. Not since 
1952 has an incumbent vice president who sought nomination been 
denied it. Four of the last seven presidents had been vice 
president, although only George Bush in 1988 won election while 
serving as VP. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has both special standing and special problems in running  
for the White House. He knows the job; vice presidents usually do. 
He has been Clinton's partner as well as his understudy, part of 
the team that made the policy decisions. They weren't his, and he 
kept quiet when he disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	There are polls to indicate a downside, suggesting what's been  
termed Clinton fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton is, after all, an impeached president. Gore, to the  
dismay of his own political allies, pronounced Clinton ``one of our 
greatest presidents'' the day the House impeached him. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that he defended Clinton's behavior. He said it was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	He's saying it far more vehemently now that his own campaign is  
on, calling it inexcusable, saying the impeachment, trial and 
acquittal wasted time the administration could have spent on other 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the easy part of his effort to move beyond Clinton; it is  
more difficult to define policies for change, so as to counter the 
Republican arguments, already sounded by Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
that he represents the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore said he would take his own values to the presidency ``to  
build an America that is not only better off but better.'' He also 
said that as a candidate, he would say so should he disagree with 
Clinton on an issue. 
</P>
<P>
	A new poll tells why Gore needs to promise a new look. A Pew  
Research Center survey reports that only 43 percent of Americans 
want the next president to offer policies and programs similar to 
those of the current administration, 10 percent fewer than five 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	No modern president has pushed as Clinton is for the nomination  
and election of his vice president to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight D. Eisenhower kept hands off in 1960, saying he didn't  
want to be seen as Richard M. Nixon's patron, that it was better 
for the vice president to be his own man. Ike was no help when 
asked for a major Nixon idea adopted by the administration. ``If 
you give me a week, I might think of one,'' he said. ``I don't 
remember.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eight years later, Nixon was the beneficiary when Vice President  
Hubert H. Humphrey couldn't break the bond of being No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	When Humphrey said that as president he would cease the bombing  
of North Vietnam to pursue peace negotiations, President Lyndon B. 
Johnson made him back off. Already undermined by Democratic 
divisions, Humphrey lost narrowly to Nixon -- although LBJ stopped 
the bombing just before the election. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President George Bush promised a ``kinder, gentler''  
America when he was nominated to succeed Ronald Reagan. But he 
coupled that suggestion of a different course with a line that 
sounded like vintage Reagan: ``Read my lips: No new taxes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It served him in the 1988 campaign, but backfired when he  
reneged to get a budget deal with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is behind in polls on the presidential election. Vice  
presidents have been there before, too. George Bush was, well into 
the campaign in which he won the White House, which his son, George 
W., seeks now.

<HEADLINE>  Gore Pitches High-Tech Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called today for  
tax cuts for businesses which invest in high-tech research and told 
a crowd in a state that is politically crucial and home to a 
growing high-tech industry that he'd ``invest aggressively'' to 
create information-age jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be talking about my economic ideas in real  
specifics,'' Gore said, at an ``issues forum'' in New Hampshire, 
moving to build on his front-runner status in the Democratic 
presidential fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore brought his economic message to New Hampshire, site of the  
nation's first presidential primary. The centerpiece of Gore's 
economic proposals focused on incentives for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will craft these tax cuts specifically to help the small  
businesses and startups that are crucial to our high-tech future,'' 
Gore said. He pledged to ``double our investment in information 
technology over five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals came as Gore opened his first full days as an  
officially declared candidate for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, speaking with about 300 people jammed into a college 
gymnasium for a detailed policy discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides hope to contrast the opening of Gore's campaign with that  
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner often 
criticized for being vague on the issues. In the process, Gore was 
sketching out his own agenda apart from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to avoid the false assumption that we can keep  
the good times going just by wishing it would be so and not trying 
to be proactive,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's event was interrupted briefly by a group of protesters  
who chanted and waved signs urging greater assistance for AIDS 
victims in Africa. ``I respect our tradition of free speech,'' Gore 
said, as protesters were hustled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore pointedly scheduled the first two events of his campaign in  
important early test states, Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very lengthy list of specific and hard-hitting  
proposals to make this country a better place,'' Gore said. ``I 
haven't heard any of the others support this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters if he was seeking a contrast with Bush, Gore  
said: ``That is a conclusion that is almost impossible to avoid, 
but I'll let you reach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore officially kicked off his run for the White House in his  
hometown of Carthage, Tenn., on Wednesday, with a theme of ``the 
family crisis in America.'' He also called for individual 
responsibility in a speech in which he also began to distance 
himself from the scandals that have plagued President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is our lives we have to master if we are going to remain as  
role models for our children,'' the vice president said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore repeatedly insisted that parents must ``master their own  
lives'' before lamenting tragedies like school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force Two en route to New  
Hampshire, Gore was asked if that applied to Clinton as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``It applies to every single American,'' he said. ``I'm sure  
that you heard when you were a child what I heard when I was a 
child, that what you do speaks louder than what you say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore followed the Carthage announcement with a town-hall meeting  
in Iowa, where about 1,000 activists cheered an abbreviated 
announcement speech, and asked a few carefully scripted questions 
about bolstering schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Today he also was heading to New York, and then to California to  
show the flag in states that could help settle the nomination by 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Democratic fight, Gore faces a challenge only from former  
New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley. He holds a wide lead in the polls, 
and some strategists argue that -- absent an unforeseen event -- the 
nomination is Gore's to lose. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore aides said the dynamic of the Democratic race bodes well  
for Gore, because Bradley must demonstrate fairly quickly an 
ability to win, not simply compete. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a two-person race,'' said Gore campaign manager Craig  
Smith. ``He (Bradley) has got to find somewhere where he can win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been little battling between Gore and Bradley, and  
Bradley aides said the announcement changes nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't really change how we're coming at things,'' Bradley  
aide Eric Hauser said. 
</P>
<P>
	With Gore far ahead among Democrats, and with Bush leading among  
Republicans, there was a clear effort in Gore's camp to begin 
drawing contrasts with Bush, looking past the primary season. Some 
Democrats are worried by early polling showing Gore losing that 
matchup, and Gore was clear in trying to begin the process of 
offering contrasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring the seriousness with which they take Gore, top  
Republicans bought newspaper ads and staged events welcoming Gore 
to the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't respond to it,'' said Gore campaign chairman Tony  
Coehlo, ``because we thought it was too cute.''

<HEADLINE>  Gore Pitches High-Tech Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore called today for  
tax cuts for businesses which invest in high-tech research and told 
a crowd in a state that is politically crucial and home to a 
growing high-tech industry that he'd ``invest aggressively'' to 
create information-age jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be talking about my economic ideas in real  
specifics,'' Gore said, at an ``issues forum'' in New Hampshire, 
moving to build on his front-runner status in the Democratic 
presidential fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore brought his economic message to New Hampshire, site of the  
nation's first presidential primary. The centerpiece of Gore's 
economic proposals focused on incentives for research and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will craft these tax cuts specifically to help the small  
businesses and startups that are crucial to our high-tech future,'' 
Gore said. He pledged to ``double our investment in information 
technology over five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposals came as Gore opened his first full days as an  
officially declared candidate for the Democratic presidential 
nomination, speaking with about 300 people jammed into a college 
gymnasium for a detailed policy discussion. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides hope to contrast the opening of Gore's campaign with that  
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican front-runner often 
criticized for being vague on the issues. In the process, Gore was 
sketching out his own agenda apart from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we need to avoid the false assumption that we can keep  
the good times going just by wishing it would be so and not trying 
to be proactive,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's event was interrupted briefly by a group of protesters  
who chanted and waved signs urging greater assistance for AIDS 
victims in Africa. ``I respect our tradition of free speech,'' Gore 
said, as protesters were hustled out. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore pointedly scheduled the first two events of his campaign in  
important early test states, Iowa and New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a very lengthy list of specific and hard-hitting  
proposals to make this country a better place,'' Gore said. ``I 
haven't heard any of the others support this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked by reporters if he was seeking a contrast with Bush, Gore  
said: ``That is a conclusion that is almost impossible to avoid, 
but I'll let you reach it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore officially kicked off his run for the White House in his

<HEADLINE> AGs Want Sweepstakes Warning Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sweepstakes companies could soon stuff  
warning labels into their contest envelopes if they adopt new 
industry guidelines being proposed by state attorneys general. 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana Attorney General Jeff Modisett and others want the  
industry to include the following note of caution in their 
mailings: ``You have not yet won. Enter for free. Enter as often as 
you like. Buying won't help you win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, Modisett vowed to push for federal laws requiring  
such disclaimers. 
</P>
<P>
	The suggestion is one of many that members of the National  
Association of Attorneys General will present at a meeting in 
Nashville next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that sweepstakes marketers should not imply that a  
person is a winner, or stands a better chance than anyone else, 
unless that is in fact the case,'' Modisett said. ``We want the 
industry to take responsibility for not taking advantage of 
vulnerable consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also wants the industry to:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Stop implying that a person won or is in a unique position to  
win or that ordering a product increases the odds of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Create a simple and uniform way to enter the contests.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Stop multiple deadlines for a single sweepstakes contest.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Make getting off sweepstakes mailing lists easier.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Stop including checks that often look like they've been issued  
or endorsed by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	Two leading sweepstakes companies insist they already use many  
of the consumer advisories being outlined by NAAG. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support clear disclaimers. We've already done it for a  
year,'' said Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman for American Family 
Publishers, the company that uses Ed McMahon and Dick Clark in its 
mailings. 
</P>
<P>
	Christopher Irving, director of consumer affairs for Publishers  
Clearing House, said his company wasn't sure if another piece of 
paper would be the best way because it could become lost with the 
other inserts. 
</P>
<P>
	``A stand-alone slip may not do that,'' he said. ``That  
information might better be communicated on the entry order form, 
which the consumers may be more apt to read.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Modisett, who chairs the Subcommittee on Sweepstakes and Prize  
Promotion for NAAG, said the suggestions could become law if the 
industry doesn't practice more self-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have observed over the last year a distinction between  
statements of the industry and the actions of the industry,'' he 
said. ``The proof will be in the pudding. If they do not follow, we 
would recommend that these be adopted nationally. It would take 
federal legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana, South Carolina, West Virginia and Florida agreed to a  
$4 million settlement with AFP last month. It included a pledge to 
stop the mailings that duped hundreds of people into thinking they 
were winners. Iowa and Connecticut are still in negotiations with 
the company and could sign on later.

<HEADLINE> Tony Conn. Town Defends Sandy Turf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Folks in Greenwich hate it when someone  
says their residents-only beach policy is a bid to keep the 
riffraff out of one of the nation's toniest towns. 
</P>
<P>
	``That just isn't so,'' insisted Dolores Deck, a real estate  
agent who visited sandy Greenwich Point on Thursday. ``We pay taxes 
for this beautiful beach. Why should we open it to outsiders?'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the controversy reached a new -- some say absurd -- level this  
week as police staged an undercover operation to capture a would-be 
intruder who, officers said, advertised for black market beach 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I mean, to set up a sting operation -- I'm sure there's other  
crime in Greenwich that requires their attention. It just strikes 
me that their resources could probably be used more effectively,'' 
said Brenden Leydon, a lawyer from neighboring Stamford who has 
sued Greenwich over the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenwich is a town with resources that small countries would  
envy. Former President George Bush grew up in the place that today 
contains the bedrooms of those who work in New York City's loftiest 
boardrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	The average home sells for more than $1 million, and the people  
who live in them play polo on ponies, not in some measly pool. 
Diana Ross, Mel Gibson and Leona Helmsley have homes here. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't live here and want to visit the beach? Find a resident to  
accompany you and fish out $6 for the guest fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The town has argued that allowing outsiders would worsen a  
parking crunch, hurt the environment and could make it difficult 
for emergency vehicles to get around. 
</P>
<P>
	Leydon filed his lawsuit in 1995 after he was barred from  
jogging into Greenwich Point, a 147-acre park with a pristine beach 
on Long Island Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	He claims the town's restrictive policy violates the First  
Amendment's right to free association and Connecticut law. The case 
was dismissed last year, but Leydon has appealed. The court is 
expected to hear more arguments later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Locals celebrated when the trial court tossed out his claims --  
one person said, anonymously, that he needed a ``good old-fashioned 
spanking.'' But the undercover sting conducted to uphold the town's 
``zero tolerance'' beach policy has the outsiders again calling the 
insiders a bunch of rich snobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The caper went down like this: Victor Consoli, 34, allegedly  
placed an ad in the Greenwich Time newspaper seeking beach passes 
``For prof'l Stamford cpl w/child. $100 + expenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Readers and the town's own parks agency complained; police set  
up their mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Mark Larobina called Consoli and said he was a  
Greenwich resident interested in selling two passes. They arranged 
to meet. At a McDonalds restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	Larobina said Consoli handed over $100 for the two passes.  
</P>
<P>
	``That's when I advised him I was, in fact, a police officer,''  
Larobina told the Greenwich Time. ``He was more disappointed than 
anything else. Disappointed and shocked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consoli was charged with violating an ordinance that prohibits  
anyone but a town resident from obtaining or possessing a beach 
pass. He can either pay a $60 fine or plead innocent and request a 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Consoli did not return messages left at his home Thursday, and  
no one answered the door at his Stamford home, near the Greenwich 
town limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Capt. James Walters said his officers staged the sting  
because of ``the level of concern for the safety and security of 
the beaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walters also couldn't understand why the suspect went to such  
lengths to get the passes, despite the town's highly publicized 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a bit ridiculous, to be perfectly honest with  
you,'' he said. ``The man lives in Stamford and has access to 
several beautiful beaches in Stamford, and for whatever reason, he 
was so intent on obtaining a Greenwich beach pass, I just don't 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents, meanwhile, are applauding that the sanctity of their  
shore has again been upheld. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's so crowded now,'' Deck said at Greenwich Point, ``if we  
ever let it open to outsiders, you'd never be able to come here.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Is Shredder Capital of World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Washington is awash in secrets, some  
better kept than others. Because of that, shredders are a fact of 
life inside the Beltway. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably the shredder capital of the planet,'' said  
Greg DiGioia, president and owner of Capital Shredders in 
Rockville, just outside the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Where there's government, a shredder isn't far.  
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service shreds outdated stamps and the Treasury  
Department shreds worn-out money. Even the Smithsonian Institution 
shredded controversial nude photos taken of Yale University 
students during a medical study. 
</P>
<P>
	At CIA headquarters in Langley, Va., an entire building is  
devoted to shredding. The Classified Waste Disposal Facility chops 
and burns five to 10 tons of documents per day, agency spokesman 
Tom Crispell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The oldest of Washington's shredding firms is Whitaker Brothers  
of Rockville, which bills itself as the No. 1 government shredder 
supplier. 
</P>
<P>
	Founded in 1945, Whitaker sold perhaps the world's two most  
infamous shredders: the Republican National Committee shredder used 
by White House operative G. Gordon Liddy and the model 007-S used 
by Oliver North to ``clean things up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Co-owner Vince Del Vecchio hauls out a company scrapbook with a  
copy of a 1972 sales receipt from the Committee to Re-Elect 
President Nixon with what looks like the signature of Watergate 
burglar and committee security chief James McCord. 
</P>
<P>
	The company bought it back from the committee and today the  
800-pound machine sits in a company warehouse -- still adorned with 
a small U.S. flag attached by the president's men. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to believe, but it's a piece of history,'' said  
Linda Robbins of Whitaker Brothers. ``There's an aura.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it's considered an old-timer. Its paper strips could be  
painstakingly reassembled, as they were by militants who took over 
the U.S. Embassy in Iran in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	High-security shredders -- which cost thousands of dollars -- now  
cut each page of sensitive material into at least 10,000 wisps of 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
	The ultra-secret National Security Agency sets the standard for  
these top-secret shredders, estimating it would take about 10 years 
for someone to reassemble a single sheet of paper.

<HEADLINE> Cowboys Agree on Sanders Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Despite salary-cap problems and Deion  
Sanders' nagging toe injury, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has 
agreed on a contract extension for the All-Pro cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones initially announced Thursday that it was a three-year  
deal. But Jones later said he misspoke about the time frame, 
according to Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tentative agreement has been reached, although the  
contract has not been signed and the length of the agreement will 
not be released,'' Jones later said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones wouldn't say how much the extension is worth, but he  
conceded that the decision is a calculated risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really don't know if he's going to play at the level we'd  
like for him to,'' Jones said at Valley Ranch, where players were 
concluding a three-day mini-camp. 
</P>
<P>
	``But when I look at what our alternatives are and when I look  
at what he can bring to the table for our team this year, it's 
worth the risk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said the deal, which still must pass muster with the NFL,  
was nearly complete and he expected it to be signed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The extension is expected to be surpass the highest contract for  
an NFL cornerback, a four-year, $22.8 million deal that Dale Carter 
signed recently with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones said the contract might not be as long as some had  
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shorter than I hope his career is,'' Jones said. ``But  
it's a step in that direction. I would hope he could finish his 
career here, but this contract doesn't necessarily accomplish 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, still sidelined from a turf toe injury he suffered on  
Nov. 15, attended workouts on Friday but didn't practice and didn't 
comment on his contract situation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said negotiations were complicated because of the Cowboys'  
limited salary-cap room and the uncertainty surrounding Sanders' 
injury. The contract is expected to include incentive clauses to 
ensure that Sanders gets paid in full only if he performs up to 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Chan Gailey said his hopes are high.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're very excited about the possibility of having Deion on  
the field,'' Gailey said. ``Hopefully, this contract will get 
worked out completely and we'll get him signed. His attitude on the 
field has been very positive, and it looks like it's a win-win 
situation'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones and Sanders' agent, Eugene Parker, negotiated a  
seven-year, $35 million contract that brought Sanders from San 
Francisco to Dallas in 1995. The pact included a then-record $12.99 
million signing bonus as well as 10 incentive clauses that would, 
if reached, allow Sanders to void his contract's final two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders underwent toe surgery April 28. The team trainer said  
last month that recovery was expected to take another 3-4 months, 
lasting at least into the exhibition season. Dallas starts the 
season Sept. 12 at Washington.

<HEADLINE> Rivera Declares Drug War Lost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's not hard to find NBC's $5 million man,  
Geraldo Rivera, on television. You just have to know where to look. 
</P>
<P>
	Try the ``Today'' show, where Rivera's action-packed reports on  
the Kosovo Liberation Army first aired this month. But don't try 
the ``NBC Nightly News,'' where a Rivera report has never been 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
	Try prime time this Sunday, when Rivera's documentary, ``Drug  
Bust, The Longest War,'' airs at 8 p.m. But don't try ``Dateline 
NBC,'' where Rivera believes he's not welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Better yet, try cable, where MSNBC repeatedly ran the Kosovo  
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	A year and a half into his lucrative new contract with NBC, the  
former syndicated talk-show host still doesn't feel completely 
accepted at the Peacock Network. He may get more camera time than 
anyone else in the company, but he yearns for the time he doesn't 
get. It's a strange dynamic. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the drug special.  
</P>
<P>
	It's the third special report to emerge from Rivera's  
documentary unit, and he reaches the pointed conclusion that the 
decades-long war on drugs was in large part a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have lost the war on drugs,'' he said. ``It's like Vietnam.  
At some point we've got to say we have lost and no one has had the 
courage to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera talks to a veteran drug smuggler and a U.S. Customs  
inspector about efforts to stem the flow of illegal drugs into the 
country. ``Drug Bust'' also examines why addicts who want help have 
an easier time finding drugs than treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the war on drugs was declared in 1971, it has cost $300  
billion of taxpayer money, and drugs remain readily available, 
Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A generation of politicians has been corrupted,'' Rivera said.  
``This has been a cancer on the souls of the supplier nations. 
America is this huge, voracious vacuum cleaner sucking up all the 
illicit narcotics the world can produce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike news reports, documentaries generally take a clear point  
of view. ``Drug Bust'' is particularly provocative. Rivera's 
eagerness to say how he feels -- also shown in his spirited defense 
of President Clinton during the impeachment trial -- probably has 
something to do with the arms-length relationship he has with some 
of NBC's old guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera doesn't think his opinionated nature is all that unusual  
in network news. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't think the reporters at NBC had opinions during  
the impeachment crisis, the vast majority of them in diametric 
opposition to mine, then I don't think you were watching,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since signing his NBC deal in November 1997, Rivera has been  
rankled at not having any reports aired on ``NBC Nightly News,'' 
the network's flagship show anchored by Tom Brokaw.

	In December 1997, Brokaw said of Rivera: ``He does what he does,  
and I do what I do. There's very little common ground between us. 
That doesn't mean he doesn't have the right to do what he does.'' 
Brokaw hasn't talked much about his colleague since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Rivera's feelings were hurt anew by the treatment of his  
Kosovo reports. He hoped they were good enough for ``Nightly'' to 
seek them out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The writing is on the wall, the sky and the ground,'' Rivera  
said. ``It's just not going to happen. I don't think it will ever 
happen. If that piece didn't get on, I don't think they'd use 
anything. I know that `Dateline' and `Nightly' are like the country 
club in my neighborhood. I'm not allowed in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The network's only comment: ``Each NBC News program makes its  
own editorial decisions,'' said spokeswoman Alex Constantinople. 
Privately, NBC executives note that ``Dateline NBC'' has run 
Rivera's work in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Rivera said frustration with his situation is partly why he's  
considering a daily radio talk show. ``The motivation, honestly, 
was, `OK, you don't want me, I know a lot of other people who 
do,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If his role at NBC continues to evolve, Rivera said, he'd be  
much less inclined to seek out the radio job. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a real need for an aggressive, populist  
alternative to the Rush Limbaughs and Oliver Norths of the world,'' 
he said. ``It's time for liberals to stop being embarrassed about 
their political philosophy. Having said all that, I probably don't 
have the time to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Hatch Might Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah is strongly  
considering joining the crowded race for the Republican 
presidential nomination, GOP sources said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	These Republicans, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,  
said Hatch, a fourth-term senator and chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, had begun to search for staff in the event of a 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether he was thinking about entering the race, Hatch  
said: ``I've had people come to me and I'm certainly courteously 
listening. I'm not pushing them away. I'm just listening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, 65, would face difficult obstacles if he were to decide  
to enter the race. Texas Gov. George W. Bush is the commanding 
front-runner in the polls and in money raised. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch understands Bush's status but has indicated that he could  
have a good chance to establish himself as a credible alternative 
should the Texas governor falter, according to one Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch also faces re-election to the Senate in 2000, but a  
recently enacted Utah law would allow him to run for both offices 
at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake Tribune reported Thursday that the senator was  
considering a run for the presidency, quoting advisers. Roll Call, 
a Capitol Hill newspaper, also reported on Hatch's plans on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch has said he would be ``the longest of the long shots.''  
</P>
<P>
	Others vying for the GOP nomination are Texas Gov. George W.  
Bush, former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole, 
businessman Steve Forbes, former Vice President Dan Quayle, former 
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, conservative activists Gary Bauer 
and Pat Buchanan, Sens. Robert Smith of New Hampshire and John 
McCain of Arizona, and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore announced his candidacy Wednesday for the  
Democratic presidential nomination, also being sought by Sen. Bill 
Bradley of New Jersey.

<HEADLINE> Brooding Belle Hasn't Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- The youngster eagerly stretched his arm over  
the railing, tightly gripping a baseball as the Baltimore Orioles 
walked off the field after batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Belle, would you please sign this? It would really make my  
day,'' the boy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know what, kid? I'm sure it would,'' replied Albert Belle,  
never breaking stride as he disappeared into the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the same Albert Belle who recently purchased baseball  
tickets for 400 children in Texas and put his name on college 
scholarships for four students. 
</P>
<P>
	It's virtually impossible to get a definitive read on Albert  
Belle, a reclusive slugger whose demeanor changes as often as a 
traffic light. It's always been that way, and nothing has changed 
in his first season with the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	When Belle signed a five-year, $65 million contract in December,  
he spoke of bonding with Orioles fans and forging a workable 
relationship with the media. 
</P>
<P>
	That hasn't happened. The fans gave him a standing ovation when  
he homered on opening day, and he shocked more than a few of them 
by stepping from the dugout to tip his cap. But after he went into 
a prolonged slump and occasionally failed to hustle on groundballs, 
Belle heard plenty of boos at Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
	His association with the Baltimore media is nonexistent. Belle  
stopped speaking to the press after reporters wrote about a 
clubhouse tirade during spring training that occurred in front of 
his locker immediately after a sixth-inning strikeout. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters kept their distance until last week. After being  
replaced in the ninth inning of a game against the Florida Marlins 
after failing to run out a grounder, Belle exchanged angry words 
with manager Ray Miller. When approached by reporters after the 
game, Belle rattled off a string of expletives. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said he intended to replace Belle in the bottom of the  
ninth anyway. But he benched the right fielder in the next game to 
end his run of consecutive games at 392, then the longest active 
streak in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle has since been on a tear at the plate, going 10-for-22 in  
five games to raise his batting average 20 points to .264. 
</P>
<P>
	When they signed Belle as a free agent, the Orioles had no idea  
whether he would behave differently than he did with the Cleveland 
Indians and Chicago White Sox, when he was suspended six times. But 
team officials figured he would at least maintain his pace of 
hitting at least 30 homers and 100 RBIs the past seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, Belle actions on and off the field have been  
consistent. He usually starts hitting well when the weather heats 
up, and his performance this week seems to indicate he's right on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Albert's been fine. I think we all got frustrated with the way  
the club has played the first two months, and his frustration was 
intensified by the fact that he wasn't hitting as he would have 
liked,'' Orioles general manager Frank Wren said. ``But he's 
starting to pick it up lately, so hopefully that's all behind 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Orioles can only hope his erratic behavior will change, too.  
In April, during a three-game series in which he managed only two 
hits, Belle threw a beer bottle through a television set in the 
visitors clubhouse at Tropicana Field in Tampa Bay. He paid for the 
damage and was not fined. 
</P>
<P>
	Belle usually is far less obtrusive in the Orioles clubhouse. He  
likes to play cribbage with teammates before games, but for the 
most part he performs his pregame rituals in solitude. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Johnson, whose locker is separated from Belle's by one  
vacant cubicle, said, ``You see his preparation for the game and 
what he goes through. He's a serious competitor who really cares 
about his game. ... Regardless of what people say about how he 
plays the game, to me it says a lot that he's the first to get here 
and the last to leave.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Belle has a no-trade clause through 2001, so these first months  
are seemingly the beginning of a long relationship, for better or 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a big bat in the middle of the lineup. If he hits like we  
know we can,'' Wren said, ``then we'll have the guy we were looking 
for.''

	MIAMI (AP) -- Arlene, the first storm of the Atlantic hurricane  
season, weakened into a tropical depression Thursday after sweeping

<HEADLINE> Belgium Extends Coke Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Belgium extended its ban on Coke but  
agreed Thursday to lift restrictions that were placed on some of 
the company's other beverages after dozens of people became ill 
consuming soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
	France partially relaxed its ban on Coca-Cola sales Thursday,  
but Switzerland joined a move by other nations to block sales of 
Coca-Cola drinks produced in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., the world's biggest soft-drink company, had been  
hoping the ban would be lifted and European confidence in the 
brands would be restored. 
</P>
<P>
	With Coke's problems coming on top of a tainted-food scandal in  
Belgium, French President Jacques Chirac said Thursday he will 
propose creating an international council to monitor food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian Health Ministry said Thursday it was allowing the  
resumption of sales of Coca-Cola's Nestea, Aquarius, Bonaqua, 
Kinley, Lift and Minute Maid brands. But the ban was extended on 
Coke, Fanta and Sprite pending further investigation into what 
caused the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not possible today to explain in a calming and  
satisfactory way the appearance of these symptoms of illness,'' 
said the statement from Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche. 
``Coca-Cola must withdraw all these products from the market and 
destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government imposed its ban Monday after dozens of  
youngsters were hospitalized complaining of stomach pains and 
nausea after drinking Coca-Cola products. Belgian news media said 
Thursday some 200 people had been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The health scare rapidly spread to other nations, with  
Luxembourg imposing a similar ban, France banning Coke in cans and 
the Netherlands, Spain and Germany withdrawing Coke products coming 
from Belgium. Switzerland joined the list Thursday telling Coke to 
withdraw any drinks imported from Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	The French government announced Thursday it was relaxing its ban  
on canned Coca-Cola products and would allow sales to resume from 
one of two French Coke plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola spokesman Rob Baskin said the company was pleased with  
the partial victory and continues to work to restore all its 
products to Belgium's shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're looking forward to meeting with the ministry tomorrow to  
present data we hope will allow the ministry to continue our 
product line,'' Baskin said. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Douglas Ivester, the chairman of Coca-Cola, expressed deep  
regrets to European customers Wednesday and promised the company 
``will not rest'' until it ensures all of its products meet the 
highest quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke insists there was no toxic contamination of its drinks, but  
said substandard gas used to put fizz into the drinks at the 
Antwerp plant produced an off taste, while fungicide used on crates 
in Dunkirk was absorbed by the underside of cans giving off an 
``offensive odor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Belgium said it would reimburse medical costs of  
anyone who produced a doctors' certificate showing drinking the 
company's products had made them ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coke scare hit as European consumers remained shaken by a  
scandal over Belgian food contaminated by cancer-causing dioxins. 
That led to bans on poultry, eggs, pork, beef and dairy products 
from Belgium, creating Europe's worst food panic since the 1996 
``mad cow'' crisis.

<HEADLINE> Sabres, Stars Serve Up Cup Thrills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- At last, there's a competitive series in the  
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tied 2-2 going into Game 5 tonight, the Buffalo Sabres and  
Dallas Stars have made it the best championship round in many 
years. The previous four seasons ended with 4-0 sweeps in the 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is as tight a matchup as you'll find,'' Stars forward  
Brian Skrudland said. ``Both teams deserve a lot of credit for 
where they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not since the New York Rangers and Vancouver Canucks went seven  
games in 1994 has there been a Stanley Cup final that has lasted 
more than four. The New Jersey Devils, Colorado Avalanche and 
Detroit Red Wings (twice) have all swept the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the best-of-7 format began in 1939, only 10 finals have  
gone the limit. But no one is betting that this one won't go right 
down to the end. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars and Sabres have each split games in each other's  
arena, and the teams have been tied or had a one-goal difference 
for all but 26 seconds of the first four games. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams feature a defensive style that has resulted in  
low-scoring games. Their 17 combined goals (Stars 9, Sabres 8) are 
the lowest four-game total in Stanley Cup finals history since the 
Montreal Canadiens outscored the St. Louis Blues 12-3 in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	The last game of the Stars-Sabres series was typical, the Sabres  
winning 2-1 at Buffalo. The Sabres are 8-1 in one-goal games, and 
the Stars are 7-6 in this year's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of these goaltenders are playing so great,'' said Stars  
defenseman Craig Ludwig, referring to Dallas' Ed Belfour and 
Buffalo's Dominik Hasek. ``One break here or there makes a 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek has the better stats between the two, having allowed only  
eight goals on 127 shots, but Belfour was the more spectacular in 
Tuesday night's victory for Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just see this as two really competitive teams trying to  
win,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``(Stars general manager) 
Bob Gainey said to us last night on the airplane this is such a 
great series. You've got two teams with so much passion and 
character going at it. It's so good for the game of hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With their victory on Tuesday night, the Sabres cast an entirely  
new light on this series. A Stars victory in Game 4 would have 
given them a 3-1 lead in the best-of-7 finals, making it a tough 
job for the Sabres to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one team since 1939 has come back to win the Cup after  
losing three of the first four games -- the 1942 Toronto Maple 
Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday night's victory was also important for another reason as  
far as the Sabres were concerned: They admittedly played their 
worst game of the playoffs in losing Game 3 by a 2-1 score on 
Saturday night. The Stars held the Sabres to 12 shots, tying a 
Stanley Cup finals record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought our team got away from the aggressive forecheck (in  
Game 3) and we wanted to get back to that,'' Sabres coach Lindy 
Ruff said. ``We wanted to get our (defense) involved. That was 
probably the thing that hurt us the most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres scored first on Tuesday night, but that's not always  
a guarantee of anything in this series. Scoring first in two other 
games, the Sabres lost both. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be great if we got the first goal,'' Ruff  
said, ``but I don't think that one goal is the type of lead that 
causes them to start taking chances. Dallas is a very patient 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres don't expect Dallas to make the same kind of mistakes  
that helped them win Tuesday night. The Stars defense broke down 
twice, leading to Buffalo goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Neither team is going to give up many opportunities on  
mistakes now,'' Buffalo's Brian Holzinger said. ``We have to play 
almost a perfect game against them because of how smart 
positionally they are and what a veteran team they have.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Higher / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks pushed higher today after Federal Reserve  
Chairman Alan Greenspan indicated that only a modest interest rate 
hike may be in order to keep inflation well-tamed. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 45.60 at 10,830.55, a day after soaring nearly 190 points as 
inflation fears eased. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indexes were mostly higher. Shrugging off early  
disappointing news from Compaq Computer and profit-taking, the 
Nasdaq composite index rose 21.71 to 2,539.54. On Wednesday, the 
index rose 103.16 -- its largest one-day point gain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 8.92 today to 1,339.33.  
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan told Congress that while inflation remains in check,  
the Fed should consider taking pre-emptive action to avert any 
threat to continued economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	In his most direct comments recently on the question of an  
interest rate hike, the Fed chairman said a modest increase could 
eliminate the need for more drastic action at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has warned recently it might raise interest rates as  
early as its June 29-30 meeting to guard against a surge in 
inflation. The annual rate of inflation felt by consumers so far 
this year is 2.6 percent, compared to a 1.6 percent rise for all of 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets moved higher today in a continuing response to  
Wednesday's Labor Department report that inflation at the retail 
level barely budged in May, and on sheer relief that Greenspan had 
showed the Fed's hand so clearly. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets were relieved that the Fed is finally going to do  
something, but it won't be too drastic,'' said Eugene G. Mintz, 
financial markets analyst at Brown Brothers Harriman &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also didn't issue any dire warnings about the stock  
market, as he has done in the past, added Mintz. In his testimony, 
Greenspan said that while it is unclear if the stock market's 
current high prices represent a speculative ``bubble,'' the 
bursting of such a bubble needn't have catastrophic consequences 
for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Other economic news today showed the country's economic growth  
continues. The Labor Department reported that the number of 
Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 
28,000 last week to 297,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's trade deficit, meanwhile, held steady at a record  
high of $18.9 billion in April, matching the March figure. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq initially fell, affecting other technology stocks, after  
the computer maker predicted it would lose up to 15 cents a share 
in the second quarter, compared to a profit of 20 cents expected by 
Wall Street analysts. The company also announced a restructuring. 
Compaq was up 1/4 at 22 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	Other technology stocks shrugged off Compaq's news, and most  
moved higher. Intel fell 1 15/16 to 57 3/4, while Amazon.com rose 
13/16 to 112 1/2 and Yahoo! rose 1 3/8 to 143. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 552.02 million 
shares, down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.49 at 635.66, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.76 at 766.68.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Sorry for 'Carelessness' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Richard Holbrooke, nominee for U.S. ambassador  
to the United Nations, today apologized to the Senate for 
``carelessness'' that he said led to ``misconceptions'' about his 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms opened  
Holbrooke's confirmation hearing with sharp criticism, saying 
Holbrooke ignored legal advice that could have prevented conflicts 
of interest while he served as both a government adviser and 
private investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms, R-N.C., said Holbrooke accepted ``enormous fees'' for  
speeches about U.S. foreign policy. And he said the nominee 
``appears to have made no effort'' to observe a yearlong 
cooling-off period in contacting federal officials after leaving 
government service. 
</P>
<P>
	While insisting, ``I knew the law and I was careful to follow  
it,'' Holbrooke acknowledged that he failed to appreciate ``how 
complicated it would be to avoid misconceptions in some areas at 
some times because of the two roles''. 
</P>
<P>
	``With regret I must say that carelessness on occasion on my  
part contributed to these misconceptions,'' Holbrooke said. 
</P>
<P>
	The nominee said he would ``pay close attention'' to ethical  
matters if confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton first announced his intention to nominate the  
architect of the Bosnian peace accords a year ago, but the ethical 
questions delayed his formal nomination for eight months. 
Conservative Republicans were expected to batter Holbrooke during 
three days of hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	But one committee member, Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., told  
Holbrooke today he would support his nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke wore two hats as a Credit Suisse employee and an  
unpaid State Department adviser from 1996 to 1999. Helms said that 
``when Mr. Holbrooke called, U.S. ambassadors jumped. They hosted 
receptions, facilitated meetings and even accompanied him to meet 
with the particular country's top government leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Holbrooke could have avoided such conflicts of interest by  
seeking and following the advice'' of either Credit Suisse lawyers 
or State Department attorneys, Helms said. ``But time and again, 
the evidence shows Mr. Holbrooke either chose not to seek ethics 
advice or to ignore it when it was given.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke told the hearing that on visits to foreign countries  
``it was common courtesy to inform ambassadors'' of U.S. foreign 
policy goals and the ambassadors, in turn, asked him to meet with 
officials and businessmen in those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke said the meetings were part of his official role,  
adding that he settled a Justice Department civil case arising from 
such contacts with a $5,000 payment in order to allow his 
confirmation to move forward. He admitted no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	On a separate issue, the State Department inspector general  
cleared him of allegations that he improperly accepted private 
speaking fees last fall while trying to broker a peace deal on 
Kosovo for the Clinton administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Helms criticized the $900,000 that Holbrooke earned from 1996 --  
the year he left the State Department as a top official -- to 1999. 
The money was earned by speaking and writing ``about the very 
issues that were a part of his duties'' as a top State Department 
official, Helms said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's senior Democrat, Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware,  
defended Holbrooke, saying: ``I believe strongly that none of these 
matters even approach the level where they should be considered 
disqualifying. I do not believe for one minute that Richard 
Holbrooke is an unethical person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biden predicted confirmation once Republicans vent their anger  
on Holbrooke. He said Republicans want to depict Holbrooke as ``the 
architect of the Democratic failure in the Balkans,'' but added 
that the peace agreement in Kosovo undermined the argument. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke went to work for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.  
after resigning from the State Department, contacting the federal 
officials just months after quitting his job as assistant secretary 
of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Former government officials are not allowed to deal with their  
old colleagues on business matters for a year after leaving office. 
However, the Justice Department said there was no willful violation 
of the law. The contacts were clouded by Holbrooke's 
post-retirement role as a special government employee, advising 
U.S. diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
	Holbrooke negotiated last October's failed cease-fire in Kosovo  
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic -- and he made a 
last-minute visit to Belgrade in March in an unsuccessful effort to 
get Milosevic to accept NATO's terms for a Kosovo peace plan to 
avoid airstrikes against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic essentially agreed to those same terms last week,  
bringing the 11-week NATO bombing campaign to a close.

<HEADLINE>  India Puts Navy on Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The Indian navy is on alert following a  
buildup of Pakistan's fleet in apparent response to the fighting in 
Kashmir, India's naval chief said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan could launch an offensive on short notice, although its  
ships have adopted a defensive posture, said Adm. Sushil Kumar. 
``It is imperative for the Indian navy to prepare itself to prevent 
any surprises at sea,'' he told reporters in Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
	The stepped-up naval moves follow more than a month of fighting  
between the rival neighbors along their disputed Kashmir frontier. 
India has been battling to dislodge Islamic militants it says are 
led by Pakistani army regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan denies its troops are involved in the fighting and  
maintains that the guerrillas are Kashmiris battling for 
independence of the Himalayan territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan's navy has been on alert since last Friday, Kumar said.  
</P>
<P>
	In response to the Pakistani move, India put its naval squadrons  
on alert, moved warships from other bases and increased 
surveillance in the Arabian Sea, he said. The independent coast 
guard also was brought under the navy's command. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate response from Pakistan.  
</P>
<P>
	India, with 60 warships and submarines, outnumbers Pakistan's  
fleet of 16 that includes six submarines capable of launching 
anti-ship missiles, Kumar said. India's single aircraft carrier was 
being repaired. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kashmir, the army said it overran another position held by  
the militants in the central sector near the abandoned town of 
Dras. Two Indian soldiers were killed, and eight militants died in 
a barrage of artillery, said Col. Bikram Singh, the army spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	India has so far acknowledged 106 of its soldiers killed and  
nearly 250 wounded, while claiming more than 300 dead on the other 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	India controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the rest --  
although both claim the entire territory. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan, which both tested nuclear weapons last year,  
have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir, a Muslim-majority 
area whose Hindu ruler ceded the territory to India shortly after 
the two nations gained independence from Britain in 1947.

<HEADLINE> Education Dept. Lowers Loan Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Education Department, under fire for  
forgiving loans for students who falsely claimed death or 
disability, defended the cost and operation of its direct loan 
program to lawmakers on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Woods, who oversees the Education Department's loan  
division, touted a package of student loan fee discounts expected 
to save 2 million borrowers an average of $631. The new savings, 
modeled on discounts private lenders often give borrowers who repay 
early or electronically, were announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Mica, R-Fla., who oversees domestic issues on the  
House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, criticized the 
department nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	Department officials testified about the results of an internal  
audit, which found that nearly $4 million in student loans over a 
2 1/2-year period were forgiven for borrowers who were supposed to be 
dead but turned out to be alive and earning wages. Also, more than 
$73 million in loans were forgiven for people who claimed permanent 
disabilities but continued to work. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods told the panel the department would use wage garnishment  
and other means to recover the loans. The loans were forgiven 
mostly because the department didn't made sure lenders got original 
or certified copies of death certificates for discharges of loans 
based on a borrower's death. 
</P>
<P>
	He said department improvements include the new discounts --  
which will go to borrowers repaying loans electronically and those 
who consolidate their loans while they are in school or during the 
grace period before they are officially responsible for loan 
repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	The average total savings will be $631 over the life of a loan  
for the average graduate with a debt of $10,000 and a standard 
10-year repayment plan. A student with a loan that size will save 
an estimated $100 on the origination fee, $157 for the interest 
rate reduction for electronic debit repayment, and $374 for the 
in-school or grace consolidation savings. 
</P>
<P>
	These discounts are similar to those now offered to students by  
private lenders and guaranty agencies subsidized by the department 
to make loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's direct loans, begun in 1994, account for a  
third of the $32 billion student loan market.

<HEADLINE> World Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	To make sure they are up to the task, the 15 World Cup referees  
and their 16 assistants had to take the Cooper test Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The fitness test, which many people will remember from high  
school gym classes, includes two 50-meter sprints that must be 
completed in nine seconds each; a 12-minute run which must cover at 
least 2,400 meters; and two 200-meter sprints that must be 
completed in under 32 seconds apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	With the fitness test under their belts the referees and the  
assistants can start preparing for the opening games on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SOCCER LAB TEACHES KIDS THE ROPES:* New York's Bryant Park  
filled up with kids in soccer jerseys Thursday, ready to learn some 
new tricks in the Adidas Soccer Lab. They could practice their 
penalty shots, run an obstacle course or test their goal-keeping 
abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't all soccer, though. To attract other kids, there was a  
concert with such upcoming acts as Billie, C-Note and Cha Cha. 
</P>
<P>
	``The future is always the youth; we're really trying to capture  
the next generation with this,'' said Marla Messing, the president 
of the organizing committee of the Women's World Cup. ``Soccer is 
enormous with young kids in the U.S. The challenge is to keep them 
in the sport as they grow older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To make sure kids would come to the park, the organizer of the  
soccer lab, Nicole Vollebregt, invited schools from all over the 
New York metropolitan area to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The park was filled with several school classes. Some of the  
kids came wearing the soccer jerseys of the teams they played for. 
Others, like Jennifer Lesley, hadn't played soccer before. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most fun I've had in a while,'' said 12-year-old  
Lesley. She had taken a shot at being a goalkeeper, had her picture 
taken with her friend and waited for the C-Note concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar Soccer Labs will also be held in the other World Cup  
cities of Boston and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SUDDEN DEATH:* This Women's World Cup will be the first played  
with sudden-death overtime. The rule was introduced in youth 
competition and used in last year's men's World Cup in France. 
</P>
<P>
	In case of a tie after 90 minutes, the rule calls for two  
overtime periods of 15 minutes each. As soon as one of the teams 
scores, the game is over. In previous FIFA events, the full 30 
minutes of overtime was played, regardless of how many goals were 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's World Cup, the France-Paraguay quarterfinal was  
decided in overtime, and France went on to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FAMILY VALUES:* The Women's World Cup is making sure it's a  
family event. Game times are planned for late afternoons and early 
evenings to make sure the matches can be a ``family oriented 
thing'' in the stadiums, and for television, said Marla Messing, 
head of the organizing committee. 
</P>
<P>
	To attract not only young children but also teen-agers to  
matches, the organizers have planned concerts at the opening 
doubleheader. The group 'N Synch and British teen sensation Billie 
will appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Billie, only 16 herself, also sings the official song of the  
Women's World Cup ``Because We Want To.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Messing stresses the Women's World Cup is not  
exclusionary and welcomes all soccer fans, she does admit girls are 
an important audience for the games. and they have a strong 
connection with the teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly teen-age girls make up a significant population of  
soccer players, they're a key market,'' Messing said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Reports on Infectious Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the next hour alone, 1,500 people worldwide  
will die from infectious diseases, mostly children and working-age 
adults -- and many of the deaths could have been prevented for less 
than the cost of a few bottles of aspirin, the World Health 
Organization said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing countries are the most ravaged, and just six  
illnesses are by far the main killers: Tuberculosis, malaria, 
measles, diarrhea, AIDS and acute respiratory diseases like 
pneumonia and flu. 
</P>
<P>
	But the WHO's new assessment of infectious diseases says the  
impact goes far beyond impoverished countries: Not only can killer 
infections spread globally with a simple airplane ride, but 
developing countries won't grow economically unless their citizens 
are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors already have low-cost methods of preventing many of  
these illnesses, and good treatments for some. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bacteria and viruses are evolving to resist therapy, so  
now is ``a window of opportunity'' that, if missed, could mean 
catastrophe for the next century, said WHO infection chief Dr. 
David Heymann. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the tools, but they are becoming ineffective so we  
have to use them now,'' Heymann said in an interview. ``This is a 
wakeup call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His example of why timing is vital: Smallpox was declared  
eradicated the year AIDS started to appear. HIV-infected people 
cannot be vaccinated against smallpox because the vaccine 
overwhelms their weakened immune systems -- so if smallpox hadn't 
been wiped out in time, the AIDS era would have ensured it never 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	The WHO listed cost-effective priorities for developing  
countries: 
</P>
<P>
	--Drugs that treat AIDS may be too expensive for many developing  
countries, but just $14 for a year's supply of condoms could 
prevent infection in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	--An insecticide-soaked bednet to protect people from  
malaria-bearing mosquitos costs $10. 
</P>
<P>
	--Twenty-six cents buys a dose of measles vaccine.  
</P>
<P>
	--Thirty-three cents buys oral rehydration salts that can save a  
child dying from severe diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	--Twenty-seven cents buys five days of antibiotics for pneumonia.  
</P>
<P>
	One problem is raising the money. The WHO's $208 million budget  
for infectious diseases is still $50 million short. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaria, TB and AIDS together have killed 150 million people  
since 1945 -- six times the number of soldiers and civilians killed 
in wars since 1945, the WHO said. Yet global military spending was 
almost 60 times higher in 1995 alone than spending on treatment and 
prevention of those three deadly diseases, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WHO's report ``for the first time lays out a worldwide  
battle plan,'' said the Dr. Nils Daulaire of the Global Health 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
	His organization says Americans overwhelmingly support helping  
developing countries fight that battle: Eighty-five percent of 
1,200 Americans the council surveyed fear global spread of 
infections, and 90 percent said fighting the diseases at their 
source is crucial. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also aims to convince governments that illness causes  
poverty just as much as poverty causes illness, so that national 
policies reflect sound health programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, half of all infectious disease deaths are among people  
under 44, and many more of a country's prime workers and farmers 
are sickened. Rice production in Asia is slowed each year as 30,000 
workers in rice paddies catch Japanese encephalitis, the WHO noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sri Lanka's decade-long battle to reduce malaria, in contrast,  
boosted national income 13 percent, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many countries have not adopted WHO-recommended disease  
prevention programs. Only 41 countries provide AIDS education in 
schools, and only half have instituted the ``directly observed 
therapy'' proven to stop spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Under Fire From IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A senior member of the International  
Olympic Committee today said the biggest scandal in the movement's 
history was ``born from the people in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our marvelous, wonderful movement ... will always have been  
besmirched,'' Mexico's Mario Vazquez Rana told the Salt Lake 
organizers. `This is something that comes from that wonderful 
country that is the USA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rana, the media magnate who heads the world's national Olympic  
associations, was commenting on a progress report presented to the 
IOC by Mitt Romney, the new head of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee, and members of his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the vote-buying scandal surrounding Salt Lake's bid  
for the 2002 Winter Games stemmed from the actions of a few bid 
committee officials who have since been removed and are under 
investigation by both state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share the concern, the sense of outrage that something as  
lofty as the Olympic spirit could be tarnished by the actions of a 
few,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dedicated to the principle that a few people cannot  
ruin anything so great as the Olympics. The people of Salt lake 
City ... did not take those inappropriate actions. A few people 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But referring to the state and federal investigations into the  
bribery scandal, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch suggested 
some IOC members might be reluctant to visit the United States for 
fear they might be subpoenaed or charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the IOC executive board plans to meet in Salt Lake  
next year, Samaranch said, ``I hope before this meeting, as soon as 
possible, these problems can be over ... The past is past. The past 
was a good lesson for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least four IOC members were reportedly questioned by the FBI  
last month when they attended a Coordination Commission meeting in 
Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from Salt Lake bidders. The 
former two top Salt Lake bid and organizing committee officials 
lost their jobs in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding Vazquez Rana's charge that the people of Salt Lake  
were mostly at fault, Romney told a news conference: ``I'd suggest 
that perhaps the percentage of blame has been allocated too 
strongly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City was also criticized for underestimating the cost  
of the games when its bidding committee submitted its estimated 
budget, forcing the new organizing committee to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when we voted for Salt Lake four years ago, the  
budget was $790 million, not $1.45 billion,'' said Alex Gilady of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested Salt Lake and other bidding cities ``like to  
decorate'' their proposed budgets ``so we'll like it when we are 
voting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the reason Salt Lake's budget was so low was because  
``there is no effective equivalent of accounting principles passed 
from one games to the next. 
</P>
<P>
	``When our team got into the games, they learned they had been  
very naive and incomplete. They didn't know what the full cost 
would be. They didn't know information technology would be $200 
million ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said his organizing committee hopes to leave a detailed  
accounting that can be used by other cities in assessing costs and 
submitting bids.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Cautious on Productivity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve officials are keeping a wary  
eye on signs the economy could soon begin to overheat as U.S. 
consumers continue their buying binge and other countries begin to 
recover from two years of recession. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, scheduled to appear  
today before Congress, warned earlier this week that recent 
increases in American workers' productivity, which have so far held 
down inflation, cannot last forever. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists saw that as a strong hint the Fed will increase  
interest rates either at its next meeting June 29-30 or later this 
year. Many anticipated a more explicit warning when Greenspan talks 
about monetary policy today before the Joint Economic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	When interest rates go up, borrowing becomes more expensive,  
consumers and businesses tend to spend less and thus the economy 
eventually slows. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Fed policymakers said they were leaning toward  
raising interest rates at future meetings because of ``the 
potential for a buildup of inflationary imbalances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some long-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates, already  
have begun to climb a bit on their own because of expectations that 
the Fed will raise short-term rates. But further complicating the 
matter, the government reported Tuesday that inflation remained 
tame in May. That caused investors to relax slightly. The Dow Jones 
average of industrial stocks rose 190 points following the 
inflation report Wednesday, and open-market interest rates fell 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	But most economists warned they still expected the Fed to  
increase short-term rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong consumer demand has kept the U.S. economy growing even as  
some foreign countries have suffered through two years of 
recession. Now those countries -- especially Japan -- seem to be 
recovering and thus increasing their demand for U.S. products, 
taxing production capacity and thus, perhaps, leading to higher 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've seen strong domestic demand continue, and now we're  
seeing increasing foreign demand pressures,'' said David Jones, 
chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the United States, the Fed's latest survey of regional  
economies also found hints that economic growth is becoming unruly. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a construction boom spurred by brisk home sales has  
resulted in shortages of labor and materials, pushing building 
costs up in some parts of the country including around Chicago and 
St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	And employers in more regions are feeling pressures to raise  
wages, which can eventually lead to inflation: Factories in the St. 
Louis area are having trouble finding enough skilled workers to 
keep up with resurging demand, and Boston and New York stores are 
increasing wages to recruit new workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even with students looking for summer jobs, temporary employment  
firms have been unable to fill job openings. ``Anyone that can 
operate a personal computer can get a job,'' one employment agent 
in northern Virginia told Fed bankers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The danger is if the Fed allows the economy to continue to  
grow at this strong a pace, eventually ... it's going to cause some 
upward pressure on wages and prices,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed hasn't raised U.S. interest rates in more than four  
years. Last fall, it enacted three rate reductions in a successful 
effort to keep the global slowdown from disrupting the U.S. 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Americans Snapping Up Shredders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Shredders aren't just for government drones  
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more Americans are turning to the devices as a form of  
protection against thieves who comb the nation's trash for 
lucrative personal information. 
</P>
<P>
	Mari Frank, the author of the Identity Theft Survival Kit,  
discovered three years ago that a woman had used her name to rack 
up $50,000 in purchases, including a red Mustang convertible. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tell everybody they should have a shredder just like they  
have a toaster,'' said Ms. Frank, who has two in her Southern 
California home. ``I think you're negligent if you don't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 9 million shredders were sold in the United States  
last year, said Terri Considine, product manager for Fellowes, an 
Itasca, Ill.-based shredder maker. At the start of the decade, 
sales hovered around 100,000, manufacturers say. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are scared. That's what it is,'' said David Joachim,  
marketing director for Royal Consumer Business Products, which sold 
nearly 3 million shredders last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales began to take off in the mid-1990s, triggered,  
manufacturers say, by falling prices, the rise of home offices and 
soaring reports of credit card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got a growing sense of paranoia which isn't  
unrealistic,'' said Todd Henreckson, director of Addison, 
Ill.-based General Binding Corp.'s shredding division. 
</P>
<P>
	With shredders costing as little as $20, many people are finding  
it easier to take preventative action against thievery. 
</P>
<P>
	But what should you shred?  
</P>
<P>
	General Binding recommends ATM receipts, pay stubs, pre-approved  
credit card applications, report cards, checks, magazine address 
labels, used airline tickets and anything with a signature. 
</P>
<P>
	A Social Security number fished from the trash is enough to  
secure one of the ubiquitous pre-approved credit card offers and a 
$10,000 line of credit, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Shredders have been around since 1898, when an Austrian  
artillery officer, worried his ballistics drawings would fall into 
the wrong hands, built a foot-powered device that chopped up paper, 
according to General Binding. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the Cold War, electric shredders have become a way of life  
for intelligence agencies, the Pentagon and the White House. In 
1988, the U.S. Supreme Court put America's trash up for grabs, 
ruling that privacy rights do not extend to curbside garbage. 
</P>
<P>
	Private investigator Richard Jerscheid says he has caught  
cheating husbands from a slip of paper with a woman's name and 
number on it that was tossed into the trash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trash tells a lot,'' he said. ``People get sloppy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Even the powerful aren't immune. In 1975, a reporter swiped five  
bags of trash from the home of then-Secretary of State Henry 
Kissinger. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerscheid has shredders in both his Pasadena and Rosedale, Md.,  
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	His advice: ``Watch what you throw away.''

	Ethnic Albanians Return to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	MORINI BORDER CROSSING, Albania (AP) -- NATO forces, Albanian  
policemen and Kosovo rebels struggled to control the thousands of 
ethnic Albanian refugees lining up Thursday in battered trucks and 
tractors to go home. International aid agencies urged the refugees 
to wait a few more days. NATO forces appeared unprepared to deal 
with the flood of desperate people. Accelerating the returns were 
reports in the camps of Albanian looters crossing the border to 
prey on the abandoned homes of refugees. KLA rebels -- unarmed and 
in civilian clothes -- were helping the German soldiers who are 
running the border station recognize Albanians mixed among the 
refugees and turning them back.

	U.S.-Russia Talks Snagged  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- U.S. and Russian negotiators failed  
today to reach agreement on Moscow's peacekeeping role in Kosovo. 
The sticking point is Russia's insistence on having its own sector 
to patrol. The talks headed by Defense Secretary William Cohen and 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and their Russian 
counterparts were to resume tomorrow morning, a spokesman said. 
Officials said Cohen was urging the Russians to accept a geographic 
patrol area within one of the already established five peacekeeping 
sectors in Kosovo, thereby avoiding a split between NATO and 
non-NATO areas.

	NASA Discloses Space Station Botch  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Flight controllers botched an  
attempt to move the new international space station out of the way 
of a speeding piece of space junk, but the rocket debris ended up 
passing at a safe distance. The incident was disclosed by NASA 
today. NASA said the sequence of computer commands sent up by 
flight controllers to fire the station's engines failed because of 
human error. If the rocket debris had collided with the space 
station, it could have destroyed the empty outpost, which has been 
in orbit for only seven months. The first residents are not due to 
arrive until next spring.

month to leave the post. Summers received the support of many 
members of the Senate Finance Committee, which held a hearing on 
his nomination. The committee's chairman, William Roth, R-Del.,

<HEADLINE> WHO Reports on Infectious Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 1,500 people, mostly children and  
working-age adults, will die in the next hour from infectious 
diseases, many that could be prevented for less than the cost of a 
few bottles of aspirin, the World Health Organization said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a new assessment of infections' global toll, the WHO found  
just six illnesses are by far the main killers: Tuberculosis, 
malaria, measles, diarrhea, AIDS and acute respiratory diseases 
like pneumonia and flu. 
</P>
<P>
	Although developing countries are the most ravaged, everyone is  
threatened, the report said: Not only can killer infections spread 
globally with a simple airplane ride, but developing countries 
won't grow economically unless their citizens are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors already have low-cost methods of preventing many of  
these illnesses, and good treatments for some. 
</P>
<P>
	But the bacteria and viruses are evolving to resist therapy, so  
now is ``a window of opportunity'' that, if missed, could mean 
catastrophe for the next century, said WHO infection chief Dr. 
David Heymann. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the tools, but they are becoming ineffective so we  
have to use them now,'' Heymann said in an interview. ``This is a 
wakeup call.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His example of why timing is vital: Smallpox was declared  
eradicated just as AIDS started to appear. HIV-infected people 
cannot be vaccinated against smallpox because the vaccine 
overwhelms their weakened immune systems -- so if smallpox hadn't 
been wiped out in time, the AIDS era would have ensured it never 
was. 
</P>
<P>
	The WHO listed cost-effective priorities for developing  
countries: 
</P>
<P>
	--Drugs that treat AIDS may be too expensive for many developing  
countries, but just $14 for a year's supply of condoms could 
prevent infection in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	--An insecticide-soaked bednet to protect people from  
malaria-bearing mosquitos costs $10. 
</P>
<P>
	--Twenty-six cents buys a dose of measles vaccine.  
</P>
<P>
	--Thirty-three cents buys oral rehydration salts that can save a  
child dying from severe diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
	--Twenty-seven cents buys five days of antibiotics for pneumonia.  
</P>
<P>
	One problem is raising the money. The WHO's $208 million budget  
for infectious diseases is still $50 million short. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaria, TB and AIDS together have killed 150 million people  
since 1945 -- six times the number of soldiers and civilians killed 
in wars since 1945, the WHO said. Yet global military spending was 
almost 60 times higher in 1995 alone than spending on treatment and 
prevention of those three deadly diseases, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WHO ``for the first time lays out a worldwide battle plan,''  
said the Dr. Nils Daulaire of the Global Health Council. 
</P>
<P>
	His organization says Americans overwhelmingly support helping  
developing countries fight that battle: Eighty-five percent of 
1,200 Americans the council surveyed fear global spread of 
infections, and 90 percent said fighting the diseases at their 
source is crucial. The poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also aims to convince governments that illness causes  
poverty just as much as poverty causes illness, so that national 
policies reflect sound health programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, half of all infectious disease deaths are among people  
under 44, and many more of a country's prime workers and farmers 
are sickened. Rice production in Asia is slowed each year as 30,000 
workers in rice paddies catch Japanese encephalitis, the WHO noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Sri Lanka's decade-long battle to reduce malaria, in contrast,  
boosted national income 13 percent, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet many countries have not adopted WHO-recommended disease  
prevention programs. Only 41 countries provide AIDS education in 
schools, and only half have instituted the ``directly observed 
therapy'' proven to stop spread of drug-resistant tuberculosis.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Offensive tackle Andy Heck, cut by Chicago  
this month, has signed a one-year, $450,000 contract with the 
Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	Heck, whose contract includes a $150,000 signing bonus, is

	Heck (6-6, 298) signed with Chicago prior to the 1994 season. He  
has started 76 of 80 games at left tackle for the Bears. Last 
season, he started 14 games with Chicago, missing two weeks because 
of a broken big toe and was cut by the Bears in a salary cap move.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Labor Strike Overshadowed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Thousands of South Korean metal  
workers walked off the job Thursday in a one-day strike that drew 
little worker support amid rekindled military confrontation with 
communist North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	The militant Korea Confederation of Trade Unions called on its  
member unions to strike in protest of an alleged government plot to 
break the labor movement. 
</P>
<P>
	But only about 7,000 workers in six small work sites heeded the  
call, joining 20,000 workers already on strike for unrelated 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar one-day strike call Wednesday by another umbrella  
group, the Korea Federation of Trade Unions, drew fewer than 10,000 
workers, the Labor Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry spokesman Lee Jeong-taik attributed the lack of support  
to heightened tension off the west coast of the divided Korean 
peninsula, where North and South Korean navy vessels exchanged fire 
in disputed waters three days ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are concerned about the national security,'' Lee said.  
``For now, labor unrest is not a big problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two labor groups have threatened strikes by ``hundreds of  
thousands of members'' since media reported last week that 
prosecutors incited an illegal strike last year to give them an 
excuse to crack down on the labor movement. 
</P>
<P>
	State prosecutors were accused of plotting with managers of the  
government-run Korea Security Printing and Minting Corp. to trick 
unionized workers into staging an illegal strike by announcing 
large layoffs. The government denied the accusation and said it was 
willing to let an independent prosecutor probe the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The two unions, which claim 2 million members, said they will  
organize bigger strikes later this month when they hoped the 
military tension will have subsided.

<HEADLINE> Stanley Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres were longshots before the  
Stanley Cup finals started. Now they're facing even bigger odds 
after losing 2-0 to the Dallas Stars on Thursday night and falling 
behind 3-2 in the series. 
</P>
<P>
	In 15 previous finals tied 2-2, the winning team in Game 5 has  
gone on to win the Stanley Cup 12 times. 
</P>
<P>
	The teams who lost Game 5 who won the title: the Detroit Red  
Wings in 1950, the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1964 and the Montreal 
Canadiens in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CLOSE AS CAN BE:* The Stars and Sabres split two regular-season  
games and there hasn't been much to separate them in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
	They have either been tied or a goal apart for all but 5:05 in  
the first five games, including an overtime battle in Game 1. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *VETERAN LINEUP:* There was an experienced lineup on the ice for  
Thursday night's Stanley Cup finals game, and it wasn't only the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the on-ice officials had worked a total of 32 Stanley  
Cup finals among them: 18 for linesman Ray Scapinello and eight 
each for referees Kerry Fraser and Don Koharski. Linesman Jay 
Sharrers was the only one without experience in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *A REAL DALLAS STAR:* The Dallas Stars brought out their big gun  
Thursday night. No, not Brett Hull. 
</P>
<P>
	It was B.J. Thomas, who sang the national anthem.  
</P>
<P>
	Whenever Thomas sings it, the Stars are unbeaten. Thursday  
night's game made the record a perfect 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BLACK AND BLUE LINE:* One of the Dallas Stars' lines on  
Thursday night featured three players recently hobbled by injuries 
-- Brett Hull (groin), Mike Modano (wrist) and Benoit Hogue (knee). 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CROWDED:* The crowd of 17,001 at Thursday night's Stanley Cup  
finals game marked the 49th straight sellout at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TAKING HIS SHOT:* Dallas Stars rookie Jon Sim has made it a  
habit of shooting the puck the length of the ice into the opposing 
team's net after every pregame skate. It sends a charge through the 
stands and an annoying message to the other team. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday night, the Sabres turned their net over so Sim  
couldn't do it. Sim instead shot the puck at Dwayne Rolossn as the 
Buffalo goalie was exiting the ice. Roloson shot the puck back, and 
Sim quickly returned the favor before the goalie gloved the puck 
and skated off. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, one of the Reunion Arena crew turned the net up so Sim  
could make his shot. Buffalo's Rob Ray, still hanging around at the 
Stars' end, playfully put a puck into the Dallas net. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FATHER'S DAY:* What better way to spend the Father's Day  
weekend than to watch your son coach in the Stanley Cup finals? 
</P>
<P>
	Leeson Ruff will have that opportunity this week.  
</P>
<P>
	Ruff, of course, is the father of Buffalo Sabres coach Lindy  
Ruff. He flew into Dallas to watch Thursday night's Game 5 between 
the Stars and Sabres at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	When the series shifts to Buffalo for Game 6 on Saturday, Leeson  
Ruff will be there, too. 
</P>
<P>
	A retired farmer, he has been driving a school bus.  
</P>
<P>
	``He missed the first couple of games but got there for the home  
games, and I think it is great,'' Ruff said of his father. ``It is 
an opportunity of a lifetime for both of us, and it is great to 
enjoy this time of year with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He spent a lot of time hauling me from rink to rink when I was  
a kid, along with my three other brothers. Finally, he gets to reap 
a little bit of the benefits 30 years later.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NERVOUS TIME:* Buffalo's Dixon Ward says playing in the Stanley  
Cup finals is ``nerve-wracking.'' Still, he loves it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wouldn't be any fun if it wasn't nerve-wracking,'' he said  
prior to Thursday night's Game 5 against Dallas. ``It wouldn't be 
worth fighting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His least enjoyable times at the finals?  
</P>
<P>
	``Sitting and waiting, it's tough to deal with,'' Ward said.  
``You just want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RANDY'S ROLLING:* The last week has been a real stretch for  
Randy Cunneyworth, who played in the American Hockey League's 
Calder Cup finals before coming into the Stanley Cup finals in Game 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	The difference between the two finals?  
</P>
<P>
	``Down there, you were talking to one or two reporters after  
games,'' said the Buffalo Sabres forward as dozens of reporters and 
cameramen jammed the overcrowded Sabres locker room and jockeyed 
for position. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GOALIES' GLORY:* Goals are tough to come by in this year's  
finals and Dallas coach Ken Hitchcock says it has been a tribute to 
the goaltenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``These games are 2-1 because of the guys in goal,'' Hitchcock  
said, referring to the Stars' Ed Belfour and Dominik Hasek of the 
Sabres. ``They are not 2-1 because of the style of the game. There 
are a lot of scoring chances. ... these games easily could be 4-3 
or 5-3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sabres and Stars combined for 17 goals in the first four  
games -- the lowest total in 30 years in the finals. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BUFFALOED AT HOME:* Ken Hitchcock had better watch his behavior  
during games, especially when he's shown on television after a 
mistake by one of his players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas coach displayed his frustration in no uncertain terms  
after the Stars gave up a goal to the Sabres after a breakdown in 
Game 4. It was caught on television, naturally, and he had to 
answer to it at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``Boy, my wife gave it to me for that,'' Hitchcock said. ``That,  
and spitting ... whoa!'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DYNAMIC DIXON:* How important has Dixon Ward been to the Sabres  
in the playoffs? They're 7-0 when he scores, that's all. 
</P>
<P>
	``That sums up that line,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff says of the  
line including Ward, Michael Peca and Vaclav Varada. ``When our 
so-called checking line scores, it puts us in real good shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SEVEN UP? With the Sabres and Stars so evenly matched, it's not  
unlikely the Stanley Cup finals will go seven games. If it does, it 
will be a rarity. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the finals were extended to a best-of-7 series in 1939,  
there have been only 10 of the 60 series that have gone the limit. 
The last to do it were the New York Rangers and Vancouver Canucks 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Another rarity in this year's finals: The teams were tied 2-2  
after four games. That hasn't happened since the 1991 finals 
between Pittsburgh and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *FRONT-RUNNERS:* Don't let the Buffalo Sabres get the lead on  
you going into the third period. They're 9-0 in such situations in 
this year's playoffs, including 7-0 at home.

<HEADLINE> Warner-Lambert Loses in Pfizer Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Drugmakers Pfizer and Warner-Lambert are  
studying making the first pill that controls both high blood 
pressure and high cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
	About 27 million Americans suffer from both conditions, which  
increase the risk of having a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership is just the latest for the two pharmaceutical  
titans. For two years, they have worked together to sell Lipitor, 
the nation's biggest selling cholesterol-lowering drug with sales 
expected to reach $3.3 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they want to combine its benefits with those of Pfizer's  
Norvasc, the nation's top selling blood pressure drug in what could 
be a blockbuster. Norvasc, Pfizer's top drug, had $2.6 billion in 
1998 sales. 
</P>
<P>
	A combination Lipitor-Norvasc pill could take four years or more  
to bring to market, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Pfizer on Wednesday gave Warner-Lambert the right to  
co-promote and split profits of its upcoming migraine drug Relpax. 
The move fulfills their 1997 agreement to co-market Lipitor. 
</P>
<P>
	But it's highly doubtful that Relpax will make even half as much  
money as Lipitor. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Lipitor should generate $3.3 billion in sales -- five  
times the $600 million in expected peak sales of Relpax. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert retains the option to re-open the deal with the  
New York-based Pfizer if it is unsatisfied with Relpax sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem Warner-Lambert faced in completing its drug  
marketing deal with Pfizer is that its partner had nothing in its 
pipeline expected to garner sales approaching Lipitor's level. The 
Morris Plains, N.J.-based Warner-Lambert reportedly was seeking to 
share profits from multiple Pfizer drugs, but Pfizer maintained 
their agreement only called for it to share rights to a single 
product. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company would comment on the details of the Lipitor  
agreement, except that Warner-Lambert said it retains most of 
Lipitor profits. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2002, Lipitor sales are expected to hit $5 billion, making it  
the world's best-selling prescription drug. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is difficult to get a quid (pro quo) on any product the  
magnitude of Lipitor,'' said Peter B. Corr, president of research 
and development at Warner-Lambert's drug division Parke-Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner-Lambert officials maintain they're getting a good deal  
from Pfizer. Relpax should do well because studies show it works 
more quickly than existing migraine drugs, they say. Still, about 
95 million Americans have high cholesterol compared to about 20 
million who suffer from migraine headaches. 
</P>
<P>
	Relpax is awaiting federal approval, which is expected to come  
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipitor, which benefited greatly from Pfizer's massive field  
staff, has made Warner-Lambert the fastest growing major drugmaker 
the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were hoping the completion of the Pfizer deal could  
have provided an incremental earnings boost. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the wild card in Warner-Lambert's bull story, and I  
think the wild card has come up empty,'' said Jack Lamberton, an 
analyst with HSBC Securities.

<HEADLINE> Poll Finds Support for Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans strongly support legal gambling  
despite concerns about the integrity of sporting events and the 
threat of addiction, a new poll shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly two-thirds of American adults approve of legal gambling,  
according to a Gallup poll released Wednesday. Three-quarters of 
those surveyed said they approve of state lotteries, while 67 
percent said that opening a casino helps a community's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those who approve of gambling reasoned that people  
should have the right to choose what to do with their money and how 
to enjoy their free time. 
</P>
<P>
	But the poll did not represent an unqualified endorsement of  
gambling, which has grown substantially in the past two decades. 
Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia now run lotteries; 
commercial casinos operate in 10 states, and Indian tribes have 
opened casinos in at least 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost half of those polled favored maintaining the current  
level of legal gambling, while 22 percent favored expansion, 16 
percent wanted to roll it back and 13 percent supported a gambling 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a clear distinction in Americans' minds about the  
economic benefits of casinos and the social impact on the 
communities in which they operate,'' Gallup reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-five percent of the adults surveyed said legalized  
gambling ``is creating a compulsive gambling problem in this 
country,'' and 68 percent said they believe sports betting leads to 
cheating or fixing games. 
</P>
<P>
	The gambling industry may face a popularity problem in the  
future, as the teen-agers who were polled, more than the adults, 
saw a dark side to gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 52 percent of teen-agers polled said they approve of legal  
gambling, compared with two-thirds of the adults. Asked to assess 
the statement that gambling harms respect for the value of hard 
work, 58 percent of the teens agreed strongly or somewhat, compared 
with 43 percent of adults. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallup's telephone poll of 1,523 adults and 501 teen-agers from  
April 30-May 23 carries an error margin of plus or minus 3 
percentage points for adults, 5 percentage points for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Ludwig, vice president at Gallup, cautioned that teen-agers  
have a more narrow definition of ``gambling'' than do adults, a 
majority of whom included stock market trading and office pools 
under the term. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said, ``Teens tend to be a little more conservative  
than adults, a little more skeptical toward gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gallup timed the poll to precede a lengthy report on gambling in  
America. After two years of work, the nine-member National Gambling 
Impact Study Commission will release its report Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission's report and Gallup's poll are in concert on core  
concepts: They agree that many Americans enjoy gambling, that 
casinos bring jobs with them when they enter a community, but that 
there are consequences, chief among them gambling addiction. 
</P>
<P>
	In the poll, a majority of adults approved of a wide variety of  
gambling, from bingo to horse-racing, but disapproved of two forms: 
video poker machines at local establishments and betting on 
professional sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the commission frowned upon the proliferation of  
video poker machines and, in a divided vote, recommended a ban on 
legalized betting on collegiate sports.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Open Lower / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower today as fears of inflation  
inched back and investors swept in to take profits on recovering 
technology shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 41.15 at 10,743.80. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index fell 0.19 to 2,517.64 after rising  
103.16 Wednesday for its largest one-day point gain. Profit-takers 
and Compaq Computer's announcement of another disappointing profit 
outlook halted the Nasdaq's advance today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 3.39 to 1,327.02.  
</P>
<P>
	Investors were warily waiting for Federal Reserve Chairman Alan  
Greenspan's appearance today before Congress, hoping for further 
clues on the Fed's plans. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has issued strong hints that it will increase interest  
rates -- for the first time in four years -- at its next meeting June 
29-30 or later this year to keep the expansion in check. This week, 
Greenspan warned that recent increases in American workers' 
productivity, which have so far held down inflation, cannot last 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, the annual rate of inflation felt by consumers  
is 2.6 percent, compared to a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998, the 
smallest in a dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 9-to-7 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 87.19 million shares, 
down from Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 1.35 at 630.82, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 2.18 at 762.74. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.17 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.72 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.83 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
1.44 percent.

<HEADLINE> NASA Discloses Space Station Botch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Flight controllers botched an  
attempt to move the new international space station out of the way 
of a speeding piece of space junk, but the rocket debris ended up 
passing at a safe distance. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was disclosed by NASA on Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	NASA said the sequence of computer commands sent up by flight  
controllers to fire the station's engines failed because of human 
error. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, the U.S. military organization that tracks objects in  
space predicted the rocket chunk would pass within two-thirds of a 
mile of the space station on Sunday. It ended up coming no closer 
than 4 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The rocket debris was Russian in origin and fairly large,  
although its exact dimensions were not immediately known. If it had 
collided with the space station, it could have destroyed the empty 
outpost, which has been in orbit for only seven months. The first 
residents are not due to arrive until next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Measures already have been taken to prevent this from happening  
again, said Frank Culbertson, NASA deputy program manager for space 
station operations. 
</P>
<P>
	At last count, the U.S. Space Command in Colorado Springs,  
Colo., was tracking more than 8,700 manmade objects in orbit, most 
of that junk. With an orbital speed of 17,500 mph, any one of them 
could do serious damage to the space station, which consists of 
only two compartments so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very glad we learned what we learned at this point in the  
mission before we have more hardware up there and before we have 
people up there,'' Culbertson said. But he noted that if astronauts 
had been aboard, they could have maneuvered the space station more 
easily than ground controllers. 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering command, drawn up by both U.S. and Russian  
engineers, was sent from the Russian control center outside Moscow 
on Saturday night. But the command contained faulty instructions, 
and the space station's computers rejected it. The station was left 
without motion control for an entire orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	Culbertson said it wasn't immediately clear whether Americans or  
Russians were to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time flight controllers learned of their mistake, it was  
too late to send up a corrected debris-avoiding command. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, the Space Command soon revised the projected  
distance between the two objects from 0.6 miles to 4 1/2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the second time in less than three months that NASA has  
reported erroneous station commanding. In late April, Russian 
flight controllers mistakenly ordered a motor to turn on and move 
the space station's solar wings; fortunately, onboard computers 
detected the error and shut off power to the motor.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Judge Denies Fixing Murder Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former judge imprisoned on a racketeering  
conviction denied he ever sold leniency to murder defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bribes? Definitely not,'' said former Circuit Judge Thomas  
Maloney, who arrived in court Wednesday in chains and a bright 
orange federal inmate jumpsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney testified in the case of William Bracy and Roger  
Collins, whom he sent to death row. The men are seeking a new trial 
because they claim Maloney treated them severely to camouflage his 
leniency in other cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney is serving a 15-year sentence for his 1993 conviction on  
four charges involving payoffs to fix cases. Supreme Court Chief 
Justice William Rehnquist once wrote that Maloney's trial showed he 
was ``thoroughly steeped in corruption.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his conviction, the 74-year-old former jurist repeatedly  
denied Wednesday that he took bribes or was unjustly severe, and 
said witnesses who claimed he did so were corrupt themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney's attorney opened the proceedings by telling U.S.  
District Judge William T. Hart he had urged his client to invoke 
the Fifth Amendment and refuse to answer any questions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Collins said Maloney wanted to testify, apparently to avoid  
any suggestion that he was finally admitting guilt.

<HEADLINE> Gore Would Welcome Run by First Lady </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore says a U.S. Senate bid by  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton would be ``a positive force'' and 
generate Democratic enthusiasm throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Heading into New York on his first full day as a formal  
presidential candidate, Gore was talking ``real specifics'' about 
his programs, but also was asked what impact the first lady would 
have in a key campaign state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm all for it,'' Gore told reporters on Air Force Two as it  
flew to New York for Gore to give an outdoor speech on Wall Street. 
``It will generate enthusiasm here and around the country. Aides 
were even more direct, saying likely Republican assaults on Mrs. 
Clinton would galvanize women voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Campaign chairman Tony Coelho said Mrs. Clinton would  
undoubtedly draw heated attacks during such a race, drawing 
resentment from women voters about the GOP attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are already honing charges she's a carpetbagger, and  
are certain to revisit sex scandals at the White House and 
financial investigations in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the idea of Republicans attacking her,'' said Coelho.  
``If Republicans want to beat up on women, that's fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has announced plans to form an exploratory  
committee and is widely expected to seek the U.S. Senate seat in 
New York, a campaign that is certain to get heavy national 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband told reporters over dinner in Cologne, Germany, that  
nothing is definite. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really have no idea what she's going to do,'' President  
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some suggestions that Mrs. Clinton would compete  
with Gore for campaign cash in a state that traditionally bankrolls 
Democratic presidential candidates, but Coelho dismissed that 
possibility. Gore's fund raising will largely be over by the time 
the fall campaign heats up, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those people who talk about conflicts don't know about the  
business of fund raising,'' said Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
	Even some Republicans maintain there is plenty of money for both  
Gore and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she's potentially a huge factor in his campaign, but  
not financially,'' veteran New York GOP operative Jay Severin said. 
``They are both going to have more money than they need. 
</P>
<P>
	``The greatest danger is not financial, but ideological,''  
Severin said. ``It is that Gore (in New York) gets caught in the 
gravitational pull of Hillary, and it may not help him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore stuck to familiar campaign themes at an appearance Thursday  
night at the Hotel Pierre in Manhattan, promising to work toward 
greater equality for women and minorities, guarantee after-school 
programs for children at-risk and quality preschool for all 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	He talked of family values -- saying his mother, one of the  
earliest graduates of Vanderbilt Law School, inspired him to work 
for women's causes and his father instilled a belief of civil 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his honor, I begin this campaign with a pledge that the  
progress we've made towards civil rights in America is only the 
beginning ... We have much more work to do to get to the promised 
land in the 21st century to banish prejudice and inequality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides said Gore was beginning to stake out his own record in the  
delicate job facing every vice president seeking the top spot, 
trying to distance himself from the White House while not seeming 
disloyal. 
</P>
<P>
	``To begin unshackling from the vice presidency is the key,''  
said Coelho. ``We need to break free of the vice presidency.''

	MANDAN, N.D. (AP) -- Slapping a tariff on imported wheat would  
help deter foreign sales in the United States at a time when 
American farmers are not covering their own costs, Republican 
presidential candidate Pat Buchanan said Thursday in North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	He advocates a tariff on imported farm commodities to equalize  
the price with U.S. production. The revenue can be used to cut 
taxes elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the price of wheat falls below the cost of production,  
why are you importing wheat? That simply kills your family farms,'' 
Buchanan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan was making his second campaign trip in four months to  
North Dakota, where Republicans are holding an early statewide 
presidential caucus on Feb. 29. The newspaper columnist and 
television commentator was opening his state headquarters in 
Bismarck during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the state held a February presidential primary  
election, which was won by Bob Dole, the eventual GOP nominee. 
Buchanan finished third among eight candidates, behind Dole and 
publisher Steve Forbes. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials in both parties, as well as wheat farmers and  
agricultural groups, often complain about Canadian wheat exports 
into the United States, claiming the wheat is being sold below its 
own cost of production. Buchanan said agricultural interests are 
given short shrift in trade negotiations.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Conservative activist and talk show radio host  
Alan Keyes, who failed in a 1996 bid for the Oval Office, formed a 
presidential exploratory committee on Thursday for the 2000 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes, who twice ran for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, has also  
worked as a State Department official. He is now the host of a 
radio talk show popular with many conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyes is a conservative African-American who argues abortion and  
a decline in religion are behind the nation's woes. He spares 
neither Democrats nor Republicans and has criticized ``a political 
elite so utterly estranged from any connection to the people,'' as 
he said in Iowa last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Keyes has gotten little attention, he has the potential  
to split the votes of social conservatives who like his message 
even though his chances of winning seem remote.

	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- GOP presidential hopeful Gary Bauer, who  
was in Memphis Thursday for a fund raiser at a private residence, 
accused President Clinton and Vice President Gore of weakening 
national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing before the Memphis Belle, a famous WWII bomber on  
display at a Memphis park, he accused the Clinton administration, 
including Democratic front-runner Gore, of failing to fund national 
defense adequately. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have military capacity at dangerous levels at the same  
time that the president and the vice president have made more and 
more (military) commitments abroad,'' Bauer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he favors a $50 billion increase in defense spending  
over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	That money, Bauer said, could come from a budget surplus and  
wasteful government programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is plenty of waste in Washington,'' he said.

<P>
	Schnur has political ties to two McCain rivals, Texas Gov.  
George W. Bush and former Vice President Dan Quayle, but said 
McCain's policy stands and personal background drew him to the 
Arizona senator. 
</P>
<P>
	``After eight years of Clinton, voters are ready for someone who  
talks to them straight, and who's got the personal credibility to 
make it stick,'' Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain called Schnur ``one of America's best political  
communicators,'' and cited his experience in California politics as 
a key reason for his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	California is holding its earliest-ever primary in March, and  
McCain has said he is making the state a key target of his 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Schnur said in a phone interview that his job would be to make  
sure that all the people in key states like New Hampshire and 
California ``can recite the John McCain story by heart by next 
January.''

<HEADLINE> Philly Tears Down Sinking Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- As newly homeless owners watched, workers  
moved into a neighborhood today and began tearing down 70-year-old 
rowhouses that were slowly sinking into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hegerman Street residents at least got some good news today  
with word that authorities planned to provide state aid to help 
cover their losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of sliding eggs and floors so slanted that the doors  
stuck were nothing new to residents on Hegerman, who for years had 
complained of construction problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Roseanne Allen recalled what happened when she was recently  
visiting her son, David. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was cooking an egg in the frying pan, and it slid out and  
fell on the kitchen floor,'' Allen said. ``I couldn't believe my 
eyes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The homes were built in the 1920s on old creek beds filled with  
a 21-foot layer of ash and cinders. As residents complained about 
crooked floors and windows, the city buttressed several of the 
homes, then determined two months ago that the problem had 
worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, an immediate evacuation was ordered for residents of  
seven small, meticulously maintained rowhouses. 
</P>
<P>
	Workers began the demolition today by hammering bricks and  
taking out a window, as homeowners and neighbors lined the sidewalk 
across the street to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Washburn, 59, was upset that he and his family had to  
vacate their house on such short notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wonder what the response would be if I walked up to  
(Mayor Edward G.) Rendell and said, 'Hey, you and your family, get 
out.' It would be a little different story, wouldn't it?'' said 
Washburn, a millwright. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials were expected to announce $1.25 million in state aid  
to the homeowners at a news conference this afternoon, The 
Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The money is the first government 
aid to be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
	Rendell initially said the city would not reimburse residents  
because the neighborhood was built before the city regulated home 
construction. Residents said their homeowners insurance policies 
will not cover the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	City and state officials are inspecting the site to determine  
whether sewer work done by the city in 1996 worsened the problem. 
That possibility was raised this week after a resident produced a 
videotape he shot that shows stream water flowing through a 30-foot 
trench dug by the crews. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuation order for seven homes came Friday. City-leased  
moving vans rumbled down the narrow street and crews hurriedly 
loaded belongings from the small rowhouses. People scrambled to 
pack; many cleaned and swept out their homes before closing the 
doors forever. Some residents went to stay with relatives; others 
stayed in hotel suites paid for by the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors also are looking over five more homes on Devereaux  
Avenue to determine whether they, too, must be evacuated. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, my house is already condemned -- I won't be able  
to sell it now. I'm a working-class stiff. What am I supposed to 
do?'' said Joseph McDowell, a 22-year resident of the block. ``I'll 
end up paying a mortgage on a hole in the ground.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Building houses over stream beds and flood plains was standard  
practice during the early part of the century in Philadelphia and 
across the country, said Anne Whiston Spirn, professor of landscape 
architecture and co-director of urban studies at the University of 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether such homes will eventually cave in depends on the type  
of fill and the construction of the foundations, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia has seen the problem before. In 1987, the city paid  
about $20 million to bail out homeowners in the Logan section after 
about 1,000 homes were found to be sinking. Underground streams had 
eroded the ash landfill under the 80-year-old homes.

<HEADLINE> Frontier Won't Act on Qwest Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frontier Corp., a small long-distance telephone  
company, said Thursday it would take no action on the $11.3 billion 
unsolicited takeover offer from upstart Qwest, and would proceed 
with its plans to merge with Global Crossing Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest Communications International Inc. made its bold offer to  
Frontier on Sunday along with a companion $32.3 billion bid to 
acquire U S West Inc., a Denver-based Baby Bell telephone company. 
Both U S West and Frontier, based in Rochester, N.Y., have agreed 
to combine their operations with Global Crossing, a nascent 
communications company that is building a vast undersea cable 
network for Internet traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	``The current circumstances surrounding the Qwest proposal do  
not warrant any change at this time in our current initiatives that 
are designed to move Frontier's transaction with Global Crossing 
toward a prompt closing,'' Joseph P. Clayton, Frontier's chief 
executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's takeover offers, which consist mostly of Qwest stock,  
quickly lost much of their appeal Monday as skeptical investors 
bailed out, sending Qwest's shares down 24 percent. The stock has 
since recovered slightly, but only enough to make the combined bid 
of $43.6 billion neck-and-neck with the $43.9 billion offer from 
Global Crossing. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with Frontier's stalling tactic, Qwest has at least three  
options: sweeten its bid, take the offer directly to Frontier's 
shareholders, or walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest, based in Denver, is the No. 4 long-distance phone  
company, but has grand visions of becoming a global provider of 
high-speed Internet communications. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Qwest, however, said the company has no plans to  
raise the stakes. ``We are comfortable with our bid and we are 
positive that as Frontier continues to review our proposal they 
will find it superior'' to Global Crossing's, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other camp, Robert Annunziata, Global Crossing's chief  
executive officer, took Frontier's inaction as a victory sign. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that the Frontier board of directors has  
reaffirmed its commitment to complete the merger with Global 
Crossing as planned,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to U S West was not immediately returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Qwest offered a $2 per share premium if both U S West and  
Frontier agreed to the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet is revolutionizing the telecommunications industry  
and is driving a string of merger bids. Companies are hoping that 
the next generation of high-speed Internet technologies will link 
more homes and businesses, providing a wealth of new opportunities 
to sell goods and provide information and entertainment. These 
hopes have prompted telecom and cable companies to make big bets on 
mergers so they can gain the size and market share that will be 
keys to new profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long-distance  
company, won a bidding war against Comcast Corp. for MediaOne, a 
large cable company. And in Europe, upstart Olivetti SpA won a 
fight with Deutsche Telekom for control of Telecom Italia SpA. 
</P>
<P>
	Frontier released its statement after the markets had closed.  
Frontier's stock closed off 12 1/2 cents at $57.75 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where U S West ticked down 6 1/4 cents to $56.93 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Qwest's stock closed up 25 cents $36 on the Nasdaq Stock Market,  
where Global Crossing ended up 56 1/4 cents at $48.81 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Study: Drugmaker Ads Can Backfire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- Television, newspaper and magazine advertisements for  
prescription drugs succeed in getting patients to ask doctors for 
the medication, a new study confirmed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But patients sometimes leave their physician's office with a  
prescription for a competing medication, a health industry 
researcher said at a conference where the findings were released. 
</P>
<P>
	And that is one of the biggest risksto promoting prescription  
drugs directly to consumers: Unlike any other product promotion, no 
matter how well an ad persuades consumers to ask for a drug, they 
still need a physician's permission to get it. Many of those 
doctors prefer a different remedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The study reported that about a third of the consumers who saw a  
drug ad have talked to a doctor about it. Of those inspired to 
request a particular drug because of an ad, about one in four 
received a prescription from their doctor, but not necessarily for 
the drug they requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of 1,000 adults was commissioned by both Time and  
Health magazines and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 
percentage points. The magazines are among those to have profited 
from the rise in pharmaceutical advertising directed at consumers, 
which took off in 1997 when the Food and Drug Administration 
relaxed rules governing disclosure of risks and side effects. 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmaceutical companies spent $1.35 billion on  
direct-to-consumer advertising in 1998, a 24 percent increase over 
1997 and three times the 1995 amount, according to market research 
firm IMS Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise of consumer advertising is a major factor behind the  
recent surge in pharmaceutical sales, experts say. Prescription 
drug sales totaled $94 billion in 1998, a 16 percent increase from 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending big dollars on consumer targeted drug campaign can pay  
big dividends. For example, Schering-Plough spent $136 million 
advertising allergy drug Claritin last year and generated $1.9 
billion in U.S. sales. 
</P>
<P>
	But such consumer marketing campaigns can also backfire.  
</P>
<P>
	``The highest spending does not equate to generate the most  
prescriptions. A lot of money is spent on new products but doctors 
write prescriptions for competitive products,'' said Suzanne 
Ramspacher, an official with market research firm IMS Health of 
Plymouth Meeting, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Merck spent $41 million on consumer advertising for  
its cholesterol-lowering drug Zocor last year, six times the amount 
its competitor Warner-Lambert spent promoting its drug, Lipitor, 
according to Competitive Media Reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	Merck may have inadvertently helped Lipitor with its campaign,  
said Ramspacher. That's because Merck's heavy advertising drove 
consumers to doctors for the medication, but physicians 
increasingly have prescribed Lipitor. In the last two years, 
Lipitor has dominated the U.S. cholesterol-lowering market, and now 
outsells its nearest competitor, Zocor, almost 2-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers Squibb's cholesterol-lowering drug Pravachol has  
met a similar fate as Zocor. Bristol Myers spent a total of $126 
million advertising Pravachol in 1997 and 1998, only to lose market 
share to Zocor. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the risk they take going out there,'' said Julie Kline,  
marketing analyst with Scott-Levin, a drug industry consulting firm 
in Newtown, Pa. ``Bristol unintentionally helped Warner-Lambert ... 
and that's not what you want to happen when you spend $67 
million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers has since discontinued its consumer advertising of  
Pravachol.

<HEADLINE> Court Ruling Helps Va. Juveniles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- A Virginia Supreme Court ruling last week  
that both parents must be notified when a juvenile is arrested 
could enable thousands to challenge their convictions and has 
already spared the life -- at least temporarily -- of a death row 
inmate who committed murder at 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The execution of Douglas Christopher Thomas was halted on  
Wednesday, just hours before he was to die by injection and five 
days after the high court ruling. Back in 1990, only Thomas' mother 
was told of his arrest in the shooting deaths of his girlfriend's 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas became the first condemned man in Virginia to take  
advantage of the Supreme Court ruling. As many as three other men 
on death row for crimes committed before they were 18 are expected 
to raise similar challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	The reprieve doesn't mean Thomas will necessarily get a new  
trial. The Supreme Court is expected to consider the case during 
its September session. 
</P>
<P>
	In its ruling last Friday, the high court ordered a new trial  
for Jeramie Baker, who was convicted at 17 of trying to rob a 
convenience store and stabbing a clerk. Only his mother was 
notified of his arrest, despite a 1991 state law that requires 
summonses go ``to the parents'' of the juvenile. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court said the use of the plural ``parents'' means  
both the mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of all juveniles sentenced in criminal cases in  
Virginia come from single-parent homes or families headed by 
someone other than their biological parents. And for years, it was 
common practice for Virginia prosecutors to notify only one parent. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, prosecutors said the ruling means thousands of  
convictions over the past eight years could be open to challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	David Botkins, a spokesman for state Attorney General Mark L.  
Earley, said every claim of improper notification will have to be 
raised individually ``and we will be prepared to argue those as 
necessary.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Virginia should not be greatly concerned about a mass exodus  
of juvenile offenders from detention facilities,'' Botkins said. 
Any jailed youth seeking release would have to go back to court, go 
through another trial and risk getting a stiffer sentence when 
retried, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other men are on death row in Virginia for murders  
committed before they were 18: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Chauncey Jackson. He had just turned 16 when he killed a man  
in 1994 as the man sat in a car. ``I understand his biological 
father was not notified,'' said Rob Lee, director of the Virginia 
Capital Representation Resource Center, which represents death row 
inmates. Lee said he will raise the issue in court by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shermaine Johnson. He was sentenced to die for the 1994  
stabbing death and rape of a woman when he was 16. His lawyer did 
not immediately return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Steven Roach. He received a death sentence for the 1993  
shotgun slaying of a woman when he was 17. His lawyer,, Steven M. 
Schneebaum, said he recalled that only Roach's father attended a 
1994 hearing on whether to transfer the case from juvenile to adult 
court. Prosecutor Daniel Bouton said he could not remember who was 
notified in the case.

<HEADLINE> Education Dept Lowers Fees on Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 2 million students will be eligible  
to save an average of $631 on the loans they get from the federal 
government, modeled on discounts private lenders often give 
borrowers who repay early or electronically. 
</P>
<P>
	The Education Department also announced Wednesday that it would  
reduce the upfront fee that students now pay in its direct-loan 
program. Discounts will also go to borrowers repaying loans 
electronically and borrowers who consolidate their loans while they 
are in school, or during the grace period before they are 
officially responsible for loan repayment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many students are struggling to pay their way through school,  
and every dollar helps,'' Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The average total savings will be $631 over the life of a loan  
for the average graduate with a debt of $10,000 and a standard 
10-year repayment plan. A student with a loan that size will save 
an estimated $100 on the origination fee; $157 for the interest 
rate reduction for electronic debit repayment; and $374 for the 
in-school or grace consolidation savings. 
</P>
<P>
	These discounts are similar to those now offered to students by  
private lenders and guaranty agencies subsidized by the department 
to make loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's direct loans, started in 1994, account for a  
third of the $32 billion loans market. 
</P>
<P>
	Private lenders and other critics of the department's loan  
administration say the programs are not saving anyone money because 
operating costs keep rising. An internal audit backed that 
assertion. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, department officials will testify about the results of  
another internal audit, which found that nearly $4 million in 
student loans over a 2 1/2-year period were forgiven for borrowers who 
were supposed to be dead but turned to be alive and earning wages. 
Also, more than $73 million in loans were forgiven for people who 
claimed permanent disabilities but continued to work.

<HEADLINE> Sabres Figure Out Nieuwendyk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Buffalo Sabres are convinced they took Joe  
Nieuwendyk out of Game 4 of the Stanley Cup finals. The Dallas 
Stars' playoff scoring leader says they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
	To settle the debate, a check of the statistics sheet is in  
order. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk's numbers before the Sabres' series-tying 2-1  
victory: 12 points in his previous nine playoff games, including 
two goals in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk's statistics in Game 4: No goals, no assists, one  
shot, only one good scoring chance. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounds like the Sabres were doing something right, even if the  
Stars could find no wrong with the way their leading playoff scorer 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a solid effort, top to bottom,'' the Sabres' Dixon Ward  
said Wednesday. ``We're going to have to sustain that emotion and 
intensity if we're going to have any chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To shut down Nieuwendyk, the biggest scorer in the  
lowest-scoring Stanley Cup finals in 30 years, Sabres coach Lindy 
Ruff made two key strategic changes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first three games, the Sabres' No. 1 line of Ward,  
Michael Peca and Vaclav Varada almost exclusively opposed the 
Stars' top line of Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Jere Lehtinen. 
</P>
<P>
	With Hull out Tuesday with a groin injury, Ruff switched the  
Peca line to oppose Nieuwendyk, who scored both goals in Dallas' 
2-1 victory in Game 3. Ruff also made sure the line played shorter 
shifts to match the Stars' quick line changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The results seemed to be evident. Nieuwendyk, who has 11 playoff  
goals and six game-winners; Jamie Langenbrunner; and Dave Reid 
combined for only four of the Stars' 31 shots and no goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nieuwendyk's line is so strong down low,'' Ward said.  
``Nieuwendyk's too good to totally take him out of the game. He's 
just too talented. But we did a better job of keeping them to the 
outside and limiting their chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff had the advantage of making the last line change at home,  
and used it to make sure Peca opposed all of Nieuwendyk's shifts in 
the third period. He won't have that edge on the road tonight in 
Game 5 at Reunion Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	Stars coach Ken Hitchcock questions if it will make a  
difference, saying Nieuwendyk's line was as effective as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had as much bite as they did any other time,'' Hitchcock  
said. ```We don't mind that matchup at all. It's a good matchup 
maybe for both teams. We're not going to change that matchup at all 
-- we like it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some time at the start of the game where some of the  
players got after us physically but, toward the end of the game, if 
you look at the chances for us scoring-wise, Nieuwendyk's line was 
in the middle of most of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Hull returns tonight, Ruff must decide if he can afford to  
concentrate his best line, Peca's, against the Stars' No. 2 line, 
centered by Nieuwendyk. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got some great individuals on that team, and they're  
an extremely hard-working team,'' Ruff said. ``We have to match 
their work ethic. Both goalies are playing tremendous, and it's 
inch by inch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nieuwendyk must have felt the same way while unsuccessfully  
trying to find open ice against Peca's line. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to be physical and not allow them to outwork us down  
low,'' Peca said. ``They do a great job of outworking a lot of 
lines and creating good chances in front of the net. We felt good 
with the matchup most of the night.''

<HEADLINE> Union Help Allowed for Agency Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal employees have the right to a union  
representative's help when they are questioned by an agency 
inspector general, the Supreme Court ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, unionized federal employees are entitled to a  
union official's aid when an agency representative questions them 
in a matter that might lead to discipline. Today's 5-4 decision 
said an inspector general represents agency management and 
therefore the right to union representation applies. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision upheld a federal appeals court ruling that the  
National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its inspector 
general committed an unfair labor practice by restricting a union 
representative's efforts to aid an employee during a questioning 
session. 
</P>
<P>
	``In common parlance, the investigators employed in NASA's OIG  
(office of inspector general) are unquestionably representatives of 
NASA when acting within the scope of their employment,'' Justice 
John Paul Stevens wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Representation is not the equivalent of obstruction,'' Stevens  
added. ``In many cases the participation of a union representative 
will facilitate the fact-finding process and a fair resolution of 
an agency investigation -- or at least Congress must have thought 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, the NASA inspector general's office was told that an  
employee of the George C. Marshall Space Flight Center in 
Huntsville, Ala., was suspected of authoring documents that 
threatened violence against coworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents outlined ways of getting revenge, including carbon  
monoxide poisoning and exploding natural gas under a house. 
</P>
<P>
	An inspector general's investigator sought to interview the  
employee and agreed to his request to have a lawyer and union 
representative present. But when the interview began, the 
investigator said the union official could only observe and could 
not offer the employee advice. The employee, who was not identified 
in court documents, eventually was fired. 
</P>
<P>
	The union, the American Federation of Government Employees,  
filed unfair labor practice charges against NASA and the inspector. 
The Federal Labor Relations Authority ruled for the union, ordering 
NASA and the inspector general not to restrict union officials' 
actions in such interviews in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Even though  
inspectors general have ``a significant degree of independence'' 
from the agencies they monitor, they still should be considered 
agency representatives in questioning employees, the appeals court 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Each federal agency's inspector general is appointed by the  
president and is under the general supervision of the agency head, 
but the agency head cannot interfere in any investigation. That 
structure is intended to keep agency managers from covering up 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In appealing to the Supreme Court, Justice Department lawyers  
said an inspector general is more like the FBI than a 
representative of management. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the nation's highest court disagreed. Under the inspector  
general law, ``NASA-OIG's investigators are employed by, act on 
behalf of, and operate for the benefit of NASA,'' Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
	His opinion was joined by Justices Anthony M. Kennedy, David H.  
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Clarence Thomas,  
Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia dissented. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the four, Thomas said an inspector general ``serves  
more than just agency concerns'' and should not be considered a 
representative of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is NASA vs. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 98-369.

<HEADLINE> Lacy Brings Experience to Liberty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Venus Lacy got a rough welcome from the New York  
Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	Kym Hampton greeted her with an elbow to the mouth at practice,  
causing a cut that required seven stitches. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacy, a member of the 1996 U.S. Olympic team, is expected to  
help fill the gap left by Rebecca Lobo's season-ending injury when 
she makes her belated debut for the Liberty against Los Angeles 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Venus brings to the table is defense, rebounding and  
experience,'' Liberty coach Richie Adubato said of the 6-foot-4 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobo's season ended 42 seconds into the opener against Cleveland  
June 10. She is expected to have surgery at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, Lobo went down,'' Adubato said. ``So from our  
standpoint, we're lucky, because now we have a big body up front.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacy, who was activated Tuesday after a week on the injured  
list, played for the defunct ABL's Nashville team. She'll bring her 
average of 10.2 points and 6.5 rebounds to a New York team missing 
its leading rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacy's extensive basketball resume includes two trips to the  
White House after winning the NCAA title at Louisiana Tech in 1988 
and the Olympic gold medal in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	She has been a late addition before. Lacy joined the Olympic  
team midway through its 52-0 year-long exhibition tour to add size 
in the paint. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's just as fiery and intense as I am,'' Teresa Weatherspoon  
said. ``Venus is a very intimidating person. She's very physical, 
taking up the paint as if it's hers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite her experience, she was among four Atlanta Olympians not  
drafted by a WNBA team. The others were four-time Olympian Teresa 
Edwards, Katrina McClain and Katy Steding. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things happen for a reason,'' said Lacy, who was looking for a  
teaching and coaching job in Ruston, La., before joining the 
Liberty June 1. ``I'm here now, and that's all I'm concerned about. 
I'm happy that (general manager) Carol (Blazejowski) decided to 
give me a chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacy is surrounded by familiar players on the Liberty. Lacy and  
Lobo were teammates at Atlanta; Lacy played with Weatherspoon on 
the championship team at Louisiana Tech; and she played against 
Hampton and Sue Wicks during her six-year professional career in 
Japan, Italy and Greece. 
</P>
<P>
	``And I played against Crystal Robinson in the ABL,'' Lacy said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a loving family,'' she added. ``We do a lot of things  
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacy will face Lisa Leslie, another Olympic teammate, in  
Friday's game against the Sparks at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're good friends,'' Lacy said. ``She's a great player. She  
can play three positions because she has a wonderful outside shot. 
She's got that quick step on you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lacy, who is playing on her fourth team in four seasons, has  
helped teams to the finals at every level. It began with a state 
championship at Brainerd High School in Chattanooga, Tenn., where a 
nearby parkway is named after her. It continued with the NCAA title 
at Louisiana Tech and a European championship while playing for 
Greece in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacy started her ABL career in Seattle and led the Long Beach  
StingRays to a runner-up finish against the Columbus Quest in 
1997-98. 
</P>
<P>
	After the ABL folded in December, Lacy finished her  
undergraduate degree in sociology. She planned to work on her 
master's degree in education this summer when her agent called. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to leave the next day,'' Lacy said.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Rise / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices rose early today  
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid concerns Midwest weather 
conditions will turn inhospitable for crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean futures were supported by private forecasts for  
hot, dry weather in western growing regions of the Midwest. Gains 
were tempered, however, by National Weather Service forecasts and 
European models that indicated there will be normal temperatures 
across the entire region. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat rose in step with corn and soybeans. Prices also were  
supported by unexpected export business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.58 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.18 3/4 a bushel; July oats rose 1 cent to 
$1.19 3/4 a bushel; July soybeans rose 4 1/4 cents to $4.68 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meat and livestock futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	August live cattle fell .05 cent to 64.67 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle fell .05 cent to 77.75 cents a pound; July lean hogs 
fell .57 cent to 50.70 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell .02 
cent to 42.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> House Panel OKs Anti-Shutdown Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amid a brewing budget confrontation between  
President Clinton and Congress, a House committee approved 
legislation Thursday that would prevent federal shutdowns during 
spending fights between the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would also permit projected surpluses on the  
non-Social Security side of the budget to be used for tax cuts or 
spending increases. That would be a boon to Republicans, whose 
agenda this year includes an $800 billion, 10-year tax reduction, 
to be paid for by that portion of the surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill may end up being little more than a symbolic GOP  
statement of how it would change the budget process. White House 
budget chief Jacob Lew has said he would urge President Clinton to 
veto it, and a Senate bill overhauling budget law is less 
far-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Budget Committee approved the measure by 22-12. The  
only Democrat to support it was Rep. David Minge, D-Minn., who 
along with Rep. Benjamin Cardin, D-Md., helped write it with 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill provides that if spending bills are not enacted by the  
Oct. 1 start of a new fiscal year, budgets for affected agencies 
would continue at the prior year's level until the new bill is 
completed. That scenario could occur this fall, because Congress is 
on track to propose spending billions less than Clinton wants for 
many domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least we don't make everyone suffer'' by shutting down the  
government during budget fights, said Rep. Jim Nussle, R-Iowa, one 
of the bill's authors. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the measure would advantage lawmakers who oppose  
proposals to cut or increase spending, and remove too much pressure 
for completing spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have the maximum incentive to reach agreement, to  
do our jobs,'' said Rep. David Price, D-N.C.

	U.S., Russia Troops Deal Hits Snag  
</P>
<P>
	HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- The United States and Russia struggled  
today to clinch an agreement on Russia's peacekeeping role in 
Kosovo under NATO command, still snagged on U.S. objections to 
giving Moscow control over any part of the province, U.S. officials 
said. During two days of talks, the two sides reached accord on how 
Russians will work under NATO command and on arrangements for 
sharing peacekeeping duties at the Pristina airport, where about 
200 Russian troops have been holed up since their surprise arrival 
Saturday ahead of NATO peacekeepers, the officials said. But 
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said there would be no deal unless 
all outstanding issues were settled.

	COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- President Clinton won the support of  
French President Jacques Chirac today for denying any 
reconstruction aid to Belgrade as long as Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic remains in power. ``Humanitarian aid, yes,'' 
Chirac said. ``Development aid, economic aid, no.'' Clinton said he 
agreed: ``We're all together on that.'' British Prime Minister Tony 
Blair has taken the same stand, virtually assuring a moratorium on 
any Western rebuilding help for Milosevic after 78 days of NATO 
bombing. The two discussed the fate of post-bombing Yugoslavia in 
two hours of talks at the Elysee Palace in Paris before Clinton 
flew here for this weekend's meetings of the world's seven biggest 
industrial powers and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Announce Service Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Prodded by Congress, the airlines industry on  
Thursday announced a package of voluntary measures to address 
growing complaints from consumers about poor service. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures, detailed at a Capitol Hill news conference, will  
stave off, for the moment, congressional passage of stronger 
consumer protection legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry, said Gerald Greenwald, chairman and CEO of United  
Airlines and chairman of the Air Transport Association Executive 
Committee, was deeply troubled by the ``perception, maybe even a 
groundswell,'' that the airlines don't care about customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We heard the bell ring, we have felt the whip,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Also on Thursday, Amtrak revealed its plan to win back the  
hearts of disgruntled rail passengers. It includes training and 
incentives for all 24,000 employees, enhanced food-service options 
and improved onboard amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak is also guaranteeing refund vouchers for future travel to  
any dissatisfied passenger. 
</P>
<P>
	Several key congressional players, including Senate Commerce  
Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., and Sens. Slade Gorton, 
R-Wash., and John D. Rockefeller, D-W.Va., gave qualified 
endorsements to the airlines' plan. 
</P>
<P>
	But others, including Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who co-sponsored a  
passenger bill of rights bill with McCain, said it fell short. 
``This voluntary program consists mostly of stuff they are already 
required to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., author of a House bill, said he  
would continue to seek mandatory measures. ``The flying public has 
seen these promises made and then broken time and time again and 
won't be fooled by the latest blast of hot air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Department Secretary Rodney Slater, in a  
statement, said the steps, while short of what the administration 
sought in a plan outlined last fall, were welcomed, ``but real 
performance will be closely monitored.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the department was formally acting Thursday to double to  
$2,500 the minimum liability on lost, damaged or delayed baggage. 
</P>
<P>
	The measures in the airlines' plan include ensuring that each  
airline will inform customers of the lowest fare available, 
notifying customers of known delays, supporting an increase in the 
baggage liability limit, allowing reservations to be held without 
payment for 24 hours, providing prompt refunds, accommodating 
disabled passengers and meeting customer needs during long 
on-aircraft delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressure to take such steps came after much publicized incidents  
during a storm last winter when passengers were forced to sit seven 
or more hours on runways without food and other services. Congress 
held several hearings in which passengers related horror stories 
about their experiences with air travel. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Transport Association President Carol Hallett said the  
picture of uncaring airlines was not accurate, but ``we all need 
and want to do a better job'' and ``when Congress gets our 
attention that's when we really do react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The package was the result of several months of negotiations  
involving the administration, Congress and the industry. It was 
scheduled to be announced last week, but a news conference was 
called off at the last minute because of unresolved issues. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said that still unsettled was his demand that airlines  
notify passengers when a plane is overbooked. He said he would also 
seek legislation requiring the Transportation Department inspector 
general to periodically check to see that the industry was 
complying with the measures. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden said he was involved in negotiations going late Wednesday  
night, which he said ended with the industry still balking on the 
overbooking issue, on making public all the fares on a flight and 
on issues of redeeming frequent flyer miles. ``This was the airline 
industry asking the passengers to accept a wink and a nod,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Ruden of the American Society of Travel Agents said he was  
concerned that the industry, by promising to give the lowest 
available fare over each airline's telephone reservation system, 
was trying to induce customers to deal directly with them rather 
than through travel agents, which now handle 80 percent of tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Hudson of the Aviation Consumer Action Projection, a group  
founded by Ralph Nader, said the industry was mainly agreeing to 
obey existing laws ``and in return the Senate is ready to kill 
their already weak passenger rights legislation.''

<HEADLINE> DNA Leads to Arrest in 1976 Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVERETT, Wash. (AP) -- New DNA-testing methods have led police  
back to the man first charged in the murder of his sister-in-law 23 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	James Lucius Stephens Jr. was arrested Wednesday in the rape and  
stabbing of Kimberly Marie Kuntz, 18, who was attacked in 1976 
while baby sitting for Stephens' 3-year-old daughter in Lynnwood. 
</P>
<P>
	After the slaying, Stephens was charged with first-degree murder  
and first-degree rape, but the charges were dismissed without 
prejudice -- meaning they could be refiled -- because of lack of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens was scheduled to be arraigned today in Snohomish County  
Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The 46-year-old Stephens, who now lives in West Seattle and  
works for a shipping company, has been under intermittent 
surveillance for some time, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators reopened the case two years ago, when advances in  
DNA technology allowed for very good results even when the evidence 
was in bad shape. A major break came this week after they found a 
perfect match between a recent blood sample taken from Stephens and 
a semen stain on the shirt worn by Ms. Kuntz when she was killed. 
The sample was obtained under court order. 
</P>
<P>
	``Twenty years is a long time, but it's not impossible by any  
stretch of the imagination,'' said George Riley, scientific 
director of GeneLex, the Seattle-based laboratory that performed 
the key DNA tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists say the DNA profile from the semen stain, which would  
have been considered too small for adequate results even a few 
years ago, is found in only one in every 377 million Caucasians. 
</P>
<P>
	That profile was a perfect match for Stephens' DNA, Snohomish  
County Deputy Prosecutor Paul Stern said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kuntz was found stabbed to death in the apartment occupied  
by her sister Donna, Stephens' estranged wife, and the couple's 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Court papers said Mrs. Stephens told officers that her husband  
had recently bound her with tape and assaulted her in the bedroom 
where Ms. Kuntz's body was found. Stephens subsequently pleaded 
guilty to second-degree assault of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his first arrest, Stephens admitted visiting the  
apartment the evening of the slaying. He said he had tried to talk 
with his sister-in-law about his marital problems but she ``didn't 
have much to say.''

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- The new director of Brazil's Federal  
Police on Thursday denied accusations that he tortured a priest 
during the country's military dictatorship and threatened to sue 
his accusers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am innocent. I have never seen an instrument of torture in  
the police stations where I worked,'' Joao Campelo told Congress' 
committee on human rights during five hours of testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, Jose Antonio Magalhaes Monteiro, the former  
priest who is now a philosophy professor at University of Alagoas, 
told the committee that Campelo interrogated him while another 
office slapped him around, hit him and kicked him in the back. He 
also said Campelo helped fasten him onto a torture device. 
</P>
<P>
	Monteiro said he was arrested for running a school that taught  
students social awareness while it taught them to read. The 
generals that ran Brazil from 1964 to 1985 considered the 
instruction subversive.

	``I'm going to demonstrate to the Dominican people that the name  
Juan Marichal is clean and it will stay that way forever,'' 
Marichal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Marichal was questioned by Judge Julio Ibarra Rios for nearly

million from the purchase of sports equipment for the ministry and 
that he benefited financially from bets placed on cockfighting 
matches.

<P>
	Aeroperu officials had announced two weeks ago that the  
Houston-based Continental had agreed to take over 49 percent of 
Aeroperu shares worth about $30 million as part of a debt 
restructuring agreement.

<HEADLINE> Deutsche Bank Officials Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- German authorities investigating  
allegations that Deutsche Bank helped customers evade taxes is now 
examining the role of some of the bank's top officials, including 
Chairman Rolf Breuer, the Frankfurt prosecutor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have been probing for a year whether employees of  
Deutsche Bank regularly helped customers funnel money into accounts 
in Luxembourg and elsewhere to avoid a withholding tax on interest 
income. 
</P>
<P>
	While Breuer and other members of the board were not suspected  
of involvement in actual transfer of money, they bore final 
responsibility for the operations, prosecutor spokesman Job Tilmann 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank acknowledged that three other board members were  
being investigated. Two former board members were also under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilmann said prosecutors believe the transfers to avoid taxes  
were ``a widespread practice'' involving many customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank became the world's largest bank after its recent  
merger with U.S.-based Bankers Trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors started investigating German banks as early as 1994  
for helping customers avoid taxes on earned interest imposed under 
a 1992 law. As the investigations progressed, bank customers 
involved in the scheme were encouraged to turn themselves in and 
make back payments to avoid proescution. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Tilmann, about 400 Deutsche Bank customers have  
given information on money transfers they say bank employees helped 
them with to avoid taxes, and about 100 bank employees have 
admitted their part. 
</P>
<P>
	Deutsche Bank denies wrongdoing, saying individual customers are  
responsible for declaring their income. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have more than 6 million customers,'' Deutsche Bank  
spokesman Dierk Hartwig said. ``We're not in a position to know 
what they do as private taxpayers.''

<HEADLINE> Compaq Issues Earnings Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp. dismayed Wall Street for a  
second time in two months this morning, disclosing an unexpected 
quarterly financial loss and a restructuring aimed at slashing $2 
billion in annual costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, which ousted its chief executive in April after another  
unexpected financial hit, said the restructuring includes job cuts, 
yet to be determined. Compaq tied its troubles to computer price 
wars, sluggish sales and a bloated cost structure at the company. 
</P>
<P>
	The company predicted it would report a loss of up to 15 cents a  
share in the second quarter, compared to a profit of 20 cents 
expected by Wall Street analysts. 
</P>
<P>
	The news sent Compaq's stock swooning as much as 10 percent  
before recovering somewhat in morning trading. Compaq shares were 
trading at $21.93 3/4, down 31 1/4 cents a share, or 1.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it will revamp into three business groups. The  
groups, focused on enterprise solutions and services, personal 
computers and consumers, will each have separate profit-and-loss 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the two months since the change of management at the  
company, we have taken a deep look into the strengths and 
challenges of Compaq,'' said Benjamin Rosen, Compaq's chairman and 
acting chief executive officer. Rosen said the changes are aimed at 
speeding up the company's reaction to the market and accelerating 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 9, Compaq announced first-quarter profits would be half  
of what analysts expected. Nine days later, Compaq ousted chief 
executive Eckhard Pfeiffer, and chief financial officer Earl Mason 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosen said the problems that afflicted first-quarter earnings  
continued. Revenues were expected to be flat to down, sequentially 
from the first quarter.

<HEADLINE> American Indian Museum To Proceed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months of design disputes, the federal  
government's Commission on Fine Arts gave a unanimous go-ahead 
Thursday to plans for the National Museum of the American Indian on 
the National Mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Groundbreaking is expected in the fall, with opening scheduled  
for 2002, next to the popular Smithsonian Institution's Air and 
Space Museum. Cost is estimated at $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Commission Chairman J. Carter Brown was pleased that the new  
design eliminates a thick column that would have held up the 
overhanging roof which is meant to recall the cliffs where native 
Americans built multistory dwellings in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all threw up our hats about that,'' said Charles H. S.  
Atherton, secretary of the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown called the column an engineering element, disguised as  
part of the design. The roof remains but the column is gone. 
</P>
<P>
	The design is based on an original plan by David Cardinal, a  
Canadian architect of Indian ancestry. His design did not have a 
column. Following a dispute over detailed drawings, the Smithsonian 
hired a new architectural firm that submitted a new design aimed to 
preserve Cardinal's basic plan, but it added the column. 
</P>
<P>
	After the commission decided that was ugly, said Brown, the  
architectural firm deleted the column. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick West, a Cheyenne who is to be director of the museum, said  
the dispute had delayed groundbreaking by several months, but would 
not postpone the opening. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Capital Planning Commission still must approve the  
design, but officials said they don't expect further difficulties 
following the Fine Arts Commission approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The Smithsonian is a federally funded museum and research  
complex, which operates 15 museums and the National Zoo in 
Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- People seldom list progress toward Christian  
unity as a hallmark of Pope John Paul II's reign. In fact, critics 
sometimes treat his two decades on the throne of Peter as a dry 
period for ecumenism. Yet 1999 is turning out to be an important 
year in spiritual geopolitics. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the Vatican's negotiations with other Christians were  
launched before John Paul took office, but he has fostered the 
process and his 1995 encyclical ``Ut Unum Sint,'' or ``That They 
May Be One,'' reaffirmed the centrality of the task. 
</P>
<P>
	To ordinary churchgoers, the theological issues involved in  
these talks seem arcane. But they have defined whole cultures for 
centuries and continue to sunder Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest breakthrough occurred last week. The Holy See,  
representing a billion believers, and the Lutheran World 
Federation, with a flock of 57 million, announced an accord on 
``justification,'' the doctrine that first caused Martin Luther to 
launch the Protestant Reformation. The agreement will be signed 
Oct. 31 in Augsburg, Germany, 482 years to the day after Luther 
posted his ``95 Theses'' against the papacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart of the new Lutheran-Catholic accord reads:  
</P>
<P>
	``Together we confess: By grace alone, in faith in Christ's  
saving work and not because of any merit on our part, we are 
accepted by God and receive the Holy Spirit, who renews our hearts 
while equipping and calling us to good works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If salvation doesn't depend on a person's charitable deeds or  
piety, that sounds just like what Luther said St. Paul taught in 
the New Testament. But both sides now explain that, despite past 
misunderstandings, Protestants and Catholics really agree on this. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lutherans endorsed the main agreement a year ago. But Rome  
had more of a struggle over certain technical points so the two 
sides had to work out a further ``annex'' to the main document. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lutheran accord came a month after release of a discussion  
paper on church authority from theologians representing the Vatican 
and the 55 million Anglicans and Episcopalians. The text says that 
Christian teaching normally is stated collectively by bishops and 
accepted by the church membership. But ``in certain circumstances'' 
the pope by himself can defining doctrine, and that authority is 
``a gift to be received by all the churches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No accord is on the horizon here, just discussion. At the moment  
it seems unlikely that Anglicanism would ever accept papal teaching 
authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Those disputes are young compared with the rift between Rome and  
the churches of the East, which date back a millennium or more. 
Here too, the parties are talking. 
</P>
<P>
	Such discussions won't change church life tomorrow, or next  
year. But ``seeds are being sown'' to overcome misunderstandings 
that have persisted for centuries, said the Rev. Richard John 
Neuhaus, a Lutheran turned Catholic and editor of First Things 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to see this in terms of the next 50 to 100 years,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Theologically, Rome is far closer to the 223 million Eastern  
Orthodox than to the Protestants. And the pope from Poland has put 
priority on healing a breach that dates from A.D. 1054. At one time 
he hoped some grand gesture of Orthodox-Catholic reconciliation 
would usher in the new millennium. But progress is agonizingly slow 
and the dream has died. 
</P>
<P>
	No doubt it's a severe disappointment for John Paul II. ``That  
was his great vision and he pursued it relentlessly,'' says George 
Weigel, author of a forthcoming biography of the pope. ``This is a 
great historical tragedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, in May the pope managed a successful pilgrimage to  
Romania, the first Orthodox land he has been able to tour. And he 
plans to visit Orthodox Armenia and honor its prime churchman, the 
ailing Catholicos Karekin I. 
</P>
<P>
	Rome is prepared for full communion, but Orthodoxy is suspicious  
of Catholicism for historical reasons. The fall of European 
communism worsened matters by stirring rivalries over property and 
souls in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Another irritant is the existence of Eastern Rite Catholics, who  
embrace papal authority while following Orthodox forms of worship. 
The Orthodox generally feel that Catholicism should keep off their 
ancestral turf. The warm reception that the pope received from 
Romania's 84-year-old Patriarch Teoctist was significant, given the 
historic rivalry between the Orthodox and the vital Eastern Rite 
presence that Rome maintains in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
	Patriarch Alexy II of Moscow has been less friendly, and John  
Paul will not make his long-desired trip to Russia without Orthodox 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the pope's pending visit to Armenia further  
underscores the complexity of the Orthodox opening. The Romanians 
and Russians are Eastern Orthodox, united with Istanbul's 
ecumenical patriarch, who follow the teachings of seven ancient 
church councils held before the split with Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	The Armenians belong to a separate branch known as the Oriental  
Orthodox, along with independent sister churches in Syria, Egypt, 
Ethiopia and India. These churches broke with the rest of 
Christendom in the 6th century and accept only the doctrines of 
Christianity's first three councils. Enormous obstacles to 
reconciliation remain, but when Karekin visited Rome in 1996 he 
issued a joint declaration of faith with the pope. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, Oriental Orthodox and Eastern Orthodox theologians  
reached a preliminary agreement on the divinity and humanity of 
Christ. Just as Vatican theologians are doing, they recognized that 
their two branches are united on important issues of faith and that 
the differing terminology used to express those beliefs need no 
longer divide them.

<HEADLINE> Catinca Looks To Increase Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Catinca gets another chance to prove she is  
among the best fillies and mares around in Saturday's Hempstead 
Handicap at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A win in the 1 1-16th-mile race would be her eighth victory in  
10 career starts. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's starting to get the respect she deserves,'' trainer John  
Kimmel said Thursday. ``If she's going to be mentioned in the same 
breath as the best fillies and mares in the country, she's got to 
win races like these.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her last start, Catinca came off a fast pace to win the  
one-mile Shuvee. There's more likely to be a slower pace on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they go slower, she'll be closer,'' jockey Richard Migliore  
said. ``She's a filly with a lot of natural speed. I think she's 
better if she makes one run. She's the kind of horse you have to 
get to settle. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only unknown now is going a sixteenth of a mile farther.  
She gets the mile real well. I can't imagine the extra sixteenth 
being a problem, but you don't know until you've done it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Catinca will carry 122 pounds in the $250,000 test for fillies  
and mares and spot five rivals from five to eight pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered are Sister Act, 117; Furlough, 114; Snit, 113;  
Beautiful Pleasure, 112, and Let, 111.

<HEADLINE> Investors Victimized in Stock Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of unsuspecting investors have lost  
more than $100 million to an alleged network of rogue brokers 
pitching worthless stocks at exaggerated prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Three separate indictments unsealed Wednesday in Brooklyn  
alleged that nine corrupt brokerage firms -- including some with 
ties to organized crime -- used high-pressure and misleading sales 
techniques to inflate the value of 20 microcap stocks. Some of the 
85 defendants named in the indictments cashed in by dumping the 
small-company shares at the inflated prices, authorities said at a 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``The mob never saw a market it didn't want to control,'' said  
Lewis Schiliro, head of the FBI's New York office. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Zachary Carter said authorities relied on an  
ongoing series of undercover operations to reveal the ``classic 
boiler-room'' securities fraud schemes. The schemes, which date to 
1991, involved ``a nest of securities scam artists who worked in 
close cooperation, migrating from brokerage firm to brokerage 
firm,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One $10 million scam was led by two associates of the Colombo  
crime family and one from the Bor Russian crime group, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reputed mobsters allegedly infiltrated now-closed New York  
branches of Global Strategies Inc., Amerivet Dymally Securities and 
First National Equity Corp. They paid kickbacks to registered and 
unregistered brokers as incentive to cold call potential investors 
and pitch dubious startup companies, including one which claimed to 
be developing golf courses in the South, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defendants in a similar plot laundered millions of dollars in  
illegal proceeds through offshore bank accounts, authorities said. 
The funds were eventually wired to Nevada casinos, where they were 
withdrawn in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants were arraigned in Brooklyn federal court on  
charges including securities fraud conspiracy, mail and wire fraud, 
money laundering and obstruction of justice. The most serious 
charges carry a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Gillette Warns of Earnings Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Gillette's troubles appear to be continuing as the  
company announced Thursday it expects to report a 20 percent 
decrease in second quarter earnings per share compared with a year 
ago, falling well short of analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-based consumer products company attributed the  
earnings drop to slower-than-anticipated recovery in Japan, Brazil, 
Russia and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales for Gillette's Braun appliance, stationery and toiletries  
businesses also were disappointing, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, ``we still expect sales to be up in a low  
single-digit increase,'' said Stephen Brayton, company spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings will return to normal levels in the second half,  
Brayton said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second quarter 1998, Gillette earned $372 million, or 33  
cents a share, on sales of $2.3 billion. The company's warning 
translates into profits of just under 7 cents per share for the 
same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. were predicting 29 cents a  
share. 
</P>
<P>
	Long known as a steady money maker for blue-chip investors, The  
Gillette Co. stunned Wall Street in September when it announced it 
would lay off 4,700 employees worldwide, or 11 percent of its work 
force. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the company, best known for its Oral B dental  
care, Duracell batteries and Sensor shaving products, was affected 
by the troubled Asian economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Gillette also announced Thursday that its board of directors has  
authorized and expansion of its stock repurchase program from 50 
million to 75 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's statement was released after the market closed.  
Gillette stock closed down 43 3/4 cents at $47.31 1/4, in trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. In after-hours trading, shares were 
trading at $44.50.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Keeps Ban on Coke, Sprite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Belgian's government extended its ban  
on Coke but agreed Thursday to allow sales of some of the company's 
other beverages to resume for the first time since Monday, when 
they were ordered from shelves after dozens of people became ill 
after drinking Coca-Cola products. 
</P>
<P>
	And while France partially relaxed its ban on sales of  
Coca-Cola, Switzerland joined a move by other nations to block 
sales of Coca-Cola drinks produced in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Co., the world's biggest soft-drink company, had been  
hoping for a lifting of the ban to help restore European consumer 
confidence in brands damaged by the health scare. 
</P>
<P>
	With Coke's problems coming on top of a Belgian scandal  
involving dioxin-infected meat, eggs and dairy products, France's 
president said Thursday he will propose creating an international 
council to monitor food safety. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgium, the Heath Ministry said Thursday that it was  
allowing the resumption of sales of Coca-Cola's Nestea, Aquarius, 
Bonaqua, Kinley, Lift and Minute Maid brands. But the ban was 
extended on Coke, Fanta and Sprite pending further investigation 
into what caused the illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not possible today to explain in a calming and  
satisfactory way the appearance of these symptoms of illness,'' 
said the statement from Health Minister Luc Van den Bossche. 
``Coca-Cola must withdraw all these products from the market and 
destroy them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was better news for Coke from Paris, where the government  
announced it was relaxing a ban on Coca-Cola products in cans to 
allow sales to resume from one of two French Coke plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Belgium had no immediate reaction to the decision.  
Calls seeking comment from Coke's headquarters in Atlanta were not 
immediately returned. 
</P>
<P>
	M. Douglas Ivester, the chairman of Coca-Cola, expressed deep  
regrets to European customers on Wednesday and promised the company 
``will not rest'' until it ensures all of its products meet the 
highest quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's action didn't hurt Coca-Cola on Wall Street, where  
its shares were up 81 1/4 cents at $64.68 3/4 in late trading on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Coke said it traced the origin of the  
problems in Belgium to a plant at the French port of Dunkirk, just 
across the border from Belgium, and a factory in the Belgian city 
of Antwerp. 
</P>
<P>
	In France, Consumer Affairs Secretary Marylise Lebranchu said  
the government was authorizing the sale of canned Coke produced in 
the southern city of Marseilles, but maintaining a ban on cans from 
northern Dunkirk. Tests on drinks from Dunkirk should be completed 
by the weekend, the minister said. 
</P>
<P>
	She also said some 80 French people, mostly from northern areas,  
had complained feeling unwell after drinking Coke, but stressed 
``the relation between cause and effect had not been proved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Belgian government imposed the ban Monday after dozens of  
youngsters were hospitalized complaining of stomach pains and 
nausea after drinking Coca-Cola products. Belgian news media said 
Thursday some 200 people had been affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The health scare rapidly spread to other nations, with  
Luxembourg imposing a similar ban, France banning Coke in cans, and 
the Netherlands, Spain and Germany withdrawing Coke products coming 
from Belgium. Switzerland joined the list Thursday telling Coke to 
withdraw any drinks imported from Belgium. Finland's Silja Line 
ferri said they were pulling French and Dutch canned Coke from 
their ships in the Baltic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Coke insists there was no toxic contamination of its drinks, but  
said substandard gas used to put fizz into the drinks at the 
Antwerp plant produced an off taste, while fungicide used on crates 
in Dunkirk was absorbed by the underside of cans giving off an 
``offensive odor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coca-Cola Belgium said it would reimburse medical costs of  
anyone who produced a doctors' certificate showing drinking the 
company's products had made them ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coke scare hit just as European consumers were still shaken  
by a scandal over Belgian food contaminated by cancer-causing 
dioxins. That led to bans on poultry, eggs, pork, beef and diary 
products from Belgium creating Europe's worst food panic since the 
1996 ``mad cow'' crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	French President Jacques Chirac on Thursday proposed the  
creation of a ``global higher scientific council for food safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our people are increasingly concerned, worried,'' Chirac said  
at a joint news conference in Paris with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Chirac said he would bring up the issue at a meeting that begins  
Friday in Germany of the leaders of the world's leading industrial 
countries and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Fears Economic Imbalance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told  
Congress today that inflation remains in check for now, but the 
central bank should consider taking pre-emptive action to prevent 
any threat to continued economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	By using the word ``pre-empt,'' Greenspan was sending a signal  
the Fed will act soon to raise short-term interest rates to slow 
the economy before signs of inflation begin to show, economists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second such hint from Greenspan this week. However,  
economists disagreed over how many rate increases the Fed might be 
contemplating. 
</P>
<P>
	``This removes all doubt that the Fed is ready to move'' to  
raise interest rates, said David Jones, chief economist for Aubrey 
G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New York. ``He is clearer than usual.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In order to keep the economy growing, ``It is useful to pre-empt  
forces of imbalance before they threaten economic stability,'' 
Greenspan said. Sometimes that is not possible because the future 
``can be too opaque to penetrate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we can be pre-emptive, we should be, because modest  
pre-emptive actions can obviate the need of more drastic actions at 
a later date that could destabilize the economy,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony before the Joint Economic Committee came  
just a day after the government reported that inflation remained 
tame during May. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market showed little adverse reaction to today's  
speech. Some economists said that was because traders already had 
factored in an expected rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had been worried that he would say something worse,''  
said economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
``I think what we are getting from the markets is a sigh of relief. 
They are not overjoyed but the fear is diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he believes the Fed may raise rates as many as three  
times this year, beginning at its next meeting June 29-30. But Sohn 
said that for now, he believes the Fed is only certain to raise 
rates one time. 
</P>
<P>
	New evidence of continued strong employment came today from the  
Labor Department, which reported that the number of Americans 
filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell by 28,000 last 
week to 297,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's trade deficit held steady at a record high of $18.9  
billion in April, matching the March figure, the Commerce 
Department said today. After a five-month drop, U.S. exports rose 
1.2 percent but imports continued to climb, by 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because monetary policy operates with a significant lag, we  
have to make judgments, not only about the current degree of 
balance in the economy, but about how the economy is likely to fare 
a year or more in the future,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats were critical of Greenspan's message, worrying  
that average Americans now benefiting from the strong economy might 
be hurt if it is slowed by higher interest rates. ``I very much 
hope the (Fed) won't adopt a so-called pre-emptive strategy without 
finding any basis or foundation in any of the economic trends,'' 
said Sen. Paul Sarbanes, D-Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reiterated what he told Congress earlier this week,  
that increases in American workers' productivity linked to 
improvements in technology have so far kept inflation in check, a 
significant change over the way the economy operated in years past. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said, ``Despite its extraordinary acceleration,  
labor productivity has not grown fast enough to accommodate the 
increased demand for labor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The economy is in the middle of an exceptional period of strong  
growth and continued low inflation, Greenspan said. ``For the 
period immediately ahead, inflationary pressures still seem 
well-contained.'' But he added: ``There are developing imbalances 
that give us pause and raise the question: Do these imbalances 
place our economic expansion at risk?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has not raised interest rates in more than two years.  
When interest rates go up, borrowing becomes more expensive, 
consumers and businesses tend to spend less and thus the economy 
tends to slow. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Fed policy-makers said they were leaning toward  
raising short-term interest rates. Some long-term interest rates 
already have begun to climb a bit because of expectations that the 
Fed might eventually raise short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong consumer demand has kept the U.S. economy growing even as  
some foreign countries have suffered through two years of 
recession. Now those countries, especially in Asia and Latin 
America, ``are clearly on firmer footing, though in some cases 
their turnarounds appear fragile,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	If American consumers continue their buying binge as demand for  
American goods picks up elsewhere, that could tax production 
capacity and perhaps eventually lead to inflationary pressures, 
many economists believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said that one of the things Fed policy-makers must  
take into account is the relative importance to place on stock 
market prices. Stock prices can climb to unsustainable levels even 
when underlying product prices are relatively stable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While it is unclear if the current high stock market prices  
represent a ``bubble,'' Greenspan noted that ``bubbles generally 
are perceptible only after the fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even when bubbles burst, ``the consequences need not be  
catastrophic for the economy,'' Greenspan said.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Candidate Plans Status Quo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                          *JEANNINE AVERSA   	
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawrence Summers, apparently on track for  
swift Senate approval as Treasury secretary, assured lawmakers 
Thursday he would continue policies aimed at fostering economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers now holds the No. 2 slot at the Treasury Department and  
is seeking to succeed Robert Rubin, who announced plans last month 
to leave the post. Summers received the support of many members of 
the Senate Finance Committee, which held a hearing on his 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee's chairman, William Roth, R-Del., said his panel  
expects to vote on and approve Summers' nomination on Tuesday. ``I 
think it would be overwhelming'' Roth said of the committee's 
support for the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Roth said he hoped Summers' nomination -- which is also subject  
to approval by the full Senate -- will be taken up by that chamber 
before July 4. Full Senate approval is expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin -- credited with policies boosting the nation's economic  
growth, reducing its debt and spurring jobs -- has said he would 
like to leave his post by July 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, 44, joined Treasury in 1993 as undersecretary for  
international affairs. He has served since 1995 as deputy to Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Larry, you have some big shoes to fill,'' Roth said.  
</P>
<P>
	In the three-hour hearing Thursday, senators questioned Summers  
on a wide range of domestic and international economic matters. 
Topics included: the health of the U.S. steel industry; reform of 
Social Security and Medicare; Japan's economic health; the dismal 
U.S. savings rate; efforts for China to become a member of the 
World Trade Organization; and the International Monetary Fund's 
proposed sale of some gold to help support a program to give the 
nation's poorest countries debt relief. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers' didn't break any new policy ground during the hearing  
and stuck to the Treasury Department's existing policies on all of 
these issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``At Treasury the right course has been set,'' Summers told  
lawmakers. ``Our challenge will be to carry on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the steel controversy, Summers expressed sympathy for U.S.  
steel industry, which has closed down plants and cut back jobs in 
response to cheap steel imports from Japan, South Korea, Russia and 
other countries. However, he said he would recommend that the White 
House veto legislation setting quotas on steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern would be the retaliation consequences,'' Summers  
said. A better approach, he suggested, is vigorously enforcing U.S. 
trade law. 
</P>
<P>
	Steel-state Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., who said he intends  
to move forward in the Senate with a steel-import quota bill, 
nonetheless threw his support behind Summers' nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are superbly qualified for this,'' Rockefeller said.  
</P>
<P>
	Summers also was questioned frequently on President Clinton's  
plans to shore up Social Security and Medicare -- the nation's 
retirement programs -- using projected budget surpluses. Republicans 
have criticized the specifics of Clinton's plan and also asked 
Summers about the prospects of carving out some of the budget 
surplus for an income tax cut many Republicans want. 
</P>
<P>
	Summers, consistent with the administration's position, said  
that it ``would not be prudent in a fiscal sense'' to have a tax 
cut until effective frameworks for Social Security and Medicare 
reforms are agreed to. 
</P>
<P>
	On other matters, Summers reiterated his commitment to a strong  
dollar as a key part of his economic strategy. ``I believe that a 
strong currency is very much in our national interest. No nation 
can devalue its way to prosperity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers said ``there's room for improvement'' for the IMF to  
better deal with financial crises around the world. And he told the 
panel that supports efforts to reform the IRS and get an oversight 
board up and running soon and that he'll work hard to come up with 
ways to encourage Americans -- whose savings' rate is at an all-time 
low -- to save more.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Amateur Pick Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Josh Hamilton, the No. 1 overall pick  
in this month's amateur baseball draft, remained hospitalized a 
second day Wednesday with a stomach ailment after arriving for the 
start of his rookie league season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton accompanied his new teammates on a 14-hour bus trip  
Monday from St. Petersburg, Fla., to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays' 
Class A affiliate in Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
	But by Tuesday morning, he was vomiting and had a slight fever.  
He was taken to Princeton Community Hospital, where he remained 
Wednesday night. A nursing supervisor said he had gastroenteritis, 
a stomach and intestinal disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's teammates Tuesday began workouts at Hunnicutt Field a  
half-mile away in preparations for Friday's Appalachian League 
season opener against the Bluefield Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton, 18, was the first high school player to be taken with  
the first pick since Seattle selected Alex Rodriguez in 1993. 
Hamilton batted .529 with 13 homers and 35 RBIs in 25 games as a 
senior at Athens Drive High in Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton agreed to a $3.65 million signing bonus, the largest  
ever given to a drafted amateur player who signed with the team 
that selected him. In rookie ball, however, he'll earn less than 
$1,000 a month and be given $20 a day in meal money on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite going 18-3 as a pitcher the last two seasons, Tampa Bay  
plans to develop him as a right fielder. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton's status for the opener is uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be an honor to be able to work with a kid like  
that,'' said Princeton batting coach Mike Tosar.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Evacuated From Yosemite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- About 200 tourists were  
evacuated from their cabins after a geologist warned there could be 
more rockslides like that one that killed a climber over the 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	After studying the area from a helicopter and on foot, the U.S.  
Geological Survey geologist determined there were additional 
fractures on the side of the cliff where the first boulders broke 
loose Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He felt it was ready to go,'' Yosemite spokesman Scott Gediman  
said Wednesday. ``It could be in the next few hours or the next few 
weeks. Predicting rockslides is not an exact science.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 80 wood and tent cabins used by visitors were evacuated  
Wednesday evening. Seventy-six park employee cabins were emptied 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Although accommodations are hard to come by during the summer  
season, last-minute cancellations and people leaving the park ahead 
of schedule enabled the visitors to find new cabins, Gediman said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Rejects $30M Claim Against GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich. (AP) -- A jury today rejected a $30 million  
claim that General Motors Corp. was responsible for a Florida crash 
that killed Philadelphia Eagles star Jerome Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-member Macomb County Circuit Court jury reached a  
unanimous verdict on the suit filed by Brown's survivors, a court 
secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week marks the seventh anniversary of the crash that killed  
Brown, an All-Pro defensive tackle, and his 12-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward Ricci, a lawyer for Brown's relatives, said GM never  
specifically tested the Corvette ZR1 -- the model Brown was driving 
-- for inadvertent air bag deployment that the plaintiffs claim 
caused the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said Brown was speeding the wrong way down a one-way street  
and was not wearing a seat belt.

<HEADLINE> Despite Pleas, Texas Kills Canadian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) -- A former auto mechanic who killed a  
woman during a 1975 burglary became the first Canadian to be 
executed in the United States in almost a half-century Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Stanley Faulder, 61, didn't deny killing 75-year-old Inez  
Phillips, but his attorneys argued his conviction was tainted 
because he wasn't told after his arrest that he could seek legal 
assistance from Canadian authorities as allowed under international 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder made no final statement before his lethal injection.  
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian government filed documents in Faulder's appeals  
protesting his treatment and won the backing of U.S. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright in calling for a reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada outlawed the death penalty in 1976, the same year the  
U.S. Supreme Court allowed it to be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deeply regret our request for executive clemency was not  
acted on, but the government of Texas has its laws and we respect 
that,'' John Morrow, the Dallas-based Canadian consul, said after 
watching Faulder die. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas authorities said Faulder did nothing to inform them he was  
Canadian. He was carrying a Colorado driver's license and had 
applied for one in Texas. It wasn't until 15 years after his arrest 
that his family, who believed he was dead, and the Canadian 
government discovered he was alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal courts rejected Faulder's appeals, and state officials  
refused other requests that could have blocked the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Thursday, the Supreme Court rejected an 11th-hour appeal  
in which Faulder's attorneys cited a 200-year-old law that allows 
foreign citizens to sue American officials if they have been harmed 
by breaches of treaties. 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder was scheduled to be executed in December, but the  
Supreme Court halted the lethal injection about 30 minutes before 
it was to begin, saying the delay was necessary so the justices 
could determine whether Faulder's international rights were 
violated. 
</P>
<P>
	In January the justices rejected his appeal and lifted their  
reprieve. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Albright's earlier pleas on Faulder's behalf, a State  
Department spokesman said Thursday ``we've exhausted all of our 
possibilities and recognize that the final decision is in the hands 
of the state.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Faulder grew up in Jasper, Alberta, but left his wife and  
children during the winter of 1974-75 and headed to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	He and a girlfriend robbed Mrs. Phillips' home in the mistaken  
belief that there was a large sum of money in her safe.

<HEADLINE> Fed May Take 'Pre-Emptive' Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even with few signs of inflation, the Federal  
Reserve may take ``pre-emptive'' action to protect the U.S. economy 
from problems that could halt its spectacular run of growth, 
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists called it a clear signal the Fed will raise interest  
rates soon -- the second such hint from Greenspan this week. But 
they disagreed over how many times the central bank might act. 
</P>
<P>
	The stock market showed little adverse reaction, in part because  
traders already assumed the Fed would raise rates at least once. 
``They had been worried that he would say something worse,'' said 
economist Sung Won Sohn of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. ``They 
are not overjoyed but the fear is diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When interest rates go up, borrowing money becomes more  
expensive. Consumers and businesses spend less and the economy 
tends to slow. If the economy is going too strong and inflation is 
a possibility, that helps to cool things off. On the other hand, 
corporate profits can fall and unemployment rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, Fed actions to change monetary policy -- by raising  
or cutting interest rates -- work only with a ``significant lag,'' 
Greenspan noted. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we can be pre-emptive, we should be, because modest  
pre-emptive actions can obviate the need of more drastic actions at 
a later date,'' Greenspan told the Joint Economic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats bristled, noting that many average Americans are  
just now benefiting from the economic boom. On Wednesday, the 
government reported that inflation remained tame in May. 
</P>
<P>
	``To say that we have a situation now that we have more people  
working, and that we have to put a stop to that ... I know that's 
not what you want. But that will be the effect if you give in to 
this notion that interest rates have to be raised,'' Rep. Maurice 
Hinchey, D-N.Y., told Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan replied that if the Fed increases rates, ``it would be  
because we believe it would increase the probability of continuing 
the expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed has not raised interest rates in more than two years and  
has not launched a sustained period of rate hikes in more than four 
years. Indeed, last fall it cut rates three times in a successful 
effort to keep a global downturn from hurting the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan now believes ``the unemployment rate has fallen so  
low that there are hardly any workers left to be employed,'' said 
David Jones, chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co. in New 
York. ``Demand is so strong that if the Fed doesn't act 
pre-emptively to cool off that demand, we will end up with 
inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said he thought the Federal Reserve might raise interest  
rates three times this year, pushing them up a quarter-point each 
time, beginning at its next meeting June 29-30. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sohn said he believes the Fed is only certain to raise rates  
once. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Sinai, chief economist for Primark Decision Economics in  
New York, said he expects a quarter-point hike June 29-30 but 
beyond that, ``the economic data will determine subsequent moves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among signs of ``developing imbalances'' in the economy,  
Greenspan said, are the booming housing market, the tight labor 
market and the high-flying stock market. The Labor Department said 
Thursday that the number of Americans filing new claims for 
unemployment benefits fell by 28,000 last week to 297,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, some Asian and Latin American countries are  
emerging from two years of recession, although ``in some cases 
their turnarounds appear fragile,'' Greenspan said. In one sign of 
that recovery, the U.S. trade deficit held steady in April -- still 
at a record high, though -- in part because U.S. companies are 
finding it easier to sell goods overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	If American consumers continue their buying binge while demand  
for U.S. goods picks up overseas, that could tax production 
capacity and eventually lead to inflation, economists believe. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan reiterated his message to Congress earlier this week  
that increases in American workers' productivity caused by 
technology have kept inflation in check, a significant change over 
the way the economy operated in years past. Nevertheless, economic 
growth is stronger than the productivity increase can account for, 
a trend Greenspan called ``unsustainable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it's unclear if high stock market prices represent a  
``bubble,'' but added that even when bubbles burst, ``the 
consequences need not be catastrophic for the economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sinai saw that as a sign the Fed will not let fears of a market  
drop prevent it from raising rates.

<HEADLINE> House Mulls 10 Commandments Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Churning through a debate on the causes of  
youth violence, the House is considering a measure that would 
permit the Ten Commandments to be posted in schools and other 
government buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate follows the sharp defeat of a proposal that would  
have curbed access by children to explicit sexual or violent 
material in video games and movies. Propelled by aggressive 
lobbying by the entertainment industry, the House rejected the 
measure Wednesday on a 282-146 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we worked it hard,'' Jack Valenti, president of the  
Motion Picture Association of America, told reporters in a 
conference call shortly after the vote. ``I think whoever drafted 
the bill drafted it in such a way as to be simply, blatantly, and I 
guess irrefutably, unconstitutional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the measure was designed to ``slow  
the flood of toxic waste into our kids' minds.'' But at one point 
in the debate, Hyde acidly acknowledged that he could not compete 
with the industry's political action committee -- a reference to 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who thinks (school violence) has nothing to do with the  
media is an idiot,'' Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., said today on the 
House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-gun-control Democrats, meanwhile, were up against the  
powerful and well-funded gun lobby and the party's most senior 
member of the House, Rep. John Dingell of Michigan. He was pushing 
a measure that would cut the waiting period for background checks 
at gun shows from three days in the Senate bill to 24 hours. If 
there's no definitive answer in that time period, the purchaser may 
take possession of the gun. Dingell said most gun checks are 
completed in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite long-distance lobbying by President Clinton during his  
trip through Europe, several Democrats expressed pessimism that 
Senate-passed gun restrictions would survive the House. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against a lot of money,'' House Democratic leader  
Dick Gephardt of Missouri said. 
</P>
<P>
	After a late dinner in Paris with French President Jacques  
Chirac, President Clinton awoke at 5 a.m. local time to telephone 
another four wavering Democrats: Reps. Gary Condit and Mike 
Thompson of California, Marion Berry of Arkansas, and Ron Kind of 
Wisconsin. Clinton urged a ``no'' vote on the NRA-supported Dingell 
amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president said the Dingell amendment would weaken the  
Senate legislation and said he knows it's a tough vote but we have 
to remember this is about keeping guns out of the hands of children 
and criminals,'' said White House spokesman Barry Toiv. 
</P>
<P>
	With the politically explosive gun debate looming today,  
conservative lawmakers pushed for legislation they said would 
instill the value of human life and prayer in children to 
counteract their exposure to entertainment and other material that 
glorifies violence. New gun restrictions were not the only solution 
to modern-day horrors like the April 20 massacre at Columbine High 
School in Littleton, Colo., these House members said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsored by Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., one amendment would  
allow schools and other government buildings to display the Ten 
Commandments in states that permit the practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that simply posting the Ten Commandments will not  
instantly change the moral character of our nation,'' Aderholt said 
in a statement. ``However, it is an important step to promote 
morality, and an end of children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a recent House Judiciary Committee hearing, Rep. Bob Barr,  
R-Ga., suggested that had the Ten Commandments been posted at 
Columbine High School, the shootings would never have happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats called the proposal unconstitutional.  
</P>
<P>
	``Whose 10 Commandments? The Christian version, the Protestant  
version or the Jewish version?'' asked Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. 
``They're different, you know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court in 1980 struck down as unconstitutional a  
Kentucky law requiring the posting of a copy of the Ten 
Commandments in each public school classroom. The court said such 
postings violated the required separation of religion and 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, meanwhile, pushed for new gun restrictions.  
</P>
<P>
	From Europe, Clinton pressured Democrats who voted for the Brady  
gun control law to approve the Senate's mandatory background checks 
for all firearms purchases at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I urge you to stand up to the gun lobby once again,'' the  
president wrote to dozens of lawmakers in a letter from 
Switzerland, where he was attending an international conference. 
The National Rifle Association has lobbied furiously for a less 
restrictive measure than the all-inclusive background checks at gun 
shows passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's proposed curbs on children's access to pictures,  
drawings, video games, movies, books, recordings or other materials 
containing certain ``explicit sexual material or explicit violent 
material.''

<HEADLINE> Thomas Delivers Off Bench for Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Kurt Thomas' numbers in Game 1 of the NBA  
Finals looked like they belonged on San Antonio's side of the 
boxscore. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off the bench, Thomas had 13 points, 16 rebounds and four  
steals for the New York Knicks, no small feat against 7-footers 
David Robinson and Tim Duncan. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter,'' Thomas said. ``If I get 16 rebounds, if I  
get 20 rebounds, if we lose it doesn't matter. This is all about 
winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And that's something the shorthanded Knicks couldn't manage in  
the opener of the championship series, losing to the Spurs 89-77. 
</P>
<P>
	If the loss had a bright side for the Knicks it was the work of  
Thomas. He would have started if Larry Johnson had not. As it was, 
he saw plenty of playing time, logging 31 minutes because New 
York's other big men, including Johnson, were in early foul 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas brought a simple philosophy to the battle with Duncan and  
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to use my quickness, my strength, my knowledge of  
defense and just play,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a lot more than he was able to do the last two years when  
injuries limited him to 23 games, 18 with Miami in 1996-97 and then 
five with Dallas last season and left the onetime NCAA scoring 
champion in basketball limbo as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The lost year in Dallas was particularly tough with Thomas  
reduced to assistant coach status. He was not exactly the key 
player in designing game plans, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just sitting, trying to learn as much as possible to  
help my game as a player,'' Thomas said. ``I was doing rehab and we 
didn't have a big man coach. It was a way to keep me around the 
guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even after the year off, he had plenty of teams offering  
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I talked to Cleveland, Houston, Miami, Denver,'' he said. ``I  
had a lot of teams willing to take a chance on me. I felt I was 
worth more than one year and $1 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York went for two years for $3.68 million, bargain basement  
prices in current basketball economics, and Thomas signed on. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had no doubt in my ability,'' he said. ``You can't find a  
6-9 guy who can do the things I can do and not take a chance with 
it. The only question was whether I could stay healthy. All the 
doctors said my ankle would be fine. All I needed to do was to take 
a year off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas battled his way in to the starting lineup and averaged  
8.1 points and 5.7 rebounds. He was bounced to the bench during the 
Indiana playoff series when Jeff Van Gundy decided to start Latrell 
Sprewell, but it seemed he would be starting again in Game 1 
because of Johnson's sprained knee. Then LJ decided he could play 
and Thomas became the sixth man again. 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't bother him.  
</P>
<P>
	``When he calls your number, you've got to be ready,'' Thomas  
said. ``I wasn't surprised at what I did. I know my ability to do a 
lot of things. I knew I had to be aggressive and attack the 
glass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That, Thomas said, is how the Knicks must approach Game 2 on  
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to play more as a team, get the assists up and the  
turnovers down,'' he said. ``We've got to pick and choose when we 
double team and we've got to get to the free throw line.''

<HEADLINE> Court Vacates Murder Convictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The slate was wiped clean for a death  
row inmate Thursday because it took the state 12 years to hold a 
competency hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronnie Lee Jones, 43, has lived on death row since 1982. He was  
condemned for the murders of three Miami men fatally shot nearly 
two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The Florida Supreme Court vacated Jones' sentences and  
convictions in a unanimous unsigned decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``For 12 years and without explanation, the defendant sat on  
death row awaiting the competency hearing ordered by this court,'' 
the high court wrote, calling the delay egregious. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices, however, said the state could prosecute Jones a  
second time if he's found competent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones represented himself at his 1981 trial and was convicted of  
shooting five men in a Miami home in July 1980. He was sentenced to 
life in prison for the two counts of attempted first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was ``pleased to get the ruling,'' said his Tampa  
attorney, Chris Coutroulis. The assistant attorney general in Miami 
did not return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Jones' appeal attorneys argued the former boxer and  
child abuse victim had been mentally incompetent to stand trial 
four years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	They argued their client suffered organic brain damage as a  
result of being battered as a child and pummeled as a fighter. He 
also was shot in the head as a teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1985, Jones came within two days of going to Florida's  
electric chair before the state Supreme Court granted him an 
indefinite stay. The high court ordered the trial judge to hold a 
hearing into Jones' claims that he had not been mentally competent. 
</P>
<P>
	That hearing, however, wasn't held until 1997.

<HEADLINE> Burned Dog Pound Stirs Mass. Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOLLAND, Mass. (AP) -- People used to roll their eyes when  
Patricia Mumper stood up at meetings and told town leaders to build 
a better dog pound. 
</P>
<P>
	She may have meant business.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mumper stands charged with burning the dog pound down.  
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old animal rights activist has pleaded innocent to  
arson, which carries up to 10 years in prison. But hours before the 
fire on June 1, she warned a Holland selectman she would ``do 
something to embarrass the town,'' and she was seen near the pound 
around the time of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	No animals were there, and no one was hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	The pound, which is now a charred ruin, was a simple  
25-by-25-foot wooden shed with four separate runs, each with a dog 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Petersen, Holland's dog catcher, told town leaders in  
May that the pound was in ``deplorable condition.'' Even so, he 
said, whoever set the fire ``took a decent, reasonable facility 
from the animals -- and left them with nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Stephen Dean, head of the Springfield-based Dog Adoption  
Network, the burning of Holland's dog pound was an act of civil 
disobedience. 
</P>
<P>
	``This burning of the dog shelter was a symbol of total  
frustration in the minds of people who felt that the animals were 
incarcerated there,'' he said. ``The only thing worse than being a 
lost dog in Holland was being a found dog -- and being put there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dean came to know Ms. Mumper several years ago, when both were  
newly arrived summer residents in this central Massachusetts town 
of 2,300 people on the Connecticut line. 
</P>
<P>
	They joined to help form a local group that tried to get town  
leaders to replace the shed where stray dogs are kept to await 
their owners. ``She was much more vested in it and emotional,'' 
Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mumper, a married administrative assistant at an insurance  
company, began living in town full-time within the past year. She 
became a fixture at meetings, where she held forth at length on the 
pound: disgraceful, not fit for a dog. 
</P>
<P>
	Some even agreed more or less, but many eventually rolled their  
eyes. They had heard it all before from her. 
</P>
<P>
	The pound ``wasn't a giant issue -- just to one person,'' said  
Paul Dimond, who owns a convenience store. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't see her as a threat -- a nuisance, yes, but never a  
threat. She'd never let you forget,'' said Paul Gillis, a selectman 
who retired this month. 
</P>
<P>
	When Ms. Mumper warned Gillis she would ``do something to  
embarrass the town,'' Gillis expected a lawsuit. Instead, the pound 
went up in flames that evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Mumper disputed Gillis' memory. She said that she did not tell  
him the night of the fire that the town would be embarrassed. 
Instead, eight months or a year before the pound burned down she 
said at a town meeting: ``Do I have to embarrass the town by taking 
this to the media?'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Ms. Mumper said she was at the pound on the day of the  
fire just to take photographs, according to Irene Loureiro, an 
animal rights activist who has worked with Ms. Mumper for more than 
20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a long-languishing proposal to build a new pound  
remains on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog catcher said he might bring dogs to a veterinarian in a  
nearby town and pay for temporary shelter. But he said that in the 
meantime, the town may need to set up some kind of temporary pound, 
probably with worse conditions than in the old one.

<HEADLINE> GM To Back Future Ken Burns Films </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Award-winning documentary filmmaker Ken Burns is  
getting a decade of financial security for upcoming projects. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Corp. has told Burns it will underwrite a portion  
of every documentary project he takes on in the next 10 years, and 
pay for the extensive educational projects that accompany the 
films. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns said the dollar value can't be specified yet because he  
doesn't know what projects might be involved. But he said the 
pledge to pay 35 percent of his production costs will provide 
security for his Florentine Films company and scores of associates 
who work on his films as free-lancers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Having a long-term commitment allows you to do some real  
long-term planning,'' Burns told The New York Times. 
</P>
<P>
	GM has been the sole corporate underwriter for Burns' earlier  
public television projects, including ``The Civil War'' and 
``Baseball'' and the documentary running this fall about 
suffragists, ``Not For Ourselves Alone: The Story of Elizabeth Cady 
Stanton and Susan B. Anthony.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns is working on a 20-hour series for 2000 called ``Jazz.''  
Future projects include a film about Mark Twain and possibly 
documentaries on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the National 
Parks system.

<P>
	SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- Lawrence Lozzano, who scored 10 goals two  
seasons ago, was claimed on waivers Thursday by the New York-New 
Jersey MetroStars. 
</P>
<P>
	Lozzano had four goals in 19 games over the past two MLS seasons  
with the San Jose Clash and the Los Angeles Galaxy. He was 
scoreless in six games with Los Angeles this season. 
</P>
<P>
	His best season was in 1997 when he had 10 goals and 10 assists  
for the Clash. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroStars expect Lozzano, 28, to join them for a game at  
Kansas City on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lozzano, 28, has appeared seven times for the United States  
national team. He was the leading scorer for Tampico of the Mexican 
first division prior to being drafted by Dallas of the MLS in 1996.

<HEADLINE> D-Backs Bell Hits With the Big Boys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Take a look at the home run leaders in the  
National League: Sammy Sosa, Jeff Bagwell, Jay Bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Bell?  
</P>
<P>
	What's the second baseman of the Arizona Diamondbacks, who has  
never hit more than 21 homers in any of his nine full major-league 
seasons, doing with the big swingers of the game? It makes about as 
much sense as a second-year franchise winning the NL West title. 
</P>
<P>
	So far it's been that kind of year.  
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-six games into the season, Bell has 20 home runs, only two  
fewer than Sosa and Bagwell and one more than Mark McGwire. 
Comfortable in the No. 2 spot in Arizona's batting order, behind 
speedy Tony Womack and ahead of Luis Gonzalez and Matt Williams, 
Bell is a big reason the Diamondbacks have a four-game lead in the 
NL West and were the first team in the league to win 40 games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got the ability to do a lot of things when Tony gets on  
base,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Tony gets on base, they're coming right after Jay and  
he's making them pay. When he gets his pitch, he's not missing it. 
That's all it is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell's polite, studious manner masks an intense competitive  
drive. After striking out recently, he could be seen pummeling the 
water cooler in the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year was tougher.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the first free agent to sign with the Diamondbacks, and  
his five-year, $34 million deal was widely criticized. Then, as one 
of the few experienced major leaguers on an expansion team, Bell 
hit just .251 batting average with 129 strikeouts, 67 RBIs, and 79 
runs scored. Late in the year, he accepted a move from shortstop to 
second without complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	``He and Matt took on the onus of the world last year, and you  
wouldn't want it any other way,'' manager Buck Showalter said. 
``But it doesn't always make a productive hitter when you've got 
that mentality that `Hey, I've got to do it. Nobody else is going 
to do it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody is saying Bell is overpaid these days. With the club's  
free-agent spree in the off-season, Bell has plenty of help. But 
don't look for him to claim any vindication. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Jay is that type of person,'' Showalter said.  
``I think he has a real grip on the realities of this world and how 
fickle people can be. As long as he has the respect of his peers, 
that's what's important to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell doesn't expect to stay with the Sosas and McGwires all  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to allow myself to get caught up in the home  
runs and that kind of stuff, even though they're fun,'' Bell said. 
``Certainly there are times in the game where you need one and 
hopefully it comes, but I haven't done anything out of the ordinary 
to produce those kinds of numbers, and I'm not going to start 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter said Bell's experience is a factor. He hit his  
career-high 21 with Kansas City two seasons ago, then had 20 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot of players as they get older have more of an  
idea of what they have to do to be successful,'' Showalter said. 
``He knows when to cut down on his swing. I think he knows the 
certain counts and sequences that he can go for the pump a little 
more. He's a very intelligent hitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell, 33, agrees that experience plays a part, but not the  
biggest part. 
</P>
<P>
	``The knowledge of pitchers around the league and knowing what  
type of hitter I am,'' he said. ``But 95 percent of the credit goes 
to my teammates. They're the ones who have allowed me to have 
success.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bell has a team-high 55 strikeouts. But some of that is because  
he must take a few pitches to allow Womack a chance to steal. He 
has 30 walks, 50 RBIs and a .288 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell is most proud of his NL-best 60 runs scored.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know what Mark's going to do or what Sammy's going to do or  
what Matt's going to do. These guys are bonafide home run 
hitters,'' Bell said. ``They'll hit 40 or 50 or 60. For me, I'm 
going to try to get on base and score as many times as I possibly 
can. That's what's been fun.''

<HEADLINE> Sugar Futures Rise Sharply  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Sugar futures prices rose sharply Thursday on the Board of Trade  
of the City of New York on speculation that a recent surge in 
Russian buying has sharply reduced available supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork futures fell sharply, as did cocoa  
futures. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar jumped as European buyers reported a shortage of available  
white sugar, which boosted speculation a world glut may be waning. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian importers in recent weeks have been snapping up  
available supplies, hoping to take delivery before an Aug. 1 
increase of tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is the world's largest sugar importer, but recently moved  
to boost tariffs to protect farmers in its domestic sugar-beet 
market. That, however, leaves importers vulnerable to paying 
sharply higher rates later this year, should domestic production 
fail to live up to expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar for July delivery rose 0.23 cent to 5.52 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures fell sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
amid expectations the government on Friday will report the amount 
of pork in storage has climbed to a new record. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Agriculture Department was likely to report supplies of  
pork bellies, or uncured bacon, rose to 107.5 million pounds, 
according to average analyst estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders say increased demand for pork during the summer grilling  
season has been overshadowed by continued-large supplies. Pork 
producers have been struggling to slash large herds, but a supply 
glut continues unabated. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, meatpackers appear to have secured enough supplies for  
the foreseeable future, leaving little room for gains even if 
consumer demand rises. 
</P>
<P>
	July lean hogs fell 1.6 cents to 49.67 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures retreated on the New York Board of Trade on  
speculation chocolate makers have secured enough supplies to last 
until the next West African harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculators bailed out of the market as cocoa purchases appeared  
to dry up, erasing concerns about declining cocoa sales from 
exporters in Ghana and Ivory Coast, the world's largest growers. 
</P>
<P>
	Chocolate makers had stepped into the market recently to snap up  
cheap supplies that came as growers flooded the market with the 
smaller of two harvests each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants also noted weather conditions have been  
largely favorable in those countries, which could promote a bumper 
main crop for harvesting this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	September cocoa fell $28 to $1,075 a ton.

partner to build a worldwide alliance, the daily economics 
newspaper Les Echos reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France has code sharing agreements with Delta and another  
American carrier, Continental Airlines, and had been negotiating 
with both carriers for a more formal bond to build a strategic, 
global alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of weighing the pros and cons of a major  
partnership with each airline, Air France settled on Delta, Les 
Echos said, citing unnamed sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France declined to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Delta spokeswoman Kay Horner said Thursday she hasn't heard  
whether Air France has chosen a partner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're aware of those rumors and we are aware that Air France  
will pick a partner sometime this year. We hope it is us,'' she 
said from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	She said such a partnership would allow Delta an alliance as  
well as growth within the European market. 
</P>
<P>
	Les Echos attributed Air France's decision to its competition on  
U.S.-Europe routes with an alliance joining Continental with some 
other major European carriers, including Alitalia and KLM Royal 
Dutch Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Air France Chairman Jean-Cyril Spinetta has said recently that  
he would explain the company's choice by the end of the year. Les 
Echos said an announcement could come as early as Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Trade Deficit Holds at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's trade deficit held steady in April --  
though still at a record high -- amid early signs that U.S. 
companies are selling more products to foreign countries recovering 
from recession. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it cannot be said that the world's markets for U.S  
products is booming again, it certainly does look as if the bottom 
has been reached,'' said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist at Naroff 
Economic Advisors in Holland, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	April's trade deficit of $18.9 billion matched a revised  
estimate of the deficit in March, the Commerce Department said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The government originally had pegged the March deficit at $19.7  
billion. The new, lower March estimate, however, was still a record 
high. 
</P>
<P>
	Global economic troubles that started nearly two years ago in  
Asia have hampered America's trade performance as overseas markets 
for U.S. products have dwindled and a flood of cheap imports causes 
stiff competition for domestic producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Highlighting how badly America's trade picture has deteriorated,  
the government released a separate report Thursday showing that the 
deficit in the current account -- the broadest measure of trade -- 
hit an all-time high of $68.6 billion in the first three months of 
this year. The current account covers not only trade in merchandise 
and services, which are reflected in the regular monthly report, 
but also investment flows and foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
	American exports have started to pick up this spring, however,  
as other countries have begun a tentative recovery from recession. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports, which had fallen for five previous months, staged  
a small comeback in April, rising 1.2 percent to $78 billion. The 
improvement touched all product categories from foods to consumer 
goods such as appliances, and industrial supplies including cotton 
cloth and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports also continued to rise, climbing 1 percent to $97  
billion in April, a record high. Nevertheless, there were several 
bright spots. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports from Japan dropped for the first time since November,  
pulling the sensitive deficit with the Asian economic powerhouse 
down 13.1 percent to $5.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the trade deficit with Mexico, a partner in the  
controversial North American Free Trade Agreement, also declined in 
April by 32.5 percent to $1.7 billion due to a sharp drop in 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
	And imports of motor vehicles and parts declined in April by 5.9  
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, National Association of Manufacturers president  
Jerry Jasinowski said that ``slow economic growth abroad is 
continuing to hurt manufacturers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America's deficit with the 15-nation European Union increased by  
9.7 percent to $2.9 billion in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, imports from China rose to $5.8 billion, the highest since  
November. That helped push the U.S. trade deficit with China -- the 
second-biggest with any country behind Japan -- up by 15.7 percent 
to $4.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the April deficit with countries belonging to the  
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- which agreed this 
spring to limit production in the face of falling world demand for 
oil -- more than doubled in April to $1.8 billion, the most since 
October 1997. That was largely due to a sharp spike in oil and gas 
prices because of the production limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials have argued that while such a  
high overall trade deficit is not sustainable indefinitely, it has 
a positive side: As the only major economy doing well, the United 
States is playing a valuable role providing markets for other 
countries struggling to get back on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists also note that cheap imports have helped keep  
inflation low here during a period of unusually high employment and 
heavy spending by Americans.

<HEADLINE> House OKs Posting of 10 Commandments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House, working on a bill to deter juvenile  
crime, voted today to permit the display of the Ten Commandments in 
schools as lawmakers headed toward a showdown on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	By 248-180, House members approved Rep. Robert Aderholt's  
amendment to allow states to decide whether to permit such displays 
on government property. The amendment, Aderholt said, was a first 
step toward reinstilling the value of human life in children 
influenced by violent culture. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said recently that if the  
Ten Commandments had been posted at Columbine High School, the 
April 20 massacre there would never have happened. The amendment's 
sponsor didn't go that far. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand that simply posting the Ten Commandments will not  
instantly change the moral character of our nation,'' Aderholt, 
R-Ala., said. ``However, it is an important step to promote 
morality, and an end of children killing children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote prompted a sharp rebuke from groups that say the  
amendment violates the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is just one more sad example of religion being  
used as a political football by a Congress which apparently cannot 
find any real solution to the problem under debate,'' said Barry 
Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of 
Church and State. ``Congress probably should spend more time 
obeying the Ten Commandments and less time trying to exploit them 
for crass political purposes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court in 1980 struck down as unconstitutional a  
Kentucky law requiring the posting of a copy of the Ten 
Commandments in each public school classroom. The court said such 
postings violated the required separation of religion and 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, the House rejected, 266-161, an amendment by  
Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., that would have given video game 
manufacturers six months to come up with a labeling system that 
alerts parents to violent materials in their products. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote on the Aderholt amendment was a victory for  
conservatives in the debate over whether violent culture, the 
proliferation of guns or a combination of the two are responsible 
for a sudden outbreak of school shootings and other youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans for the most part have sided with a cultural  
solution and taken aim at the entertainment industry, pushing 
legislation to change the violent and sexual content of movies, 
video games, music and thus real life. Democrats, meanwhile, want 
more laws to keep guns out of the hands of children. 
</P>
<P>
	The House today also approved by voice vote a proposal by Rep.  
Ed Markey, D-Mass., commissioning a study of the firearms 
industry's marketing practices to children. A similar provision was 
passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Aderholt's victory provided fresh evidence that the gun  
restrictions passed by the Senate stand little chance of surviving 
the House. Democrats are fighting the powerful gun lobby and the 
most senior House member of their own party, Rep. John Dingell of 
Michigan, who has proposed a shorter waiting period for gun 
purchase background checks than those proposed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're up against a lot of money,'' House Democratic leader  
Dick Gephardt of Missouri said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The votes today followed defeat of another cultural proposal  
that would have curbed access by children to explicit sexual or 
violent material in video games and movies. Propelled by aggressive 
lobbying by the entertainment industry, the House rejected the 
measure Wednesday on a 282-146 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course we worked it hard,'' Jack Valenti, president of the  
Motion Picture Association of America, told reporters in a 
conference call shortly after the vote. ``I think whoever drafted 
the bill drafted it in such a way as to be simply, blatantly, and I 
guess irrefutably, unconstitutional.''	   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said the measure was designed to ``slow 
the flood of toxic waste into our kids' minds.'' But at one point 
in the debate, Hyde acidly acknowledged that he could not compete 
with the industry's political action committee -- a reference to 
campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who thinks (school violence) has nothing to do with the  
media is an idiot,'' Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., said today on the 
House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-gun-control Democrats, meanwhile, were still fighting  
Dingell, who is pushing a National Rifle Association-backed 
amendment that would cut the waiting period for background checks 
at gun shows from three days in the Senate bill to 24 hours. If 
there's no definitive answer in that time period, the purchaser may 
take possession of the gun. Dingell said most gun checks are 
completed in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton awoke at 5 a.m. in Paris to telephone four  
wavering Democrats: Reps. Gary Condit and Mike Thompson of 
California, Marion Berry of Arkansas and Ron Kind of Wisconsin. 
Clinton urged a ``no'' vote on the NRA-supported Dingell amendment.

<HEADLINE> Odom Wants To Return to College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KINGSTOWN, R.I. (AP) -- Lamar Odom wants out of the NBA  
draft so he can return to play for Rhode Island next season. 
</P>
<P>
	John Vanner, Rhode Island's assistant athletic director,  
confirmed Odom's decision today, but added, ``I don't know why he 
changed his mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old player averaged 17.6 points and 9.4 rebounds  
last season. He is rated among the top five picks in the NBA draft 
on June 30 by several scouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulling out of the draft won't be easy because the 6-foot-9  
forward already signed with an agent. But athletic director Ron 
Petro is looking into filing an appeal with the NCAA to have Odom 
reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom signed with New York agent Jeff Klein but has since fired  
him, Rhode Island coach Jerry DiGregorio said. Under NCAA rules, 
anyone who signs with an agent is barred from returning to college 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NCAA grants Odom a waiver by an NBA deadline of June 23,  
Odom could remove his name from the pro draft and return to school. 
It is unclear what arguments Rhode Island would use to justify a 
waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Odom's commitment to playing pro basketball next season came  
into doubt over the weekend, when he skipped a leaguewide physical. 
He then canceled a workout with the Charlotte Hornets on Wednesday, 
and turned up on Rhode Island's campus Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an individual signs with an agent, they are ineligible,''  
said Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of agent and gambling 
activities. ``If there are mitigating circumstances, they are 
examined.''

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Under Fire From IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A senior member of the International  
Olympic Committee today said the biggest scandal in the movement's 
history was ``born from the people in Salt Lake City.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Our marvelous, wonderful movement ... will always have been  
besmirched,'' Mexico's Mario Vazquez Rana told the Salt Lake 
organizers. `This is something that comes from that wonderful 
country that is the USA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rana, the media magnate who heads the world's national Olympic  
associations, was commenting on a progress report presented to the 
IOC by Mitt Romney, the new head of the Salt Lake Organizing 
Committee, and members of his team. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the vote-buying scandal surrounding Salt Lake's bid  
for the 2002 Winter Games stemmed from the actions of a few bid 
committee officials who have since been removed and are under 
investigation by both state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We share the concern, the sense of outrage that something as  
lofty as the Olympic spirit could be tarnished by the actions of a 
few,'' Romney said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are dedicated to the principle that a few people cannot  
ruin anything so great as the Olympics. The people of Salt lake 
City ... did not take those inappropriate actions. A few people 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But referring to the state and federal investigations into the  
bribery scandal, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch suggested 
some IOC members might be reluctant to visit the United States for 
fear they might be subpoenaed or charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting that the IOC executive board plans to meet in Salt Lake  
next year, Samaranch said, ``I hope before this meeting, as soon as 
possible, these problems can be over ... The past is past. The past 
was a good lesson for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least four IOC members were reportedly questioned by the FBI  
last month when they attended a Coordination Commission meeting in 
Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from Salt Lake bidders. The 
former two top Salt Lake bid and organizing committee officials 
lost their jobs in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding Vazquez Rana's charge that the people of Salt Lake  
were mostly at fault, Romney told a news conference: ``I'd suggest 
that perhaps the percentage of blame has been allocated too 
strongly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake City was also criticized for underestimating the cost  
of the games when its bidding committee submitted its estimated 
budget, forcing the new organizing committee to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I remember when we voted for Salt Lake four years ago, the  
budget was $790 million, not $1.45 billion,'' said Alex Gilady of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	He suggested Salt Lake and other bidding cities ``like to  
decorate'' their proposed budgets ``so we'll like it when we are 
voting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said the reason Salt Lake's budget was so low was because  
``there is no effective equivalent of accounting principles passed 
from one games to the next. 
</P>
<P>
	``When our team got into the games, they learned they had been  
very naive and incomplete. They didn't know what the full cost 
would be. They didn't know information technology would be $200 
million ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney said his organizing committee hopes to leave a detailed  
accounting that can be used by other cities in assessing costs and 
submitting bids.

<HEADLINE> Cartoonists Confront Race Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Five rich, white people wait for a  
train. One holds a newspaper that reads, ``Iverson Ignites City.'' 
Their hair is in corn rows. 
</P>
<P>
	The editorial cartoon was intended as a critique of whites'  
belated embrace of Allen Iverson, a black basketball star for the 
Philadelphia 76ers with a bad-boy reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	Not everyone got the message. A black reader wrote to say  
focusing on black hairstyles was racist, and the cartoonist, who is 
white, wasn't surprised by the reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think race is such a sensitive issue that any time you do  
anything about it there's somebody who wants to take offense,'' 
said Signe Wilkinson of The Philadelphia Daily News. ``We forget 
that well into the 1950s and 1960s, racist images in America were 
ubiquitous. If you're 50 years or older, they're still in the back 
of your head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Association of Editorial Cartoonists met Thursday  
in Chattanooga to discuss, among other topics, the perils of 
offending people in the process of trying to denounce racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Days, the deputy managing editor of the Philadelphia  
newspaper, said many complaints -- such as the one about Ms. 
Wilkinson's cartoon, which he liked -- reflect minorities' general 
mistrust of papers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you talk about mainstream press, a lot of black folks, a  
lot of Latinos ... they put `white' in front of it,'' said Days, 
who is black. ``There is a belief it is suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirk Walters, editorial cartoonist with The Blade of Toledo,  
Ohio, said he was startled when some blacks protested his 1998 
cartoon about the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Klan had denounced the dragging murder of James Byrd Jr. in  
Jasper, Texas, and Walters, who is white, saw the move as 
hypocritical. He drew a cartoon Klansman saying his group opposes 
``tying negroes'' to truck bumpers because ``it could hurt the 
resale value of the truck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some blacks felt the drawing made light of a gruesome hate  
crime. Thirteen of the 17 members of the Ohio Legislative Black 
Caucus signed a letter requesting an apology from the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't meant to be funny,'' Walters said. ``It was meant to  
say look what's going on. The Klan has made a deliberate effort to 
appear mainstream. ... That couldn't stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vanessa Gallman, editorial page editor of the Lexington (Ky.)  
Herald-Leader, said cartoonists shouldn't be surprised by an angry 
response, considering readers remember past slights, even if 
they're unrelated to a specific drawing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think editorial cartoonists should assume people think  
they're the good guy,'' said Ms. Gallman, who is black. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also said editors need to differentiate between  
legitimate complaints and those meant only to further someone's 
political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gallman said cartoonists often know more about world issues  
than the problems in their own communities. She suggested 
``plugging in'' to local groups and also adding blacks in crowd 
scenes and in other everyday situations in drawings. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to show more that minorities exist other than when  
the cartoons are about race,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Robertson Warns GOP Leaders of Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pat Robertson warned Senate GOP leaders  
Thursday that Vice President Al Gore is ``co-opting a number of 
Republican issues,'' and urged them to energize religious 
conservatives by holding votes on an agenda stressing faith and 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview, the Christian Coalition president said he also  
brought up the Internal Revenue Service's recent denial of 
tax-exempt status for his organization in a series of meetings he 
requested with GOP senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he suggested they conduct a ``Senate inquiry'' of  
the IRS for ``selective enforcement'' because it has granted 
tax-exempt status to liberal organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those Robertson met with were Senate Majority Leader Trent  
Lott, R-Miss.; Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla., and Finance 
Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del. He said he received no 
commitments for votes or for an IRS inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson made his rounds on Capitol Hill a day after Gore  
formally announced his candidacy for president, stressing family, 
values and faith. 
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore is in the process of co-opting a number of Republican  
issues,'' Robertson said, adding that the 2000 voting ``could be 
the most crucial election of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he told Lott that with the votes lawmakers have  
taken so far this year, ``the average person doesn't understand 
what the Republican Congress is doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he suggested votes on a proposed constitutional  
amendment to protect religious Americans from discrimination, and 
on a GOP plan to reduce taxes on married couples, many of them now 
paying more than they would if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson also emphasized the need for the GOP to express its  
desire to win a veto-proof majority in favor of banning certain 
late-term abortions that opponents have labeled ``partial-birth 
abortions, according to Christian Coalition spokesman Mike Russell. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Robertson had requested the meetings at this time,  
Russell said the Christian Coalition founder was disappointed by 
``the knee-jerk reaction'' of the Senate to the shootings at 
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate approved some restrictions on gun sales. Russell said  
Robertson believes that Congress should instead address ``the real 
moral problems of this country'' by helping families and 
emphasizing faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said he also told the senators that his group will get  
strongly involved in next year's congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Christian Coalition isn't in the game, the Republicans  
are going to lose'' in 2000,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has concluded that some Christian Coalition activities,  
such as its distributing voter guides at churches across the 
country, were too partisan for it to enjoy tax-exempt status. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he had asked the Republican senators to intervene with  
IRS on his group's behalf, Robertson said he did not have to 
because the ruling amounts to ``only be a hiccup in our 
operation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Coalition officials have said the group is  
reorganizing itself to deal with the ruling. A new Christian 
Coalition International will engage in partisan activity, including 
candidate endorsements and political contributions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Christian Coalition of Texas, a tax-exempt group, will be  
renamed Christian Coalition of America and will limit its activity 
to nonpartisan ``voter education.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Chimps Have Culture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chimpanzees have culture -- take it from researchers who have  
studied the behavior exhibited by mankind's closest relative. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the first time scientists have concluded that a species  
other than humans has a culture, or a way of life based on customs 
that are learned and shared rather than genetically programmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The evidence is overwhelming that chimpanzees have a  
remarkable ability to invent new customs and technologies, and they 
pass these on socially,'' said primatologist Frans de Waal of Emory 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by primatologist Andrew Whiten of the University of  
St. Andrews in Scotland and others was published today in the 
journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Chimps and ancestral humans split on the evolutionary tree more  
than 4 million years ago, but the ape's genetic code still overlaps 
ours by more than 98 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Primatologists generally consider chimps to be as mentally  
capable as a 4-year-old child, and they share many practices with 
primitive human cultures, including social bonds, certain hunting 
habits and the use of plants for medicinal purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	But culture?  
</P>
<P>
	The researchers cite different examples: Some chimps greedily  
slurp ants off a stick as if it were a wriggling lollipop, while 
others daintily pluck them, one by one. Some mop their brows with 
leaves; others demurely raise their arms while companions groom 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's findings are based on an analysis of chimp data  
spanning five decades. It was co-written by Jane Goodall, the 
world-renowned scientist who has been observing primates at Gombe 
Stream in Tanzania since 1960 in the longest-running animal 
behavior project. 
</P>
<P>
	The research found at least 39 customs related to chimps' tool  
use, grooming and courtship. The customs vary widely from group to 
group, much as they do in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists said it is too early to tell if some chimp  
cultures are more advanced than others. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we see in wild chimps, on a lesser scale, is the sort of  
cultural diversity that we would see in traditional human 
societies,'' said primatologist Craig Stanford of the University of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Some anthropologists disagree, saying the primate researchers  
had redefined culture in order to include chimps. The customs 
practiced by a human culture are more than a collection of 
behaviors, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their claim for chimps depends on an operational definition  
that is quite unlike that used by cultural anthropologists,'' said 
Daniel Segal of Stanford University, editor of the journal Cultural 
Anthropology. 
</P>
<P>
	Many animal species learn fundamental survival skills from their  
parents, and their habits differ depending on where they live. 
Songbirds, for example, learn local dialects of their species' 
song. 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins swim in groups and have a complex communications  
system, while elephants display a range of emotions, including 
grief. 
</P>
<P>
	But the extensive types of behavior among chimps are  
unparalleled and are not necessarily dictated by particular 
boundaries or environments. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tanzania, chimps at Gombe routinely use sticks to probe the  
ground for termites, but chimps 100 miles away in the Mahale 
Mountains do not. 
</P>
<P>
	Gombe chimps don't use stones to crack nuts, even though their  
terrain is strewn with rocks. But Tai rainforest chimps in the 
Ivory Coast use stone tools even though rocks are scarce. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tai, grooming chimps wipe parasites on their forearms before  
mashing them with their forefingers. At Gombe, groomers mash 
parasites on a leaf. 
</P>
<P>
	What remains unresolved is the origins' of chimp customs and  
precisely how they are shared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just now beginning to videotape families to see how they  
acquire these behaviors,'' said Ann Pusey of the University of 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings raise an important consideration in the  
conservation of chimpanzees' rapidly dwindling populations across 
Africa. Logging, hunting and farming have reduced the chimp 
population to less than 200,000, down from the millions of 
chimpanzees 100 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not just losing chimpanzees,'' Whiten said. ``We are  
losing the diversity of chimpanzee cultures.''

<HEADLINE> Daly Back in Hunt in Another Major  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- John Daly was back in his element  
Thursday -- big stick in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-hitting Daly, who has either missed the cut or  
withdrawn from eight of 16 PGA Tour events this season, was as 
surprised as the next guy that he carded a 2-under-par 68 in the 
first round of the U.S. Open to trail four leaders by one shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am about as much in shock as everybody else,'' said Daly,  
who started his round with three straight birdies. ``I got off to a 
great start and that's something I haven't done in a long time. To 
birdie the first three holes in the U.S. Open just doesn't happen 
too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's especially true in a tournament Daly contemplated  
skipping. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of nine players to shoot under par in the first round  
at The Olympic Club in San Francisco last year only to finish with 
rounds of 75, 75 and 78. He was tired of Opens with narrow fairways 
and 5-inch rough taking the driver out of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
	But he decided to come to Pinehurst No. 2 after hearing of the  
wide, flat fairways where he could whale away and hit his favorite 
club -- the driver. He did just that Thursday, using only one iron 
off the tee on a par-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a major championship should be played to where you've  
got to play golf and not having to hit the 4-, 5- and 3-irons off 
the tees,'' Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly, who has the 1991 PGA and 1995 British Open under his  
rather tight belt, is as intriguing, funny and easy to root for as 
ever. He still battles alcoholism and remains honest about his 
fight with booze. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are days when I get down on sobriety,'' said Daly, who  
has been seeing a sports psychologist the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Daly would wind down after his excellent first round by eating  
six cheeseburgers, a bag of cookies and drinking milk. 
</P>
<P>
	``John is coming around,'' fellow golfer Payne Stewart said.  
``He has got his composure. I think he is in control of his life 
and he has thought of a way to play this golf course and he's doing 
a good job of it. More power to him, I think it is great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There still are days Daly has no confidence on the course and  
has meltdowns, like his six-putt on the 18th green in the Memorial 
two weeks ago that capped a first-round 82 and prompted him to 
withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	He had his act together Thursday, except for an errant drive on  
No. 18 that cost him a bogey and a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter, Daly still received a warm welcome from fans  
surrounding the final green. He broke into a wide smile and waved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the greatest feeling in the world,'' Daly said of the fan  
support. ``Fans have stuck with me through thick and thin, and it 
was so nice to give them a good round today. It's just awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's anybody's guess -- including Daly's -- how long his success  
will last this week at tricky Pinehurst No. 2. Or if it will. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing with me is I don't know who is going to show up  
tomorrow,'' Daly said. ``It's kind of scary, but I want to soak 
this day in and pat myself on the back for a round that I much 
needed for myself and my self-esteem.''

<HEADLINE> Mortgage Rates Rise / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages, which has been rising for two months, climbed 
to 7.65 percent this week, the highest level in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was up from 7.51 percent last week and represented  
the highest level for 30-year-mortgages since June 1997, according 
to a weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb for the past two  
months and have fluctuated from their low for this year of 6.74 
percent set at the end of January and their current rate of 7.65 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.26 percent this week, up from the average of 7.13 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 5.94 percent, up from 5.92 percent the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages.
