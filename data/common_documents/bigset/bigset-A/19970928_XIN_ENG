<HEADLINE> Kuwait GDP Rises to 30 Billion Dollars in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) surged to 30.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 from
26.2 billion dollars in 1995, Governor of Kuwait Central Bank
Salem Abdelaziz Al-Sabah said today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said the trade balance surplus and the current
account surplus climbed by 25.7 percent and 44.3 percent
respectively last year to hit 6.78 billion dollars and 6.5
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the actual deficit has decreased to its lowest
level during the 1995/96 fiscal year (July 1 to June 30) of 2.16
billion dollars, accounting for 7.1 percent of the GDP before
deducting allocations of oil revenues for the Future Generations
Reserves, the bank governor said.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait annually allocate, by law, 10 percent of its total
state revenues in the budget to the reserves fund which fell to
around 30 billion dollars from 100 billion dollars after
paying for the huge costs of the Gulf War. So far unofficial
sources said the fund has increased to more than 40 billion
dollars although no official figures are available.
</P>
<P>
Earnings of Kuwaiti foreign investments, mainly from this
fund, in 1996/97 exceeded actual oil revenue of over 9.9 billion
dollars in 1995/96 fiscal year, according to figures of Kuwait
Investment Authority.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the 1997 economic performance, Al-Sabah said that
1997 promises more of the same as the trade balance surplus grew
during the first half of the year to 3.18 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that a surplus in the state budget in the 1996/97
fiscal year seemed very likely to be realized.
</P>
<P>
He said the improving world oil prices and the healthy
trading at money markets played a major role in reviving the
Kuwaiti economy.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's 1997/98 budget forecasts an oil revenues of 8.45
billion dollars which is expected to exceed because of rise in
the world oil prices.

countries, according to a joint statement carried by Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the agreement which was signed in
Manama stipulates that both markets would make available to

Qatar and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Oman and Bahrain have already linked their floors and a
number of companies from the two countries have been listed
in both exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Exchange officials believe that Kuwait and Bahrain joining
together of their markets would encourage cross-listing of
companies and the flow of capital between the two countries,
thus boosting the economic cooperation among them.

<HEADLINE> US, Russia Agree to Put Off Deadline on START II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Russia
have signed a package of arms control agreements, pushing back by
five years the implementation of one of the major nuclear
disarmament treaties between the two powers in the cold war era,
U.S. and Russian officials confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
But the new package could clear the way for further cuts in
nuclear weapons of the United States and Russia, disarmament
experts said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed the accords
Friday at a New York hotel with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgev
Primakov, who is here to attending the 52nd session of the U.N.
General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would give Russia until the end of 2007 to
dismantle launching systems as required by the second arms
reductions treaty, or START II. However, the systems, including
missile silos, bombers and submarines, must still be disabled by
2003.
</P>
<P>
The accords were signed as the ratification of START II has
stalled in Russia. They were designed to break the logjam in the
process.
</P>
<P>
Some military and political leaders in Moscow have repeatedly
complained that START II put Russi at a strategic disadvantage
since it requires the elimination of all land-based
multiple-warhead missiles, the core of Russia's arsenal, while
allowing the United States to keep its multiple warhead missiles
on submarines.
</P>
<P>
The package put into writing the pledges made by U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin during their
meeting in Helsinki last March.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Russian leaders agreed to take steps toward
winning approval of the START II and pledged to try to cut the
number of long-range nuclear warheads by another third in a START
III.
</P>
<P>
Primakov hailed the package as "a new joint success, a radical
success in arms control" which "will determine the course of arms
control for many years to come."
</P>
<P>
He was echoed by Albright who said that the package "marks a
turning point in our approach to nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
"We have been very successful in mastering the challenges left
in the wake of the cold war. Now we will turn to arms control for
a new century, beyond eliminating mistrust to eliminating actual
nuclear weapons," she added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Criticizes Republicans for Delaying Judicial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton today accused Republicans of resorting to "the worst of
partisan politics" to block his nominations of dozens of federal
judges.
</P>
<P>
In his weekly radio speech, Clinton said, "We can't let
partisan politics shut down our courts and gut our judicial
system." There are about 100 judicial seats that remain vacant
across the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the resulting impasse constitutes "a very real
threat to our judicial system" by leaving courts clogged with
unheard cases.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he has sent the Senate 70 nominations this year to
cut back on the 100 vacant federal judgeships, but lawmakers have
acted on only 18.
</P>
<P>
Republicans argued they are trying to ensure that judges are
well qualified and won't devote themselves to politically
motivated activist decisions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Senate confirmed just 17 justices, which Clinton
said was "the lowest election-year total in over 40 years."
</P>
<P>
"Under the pretense of preventing so-called judicial activism,
they've taken aim at the very independence our founders sought to
protect," said Clinton, who is on a four-day visit in his home
state Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
He called Republican stalling tactics "the worst of partisan
politics."
</P>
<P>
Clintons said the result is "a vacancy crisis in our courts
that Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist warned could
undermine our courts' ability to fairly administer justice."
</P>
<P>
The blocked nominations have stalled tens of thousands of civil
cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
And in criminal courts, Clinton said, "Nearly 16,000 cases are
caught in limbo while criminals on bail await punishment and
victims await justice. Our sitting judges are overloaded and
overworked, and our justice system is strained to the breaking
point."
</P>
<P>
Clinton appointed 204 federal judges to lifetime jobs in his
first four-year term.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Minister: Wounded Hamas Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The wounded official of the
Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in Amman is recovering and his
condition is "stable", a Jordanian minister said here today.
</P>
<P>
Khalid Mashiel, head of the political bureau Hamas in Amman,
was attacked by two Canadian tourists in front of his office in
Amman on Thursday and is now in the King Hussein Medical Center
(KHMC) for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian police detained those involved in the attack and
investigation was underway, Radio Jordan quoted Samir Mutawe,
Minister of state for Information, as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Hamas office in Amman accused the attack as an
assassination attempt by Mossad, the Israeli security department.
</P>
<P>
Mutawe said on Thursday that the incident was only the result
of a quarrel between Mashiel's driver and two Canadian tourists.
</P>
<P>
The attack on Mashiel happened amid increasing tension between
the Arabs and Israelis here after Israeli embassy guards were
attacked on Monday in Amman. Two Israeli security guards were
wounded and the criminals are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Ibrahim Ghosheh, Hamas spokesman in Amman,
was detained after he spoke to Reuters Television that the armed
struggle against Israel would continue.
</P>
<P>
Ghosheh made the remarks after the Izzedin Qassam Brigades, the
military wing of Hamas, claimed responsibility for the suicide
bombing attacks in Jerusalem in July and September, which killed 25
people and injured more than 300 others.
</P>
<P>
Hamas was established in 1987 to fight against Israel`s
occupation of Palestinian land. The Izzedin Qassam Brigades was
formed in 1992.

BAGHDAD, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq lodged a strongly-worded
protest to the U.N. Security Council against the violations of the
Iraqi air space by a U.S. reconnaissance U2 plane, the Iraqi News
Agency reported today.

<P>
The protest was made in a message sent by Iraqi Deputy Prime

<P>
This is in violation of the U.N. Charter on the sovereignty
of the member states and non-interference in their internal
affairs, said the message.

for the first time in August, 1995, violated Iraqi air space for
over 375 times till the end of last August, according to the

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Urged U.N. to Focus on Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) has
appealed to the U.N. to attach great importance to peace,
stability and economic development in Africa, an OAU press
release said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first ministerial meeting of the U.N. Security
Council Friday in New York, Salim said conflicts cause
irreparable loss, damage and destruction to the African continent
and its people, leading to acute humanitarian tragedies.
</P>
<P>
On the urgent need for the elimination of the root causes of
humanitarian crisis in Africa, Salim said the United Nations and
the OAU should learn from the failure to anticipate and
effectively prevent the crime of genocide in Rwanda which
resulted in the decimation of hundreds of thousands of human
beings.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief urged the United Nations and the OAU to learn
from the inability of the Security Council to respond
appropriately to the call by African leaders to deal with the
crisis in the eastern part of former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He called for the forging ahead of a new and true partnership
that can enable the two bodies to address together in a sustained
manner the acute problems facing Africa.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the question of conflicts, Salim said the U.N.
and the OAU should pay more attention to preventive diplomacy
and preventive deployment in Africa and help build a joint capacity
for post conflict reconstruction and peace-building.
</P>
<P>
Salim also called on the U.N. to provide the OAU with the
necessary logistical and technical assistance that is needed to
enhance the organizations' capacity to respond to conflict
situations, the press release added.

JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A new political party,
the United Democratic Movement, was launched here today.
</P>
<P>
The new party, co-headed by former African National Congress
parliament member Bantu Holomisa and former National Party
General Secretary stalwart Roelf Meyer, is the first non-racial
party to have been formed in South Africa after the democratic
elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Among the party's aims and objectives is the "establishment of
a true South African constitutional democracy which rejects
racial domination of apartheid in reverse, which respects,
upholds and protects human dignity, life, liberty and the
prospertiy of its citizens".
</P>
<P>
The party also wants constitutional powers to be optimally
devoloped to the lowest possible sphere of government and
"preferably originally established at that level."
</P>
<P>
On civil order, it proposes that "people should be consulted
on the reimposition of the death penalty."
</P>
<P>
The government was opposed to the restoration of the death
penalty although there were cries for it owing to wide-spread
violence and crimes.
</P>
<P>
The new party urged the crackdown on crime.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in a very real sense experiencing a state of
emergency in the country on the question of crime and the
situation must be regarded and addressed as such," a policy
document of the party said.
</P>
<P>
The party also sets out its vision for South Africa's economy,
education, housing and health and welfare.
</P>
<P>
The official launch, held in the World Trade Center in Kempton
Park, was attended by 1,000 delegates and at least another 4,000
supporters from the nine provinces.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Ruling Parties Meet to Discuss Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 27 (Xinhua) -- High-ranking officials
from South Africa's three ruling political parties today started
a two-day preparatory meeting ahead of ANC's forthcoming policy
conference.
</P>
<P>
The three parties are African National Congress (ANC), the
South African Communist Party (SACP) and the Congress of South
African Trade Unions (COSATU).
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Tito Mboweni, who heads the ANC's policy unit,
said the party is facing a number of important issues such as how
to manage the relationship between the government and the ruling
party in policy formulation.
</P>
<P>
"Another complication is how the ANC moves in step with its
alliance partners (the SACP and COSATU)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from the three parties broke into five groups
to discuss economic issues, social transformation, peace and
stability, governance and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Among those who attended the meeting are ministers of finance,
trade, transport, constitution as well as safety and security.

<HEADLINE> French Anti-Terrorist Experts Consider GIA Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- French anti-terrorist experts
said today that the new threat posed by Algeria's extremist Armed
Islamic Group (GIA) was nothing new as it is neither precise nor
different from those published before by the extremist group.
</P>
<P>
The French military secret service Direction Generale de la
Surveillance Exterieure (DGSE) obtained a copy of the communique
by the GIA as early as Monday, and the DGSE was the only one to
judge the text as "worrying," said Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
In the communique published Friday in the London-based
underground bulletin of the GIA, "Al Ansar," the GIA claimed
responsibility for the massacres of civilians and threatened
France with new terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
While justifying the killings with religious terms, the GIA did
not claim responsibility for the latest massacre in Bentalha south
of Algiers, in which at least 200 civilians were slaughtered
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted unidentified anti-terrorist experts as saying that
the text's publication coincided with the questioning by British
police of Abu Hamza, the editor-in-chief of "Al Ansar," this week.
A French judge in charge of human rights issues also participated
in the questioning in London.
</P>
<P>
It also coincided with the second anniversary of the death of
Khaled Kelkal, one of the leaders of the Islamic network in Europe
which staged a wave of terrorist attacks in Paris and Lyon in
1995. Kelkal was shot dead by French military police on September
29, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Except a few subtle ways of presentation and a few phrases, the
text is strictly identical with those published by the GIA before,
said experts.
</P>
<P>
What is new about the text is its warning against the United
Nations, whose Secretary General Kofi Annan recently appealed for
tolerance and dialogue in Algeria. The GIA asked the United
Nations not to "follow the way of France."
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the new threat posed by the GIA against
France is "less serious" than the the letter addressed to
President Jacques Chirac on the eve of the 1996 Christmas, in
which the GIA threatened to launch attacks in France. The threats
were not followed up by action.
</P>
<P>
The French Interior Ministry also remains prudent over the
threat by the GIA although it said that the communique "seems to
be authentic."

<HEADLINE> Measles Breaks Out in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Health Ministry of Sierra Leone
today confirmed a measles epidemic had broken out in the north of the
country.
</P>
<P>
A director in charge of disease control under the ministry
said that
some 3,000 cases of measles had been reported so far, according
to the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The official did not mention the death roll, but a report reaching
here said that at least 10 persons died of the disease in the past
three days, half of them children.
</P>
<P>
According to the director, the first case of measles was reported
in June this year and disease control teams, including one from the
United Nations Children's Fund, have been sent to the area.
</P>
<P>
There has been reports of short supply of daily necessities,
including medicines in Sierra Leone since west African countries
imposed sanctions after the May 25 coup that ousted the legitimate
government.
</P>
<P>
The situation has been worsened following the enforcement of the
economic embargo endorsed by the Economic Community of West African
States last month.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Refutes Turkey's Claim on Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides today refuted Turkey's claims that S-300
defensive missile system can pose a threat to Turkey, Cyprus News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Replying to the speech of his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem,
at the 52nd U.N. General Assembly session, Kasoulides told the
U.N. General Assembly that "I want to categorically state that
these weapons are purely defensive surface-to-air missiles
destined to defend the small island of Cyprus from a potential
attack, since it has no military airport of its own."
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the missiles will not be necessary if
there is substantial progress towards a Cyprus settlement or
agreement for the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot government's decision to purchase and deploy
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in January has triggered
tension between the small island nation and Turkey which has
threatened to strike if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Cem's statement that there are "two distinct
peoples, two separate administrations and two democracies" in
Cyprus, Kasoulides said this should not be the excuse of Turkey's
military presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops and
took over 37 percent of the island following a failed pro-Athens
coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has maintained 35,000 troops in Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part which declared in 1983 a
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus " recognized only
by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides also dismissed Cem's claims that Cyprus can not join
the European Union (EU), by citing a recent statement by
Luxemburg's Foreign Minister and EU President, Jacques Poos, that
the 1960 treaties, establishing the Republic of Cyprus, do not
prevent it from joining the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU full membership in 1990. The EU has
decided to start accession talks with Cyprus early next year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chirac Proposes Privileged EU-Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
has proposed the establishment of a "privileged partnership"
between Russia and European Union (EU) countries during his
three-day visit to Russia which ended today.
</P>
<P>
In a speech addressed to the students of the Institute of
International Relations in Moscow Friday, Chirac presented himself
as the main designer of such a partnership to the welcome of his
Russian hosts.
</P>
<P>
"I say to you with force that the European Union has the
vocation to be, in all the fields..., your primary partner. At the
dawn of the 21st century, it is a real association which should
progressively establish itself between Russia and the (European)
Union," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the mutual "opening between Eastern and
Western Europe is irreversible" and that "any division line should
be from now on excluded" in Europe.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no European security without Russia being fully
associated in it, giving it a profound consent and an active
participation," said Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal by Chirac is in line with the French policy in
the field of European security, where Paris always utters a voice
of "dissent" among its Western partners of NATO.
</P>
<P>
When NATO planned to expand itself toward former Warsaw Pact
countries, Chirac proposed the signing of a charter on bilateral
relations between Russia and NATO before three Eastern European
countries -- Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- were
admitted by the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was accepted by Russia and NATO and they signed
the treaty on bilateral relations in Paris on May 27 and
established the Russia-NATO Joint Council, which held its first
session in New York Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the NATO Madrid Summit in June, France refused to return
to the integrated military structure of NATO because of U.S.
refusal to hand over the Southern Command.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also announced in Moscow Friday that after France
completes the dismantling of its nuclear missile base in Albion,
southeastern France in 1999, no French nuclear warheads will be
targeted toward Russia.
</P>
<P>
These missiles were designed during the Cold War for quick
reaction strikes and can be fired within less than one minute.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the nuclear warheads carried by French navy
submarines and the Mirage 2000-N combat aircraft are not targeted
toward Russia either.
</P>
<P>
Chirac and Russian President Boris Yeltsin also reached total
agreement on reinforcing the role of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the only forum gathering all
European countries and Russia.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to cooperate to encourage Arabs and Israel to
relaunch the Middle East peace process, and to help consolidate
peace in Bosnia through organization of elections in the country.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that Chirac failed to recall in Moscow
that France has always supported NATO expansion and wants the
maintenance of the U.S. military presence in Europe although Paris
wishes to develop a European pillar within NATO by taking over the
Naples-based Southern Command of NATO.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is completely opposed to NATO expansion and to American
interference in European security affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Europeans, and they alone, should with Russia ensure the
defense and security in Europe without any exterior interference,"
said Yeltsin during his meeting with Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Reiterates Opposition to More Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgini
Primakov has said that Moscow would not oppose expanding the
number of permanent seats in the United Nations Security Council
if only Germany alone was concerned, said German news reports
today.
</P>
<P>
Asked by the German newspaper Bild to comment on Bonn's bid for
a permanent seat in the UN Security Council, Primakov said, "If we
were talking about Germany alone, our answer would be yes." Russia
had attached special importance to the Russian-German relations,
he added.
</P>
<P>
But he also stressed that Russia was still against an
enlargement of the Security Council's permanent seats because such
a move would actually also involve several other countries. Such
an enlargement would make the UN less effective, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian foreign minister also reiterated Moscow's strong
opposition to NATO's (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) possible
expansion into the three Baltic states, saying that it would put
into question the good relations between NATO and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that the responsible politicians of NATO would be wise
enough," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Defend Its State Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Amid mounting tensions with
Greece, Turkish leaders voiced today that Turkey is determined to
defend its national interests.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national maritime conference here, Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz said that Turkey will not remain
indifferent to its rights in the Aegean Sea, according to the
Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz stressed that Turkey will take action in the light of
the international law and practices.
</P>
<P>
On the current Cyprus missile crisis, the Turkish prime
minister reiterated that the Turkish government will use all
necessary means to block the deployment of the S-300 missiles
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey will tighten security measures in its
air space and the Turkish Straits to abort the missile
transfer into Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"No country allows its shores and territorial waters to be
used against its own sovereignty and state security," Yilmaz
said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Cyprus signed an arms deal to buy about 150
anti-aircraft S-300 missiles from Russia, triggering strong
criticism from Ankara and Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened that it will destroy these missiles
with force if they are finally deployed in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said
that the Aegean issue is a key problem for the Turkish-Greek
ties. adding that the two countries should rationally share the
waters and its resources.
</P>
<P>
"If this problem does not reach a just solution, the relations
between the two countries might become more tense," Ecevit
warned.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece has long been at odds over the sovereignty of
the Aegean sea and Cyprus issue. The dispute over an uninhabited
islet in the eastern Aegean that almost led to a war between the two
sides last year .
</P>
<P>
They pulled back their warships from the area following a
U.S. intervention, but the tensions between them remained.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Turkey accused Athens of encouraging the Cypriot
government to purchase Russian-made missiles, adding it would
negatively affect the settlement of the Cyprus issue.

to promote bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During Kumar's visit here next month, two agreements on tourism

Ambassador here Kanwal Sibal said today.
</P>
<P>
"The visit expresses the two sides' willingness to continue

</P>
<P>
"India seeks at present to set up new relations of partnership
outside the region for reviving cultural and trade ties," Sibal
added.
</P>
<P>
India supports the Mideast peace process and maintains close
ties with the developing countries in general and African states
in particular, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Frees Five IRA Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government released
five Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners Friday night as its
response to the IRA cease-fire and Sinn Fein's participation in
the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
This followed the release of two other IRA men last month
before completion of their sentences in the high-security
Portlaoise prison, 50 miles from Dublin, according to reports
reaching here today from the capital.
</P>
<P>
The men released from Portlaoise prison were arrested on the
border of Donegal and Derry in 1992 for possessing assault rifles,
heavy machine guns and several hundred rounds of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
At least 35 IRA personnel were freed before the 1994
cease-fire, but the release program was abandoned after the London
Docklands bombing in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein welcomed Friday night's releases and called on the
British government to begin releasing all "political prisoners"
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, raised the matter with
Bertie Ahern, the Irish prime minister, when they met in Dublin
last week.
</P>
<P>
Ian Paisley, the Democratic Unionist Party leader who refused
to join the peace talks next Monday, said Dublin had released the
IRA prisoners "to aid the IRA in wringing concessions from the
British government."

<HEADLINE> UK Public Opposed to Single Currency, Says Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 27 (Xinhua) - Most people in Britain remain
resolutely opposed to joining a single European currency,
according to a poll released today.
</P>
<P>
More than half the adult population, 57 percent, believed that
Britain should retain the pound even if other major European
powers launch the new currency on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Only 37 percent said they would like to join, said the poll
conducted by The Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the poll will be a setback for ministers
urging Prime Minister Tony Blair to hold a referendum next year to
secure a mandate to sign up to a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Rumor that the British government is adopting a more positive
approach to the single currency caused a flurry of excitement on
the stock market and re-ignited the political debate over monetary
union.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 jumped by 160.8 points to hit an all-time record
of 5226.3. Soaring bond prices triggered a surge in the value of
bank shares which ended the day with gains of almost 10 percent as
institutional investors scrambled to get their hands on the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook tried to
take the steam out of the rumor by saying "I think I can
authoritatively state that there will be no such announcement in
the immediate future."
</P>
<P>
Britain is due to make an announcement before the end of the
year on its approach to the European Monetary Union.
</P>
<P>
It is certain to confirm that Britain will not be in the first
wave of countries, led by France and Germany, initiating the
single currency at the start of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Arab Parliamentary Union Denounces Israel's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Damascus-based Arab
Parliamentary Union (APU) today denounced Israel's policy of
settlement, describing it as a serious challenge to the
foundations and principles of the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued by the Arab Parliamentary Union
in the Syrian capital today.
</P>
<P>
Israel has announced that it plans to make new settlements in
Jerusalem and Bethlehem and to construct 300 more residential
units for Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The plans are continuation of Israeli Prime Minister's Benjamin
Netanyahu's policy of Judaizing the Holy City of Jerusalem and
altering its Arab-Islamic identity, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Israel is trying to encircle the Arab cities with a belt of the
Jewish settlements, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
Announcing these plans, Israel defies all the U.N.
resolutions, the Madrid conference principles, the Oslo accords and
the will of the international community.
</P>
<P>
The APU called on parliamentarians of all over the world to
urge their governments to exert all types of pressure on Israel to
abandon this peace-destroying policy.
</P>
<P>
The APU pointed out that it is an international responsibility
to save the Mideast peace process by compelling Israel to abandon
its policy of settlement and to declare its commitment to the
principles of the peace process, particularly the land-for-peace
principle.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 27 (Xinhua) -- The Arab Parliamentary Union
(APU) today condemned the recent Turkish military invasion in
northern Iraq, calling it "a glaring violation of Iraq's
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here by the Damascus-based APU also termed
the Turkish cross-border military action to wipe out the outlawed
Turkey's Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq as "a flagrant threat to
the independence and territorial integrity" of that Arab country.
</P>
<P>
"This intervention is a crying violation of the U.N. Charter, the
rules of international laws and the principles of good
neighborhood", thus it is unacceptable, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish move is in defiance of the indignant reactions to
this intervention of Arab and Islamic countries and the
international community, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the Turkish government to withdraw its
forces from Iraqi territory immediately and to respect the
sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has also condemned strongly the recent
Turkish military intervention in northern Iraq, calling for
immediate withdrawal of Turkish forces.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,000 Turkish troops backed by more than 100 tanks entered
northern Iraq on September 22 to reinforce the Turkish forces there
in a bid to wipe out guerrillas of the outlawed Kurdish Worders'
Party based in the region.

acres of bush and forest and 20 homes.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 people were forced to flee their homes during the

area, state forestry officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all of the residents of the small towns of Dobbins and
Oregon House had to leave, officials of the California Department
of Forestry said.
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 firefighters were dispatched and air tankers,
helicopters and bulldozers were used to fight the fire that

<HEADLINE> New Computer, Crewman Arrive at Dilapidated Mir </HEADLINE>

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Atlantis crew pushed
through a new motion-control computer to replace the one that has
crashed three times in three weeks seconds after the hatches
between the space shuttle and Russia's decrepit Mir station swung
open Saturday, the NASA Space Center in Houston said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mir's new American crewman, David Wolf, told the
ground controllers that he was comfortable aboard the aging
station, his home for the next four months, as he woke up on the
shuttle Sunday morning and prepared for his big move into the
space station.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis, carrying the 41-year-old doctor-engineer and six
others, pulled up and docked earlier as Mir's central computer
held it steady at a crucial time.
</P>
<P>
When the Atlantis crew members entered the station, they were
greeted with hugs, handshakes and smiles from Foale, who has spent
four and a half months on Mir, and his two Russian crewmates.
</P>
<P>
The crews will carry water, food, plugs for holes, pressurized
air tanks and other important gear from Atlantis to the station
during the six days of links.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Return More Revenues to PNA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu today said he has ordered the release of more
withheld revenues to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
At an urgent cabinet meeting, Netanyahu instructed the Finance
Ministry to speed up the return of the taxes Israel had collected
for the PNA in response to PNA's crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He also said the security cooperation between both sides are
expected to resume after a six-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
PNA had recently stepped up its efforts to fight terrorism and
taken actions against Hamas and its infrastructure, he told the
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The release will free about half of the tax revenues it had
refused to transfer to the PNA since the two suicide bombings in
Jerusalem which killed 20 Israelis and the five bombers.
</P>
<P>
The amount is expected to reach 17 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli punitive closure of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip have dealt a cut-throat blow to Palestinian economy, which
suffered losses of up to several million dollars every day.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians urged Natanyahu to lift the blockade which
barred tens of thousands of them from reaching their jobs.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the cabinet meeting also discuss the
impact of a nationwide general strike organized by the Israeli
Federation of Trade Unions (Histadrut) today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu sharply criticized Histadrut for the strike, which he
claimed could cause huge losses to the economy, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
The general strike started at 6:00 am local time and ended at
14:00 pm today, involving various sectors of the Israeli economy.
But it was continuing this afternoon in sectors which were not
crucial to the public, according to Histadrut officials.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut was angered by government-proposed new budget cuts to
the pension funds and a general restructuring of the economy. It
is feared that privatization of state-owned corporations will lead
to serious unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Histadrut requested the government to honor an existing
agreement on pension signed in 1995 by the then leaders of the
government and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government, however, refused to recognize the
agreement, which it says is not binding.
</P>
<P>
Today's cabinet meeting focused on ways to solve this problem,
but Israel Radio did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Japan, Ningxia of China to Intensify Exchanges, Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime
Minister Noboru Takeshita said here today that Japan is willing to
intensify exchanges and cooperation in various fields of economic
and social development with northwest China's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita, who is here to mark the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of diplomatic relations between China and Japan,
made the remarks during a meeting with Bai Lichen, chairman of
the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Regional government.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of 66,400 square kilometers, Ningxia is the
largest habitat of the Hui ethnic group in China. One third of the
region's 5.22 million population are Hui.
</P>
<P>
A native of Shimane Prefecture in Japan, Takeshita visited
China for many times, making great contributions to the
improvement of the Sino-Japanese relations and the friendship
between the Chinese and Japanese peoples.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to his efforts, Ningxia and Shimane established
brotherly relations in October 1993, starting various types of
friendly exchanges and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Bai told Takeshita that over the past four decades since the
founding of the autonomous region, especially since the beginning
of China's reform and opening-up drive, Ningxia has witnessed
rapid economic growth, all-round social progress and solid ethnic
unity.
</P>
<P>
To date, he said, the region has developed economic and trade
relations and technical cooperation with over 60 countries and
regions in the world, and has more than 400 foreign-funded
enterprises, many of them with Japanese investment.
</P>
<P>
However, he conceded that Ningxia still is one of China's
underdeveloped regions due to its weak economic foundation, and
that part of the region's rural population in the southern
mountainous areas remains extremely poor because of a serious
water shortage.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, the cooperation between Ningxia and Japan
has broad prospects. He hoped that Takeshita could use his high
prestige in Japan's political and financial circles to seek
benefits for the people of Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita responded that with apparent advantages in energy
reserves and agricultural sector, rich cultural heritage and the
local government's emphasis on education, Ningxia surely has a
great future.
</P>
<P>
"Over the past several years, Ningxia and Shimane have achieved
remarkable progress in multi-level exchanges and cooperation," he
said. "I'm glad to further promote the friendly relationship
between Japan and China, as well as between my hometown and
Ningxia."
</P>
<P>
He also highly praised Ningxia's investment environment, saying
that economic cooperation between Japan and Ningxia has great
potential.
</P>
<P>
"After my return to Japan, I will describe Ningxia in detail to
the Japanese business people to help further expand our
cooperation," he promised.

<HEADLINE> Residential Housing Wins Market in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Though they have lived in
inexpensive public housing for decades, more and more Chinese want
to buy their own apartments, and with the deepening of housing
reform they're getting the chance.
</P>
<P>
This mindset is especially prevalent in Shenzhen, a showcase
for China's reform and opening-up drive in south China's Guangdong
province; about 82 percent of the residents there have opted to
buy rather than rent.
</P>
<P>
Home ownership is gaining popularity across the nation. In
Nanjing, eastern Jiangsu province, almost half of the marketable
public housing had sold by June. Young Hainan island province,
also in south China, had sold 70 percent, and the Shijiazhuang
city in northern Hebei province, more than 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
China's residential housing was not for sale until a few years
ago. As a major part of the socialist welfare system, it was
allocated for residents to rent but tradable on the market.
</P>
<P>
"We used to regard living comfortably in public houses at a low
rent as one of the great advantages of socialist society," said
one recent house buyer.
</P>
<P>
In April 1980, the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping put
forward an outline for housing reform, and the state government
then decided to push the public houses on the market in a bid to
boost urban housing construction and meet the demands of growing
population.

<P>
After a series of experiments with housing reform measures and
numerous national conferences on the subject, the central
government unveiled a State Council decision calling for a new
urban housing system be set up before the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the country has to establish a public housing fund
system, deepen the reform in the renting of public houses, sell
public houses gradually, boost the real estate market and a market
for housing maintenance, and accelerate the building of urban
residential houses.
</P>
<P>
The people across China have warmly welcomed the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The first group of house buyers were granted various price
reductions, and the money saved was pooled to build new apartments
for others.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Shenzhen now are allotted an average of 14.2
square meters living space per head; the urban dwellers in Hainan
enjoy more than 15 sq. m. of floor space on average, and more than
half are living comfortably in well-furnished and equippeds
apartments.
</P>
<P>
The nation aspires to have an average per capita living space
of nine sq. m. by the year 2000, according to the Vice-Minister of
Construction Ye Rushang.
</P>
<P>
China put more than 1.1 trillion yuan into the building of 1.4
billion sq. m. of urban residential housing between 1991 and
1996. In 1990, the average living space for urban dwellers went up
to 8.47 sq. m., from the 6.77 sq. m.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector in China also provided solid support for
the marketing of the residential housing. The secured bank loans
from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, for example,
have helped numerous eager house buyers move into new apartments.

<HEADLINE> Haze Emergency in Sarawak Revoked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The state of haze
emergency, declared in East Malaysia's Sarawak on September 19,
was lifted today following significant improvement in Air
Pollutant Index (API) readings.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim in Kuching, capital of Sarawak State, according to the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama.
</P>
<P>
Anwar told a news conference there that he signed the letter
for the lifting of the haze emergency today and it took effect
immediately.
</P>
<P>
Sarawak has so far been the most badly affected state by the
haze in the country with the API in the state once touching a high
of 851.
</P>
<P>
The haze emergency, the first in Malaysia, was declared by its
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad after the Air Pollutant Index
(API) in Kuching breached the 600 mark, far beyond the 301-500
hazardous level.
</P>
<P>
But the situation improved over the past few days with API
reading dipping to 107 at 8am today, and by 11am today, further to
99 before reaching an all time low of 83 at 5pm today, which is
considered "moderate".
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that all schools and offices which were ordered
closed under the emergency would reopen as usual from tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
He, however, advised the people to continue wearing masks or
cover their nose with a wet towel to prevent from inhaling the
polluted air.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also called on the people to tune in to the radio for the
latest API readings to know the haze situation in their area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the air quality in the country as a whole showed
slight improvement in late afternoon compared to earlier in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
The API readings of 13 areas including Kuala Lumpur still fell
within the unhealthy level category.

<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 700 people,
including compatriots from the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR), Macao and Taiwan and overseas Chinese and Chinese
nationals residing overseas joined a grand reception here this
evening to mark the founding anniversary of the People's Republic
of China.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC)'s Central Committee and also
chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), attended the reception,
which was held in the Great Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the group, Ye Xuanping, vice-chairman of the
CPPCC National Committee, first extended sincere greetings to all
the guests, people of various ethnic groups and circles across
China, Taiwan, Hong Kong SAR and Macao compatriots and other
overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Ye said that over the past 48 years, tremendous changes have
taken place in China, and that the country's reform, opening-up
and modernization drive, under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping
Theory, has scored remarkable achievements that have drawn
worldwide attention since the Third Plenum of the 11th CPC Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He described the 15th National Congress of the CPC, which was
convened here from September 12-18, as an epoch-making event that
summarized the past experience and ushered in a promising future.
</P>
<P>

He noted that on July 1 this year, the Chinese government
resumed its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with the formal
establishment of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he said, the Hong Kong SAR government has been
smoothly exercising various powers granted by the HKSAR Basic Law,
and Hong Kong continues to enjoy social stability and economic
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
"The great concept of 'one country, two systems' initiated by
Deng Xiaoping has become a reality in Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that thanks to the friendly cooperation between the
Chinese and Portuguese sides, various preparations for the return
of Macao to China in the year 1999 are also progressing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully confident in Macao's smooth return and its
long-term stability and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and
that reunification of the motherland represents the fundamental
interests of the Chinese nation, as well as the irreversible
historical tides.
</P>
<P>
"All Chinese across the world hope that relations across the
Taiwan Straits could develop healthily under the 'one China'
principle, and all of us are against separatism, 'Taiwan
independence', 'two Chinas', 'one China, one Taiwan' and any
foreign interference in the Taiwan issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the Taiwan authorities would
respond to the solemn call for China's peaceful reunification set
forth recently by Chinese President Jiang Zemin in his report to
the 15th CPC National Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We have faith in the Taiwan compatriots, who have a glorious
tradition of patriotism," said Ye. "And we will continue to adhere
to the basic principle of peaceful reunification and 'one country,
two systems' in promoting relations across the Straits."
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The signing of a package of
Russian-U.S. disarmament accords is the most important step in the
course of arms control, said Russian Foreign Ministry today.
</P>
<P>
An announcement, made by the Press Bureau of the Foreign
Ministry, said the accords are in the interests of Russia's
security and in conformity with Russia's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The accords highlighted the two countries' willingness to go
along with further reductions in strategic nuclear weapons and
created favorable conditions for Russia to implement START II,
reported the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright signed the accords
with her Russian counterpart Yevgeni Primakov in New York when
attending the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The accords include an adaptation of the 1972 anti-ballistic
missile (ABM) treaty that limits the capability of both countries'
anti-missile weapons. They also include an accord that postpones
to December 31, 2007 the date at which the START II treaty has to
be put into effect, instead of December 31, 2003.
</P>
<P>
START II, signed in January 1993 by Russia and the United
States, already has been ratified by the U.S. Senate but not by
the Russian Duma because it fears that Washington would break the
ABM pact by deploying multiple anti-missile defensive systems.

<HEADLINE> ASEM Calls for Closer Ties Between Asia, Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers from Asian
and European countries concluded today their first meeting in
Chiba, near Tokyo, and called for closer ties between the two
continents for sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
To expand trade and investment flows between the two regions,
the ministers from 25 Asian and European countries set principles
and common policy tasks at the two-day session of the Asian-Europe
Meeting (ASEM).
</P>
<P>
In a chairman's statement issued after the meeting, the
ministers said ASEM economic cooperation will "reinforce the
underlying sound economic structures" and "contribute to the
robustness of the ASEM economies."
</P>
<P>
"In this context, ministers expressed the view that transient
economic difficulties, export slowdown and exchange rate
fluctuations observed in some ASEM partners would not harm the
significant long-term potential of these economies," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers "affirmed their confidence in the strong future
prospects of these economies" in an era of globalization, taking
into account positive factors such as abundant investment
opportunities and high savings rates, it added.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also stressed in the statement to cooperate in
guaranteeing energy safety, protecting environment and
accomplishing sustainable economic growth, which, they said, are
the common tasks.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the first since ASEM was launched last
year, the economic ministers agreed on five principles for

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping Theory And Shanghai University Students (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- While many older Chinese
find it hard to see eye to eye with today's modern-minded youth,
Deng Xiaoping, who saw it all in China in his 93 years, now seems
to have a lot in common with young people.
</P>
<P>
This is particularly true for the 140,000 university students
in Shanghai, a major stop during Deng's tour of southern China in
1992, when he gave famous and important remarks on the country's
need to deepen reform and open up further to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is the first Chinese city in which universities have
offered a special course on Deng Xiaoping Theory. Since 1994, 34
of the municipality's 40 universities have included the class in
their curricula, and many students have organized their own small
study groups to discuss the late paramount leaders ideology.
</P>
<P>
When the course opened in East China Engineering University,
1,800 students signed up in the first semester, setting a school
record for the number of students taking a selective courses.
</P>
<P>
When the third volume of the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping
was published in Shanghai, the book soon became a bestseller on
Shanghai campuses.
</P>
<P>
Han Junyi, a fifth-grade student from Shanghai Medical Sciences
University who has read over 20 books about Deng's theory and his
life, said, "Deng's theory has brought earth-shattering changes to
China. We university students are deeply interested not only in
the theory but also by the great man's characteristics and his
legendary life experiences."
</P>
<P>
Four thousand and five hundred students in Shanghai Normal
University, making up over 94 percent of the school's total
student body, turned in essays when the school authority announced
papers on the study of Deng Xiaoping theory were being accepted.
</P>
<P>
Yang Longbo, a senior from Shanghai Normal University, said,
"It is a wonderful thing that Deng Xiaoping Theory was included in
the Party constitution during the 15th National Congress of the
Communist Party of China."
</P>
<P>
Yang has spent three years studying Deng's books, and has
written quite a few theses on the basis of her understanding of
the them.
</P>
<P>
Yang, a native of a once poor village in Chongming County on
the outskirts of Shanghai, is deeply impressed by Deng's idea that
"Poverty is not socialism."
</P>
<P>
"Poverty had forced many people in my hometown to beg for a
living," she said, "but since China's reform and opening-up in the
late 1970s, beggars are nowhere to be found, and now all families
have built their own houses and installed telephones and hot water
heater and use liquefier."
</P>
<P>
"All these changes would have been impossible if it weren't for
Deng Xiaoping Theory," Yang noted.

"Deng Xiaoping and his theory have created opportunities for
these university students to realize their ambitions, which their
parents and grandparents had no way to get when they were young,"
said Cheng Weili, deputy director of the Deng Xiaoping Theory
Research Center of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, when
explaining why contemporary university students are so interested
in Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
He added that the young people also get to know the major trend
of the country's development in the 21st century by studying Deng
Xiaoping Theory, which provides answers to their various questions.
</P>
<P>
Some experts deem that college kids' interest in Deng Xiaoping
Theory is greatly due to the fact that it has stood the test of
time during China's development process.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the State Education Commission shows that 92
percent of the college and university students in Shanghai agree
that the central government's policies of further carrying out
reforms and opening still widerly to the outside world have
produced remarkable achievements.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that 95 percent of the students have read
the Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping, and 97 percent share the view
that Deng Theory can guide China's reform and opening-up as well
as the country's modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Urges Netanyahu to Advance Peace March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
today urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to do his utmost to
propel the Middle East peace process that has been stuck for over
six months.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made the appeal in Egypt's seaport city of Alexandria
at a joint press conference with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak. The two leaders had emerged from talks on ways to revive
the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Weizman arrived in Alexandria this morning on a brief visit to
Egypt, just a few days after Netanyahu posted plans to construct
300 new housing units in the West Bank town of Efrat, a move that
added fuel to Palestinian outrage and drew opposition even from
the United States government.
</P>
<P>
Weizman told reporters that he discussed with Mubarak on the
imperativeness that Netanyahu begin to work for progress of the
peace march. He said his aim of directing this call to Netanyahu
is to serve the regional peace drive.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that Egypt will play a positive and
continuous role in peace making in the region.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Egypt is ready to mediate between Syria and the
Jewish state for a resumption of talks that froze in February 1996
and urged Israel to take "concrete steps" so that Syria could act
correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that Israel return the Golan Heights it captured
in 1967 in exchange for peace as promised by Israel's former Labor
government.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Mubarak praised Weizman as an
"advocate of peace".
</P>
<P>
He said today's meeting centered on the Mideast peace process
and on finding ways to restart the disrupted talks, adding they
have touched up all the issues of concern to the two countries and
the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian and Israeli peace teams are holding talks in
Washington in what may be their last chance to save the crumbling
peace process. Weizman himself will go to the U.S. capital for
talks with President Bill Clinton before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace process came to a standstill in March after
Israel decided to go ahead with Jewish settlement expansion in
East Jerusalem. It slid into deeper crisis after two suicide
bombings ripped off Jerusalem markets in July and September ,
killing 25 people including the five bombers.
</P>
<P>
The Netanyahu government took suffocating punitive measures
against Palestinians and insisted that primary concern be given to
Israel's security. It announced to stop giving back lands to
Palestinians as stipulated by their accords as long as they fell
short of its demand to crack down on terrorist infrastructure.

ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Fighting between the Afghan
Islamic Taliban militia and their rival northern alliance were
continuing to rage today around Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 km
north of the Afghan capital of Kabul, Pakistan Television (PTV)
reported.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters have consolidated their positions around
Mazar-e-Sharif, the seat of the anti-Taliban northern alliance,
following fresh attack, PTV quoted a Taliban spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chief of the Taliban Supreme Council Mohammad Omar
today urged the opposition forces defending Mazar-e-Sharif to lay
down their arms, PTV said.
</P>
<P>
If the anti-Taliban elements in Mazar-e-Sharif surrender, they
would be given general amnesty, Omar announced today in Kandahar,
Taliban's stronghold in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Omar also asked the neighboring countries not to provide asylum
and not to give transport facilities to the leaders of the
northern alliance comprising forces loyal to Uzbek warlords Rashid
Dostum and Abdul Malik, and Afghanistan's former military chief
Ahmad Masood and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban have claimed they had made major gains around
Mazar-e-Sharif and their fighters have seized areas within 15 km
of the Afghanistan's second largest city. However, the claim has
not been independently confirmed so far.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three weeks, Mazar-e-Sharif has been under
Taliban attack.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control two-thirds of the Afghan territory
and the capital of Kabul, briefly controlled Mazar-e-Sharif
airport early this month but were forced to retreat in a few days.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance, who announced Mazar-e-Sharif as
their capital, has been battling the hard-line militia in
northern, central and western Afghanistan since the Taliban seized
Kabul last September.

CHANGCHUN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Party official
said here recently that China would continue to attach top
priority to agriculture, the foundation and guarantee for
realizing the country's strategic goal for economic restructuring
and development.
</P>
<P>

areas of northeast China's Jilin Province. He concluded his tour

opening-up drive and national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"To achieve the strategic goal set by the 15th CPC National
Congress for our country's economic restructuring and growth still
needs the strong support from the agricultural sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to list a series of measures to promote agricultural
development, which include maintaining the consistency of the
Party's basic policies in rural areas, further deepening rural
reforms, improving agricultural infrastructure, and invigorating
the agricultural sector by popularizing scientific and technical
achievements.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of promoting socialist ethical and
cultural progress in the vast rural areas, adding that grassroots
Party organizations and the system of democratic election and
management in the countryside should be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Wen also visited farmers in western Jilin afflicted
by serious drought earlier this year, urging local officials to
take good care of those farmers' life.
</P>
<P>
One of China's major grain producers, Jilin now provides some
one tenth of the country's total grain output. Last year the
province scored a record grain harvest.

<HEADLINE> Inter-Regional Meeting on Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISFAHAN, IRAN, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 anti-drug
policemen from 36 countries gathered here today to coordinate
action to stop the flow of narcotics from Afghanistan and
Pakistan through Iran to Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Raymond Kendall, Secretary General of International Criminal
Police Organization (Interpol), said at the opening session of
the three-day Inter-Regional Meeting on Illicit Drug Traffic in
the Near and Middle East and Central Asia that the drug problem
was hurting Western Asia.
</P>
<P>
The regional meeting is attended by police officers, drug
specialists, generals and inspectors from Amenia, Azerbaijan,
China, France, Iran, Italy, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait,
Pakistan, Russia, Turkey and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Today the region of the Near and Middle East and Central
Asia is seriously affected by drug abuse and trafficking,"
Kendall said, noting that the quantities of narcotic drugs being
produced in the region are greater than in any other region
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Kendall said that "what makes the situation even more
alarming is the emergence of a large drug addict population in
the Near and Middle East."
</P>
<P>
"It is estimated that there are currently over 3 million
individuals who abuse heroin and opium on a regular basis," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the drug traffickers play with the lives of
innocent people, destroy national economies, corrupt
administrations and weaken political institutions in order to
satisfy their voracious lust for money.
</P>
<P>
"They deserve no mercy and should be subjected to a vigorous,
continuous and relentless pursuit," he vowed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In his written message to the meeting, Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami pointed to Afghanistan as the source of
drug problem in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is indeed a source of pity that at present a major part
of global poppy cultivation and opium production is taking place
in Afghanistan," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The brunt of the complex problem of addiction and drug
trafficking in the region and the world springs from narcotics
cultivation and production in the country," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president pledged that Iran will sustain its
decisive and strict policy against drug trafficking in future
and is ready to exchange experiences with other countries and
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that Iran has been used by drug
trafficking rings as the shortest route for transit of narcotics
from Afghanistan and Pakistan to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that 85 tonnes of narcotics were seized in the
country from March 21 to September 21 this year. In a 12-month
period beginning from March 21, 1996, Iranian authorities seized
191 tonnes of narcotics.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: UDM, Black Horse in S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- While major political
parties started their active preparations for the 1999 general
elections, United Democratic Movement (UDM), a newly set up
party, is also throwing its weight on the political competition
in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The UDM, launched Saturday in Johannesburg, has apparently
drawn great attention from the people in the country, as it is
the first political party co-chaired by black and white people
since the first non-racial elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
There are two top leaders in the party. One is Bantu Holomisa,
popular leader who fell out of favor with the ruling African
National Congress (ANC), and the other is Roelf Meyer, who quit
the white-dominated National Party earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at the launch of the new party, Meyer
said the UDM would be "the political home of all South Africans",
saying, "We no longer want to vote for political parties that
have taken root in a soil of racial division." He stressed the
need to foster a strong multi-party democracy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
To promote national unity and to realize the real multi-party
democracy are the most resonant and attractive slogans put
forward by the UDM.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, once known for its notorious policy of racial
segregation, abolished apartheid laws right after the 1994
general elections, and set up an ANC-led Government of National
Unity which included the National Party.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Party headed by Deputy President F.W. de
Klerk, pulled out of the central government in June last year due
to its sharp political differences with the ANC coalition, which
also included the South African Communist Party and the Congress
of South African Trade Union.
</P>
<P>
Opposition claimed that ever since the National Party's
withdrawal from the government, the ANC, which is the largest
black party in South Africa, has in reality become the sole
dominator in the country. A new kind of racial discrimination is
being practised by ANC, the extremists charged.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed that the UDM is trying to give a signal
that it is promoting a truly multi-party democracy, thus creating
an image that would be accepted both by the black, the white and
the colored people in the country.
</P>
<P>
Another remarkable characteristic of the UDM is that it pays
special attention to various national thorny issues like social
security, crime and employment.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa said South Africa "is in a state of disarray, not as
a result of the past government's policies, but the inability of
the present government to direct resources to appropriate social
programs and get its priorities right."
</P>
<P>
Meyer pledged his party's support for the war against crime
and corruption, saying South Africa needs to become
"criminal-hostile to the greatest possible extent".
</P>
<P>
Referring to his aspiration, Meyer said the UDM would devoted
itself "to making South Africa a world-class nation in 10 years
time".
</P>
<P>
A survey suggests there is a floating vote of 25 percent who
might support a party like the UDM. Part of the reason for this
is that the party starts with a clean slate. It is not mired in
deeds and attitudes of the past.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts said although the UDM is by now a minority party
in South Africa, it is very much likely to be hard challenger
among the ruling ANC and opposition parties because it strongly
advocates more jobs, less crime and a better life for all.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Bloc Launches Boycott Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli peace organization
Gush Shalom (Israeli Peace Bloc) today announced to lauch a
boycott campaign against products of Jewish settlements in the
occupied territories in an effort to save the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Gush Shalom leader Uri
Avnery said that the boycott campaign is "the means of defense
of the people of Israel against the settlement, and most of all
against the intent of a small minority in Israel to impose its
will on the great majority."
</P>
<P>
"If you believe that settlement building is a danger to
Israel and a step toward the war, the way to avert it is very
simple: put back settlement products on the shelf," Avnery said.
</P>
<P>
Avnery said that his organization is launching a propaganda
campaign to teach people how to identify settlement products,
and how to contact with Gush Shalom for a list of these products
by phone or by E-mail.
</P>
<P>
Oren Medicks, head of the Gush Shalom committee in charge of
the boycott campaign, announced a series of measures to be taken
in the next few months to get the capmaign to full proportion.
</P>
<P>
He said that Gush Shalom would publish more advertisements in
local newspapers, issuing stickers to customers in supermarkets
and advising customers to avoid buying settlement products.
</P>
<P>
More important is, Medicks told Xinhua, that Gush Shalom had
begun negotiations with diplomats from the European Community
(EU) in an attempt to persuade these countries to stop importing
settlement products from Israel, because European market is the
leading export market for these products.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that the boycott campaign faced great
difficulties in making it a big success, mainly because some of
the agricultural products, including flowers, exported under the
marks of "Made in Israel" without listing the origins of
production.
</P>
<P>
Israel's settlement activities are the outstanding barrier in
the path to push forward the Israeli-Palestinian peace process,
which has been stalled since March when Israel began building
the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.

KIEV, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian former Justice
Minister Sergei Golovaty has vowed to root out corruption during
his 1999 presidential campaign, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper quoted Golovaty as saying that he would challenge

Golovaty, who was dismissed a month ago, proposed a nationwide

minister. But the campaign reportedly failed to convict any
corrupt official or improve public morality.

Golovaty accused the government of being neither willing nor

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng met recently
with Chinese master artists and craftsmen and asked them to
inherit, carry forward and improve on the fine traditional styles
and techniques.
</P>
<P>
Li said that they should "weed through the old and bring out
the new" to develop products with characteristics in accordance
with the times.
</P>
<P>
The Light Industry Association today bestowed the title of
Chinese Master of Arts and Crafts on 108 people well-accomplished
in their fields.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that arts and crafts are an important
component of the fine Chinese culture as well as a treasure of the
the world civilization.
</P>
<P>
"Since the founding of New China in 1949, especially since the
reform and opening in 1970's, the arts and crafts industry has
contributed actively to international exchanges, inheriting and
carrying forth the fine traditional culture of the nation," he
said. The industry also has been strongly pushing the the course
of building socialist material civilization as well as socialist
ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
In line with the improved living standard of the people and the
growth of tourism, Li said the arts and crafts market will become
increasingly bigger and bigger, and that people should improve the
products' quality by relying on the advanced technical-how and
develop products that suit the customers' tastes.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged that a state decree concerning the protection
of the industry be followed and that a workforce be trained to
make even greater contributions to the sector.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Industry Bleeds at False Health Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
insurance companies stand to lose millions of Rand annually as
HIV carriers and AIDS sufferers are being given clean bills of
health when applying for life cover, Sunday Tribune said today.
</P>
<P>
Medical personnel, including specialists -- particularly in
KwaZulu-Natal -- allegedly switched blood samples so that tests
on HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) positive patients were
reported to be negative, thus enabling the patients to make
successful applications for life assurance, the paper quoted
medical sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Some doctors have allegedly changed the cause of death from
HIV to other complications not associated with the fatal virus.
</P>
<P>
Other important papers such as medical examination forms have
been allegedly falsified and doctors have been known to turn a
blind eye to them, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"Assurance companies often see piles of forms in which
patients have the same height and weight registered," said Pieter
Coetzer, committee member of the Life Officers Association
representing life assurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Spokesmen for insurance industry giants like Old Mutual and
Sanlam Life have expressed grave concern at what is threatening
to become a huge and financially disastrous scam for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
"It's of great concern to us because when fraudulent claims
are made, other policy holders are adversely affected," Sanlam
Life spokesman Nico Van Gijsen said.
</P>
<P>
AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) was spreading
quickly in South Africa. According to statistics last year, about
1.5 million people were infected with the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that 5 million people would be infected with
HIV which causes AIDS by the year 2000.
South Africa has a population of some 41 million.

ADDIS ABABA, Septemebr 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's three rift
valley lakes, Ziway, Abiyata and Langano, are becoming a meter
shallower annually due to siltation resulting from sever erosion

</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency reported today quoted local

Uncontrolled felling of the acasia trees in the surrounding

The three lakes have a combined depth of 51 meters.

Local officials said the preservation of the lakes is not a

and Commerce, said in his opening speech that the forum is a new
tool to boost the bilateral relations and economic cooperation
between China and Nepal.
</P>
<P>
It not only gives play to the non-governmental forces in
developing relations between countries, but also shows China's and
Nepal's confidence in increasing cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jian, assistant foreign-minister of China, and Yubaraj
Singh Pradhan, Nepalese Ambassador to China, also delivered
speeches on behalf of their respective governments.
</P>
<P>
The forum was sponsored by the Chinese and Nepalese governments
and organized by the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce
and the Nepalese Federation of Industry and Commerce. The first
forum was held in Kathmandu, the Nepalese capital, in October
1996.

WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Republican leaders have begun a push for a radical revision
of the tax code, but the party has yet to reach a consensus about
what kind of changes it wants to see. The shift in focus comes as
pollsters report that voters are becoming cynical about promises
of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- According to President Clinton's playbook, this fall was
supposed to be a season of bipartisan achievement on the issue of
free trade: Republican congressional leaders would deliver their
members, Clinton would deliver moderate Democrats, and together
they would have the votes to overcome the opposition of organized
labor and pass a "fast-track" trade bill.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Forces Return From Congo: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Most of the Rwandan troops
have withdrawn from the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo
where it helped to topple former Zairian President Mobutu Sese
Seko, Rwandan President Pasteur Bizimungu said today.
</P>
<P>
A report from Rwandan capital Kigali quoted Bizimungu as
saying that only a few defense experts from Rwanda have remained
behind to train the army of Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We have pulled the bulk of our forces back home. While in
Congo, we technically assisted the Congolese to liberate
themselves," Bizimungu told Reuters in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
"Only a few of our military people remain in Congo as
advisors, very few of them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports disclosed that more than 1,000 Rwandan troops
involved in Kabila's seven-month military drive to topple
Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda was the backbone of an international and regional
alliance against Mobutu, who died in Rabat early this month.
</P>
<P>
Regional military sources said that Uganda and Angola, among
others, also actively took part in the war against Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
They claimed that other countries such as South Africa and the
United States provided Kabila with diplomatic and political
muscle.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's rebellion, began in October last year and ended on
May 17 when his forces took Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Vice-President and Defense Minister Major-General Paul
Kagame admitted in July that Rwandana soldiers joined Kabila's
uprising directly against Mobutu, but other Rwandan and Congolese
officials remain reticent about the military ties between the two
states.
</P>
<P>
Kagame had said Rwanda provided training and arms for the
rebel forces in the then Zaire even before the push to overthrow
Mobutu began in October.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu said his army is now engaged in operations to
stamp out pockets of insecurity in some parts of his country,
caused by Hutu refugees returning from Congo, or ex Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Over a million Rwandan Hutus streamed into the former
Zaire in 1994, fearing reprisals for the genocide of minority
Tutsis by militant Hutus.
</P>
<P>
About 600,000 Hutus returned to Rwanda late last year after
their camps were shelled allegedly by Rwandan forces, while the
U.N. says others are unaccounted for, presumed dead or still
wondering across Congo's vast jungle.
</P>
<P>
Bizimungu claimed that some of the refugees are involved in
organized acts of violence against the army and Tutsi civilians.
But Bizimungu, himself a Hutu, said the insurgency has been
contained by his army.
</P>
<P>
"The insecurity is localized in the northwest. The rest of
the country is secure and completely safe," Bizimungu said.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Build Most Secure Prison in World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to
build one of the most secure prisons in the world in
KwaZulu-Natal in the next 18 months, the Sunday Tribune newspaper
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Super Maximum Prison (SPM), to be built in Kokstad in the
eastern province, will match the highest security prison in the
United States at Boulder, Colorado, and then go a step or two
further, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The SPM is expected to cost 250 million Rand (53 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Goltz Wessmann, special adviser to Minister of Correctional
Services Sipo Mzimela, said the Kokstad prison will be one of the
most secure institutions in the world.
</P>
<P>
"It will be a very secure facility. That is why it will cost
about 250 million Rand. But over a 10-year period it could prove
to be the cheapest prison if there are no escapes. Escapes are
very costly," he said.
</P>
<P>
Escapes are frequent in South African jails. In the 15 months
as of March this year, more than 4,240 prisoners slipped from
their cells.
</P>
<P>
Escapes were blamed on corruption of warders and activities of
drug syndicates.
</P>
<P>
In order to address the problem, Mzimela officially opened
South Africa's first closed maximum security prison (CMAX) in
Pretoria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Inmates in the CMAX, which houses criminals with violent
records, escapees and those who killed fellow inmates or police
staff, will be locked in their cells for 23 hours a day and will
always be cuffed outside their cells.
</P>
<P>
The CMAX is regarded as a guinea pig for the planned Kokstad
prison.
</P>
<P>
The SPM will be built in a cross, block or butterfly shape
surrounded by a section of no-man's land and two or three wire
fences with the first one being electrified to set off alarms and
video surveillance.
</P>
<P>
The prison security system will be driven by computers and
special treatment sections will be run by a warden in an enclosed
cubicle with a view of the yards and ablution centers. There will
also be an enclosed central command center that can override
everything else, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners in a SPM will spend 23 hours a day alone and then
one hour in cages in open yards where they can talk to other
inmates.
</P>
<P>
Convicts taken to the special sections of the SPMs will be
alone for 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
Wessmann said over the next few years every province would
have either a CMAX section of a complete super maximum security
prison.
</P>
<P>
"Since the CMAX opened in Pretoria, incidents in prisons
around the country have already dropped considerably," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, there were also criticisms of the CMAX, saying that
it is "inhuman."

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Receive 7 Groups of Iranian Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has agreed to receive
seven groups of overseas Iranians despite Iran's doubt over
Baghdad's intention of doing so.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi newspaper Al-Thawara today quoted Mowaffaq El-Nasseri,
board chairman of the Huda Company for Religious Tourism as saying
the applications of these Iranians to visit Muslim holy sites in
Iraq have been approved.
</P>
<P>
The groups of Iranian visitors reside in the Gulf region and
the U.S., El-Nasseri said, but he failed to mention the number of
the Iranian visitors and the dates of their arrival.
</P>
<P>
He said that his company keeps in contact with many travel and
tourist agencies in the United Arab Emirates, India, Thailand,
Tanzania, Jordan and some southeast Asian countries with the aim
of making arrangements for Iranians residing in those countries to
come to visit Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran fought an eight-year war from 1980-88 and are
still at odds with each other.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has recently decided to allow Iranian
expatriates to visit Shiite Muslim holy shrines in Iraq as a
gesture for mending ties with Iran.
</P>
<P>
But Iran dismissed the offer, saying it was ambiguous and aimed
at diverting attention from unresolved issues between the two
countries, such as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
Shiites and Sunnis are the two major factions of Islam. Iran is
the only Shiite-dominated country in the region but the most
important Shiite shrines are in Iraq.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Garrison of the
People's Liberation Army (PLA) stationed in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will open its barracks to the public
on October 1, the National Day.
</P>
<P>
Groups will be allowed to tour camps at Stanley and
Stonecutters Island and visit gunboats, according to a statement
issued by the garrison.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time since Hong Kong's return to the
motherland on July 1 that local residents have been allowed
inside the garrison's military bases and also marks the first
National Day celebrations by PLA forces in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The garrison troops will stage cultural shows, basketball
matches and other activities on their open day.
</P>
<P>
The two camps will be open between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in two
sessions to receive up to 40 groups and organizations each
including up to 50 people, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the open day is aimed at improving
communications and understanding between the garrison troops and
the general public.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a morning and an afternoon session and we shall
receive 20 groups at most in each session," a spokesman for the
garrison told reporters this morning.
</P>
<P>
"We think that it is good enough as the forces have only been
stationed here for three months and there might not be too many
things to see," he added.

CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
said today that a U.S.-brokered Palestinian-Israeli talks in
Washington might be the last chance to revive the stumbling peace
drive, Egypt's Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with MENA, Fasail Husseini, minister in charge
of Jerusalem Affairs at the Palestinian National Authority (PNA),
expressed hope that U.S. proposals presented in the past few days
would help revive Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, the hope for a breakthrough at the suggested
Palestinian-Israeli talks is widely considered as almost
impossible in view of the severe situation for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Adding to the tension brought about by the peace stalemate
since last March, Israel has announced plans to construct 300 new
housing units in the West Bank town of Efrat, and its troops have
trained for a possible all-out war with Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Israel's plans to expand its settlements at this particular
time could be attributed to its desire to blow up the U.S. efforts
aiming at salvaging the deadlocked peacemaking," he said.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who strongly advocated the Washington talks during
her maiden trip to the region early this month, on Friday
criticized the Israeli plan as "an unnecessary kind of a step when
what we are trying to do is to create the best climate" for peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have held separate talks with Palestinian and
Israeli peace teams ahead of the key meeting between Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy and Palestinian negotiator Mahmoud
Abbas in New York tomorrow that will be hosted by Albright.

<HEADLINE> Qatari Economy Reeling Under Heavy Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Qatari economy is reeling
under a burden of nearly 6 billion U.S. dollars of debt, one of
the heaviest in the world, local newspaper Khaleej Times reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The debt built up to finance projects aimed at transforming
Qatar into the world's biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG)
producer accounts for 79 percent of the country's gross domestic
product (GDP), the paper quoted an official report of the Arab
League-affiliated Inter-Arab Investment Guarantee Corporation as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's debt servicing accounts for 20 percent of the GDP and
45 percent of exports, one of the highest in the world, according
to the report of the economies of the Arab League's 22 members.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf state, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), owes 5.7 billion dollars to
international banks and other creditors and the debt is set to
increase as more funds are borrowed for LNG ventures, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
"The debt is expected to rise in the coming years because of
the ambitious investment plans and their financing needs,
especially concerning projects to develop the North Field," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the subsequent increase in debt servicing, the
situation will begin to improve at the start of the next century
when those projects begin yielding high investment returns," the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Qatar's North Field is by far the largest known gas basin in
the world, containing nearly 10 trillion cubic meters of
non-associated gas, accounting for around 7 percent of the global
gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the investment to develop the field could
reach 15 billion dollars and the production could hit 30 million
tonnes in 2005.

<HEADLINE> Labor Immigrants Plaguing Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The decline in war refugees
in southern Africa due to reduced military conflicts has shifted
focus on the plight of immigrants being accused of destabilizing
and straining the region's economies, Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Known as "economic refugees", migrants have become the latest
thorn in the flesh for a region striving to recover from decades
of liberation and civil wars that shattered its economies, the
Zimbabwe weekly says.
</P>
<P>
Immigrants, despite their contributions to host countries'
economies, are viewed with hostility.
</P>
<P>
Though they are found in every country, South Africa has
become the most attractive haven and it has crudely intensified
its crackdown to flush them out, only for them to return through
the back door.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that between 2.5 million and 4.1 million
illegal immigrants live in South Africa, the bulk of them from
Mozambique, Lesotho and Zimbabwe. Malawi, Zambia, Botswana and
Swaziland also contribute significant numbers.
</P>
<P>
South Africa accuses the immigrants of distorting economic
performance, threatening its border security, drug and arms
smuggling and all sorts of crimes.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported the migrants were recently a focus of
discussion during the 10th anniversary colloquium of the southern
Africa political economic series which concluded that labor
migration is a permanent phenomenon that cannot be swished away
unless economic disparities within the region are corrected.
</P>
<P>
South African Labor Minister Tito Mboweni held the migrant
inflow would continue as long as his country's income levels were
better than in the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
He called on other countries to increase real earnings to
retain skills and maintain production levels that create
employment.
</P>
<P>
"If this is done, countries will stop resenting labor migration
and so efficient allocation of labor must be promoted," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Urges Investors to Stay in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has appealed to foreign investors not to leave his
country because the economy is on the way to recovery.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to government officials Saturday at Freedom Park in
Kitwe, 300 kilometers north of the capital, Chiluba said while
foreign investors work under difficult circumstances, they should
continue to stay, Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is an ideal investment location and foreign investors
can make good returns for their money, said the president.
</P>
<P>
These remarks are made undoubtedly to counter several big
investors's claimed withdrawal from Zambia following last month's
closure of Dunlop Tyres Company Limited, the only foreign funded
tyre manufacturing company in the country.
</P>
<P>
Dunlop's closure was attributed to the importation of heavily
subsidized tyres imported from South Africa and the government's
failure to protect the country's fragile manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Chiluba has accused some trade partners in
the region intend to turn Zambia into a "dumping ground" through
"unfair competition".
</P>
<P>
During Saturday's speech, Chiluba stressed that although there
have been difficult circumstances, Zambia is both a member of the
Southern African Development Community and the Common Markets for
Eastern and Southern African and it is the one of the two
countries in the region which has no exchange controls, according
to the paper.
</P>
<P>
However, he cautioned those who wish to invest in the country
to have long-term plans instead of just making money and going
back to their home countries.

<HEADLINE> UAE Oil Reserves Put at 100 Billion Barrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The proven oil reserves for
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) now stand at around 100 billion
barrels, tripling those in the 1970s, according to the country's
oil minister.
</P>
<P>
Obeid bin Saif al Nasir was quoted in the latest issue of the
Emirates Today monthly as saying that the natural gas reserves are
at 6 trillion cubic meters, nearly ten times of those in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
These developments, which made the UAE one of the world's
leading oil-rich countries, were due to continuous efforts in
developing the resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his country, a member of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), will continue to adhere to
its Opec-assigned quota and "not to ask for an increase until Opec
increased its ceiling."
</P>
<P>
The UAE's quota is 2.161 million barrels per day. And the oil
industry takes up about 35 percent share in the financial income
for the country.

<HEADLINE> Israel Trade Unions Holds Nationwide General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua)-- The Israeli Federation of
Trade Unions (Histadrut) today organized a nationwide general
strike against the government's economic and pension policies.
</P>
<P>
The strike, began at 6:00 am (local time), will last till
14:00 pm as ordered by the Israeli National Labor Court, which
tried its best Saturday night, but failed to help the government
and Histadrut make compromise over their disputes.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut said that a total of about half a million of
workers and staff from both public and private sectors
participate in the general strike, the largest in Israel's
history.
</P>
<P>
The strike paralyzed all government offices, including the
national insurance institutes, the employment service, local
authorities, public schools, banks and postal offices as well as
railway and bus lines.
</P>
<P>
The national health services, such as hospitals and clinics,
only operate on emergency cases.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut is angry with new government budget cuts to
pension funds and a general restructuring of Israel's economy,
which involves privatization of state-owned corporations.
</P>
<P>
It requested the government to honor the existing agreement
signed in 1995 by the then leaders of the government and trade
unions, but the current government refused to recognize the
agreement, saying that it is nonbinding.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry and the Histadrut could not reach a
compromise Saturday night over this issue even with the help of
the Labor Court. The Histadrut then ordered today's strike.
</P>
<P>
The plans of today's strike also brought chaos Saturday night
to Ben-Gurion Airport. El Al, the Israeli Airlines, had to
rechedule 25 flights to transport about 3,500 passengers out
from the airport. The airport staff also joined today's strike,
and the airport closed down to air traffic.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that representatives of both the government
and Histadrut would meet again this afternoon or evening to
negotiate over the pension issue. The Histadrut said that the
strike will continue if the government does not give in.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Iran's Missile Program Threatens Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has said that Iran is nearly completing its
development of long-range missiles that will threaten both Israeli
and U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published by the Jerusalem Post daily today,
Mordechai said "Iran is on the verge of achieving the capability
of producing long-range missiles that have strategic dangers to
Israel, as well as to U.S. interests in the region."
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States believe, on the basis of latest
intelligence information, that Iran's medium-ranged ballistic
missile and nuclear weapons programs have progressed faster than
expected, Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
The most impressive progress was made in Iran's missile
development program with the aid of Russia, he added.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister claimed that at the current pace of
development, Tehran would have missiles that can reach Israel,
Gulf states, Asia and parts of Europe by 1999. He believed that
Iran also wants to increase its chemical weapons and produce
biological and nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted western intelligence officials as saying
that Iran has embarked on three missile programs. One has a range
of 1,500 kilomaters, which covers Israel, Gulf states and Asia;
another has a range of 3,000 kilometers, which can hit much of
Western Europe; and the third has a range of 5,500 kilometers that
is to be largely aimed at striking the U.S. targets in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said that the U.S. intelligence officials have a
more alarming assessment than their Israeli colleagues of how
close Iran is to achieving its goal. He added that the new
intelligence showed that Russia had violated months of pledges
to stop aid to Iran's missile and non-conventional weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel and the U.S. disagreed over how to pressure
Russia to immediately stop assisting Iran's missile programs. The
U.S. government wants to concentrate on quiet diplomatic efforts,
while Israel is lobbying the U.S. Congress to cut off U.S. aid to
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that the U.S. government has so far
refused to use the cutoff of U.S. economic aid to Russia as a
lever to stop Russian aid to Iran's missile programs. Russia
received 95 million dollars in aid from the U.S. in 1997, and the
U.S. government is asking the Congress for 225 million dollars
for Russia in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Russia has strongly denied that it is helping
Iran develop ballistic missile programs, saying its nuclear aid to
Iran is limited to developing a civilian nuclear reactor.

<HEADLINE> Officials Bribed for Illegal Immigration into S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Officials in South
Africa's Home Affairs Ministry were paid 710,000 U.S. Dollars in
bribes to grant 54 Taiwanese families permanent residence, a
local weekly City Press revealed today.
</P>
<P>
According to the weekly's investigation report, the ministry
has confirmed that the families, consisting of 272 people, were
granted permanent residence after arriving in South Africa in
1995 on tourist visas.
</P>
<P>
The aliens control act prohibits foreigners who arrive in
South Africa as tourists from working in the country.
</P>
<P>
This means the corrupt officials were paid almost 14,200
dollars per family, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It is not yet known if this is just the tip of the iceberg, as
more than 10,000 people have been granted permanent residence by
the ministry during the past two years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's spokesman, Hennie Meyer, told the weekly that a
department official and a former employee involved in the scandal
are being investigated by the police.
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the families has applied for permission for
the illegal Taiwanese immigrants to remain in the country, saying
the families incurred enormous costs to settle here through an
immigration agent who allegedly dealt with the corrupt officials.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the immigrants have invested millions of Rands
in properties and businesses and should they be forced to leave
both these people and South Africa would suffer financial loss.
</P>
<P>
But the parliament standing committee of the ruling African
National Congress wants the ministry to deport the families back
to Taiwan, saying they can follow proper procedures if they are
interested in settling in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Visitors on tourist visas are not permitted to apply for
permanent residence while in the country. Applications for
permanent residence must be made from the applicant's home
country and more than 2,000 U.S. Dollars must be deposited with
the Ministry of Home Affairs if the permanent residence is
granted.
</P>
<P>
Desmond Lockey, the standing committee's chairman, said the
families "have broken the country's laws by bribing officials to
gain permanent residence status."
</P>
<P>
"No country in the world would allow such a practice and we
must not be called on to change our rules for certain people," he
noted.

HARARE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Uncertainty and fear have set
in among ACP states over the pending expiry in year 2000 of the
Lome Convention and its trade packages which have over the years
facilitated preferential access to European markets.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Mail reported today that Lome Conventions have

feet if it fails to negotiate for the extension of Lome
Convention beyond the year 2000 or retain preferential terms.
</P>
<P>
The WTO seeks to open trade to all world economies and reduce
or even remove aid packages and preferential agreements.
</P>
<P>
"All this is a threat to Africa and calls for urgency on our
part. If we do not fight in real terms then we are down," said
economist of Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions Godfrey Kanyenze.
</P>
<P>
For fear of weakening their cause through individual country
negotiations, the ACP, led by Zimbabwe current chairman of
chambers of commerce, has formed a strong bloc which is to meet
in Gabon in November to define its common position before a
meeting in Brussels, Belgium, in September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among the ACP demands is the relaxation of restrictive trade
regulations and stringent lending, borrowing and aid packages.
Already, the 14-member southern African development community
prefers Lome Convention to continue for 10 years after the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted experts saying that current developments
reflect a rapid transformation of world economies which has gone
through in the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that the 1989 fall of the Soviet Union economy,
changes in eastern Europe and forced structural adjustment
programs in developing countries have shaken the foundations of
the convention.
</P>
<P>
Europe is now looking at expanding eastwards and strengthening
ties there while further marginalizing Africa.
</P>
<P>
To compound its woes, an EU's "green paper" published recently
concludes that aid to ACP countries through the European
Development Fund has not yielded expected results in the economic
growth of these countries.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that all aid given to Africa be converted to
trade, the paper reported.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Least Developed States Fail to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural output of
the 48 Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in 1990-1994 had an
annual average growth rate of two percent, one pc less than their
annual average population growth rate, a U.N. report said.
</P>
<P>
The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said in
its "the least developed countries 1997 report" that food imports
and food aid have been significant in meeting the shortfall
between domestic agricultural production and food requirements in
many LDCs.
</P>
<P>
In 1990-1993, LDCs food imports averaged 3.6 percent of gross
domestic product (GDP), while African LDCs imports reached almost
5 percent over the same period, and these African LDCs form the
bulk of the LDC group.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that agriculture is the most important
economic activity in LDCs. In the early 1990s this sector
provided about a third of the GDP of all LDCs, and employed more
than two-thirds of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
Why then, 20 years after the "green revolution", have many
LDCs failed to improve their agricultural productivity?
</P>
<P>
Experts from the UNCTAD believed that the sluggish growth in
per capita agricultural production in LDCs can be explained by
various factors.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the agricultural and food production in most of LDCs
are dependent upon weather. The traditional production relations,
rudimentary technology and simple hand-held tools hinder farming
development.
</P>
<P>
Even where yield-enhancing technologies are available in
developing countries, farmers in many of LDCs have increased
their output simply by extending into virgin lands. They have not
adopted, on a wide scale, yield-enhancing agricultural
technologies, such as high-yielding varieties and irrigation.
</P>
<P>
For example, as a big agricultural production country in
Africa, Ethiopia has only 160,000 hectares of land under
irrigation out of the 3.5 million hectares of potentially
irrigable area.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, most LDC governments often neglected and made
inadequate investment into the agricultural sector. development
of agriculture in LDCs.
</P>
<P>
They have not adequately financed such physical and social
infrastructure as roads, water facilities, education and health
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Rural roads in LDCs are mostly dirt tracks, which are
impassable during the rainy season. And uneducated farmers may
not be as receptive to new ideals and technology as educated one.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, past macro-economic policies in most LDC governments
have failed to courage the agricultural production. For example,
the control of, or the intervention in, input supply,
agricultural processing and marketing, in the case of food crops
to ensure cheap food for urban dwellers, have created many
distortions in agricultural trade.
</P>
<P>
Administered prices, for various crops whose marketing are
controlled by the government, are often insufficient to cover
total costs of production, thus further distorting the market.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, agricultural exports are discouraged by heavy
explicite taxation and overvalued domestic currencies.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Ricupero, Secretary General of UNCTAD pointed out that
"a strong and well developed agricultural sector is a means to
broader developmental ends."
</P>
<P>
By increasing rural incomes, it will also lead to an expansion
of domestic markets. A robust agricultural policy is also a key
to an integrated poverty alleviation strategy, given that the
poorest people in LDCs tend to live in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Now UNCTAD calls on LDC governments to prioritize their often
neglected agricultural sector if they want to attain, and then
sustain, high growth rates.
</P>
<P>
The experts from UNCTAD believe that to achieve this goal, the
advise and support should be offered to governments as regards
giving higher priority to sound national agricultural policies
and their adjustment to new international trade regimes.
</P>
<P>
Effort should also be made in revitalizing national
agricultural extension, training and research facilities with
particular emphasis on creating capabilities for reaching
resource-poor and female farmers.
</P>
<P>
Stress should be put on the re-orientation of national
extension and research systems with the aim of creating more
environmentally sustainable agricultural systems.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the LDCs should have close cooperation with the
international agricultural research systems to ensure a clear
focus on production impacts on farmers' fields in international
research efforts.

<HEADLINE> 40 Percent of Bangladesh's Mangroves "Sick" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The world's greatest mangrove
forest, situated in the Bangladesh's southwest district of Khulna,
is "sick" and scientists suspect that global warming is the cause.
</P>
<P>
Already 40 percent of the 5,800 square kilometer forest
fringing the Bay of Bengal is affected by "top-dying" disease
which kills off the mangroves from the top down, the newspaper New
Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Now, in an attempt to stop the disease, scientists have begun a
three-year project funded by the British government's Overseas
Development Administration to monitor the forest, the newspaper
added.
</P>
<P>
If the scientists' suspicions are found to be true and nothing
is done to protect the forest in Sundarbans, the effects would be
both devastating and far-reaching, the newspaper continued.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh would be left to face a decimated fishing industry,
increased flooding and the loss of endangered animals, including
the world's largest concentration of royal Bengal tigers, the
newspaper quoted project director Terry Thomas as warning.
</P>
<P>
The wildlife would be badly hit in Bangladesh with about 500
types of birds and 40 species of animal, including the globally
endangered salt water crocodile, living in the forest, the
newspaper stated, adding Bangladesh would also lose its only
substantial timber resource.
</P>
<P>
"The disappearance of Sundarbans mangroves, which is the only
thing stopping Bangladesh from sliding into the Bay of Bengal,
would be an ecological catastrophe," said Keith Burd, director of
the British Council in Bangladesh which is administering the
project.
</P>
<P>
The "sick" mangroves in Sundarbans indicate that already global
warming may be having an impact on sea levels in the Bay of
Bengal, according to Thomas.
</P>
<P>
The fresh water channels are becoming increasingly saline, and
although no one knows yet for sure, "we think this may be behind
the top dying," Thomas said, adding that it also possibly
indicates a rise in sea levels which would push salt water back up
into the channels.
</P>
<P>
The initial phase of the project, which has got under way last
April, will lay a foundation for fighting back against the
catastrophe, the newspaper stated.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aim of the project is to establish Khulna, located
80 kilometers to the north of the mangroves, as a regional center
to offer graduated specific training in the ecology and
sustainable management of tropical coastal zones, the newspaper
added.
</P>
<P>
Losing the forest would be devastating for the fisheries and
therefore the economies of Bangladesh, Thailand, Myanmar and
India, according to a lecturer in forestry at Khulna University.
</P>
<P>
The governments of India, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines,
Papua New Guinea and Australia are keeping a close eye on the
Sundarbans situation, because their own mangrove forests will also
suffer similar decimation if global warming is conclusively found
to lie behind mangrove sickness, the newspaper noted.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Lobby Group Calls off Strike Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The National Convention
Executive Council (NCEC) has decided to cancel a plan of strike
scheduled on October 8 and 9, The Sunday Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The weekly paper quoted NCEC spokesman Kivutha Kibwana as
saying Saturday that the cancellation action was aimed at giving
a chance to the expected consultations with other stake-holders
of the on-going debate on the two amended bills in Kenya's
parliament.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that the government works out a modality to hold
dialogue with NCEC" on the content of the current reforms based
on the reforms package put forward by the Inter-Parties
Parliamentary Group (IPPG), he noted.
</P>
<P>
The NCEC which is the lobby group of the opposition parties in
Kenya has always dismissed the IPPG minimum constitutional,
administrative and legal reforms package as inadequate for
facilitating free and fair elections.
</P>
<P>
Kibwana said that the NCEC would review the propriety of
reviving mass action after Kenya's parliament had concluded its
debate on the minimum reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he noted that the NCEC would organize
provincial public rallies and meet-the-people tours to discuss
the IPPG proposals with the Kenyan people.

<HEADLINE> Floods Inflict Heavy Losses on Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's economy has
suffered an estimated loss of about 40 billion rupees (about 1
billion U.S. dollars) because of floods since 1988, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Another 40 billion rupees has been spent on the import of food,
owing to a lack of reservoirs to hold the water and use it to
irrigate farmland, said the officials with the Pakistan
Engineering Congress.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that we are not deriving maximum benefits
from the sweet river water, which during floods, have been flowing
into the sea un-utilized," they said.
</P>
<P>
If flood water is not contained in storage schemes and used to
augment food supplies, Pakistan would face a severe famine as the
country enters the next century, the officials warned.
</P>
<P>
The government should take immediate measures including
constructing more major reservoirs to harness the flood water,
they said.

<HEADLINE> Rational Use of Drugs Urged in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chief Medical Officer
in Tanzania's Ministry of Health Gabriel Upunda has called for
rational use of drugs to ease financial burden.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal while opening an international course on
the promotion of rational drug use in Dar es Salaam at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Upunda noted that developing countries can save their meager
resources used in importing expensive drugs if the medicines are
rationally used.
</P>
<P>
He said many developing countries at present have tight
budgets and they are forced to adopt and implement new health
financing strategies with which parents, using health care
facilities, are being asked to share the cost of medicines and
other services.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from personnel emoluments, the great part of the health
budget is spent on drugs," Upunda said.
</P>
<P>
"Most of these drugs are imported, thus exhausting the meager
foreign exchange earnings of the least developed countries such
as Tanzania," Upunda said, stressing when drugs are used
rationally there is a bigger chance that the drugs can be made
available at health centers.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 people from 12 countries are taking part in the
course.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Serengeti District
Council of Mara Region in northern Tanzania has formulated
by-laws which will make female circumcision an offense.
</P>
<P>
The by-laws were made and approved by councillors and have
been sent to the prime minister for approval before they become
effective, according to a news dispatch from Serengeti quoting
district commissioner Laban Makunenge as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
If the by-laws sail through, parents who circumcise their
daughters will face traditional fines and other punitive
measures, said the district commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Serengeti is the second district in Mara Region after Tarime
where female circumcision is rampant with all the major tribes
there practising female circumcision. Women who are not
circumcised are regarded incomplete and cannot get married.
</P>
<P>
Genital mutilation causes sufferings to women and resulted in
high rate of mortality in areas where such habits are practised.
</P>
<P>
Female circumcision-related deaths in Tarime District are
high, with 20 to 25 out of 5,000 circumcised girls dying annually
of complications particularly because of bleeding and infections,

SINGAPORE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The haze disaster, which is
turning for the worse in the region, has not only stopped overseas
tourists from coming to Singapore, but also has driven more
Singaporeans abroad for fresh air, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Sunday Times said today that figures from local
travel agents showed that there has been a growing number of
people leaving lately, resulting in increases in tour bookings in
the months of September and October, which is unusual because this
is an off-peak season.
</P>
<P>
At one travel agency, bookings went up by almost a third. More
than 250 people are leaving each week while there were fewer than
200 a week this time last year.
</P>
<P>
Another travel agency saw its bookings for Australia tours
going up by 60 percent while a third one got inquiries over the
phone for all tour packages at about 70 per hour.
</P>
<P>
The most popular destination, said the travel agents, is
Australia, followed by the United States and European countries.
</P>
<P>
Most Singaporeans prefer Australia because it is far enough to
avoid the haze but close enough to be affordable, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Cyclonic Storm Kills 36 in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The cyclonic storm and tidal
surge that battered several Bangladesh coastal districts early
Saturday morning left 36 people dead, according to information
reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The cyclone, which blew at a speed of 150 kilometers per hour
and was accompanied with five-feet-high (about 1.5 meters) tidal
surge, also left unspecified number of people injured and damaged
thousands of houses and more than 5,000 acres (about 2,000
hectares) of standing crops.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 to 30 percent of standing crops in the cyclone-hit
areas were damaged while 2,500 families were affected and more
than 1,000 houses collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The number of casualties was low mainly because of early
effective warnings, forced evacuation and efforts made by
thousands of volunteers from the Red Crescent Society.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked the concerned
authorities, including the Armed Forces, to remain alert and
continue the rescue work in areas hit by the cyclonic storm.

operations on a priority basis after identifying the worst-hit
areas.

<HEADLINE> Chea Sim Denies Split Among CPP Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Cambodian
People's Party (CPP) Chea Sim has denied reports that split has
appeared among CPP top leaders, saying that purpose of spreading
rumors of this kind is to create dissension in the party.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim, also chairman of the National Congress, said in a
televised statement Saturday that the three CPP top leaders:
himself, Hun Sen, vice chairman and co-prime minister and Heng
Samrin, honorary chairman "are united as one."
</P>
<P>
After Hun Sen left Cambodia for visits on September 22, some
Cambodian newspapers, including those pro-Hun Sen, carried
articles, saying that Chea Sim factions would hold meetings to
topple Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, the atmosphere in Phnom Penh suddenly
became so tense that some foreign embassies even notified their
citizens to get prepared for contingencies.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim said that there had been rumors recently that someone
wanted to seize me, and last night rumors went even farther as to
say that "Chea Sim has already been seized."
</P>
<P>
He mentioned that some people said that Heng Samrin were
assembling troops to fight Hun Sen. "Why does Heng Samrin have to
fight Hun Sen? These are sheer rumors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim said that "peace, development and progress are the
common desires shared by the Cambodian People, ... CPP leaders
will never do anything that goes against the will of the people."
</P>
<P>
He said that preparatory work for the general election to be
held in May 1998 was being conducted, and electoral laws and
political party law would be adopted by the Congress in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim also expressed hopes that the international community
would send observers to Cambodia and provide funds and
technological assistance for the election.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Confirms Loss of Colombo-Bound Mortars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- After a silence of nearly
three months, official confirmation has finally been given that a
consignment of 32,400 mortar bombs ordered from Zimbabwe by the
Sri Lankan Army, has gone missing.
</P>
<P>
Local press reports said today that the missing bombs had
fallen into the hands of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE).
</P>
<P>
An independent Zimbabwean newspaper, the Financial Gazette, on
Thursday quoted Tshinga Dube, head of the government-owned
Zimbabwe Defense Industries (ZDI) as saying the 81-mm mortar
rounds had disappeared at sea after the cargo vessel carrying them
left for Colombo on July 2, the local press said.
</P>
<P>
Dube was quoted as saying the International Police Organization
(Interpol) was still trying to trace the whereabouts of the
missing ship and its captain.
</P>
<P>
The ship, Stillus Limmassul, was loaded with the mortar bombs
at the Mozambican port of Beira. It last docked at a port in
Madagascar en route to Colombo.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan troops operating in the north and east of the
country reported unusually heavy mortar shelling from the rebels
in the past month, which they believed indicated that the Tamil
rebels had got the shipment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Israeli arms dealer, Ben Tsoi, was also involved
in the missing of the consignment. The ZDI claimed to have
contracted with Tsoi to arrange the transportation of the bombs.
</P>
<P>
However, Tsoi has flatly denied that he had handled the
transportation. The Israeli national was also hunted by the
Interpol for investigations.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The downward march on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) last week was halted and the share
prices staged a smart recovery in the wake of hectic short
covering and purchases by domestic institutions and foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Although the weak trend continued even in the opening session
of the new account, speculatives later met with good support as
operators rushed to cover their short positions.
</P>
<P>
And together with buying by financial institutions and
increasing purchases by foreign funds in the light of the
appreciating Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar without any
intervention by the Reserve Bank of India, the sensitive index was
pushed up by more than 100 points.
</P>
<P>
The index, which dipped by 54.13 points to 3770.99 on Monday,
later recovered to close the week at 3925.24 as against last
weekend's close of 3825.12, showing a rise of 100.12 points.
</P>
<P>
The national index rose by 39.58 points to end the week at
1703.63 from the previous weekend's close of 1664.05. The BSE-200
and the U.S. dollar index were quoted substantially up at the
weekend at 380.01 and 174.67 compared with last weekend's closes
of 373.44 and 170.81.
</P>
<P>
Brokers expected a further improvement in the prices in the
initial stages next week, but they noted that it is difficult to
predict the behavior of the market.

<HEADLINE> Haze Over Southern Thailand Starts to Lessen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The haze caused by massive
Indonesian forest fires has started to lessen on the whole in
southern Thailand, but the problem still remains serious in some
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The air quality was improving in southern Thailand's Songkhla,
Phuket, Satun and Surat Thani provinces, the Thai Public Health
Ministry said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The dust particles were measured at 50 micrograms per cubic
meters on Saturday, down from the level of 60 micrograms measured
earlier, according to the ministry, which has established mobile
air-quality monitoring units there.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the improvement, the situation is still far
from perfect, officials from the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
In some parts of Satun Province, road visibility is only within
one kilometer while on the sea, it is only 300 meters, blocking
some small boats without navigating equipment from going offshore.
</P>
<P>
In Trang Province, the haze forced Thai Airways International
to cancel a domestic flight on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The choking smoke produced from Indonesian forest fires was
brought to southern Thailand through Malaysia by wind earlier this
week, covering most of southern Thailand with Trang Province hit
hardest.
</P>
<P>
The smoke has made people in southern Thailand suffer from
respiratory aliments, forced some airlines to cancel some flights
and blocked fishing boats from going offshore.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City declared a
phase one pollution emergency today and ordered cars off the roads
and factories working at partial capacity, the city government
said.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Environment Commission made the decision this
afternoon as ozone levels went above allowable readings.
</P>
<P>
Under the emergency rules, half of the city's vehicles will be
pulled from the road, while factories are only allowed to work at
30-40 percent of capacity. One fifth of the gas stations will be
shut down and all outdoor sports activities will be called off in
schools.
</P>
<P>
The Metropolitan Indice of Air Quality (IMECA), which measures
ozone levels, reached 270 in the northeast part of the city, high
enough to trigger the alarm.
</P>
<P>
A reading of 250 on the IMECA scale is considered a hazardous
level. Readings above 100 is considered by international standards
to be dangerous to the health.
</P>
<P>
Ozone is a pollutant created when car fumes mix with solar
radiation. There are an estimated 3 million cars on the road in
the city.
</P>
<P>
Mexico City, high in a mountain basin, is one of the most
polluted in the world, where sun and smog produce a toxic brew
that often smothers the city.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time this year that the city declared a
state of environmental emergency. The incidence of respiratory and
cardiovascular diseases has risen markedly in recent days as a
result of the dense smog.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Defend Banana Export Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, September 27 (Xinhua) -- A Costa Rican delegation led
by Foreign Trade Minister Jose Miguel Salazar will travel to
European countries in the next few days to defend the country's
quota rights of banana exports, Costa Rican government sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the European Union (EU) banana import system, Costa Rica
can export 24 percent of the total Latin American banana
production to Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, the United States, Ecuador, Mexico and Guatemala never
accepted the quotas and granted discriminatory commercial
advantages to the former European colonies in Africa, Latin
America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The World Trade Organization (WTO) considers that the quota
system violates international commerce rules and asked the EU to
change it.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica will suffer the negative consequences of the WTO
resolution, though the WTO's decision will not affect this year's
Costa Rican production.
</P>
<P>
"But we are not sitting on our haunches," said Salazar. For
this Costa Rica began contacting some of the countries to start a
dialogue on the matter, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy has set up a national
committee for fighting desertification on the eve of a
U.N. conference on the problem in Rome.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi signed an order to create
the committee today.
</P>
<P>
A quarter or 27 percent of the Italian territory is considered
as facing the risk of desertification, data released by the
government show.
</P>
<P>
Large areas of arable land in Italy have changed or are
changing into deserts after they were abandoned by rural
population who moved to settle in cities.
</P>
<P>
The problem is becoming more and more acute with increasing
industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. conference on global desertification starting on
September 30 will bring together representatives and experts from
countries which have signed the International Convention to Combat
Desertifiation.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. figures, desertification causes an annual
revenue loss of 42 million U.S. dollars worldwide and affects 250
million people all over the world and a billion more people are at
risk.
</P>
<P>
In North America, desertification engulfs 74 percent of the
land while 73 percent of the African continent is threatened. In
Europe, Italy and Spain need to address the problem more seriously
and the risk of desertification in Asia and South America is
increasing.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day U.N. conference aims to find ways to implements the
Desertification Convention adopted on December 29, 1996 and
already ratified by 108 countries.
</P>
<P>
The countries who signed the Convention pledge to work out a
long-term strategy to fight desertification based on international
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Historians Say Ancient Chinese History Needs Rewriting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 28 (Xinhua) -- China has a history of 10,000
years of civilization rather than 5,000 years, some historians
have announced.
</P>
<P>
China's historical framework was built around "The Historical
Records", written by Sima Qian, a famous historian of the first
century B.C. But now, 2,000 years later, there have been new
discoveries in archaeology, anthropology, and folklore, giving
ancient history a different look, according to historians from
both sides of the Taiwan Straits attending a recent seminar on
Chinese history in Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Shi Shi, 75, a famous Chinese historian, said: "Sima Qian, who
was restricted by limited historical materials and knowledge,
built an ancient historical framework that was not quite in
accordance with historical reality," and offers some proposals for
a new Chinese historical framework.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese nation has a history of 10,000 years rather than
5,000 years, he said, and archaeological studies have proven
that Chinese civilization originated at least 9,000 years ago,
long before Huang Di, who is commonly recognized as the earliest
ancestor of the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the origins of Chinese civilization are not
monistic, but pluralistic, and that it was not a single farming
nation and that the Huanghe River Valley is not the only
birthplace of the Chinese civilization. The Yangtze River and the
Huanghe River are both places of Chinese civilization's origins.
</P>
<P>
He used Guyue People, who lived in south China in ancient
times, as an example. They were typical maritime persons who
fished on the sea 7,000 years ago and created the oldest sea
civilization in the world.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that we should not value north China above
south China in historical studies. The maritime civilization and
farming civilization of ancient China both originated in south
China and so we should pay more attention to studies of ethnic
groups in south China.
</P>
<P>
A new ancient historical framework is an important task, one
that can help us better understand our ancestors and our nation,
Shi said.
</P>
<P>
"Sima Qian dared to write a history of 2,600 years with only
reliable historical materials of 700 years. If we dare not go one
step beyond the framework built by Sima Qian after we have gotten
reliable historical materials of 3,400 years and relics from 7,000
to 8,000 years, we will be laughed at by him," he
concluded.
