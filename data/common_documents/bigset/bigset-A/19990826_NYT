AMERICAN AIRLINES WORKERS CHARGED IN DRUG SMUGGLING CASE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dozens of American Airlines employees and contract workers were
arrested Wednesday and charged with smuggling cocaine and marijuana
_ hidden in food carts, cargo holds and other inconspicuous places
_ into the United States on American planes, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A baggage handler at Dallas/Fort Worth Airport is among 58
people named in federal indictments resulting from a two-year
undercover operation called Operation Sky Chef and Operation Ramp
Rats. Most of the suspects were arrested in Miami. About 30
suspects are American Airlines employees, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were put aboard American Airlines planes at Miami
International Airport and were flown to New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, Baltimore and Cleveland, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides food carts and cargo holds, the drugs were hidden in
airplane wall panels, overhead compartments, kitchen areas,
suitcases, backpacks, garbage bags and wheel bays, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling operation came to light two years ago when an
American Airlines pilot was unintentionally served a mixture of
coffee and heroin from a smuggled parcel and complained that it
``tasted weird,'' said Ed Halley, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Brackett, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
spokeswoman in New York, said American Airlines cooperated with the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fourth large smuggling case in three years involving
American. Brackett said ``it appears ... that there's a
vulnerability that the airline industry provides'' for smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Halley said, ``This isn't something unique to American
Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Baggage handlers can move in and out of secured areas at most
airports and can fly for free or at little cost on almost any
American Airlines flight.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, at least 48 people were arrested at their homes, and
several were taken into custody at Miami International Airport,
authorities said. Not all the suspects have been arrested,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges include weapons offenses, conspiracy and importation and
distribution of drugs, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people indicted are ramp workers and baggage
handlers. Also charged are a detention officer for the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service, a Department of Agriculture
inspector, a sheriff's detective in Broward County, Fla., who
moonlighted as a baggage handler, and 11 employees of LSG Sky
Chefs, a food service contractor owned by Lufthansa German
Airlines, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   No one in American Airlines management was arrested, and no
pilots or flight attendants were indicted, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case, eight people, including seven American
employees, were arrested in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Also, 10 Colombians were arrested during the weekend in Cali,
Colombia, on drug charges that include allegations that they used
American Airlines flights to smuggle heroin and cocaine to Miami
the past two years. It was unclear whether the arrests in Colombia
were related to the U.S. arrests.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Gordon Pfeil of Watauga, Texas, the American
Airlines employee at D/FW Airport who was indicted, began at La
Guardia Airport in New York when DEA and New York Port Authority
officials caught an unidentified baggage handler carrying five
bundles of marijuana in July 1998, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation in Miami started two years ago and involved
undercover DEA agents paying airline employees and other airport
workers to carry drugs onto airplanes. The Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms later paid some of the workers to smuggle guns
and explosives onto planes.
</P>
<P>
   The agents in the Miami operation used phony cocaine and weapons
to prevent the possibility of the real thing being transported,
Miami DEA spokesman Brent Eaton said.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents in Pfeil's case, he and seven other
baggage handlers in Miami, where he worked before moving to D/FW
Airport, are suspected of smuggling as much as 10,000 pounds of
marijuana from Miami to New York and to Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeil became a target after the unidentified baggage handler
became an informant and gave police a detailed description of the
smuggling operation, according to an affidavit by Detective George
Dorner of the Port Authority Police.
</P>
<P>
   American Airlines transferred Pfeil to D/FW in August 1998. The
affidavit states that he is not suspected of smuggling after that.
He was arrested at his home about 9 a.m. Wednesday by agents from
the DEA's D/FW Airport Task Force and was charged with conspiracy
to possess and distribute marijuana, a DEA spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Pfeil, wearing his blue American Airlines uniform, made an
initial appearance before U.S. Magistrate Charles Bleil Wednesday
afternoon in Fort Worth. He was ordered held until Thursday, when
Bleil will decide whether there is sufficient evidence to try him.
</P>
<P>
   An American Airlines official said the arrests of numerous
employees did not affect company operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disturbed that a small group of our employees were part
of this smuggling ring,'' said Larry Wansley, managing director of
corporate security for AMR Corp., American Airlines' parent
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their activities have been under surveillance by the federal
government and the company for quite some time. This is a company
with zero tolerance for illegal drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wansley disputed a CNN television report that there is
``widespread corruption'' in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It involved a small group of our employees,'' Wansley said.
``I'd be foolish to say that this is all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   AMR officials have estimated that 116,000 people are employed by
the company worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Wansley said American Airlines has internal detection programs
to target illegal drug activities, but he declined to elaborate.
The company requires drug screenings for potential employees, and
random drug tests are administered to pilots, company officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're limited by law to administer polygraph examinations to
employees,'' Wansley said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has pledged $15 million to help federal agencies
intercept drugs, said John Hotard, an American Airlines spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the baggage handlers union and other groups
said the arrests do not reflect most airline ramp workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always going to have a few bad apples,'' said Tim
Gillspie of Fort Worth, president of the 5,000-member Transport
Workers Union Local No. 513.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Slay, a spokesman for LSG Sky Chefs, which has about 37,000
employees worldwide, said the company has cooperated with
authorities throughout the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They intend for this not to happen again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other smuggling cases involving American Airlines in recent
years, about 64 pounds of cocaine were found in March 1996 stuffed
in the cockpit ceiling of an American Boeing 757 at D/FW Airport.
The jet had made stops in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Puerto Rico and
several U.S. cities before the drugs were found.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1997, seven American Airlines mechanics in Miami were
charged with smuggling after millions of dollars worth of heroin
and cocaine from Colombia were found in fishnet-type material
behind panels in the ceilings, lavatories, kitchens and cockpits of
several American jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Drug agents in Puerto Rico arrested an American Airlines ramp
supervisor in February on suspicion of trying to smuggle 205 pounds
of cocaine into the United States. &QL;

ALAN KEYES: ARIZONA'S STEALTH CANIDATE FOR PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alan Keyes, a bombastic, conservative talk-show host, is
Arizona's stealth candidate for president.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has yet to come to Phoenix this year, he's kept the
nucleus of his campaign operating in a downtown house since June,
largely undetected by the radar screen of local media.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, a protein-diet fan who strips the buns off his burgers
while grabbing a bite at campaign stops, is nourishing his unlikely
campaign the same way: red meat, hold the carbos.
</P>
<P>
   His explosive oratory knocks his listeners back in their seats;
his press secretary has locked horns with Jay Leno; and Keyes has
gone his own way even at the cost of media exposure.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with ``The Arizona Republic,'' the candidate
criticized his Republican Party for going the way of the cash-rich
donor at the expense of its more traditional, grass-roots
supporters. The result, according to Keyes, is that core issues,
abortion in particular, are being ignored by leading candidates
such as Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of the large donors in the party, possibly 50 to
60 percent, are pro-abortion, and I think it is corrupting these
candidates' views,'' said Keyes, a Maryland resident.
</P>
<P>
   With 16 paid staffers nationwide and an e-mail list of 22,500,
Keyes is tilling the hard-right grass roots in his effort to reach
the White House. His firebrand speeches are laced with references
to the halcyon days of conservatism under Ronald Reagan; it is the
adherents of Reagan that Keyes is seeking to awaken in his second
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``One has to rouse and organize people at the grass roots to
counteract this bad influence in the party,'' he said. ``It's not
enough to take stands on moral issues that are right. You have to
make clear that we have a moral crisis in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his skill as an orator _ Keyes can draw impressive
crowds along the campaign trail _ he faces daunting odds in his bid
for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, aides concede that Keyes can't compete for TV time
with the state's two other candidates, former Vice President Dan
Quayle and Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at this realistically, when you have two favorite sons
and half the biggies, including (Gov.) Jane Hull working for (Texas
Gov. George W.) Bush, it's frankly just not judicious for him to be
here a lot,'' said Becky Fenger, Keyes' national communications
director. ``Most of Arizona would like Alan Keyes, at least the
conservative part.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes has also struggled for attention from the national media,
which have largely dismissed his campaign as implausible. Even when
reporters have sought him out, Keyes sometimes has sidestepped the
interviews because too many questions are about Bush, the race's
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the recent flurry of attention about whether
Bush ever took illegal drugs, Keyes politely responds that
reporters should back off Bush until they have concrete evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in public and political life should not answer, and
should not have to answer, any open-ended questions about
themselves,'' Keyes said. ``This whole business of fishing _ I
mean, where does it stop?''
</P>
<P>
   Added Keyes, ``Why this crime and not that crime? When you
consider the catalog of human vices, it would take us the whole
rest of the campaign just to answer the questionnaire.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, however, Keyes has been frustrated by the Bush mania.
</P>
<P>
   Fenger said the candidate had declined to do interviews in the
run-up to the Iowa Straw Poll after becoming disgusted with the
incessant flow of questions about the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has said, `I really hate doing it because there are no
other questions, and it's boring,' '' Fenger said. ``You can
understand the fatigue if you do all those interviews and the only
question is, `Why would you be in a race when George Bush has $40
million?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fenger, a conservative lobbyist and local columnist whose e-mail
address is rpfenger(at)extreme.com, provided one of the campaign's
biggest headlines. In July, she went head-to-head with Jay Leno
when he referred to the Republican presidential field as ``the
Ivory Coalition.'' Fenger was upset that he hadn't noted the
candidacy of Keyes, who is African-American.
</P>
<P>
   Fenger phoned the comedian on multiple occasions to complain,
and Leno was later quoted in the ``Washington Post'' as calling
Keyes' spokeswoman a ``psycho woman.'' According to Fenger, she was
merely trying to correct a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was saying, `Just say Alan is a Black man,' '' Fenger told
``The Republic'' at the time of the article. ``I said, `Just tell
the nation Alan is not White.' ''
</P>
<P>
   An ardent foe of taxes and abortion, Keyes has attended
conservative events that his opponents have shirked or indicated
they would bypass, including the Midwest Leadership Conference in
Omaha earlier this month and the upcoming Alabama Straw Poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where it's feasible, I want to go and talk to folks who will
be making the crucial decisions in this election,'' he said. ``I
think what the party does this time is seriously, deeply important.
If the Republicans mess up, it's going to be a blow to basic
self-governance because I don't think the Democrats offer a hope in
that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Keyes' aides assailed his rivals for playing
politics with the Straw Poll rather than showing up to get their
message out and taking their chances on the results. According to
Fenger and Sydney Hoff Hay, Keyes' general consultant, several
other campaigns bought the delegate list for the event Saturday,
saw they wouldn't do well and decided to take a pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an example of the typical political posturing that a lot
of candidates do with these straw polls,'' Hoff Hay said. ``But
Alan isn't that way. He's going to honor his commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoff Hay said Keyes had used the same delegate list not to see
how he would do, but to mail out copies of an audio tape containing
a recent Keyes speech.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the decision of most other campaigns to stay away from
Alabama this weekend, Keyes will hold center stage with Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah, at a convention that likely will draw more than
3,000 conservative Republicans, many of whom are the kind to do the
heavy lifting necessary later in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that Dr. Keyes has that some of the top candidates
don't have is the ground troops,'' said Chris Neeley, executive
director of the Alabama Republican Party. ``He has a strong
presence among the activists, and those are the fighters and
diggers in the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Keyes, who recently has lost 35 pounds on an all-protein diet he
learned about from an infomercial, is also having to run a lean
campaign. He has a tiny bankroll and is having trouble adding to it
because of less than impressive numbers in recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   The candidate has raised slightly more than $2 million from more
than 40,000 contributors, but aides point out that their expenses
are rock bottom compared with other candidates'. That will allow
Keyes to avoid having to borrow against matching funds for another
two months, a fate that has already befallen the campaigns of Gary
Bauer and Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   At the Iowa Straw Poll, where Keyes came in seventh, a low
showing, but ahead of Quayle, Keyes served only ice cream to his
supporters and made them foot the bill to attend, while every other
campaign paid to truck in its faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were, to the best of our knowledge, the only campaign that
didn't buy tickets,'' Fenger said. ``You almost wanted to cry.
Sometimes, there were these poor farmers wearing overalls who came
and said, `We can't afford the $25, but we want to go and vote for
Alan Keyes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Keyes team thinks devotion like that will generate a
surprise victory in the Iowa caucuses, which will be conducted in
town-hall fashion early next year. The event requires voters to
conduct face-to-face debates with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straw Poll was about T-shirts and barbecue and
air-conditioning and everything else,'' Hoff Hay said. ``In the
caucuses, you've got to go and debate, and it's very in-your-face.
It's uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   And if there is an in-your-face candidate in the race, it's
Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech before the Iowa Straw Poll, Keyes thundered that
elements in the Republican Party had sold out to the highest bidder
by throwing their support behind candidates with massive war chests
and binding ties to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some in this party who have surrendered to
government by money, for money,'' Keyes said. ``I will not be
bought and sold on the auction block of our freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidate lacerated President Clinton as ``treasonous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If no one else will say it, (Clinton) has assaulted the
security of our country by this treasonous betrayal of our national
security,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of edgy speech that causes professional
political observers to almost uniformly dismiss Keyes as an
unlikely winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a political gadfly,'' said Dennis Goldford, a political
scientist at Drake University in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes faithful write off glum prognostications, asserting they
have always been overlooked by the media elite. Case in point, said
Fenger: When Keyes brought the crowd to its feet at the Midwest
Leadership Conference in Omaha, national political reporters
sloughed off his rousing performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen Omaha,'' Fenger said. ``Omaha was his.
They almost got up and carried him away on their shoulders.'' &QL;

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
He still sweats the details. Even now, in his 50th year on the job,
the butterflies still gather in the stomach as the days leading to
a big game count down and anticipation increases by the moment.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Big Ten title? It's all but a given. National champions? Some
think that will happen, too.
</P>
<P>
   First up, though, a Saturday date with Arizona, a football team
with similarly big-time aspirations. So how go preparations for the
final season of his first half-century in Happy Valley?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had it to do over again,'' Joe Paterno says, ``I'd open
up with Akron.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the original plan before Penn State _ ranked third in
the Associated Press preseason poll _ agreed to host No. 4 Arizona
in the Pigskin Classic at noon Saturday in Beaver Stadium. Still,
if his team is as close to midseason form as its 73-year-old coach,
the Nittany Lions' national title drive will be off to a roaring
start.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno worries about his backfield, where likely starting
tailback Cordell Mitchell has missed time with a hamstring pull.
Fullback Aaron Harris has been slowed by a groin pull. Quarterback
Kevin Thompson has been established as the starter, but Thompson or
backup Rashard Casey will have to improve on erratic 1998 showings
if the Lions are to live up to all the hype.
</P>
<P>
   And what about that defense that's supposed to rival that of the
1986 national championship team?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see it first, Paterno says.
</P>
<P>
   After all the obligatory paranoia, though, Paterno appears to be
having fun as season No. 34 as head coach at Penn State beckons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches never grow up,'' he says with a smile. ``When you grow
up, you probably need to retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still like being involved in a kids' game. I still like the
game part, the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder. A man who fell into the job has won 307 games in
33 seasons in Happy Valley. Those plans to become a lawyer _ the
ones put on hold when Rip Engle invited him to join the Penn State
staff a half-century ago _ will have to wait awhile longer, it
seems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm just stupid or narrow-minded,'' Paterno says. ``A
lot of people do something for 15 years and say, `Hey, I'm bored. I
want to do something else.' And they have the talent to do
something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been bored, but if I was, I don't know what else I
would do. I don't have the talent to do something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's why I stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   And stayed and stayed.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when a 10-year tenure has become a major event,
Paterno is the last dinosaur. But if the number 50 might boggle
other minds, the fellow at the heart of what could be a season-long
celebration insists he isn't wasting time looking back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifty ties in with the end of the century,'' he says. ``In
order to help recruiting, they've had people look back and see
what's happened over that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty. Among the more notable historical upheavals over that
tumultuous period, consider a small but intriguing footnote: Since
Paterno became head coach at Penn State in 1966, there have been
657 Division I-A head coaching changes, an average of 5.86 for each
of the 112 institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Paterno's starting his 50th year at Penn State,''
third-year Minnesota coach Glen Mason says. ``I'm in my 50th year
on the planet. That's as close as I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Paterno has had chances to pack up and go. The New
England Patriots courted him heavily in the 1970s, and he concedes
to a pang or two when another Super Sunday rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while, with all the hoopla about the Super
Bowl maybe I wanted to be in one Super Bowl,'' he says. ``But that
was very, very passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody is able to have the kind of career I've had at Penn
State, the people I've been around you've got to go to bed at night
thinking, `Thank God!'''
</P>
<P>
   Even after all these years, Paterno stays involved in most
phases of the program. Unlike some other coaching icons before him,
he resists the role of figurehead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain areas I like to coach; others I don't,'' he says. ``I
stick my two cents into just about every part of it from time to
time.''
</P>
<P>
   He is about to outlast longtime assistant Jerry Sandusky, the
defensive coordinator who plans to retire after this, his 32nd year
on the Nittany Lions' staff. Three other aides have been with
Paterno for at least two decades _ offensive coordinator Frank
Gantner (29th season), quarterbacks coach Dick Anderson (23) and
secondary coach Tom Bradley (21).
</P>
<P>
   While 50 is a nice, round number _ and he can't help but notice
all these other guys getting older and grayer all around him _
Paterno offers no indication he is ready to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the people around me would say, `You don't have quite
the energy,' or, `You're not paying attention to the little
things,' or, `You're not as organized as you need to be,''' he
says. ``I think I'll be the first to notice.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he still knows the difference between Arizona and
Akron; the latter arrives Sept 4. Those national championship
dreams could be dashed in the span of just a few hours Saturday
afternoon, but such is the risk of taking on a high-profile
``preseason'' game.
</P>
<P>
   But the positives, Paterno says, outweigh the pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a chance to prepare for a team as good as
Arizona, you probably get a little more out of summer conditioning
and preseason practice,'' he says. ``Win or lose, you are probably
a better football team when you start the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Good enough to go on to add a third national championship to the
ones Paterno claimed in 1982 and '86?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions must travel to improving Miami on Sept. 18,
but Ohio State (Oct. 16) and Michigan (Nov. 13) visit Happy Valley.
If a few things fall into place, a trip to the Sugar Bowl _ site of
the Bowl Championship Series' designated national championship game
_ is hardly out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   So 50 could be more than a watershed number. It could be a
memorable one in other ways, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no sense of, `Hey, I made it 50 years, I'm
something special,''' Paterno insists. ``I'm just lucky. I'm the
first guy to admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up can wait.

   MILWAUKEE _ Even in an illogical season, there are times logic
and common sense should rule.
</P>
<P>
   So there they are, the Dodgers, finally on some sort of roll
against the Milwaukee Brewers, the worst home team in baseball.
There's Kevin Brown, one of the best pitchers in baseball, with a
three-run lead in the sixth inning against a light-hitting team.
And there's the Brewers, already into their makeshift bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect set-up. You knew where this one was headed.
It had to be in the Dodgers' favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we lost,'' Dodgers shortstop Mark Grudzielanek said
after Jose Valentin's grand slam helped the Brewers rally for a 9-7
win in the series finale Wednesday at County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gone was the Dodgers' three-game sweep of the Brewers. The road
trip went from a stellar 5-1 to a sour-tasting 4-2, and the quiet
rumbling of perhaps catching fading San Francisco for second place
in the NL West was again wiped away by the reality of another
golden situation badly tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know was saying, `Sweep, sweep, sweep,''' said
Grudzielanek, a Milwaukee native with family in attendance. ``Brown
was on the hill. That's what people were saying. You can't do that.
We're supposed to win the game. We've got our No.1 guy out there
and you're supposed to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you get the door slammed in your face. That's been
happening all year. We need to go out and play hard every day. We
can't worry about the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown didn't figure in the decision, but he was a big reason for
the disappointment. The seven earned runs he allowed (in six
innings) were more than double the amount he yielded in his four
previous starts this month. It also brought an end to a six-start
stretch in which the $105-million man went 4-0 with a 0.99 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``With K.B. on the mound, 99 out of 100 times, you're going to
win the game,'' said Dodgers catcher Paul LoDuca, who had his
second career homer. ``It's one of those years where you have to
get over the hump. You keep waiting for it to happen....''
</P>
<P>
   But, as LoDuca then admitted, the Dodgers always slide back
down. This is not an isolated incident. The Dodgers could have won
their fourth straight for the first time since before the All-Star
break. They took four consecutive victories into the second half,
then lost to the Angels with Brown starting.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been many, if any, huge starts since then, but put
in proper context, this loss to the Brewers had meaning. Nobody in
baseball has been pitching as well as Brown, and the Dodgers staked
him to a 5-2 lead on LoDuca's two-run homer in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Are the Dodgers heading for the playoffs? No.
</P>
<P>
   Are they still after respect? Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Brown retired the first batter of the sixth and then allowed
three straight singles. Jeff Cirillo, 2 for his last 20 and without
an RBI for 15 games, walked on five pitches to force in a run.
Valentin then homered into the first row of the right-field stands
for the Brewers' second grand slam of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valentin, I don't know, he's been all world against us,''
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``That's one that you think
you're going to put away. It would have been a great road trip
instead of just a good one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers should be used to this. They are set for
expectations, poised to achieve it. Then they fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   They rallied from a 7-5 deficit to tie it seventh, only to have
flailing lefty Pedro Borbon (3-2) allow two runs in an inning of
relief to lose it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like we should have won the game,'' Grudzielanek
said. ``We let this happen.''

SIMMS GETS THE APPLAUSE, APPLEWHITE THE SNAPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As a public service to Orangebloods eager to
begin hyping Texas' next Heisman Trophy candidate, we offer this
warning from the head football coach's office:
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath waiting for freshman quarterback Chris
Simms, the purest passer to pass through the Longhorns' locker room
since Bobby Layne, to take any snaps during Saturday's season
opener against North Carolina State. It could be hazardous to your
health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Chris play, but we're not going to script
it,'' Texas coach Mack Brown said. ``We need to win the game.
That's our only objective.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, someone other than the most prized signee in the
nation's top recruiting class gives the 17th-ranked Longhorns their
best chance to beat the Wolfpack. In fact, the major player in this
offense, both now and throughout the season, will be the
freckle-faced redhead who has all the intangibles Simms lacks:
Major Applewhite, Texas' sophomore quarterback and unquestioned
team leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Major and this is clearly his huddle now,'' Brown
said. ``He steps in and takes over. He's made very few ill-advised
or poor throws this fall.''
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said of Simms, who has confided to teammates
and coaches that the college game moves more quickly than he
envisioned. Until he takes his first regular-season snap, Simms
will not be allowed to utter those words for himself, as per
Brown's policy regarding interviews with freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   So we'll have to defer to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, who
said: ``Chris told me it's been less of a physical adjustment than
he expected but more of a mental one.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean Simms, son of former New York Giants
quarterback Phil Simms, has failed to turn heads. Quite the
contrary. During the team's final scrimmage, his 65-yard touchdown
pass to David Aaron against the first-team defense drew the largest
cheer from the 4,000 fans in attendance. The second-loudest ovation
went for Simms' near-miss on another deep pass.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, by comparison, received golf claps for connecting on
6-of-7 passes for 75 yards and a touchdown in his lone,
precision-perfect possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of makes me laugh a little bit,'' Applewhite said of
the buzz surrounding Simms. ``No question, he's going to be a good
quarterback. He has great physical skills. But he needs to learn
the mental part of the game. That's about 90 percent of what
college football is. Basically, everyone has about the same
physical skills. The key is whether you can beat the other guy
mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   That is where Applewhite, a devout film studier, excels. It is
the reason he will remain ahead of Simms on Texas' depth chart for
the foreseeable future. Maybe for an entire career.
</P>
<P>
   Such a notion sounds laughable, considering the respective
physical attributes of Applewhite (6-foot-1, 205 pounds) and Simms
(6-5, 210). But the most-celebrated quarterbacks are not always the
most successful ones at the college level. Scrappers occasionally
outshine projected superstars, especially at Texas. James Street
over Bill Bradley. Robert Brewer over Rick McIver. James Brown over
Shea Morenz.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite over Simms? It's too early to call. But you have to
love the attitude of a guy like Applewhite, who ranks sixth among
returning passers in college football (147.4 rating) and shrugs off
a Sports Illustrated prediction that he ``will most likely sit on
the bench once Simms ... learns the playbook.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at this as competition or pressure. I look at
this as Texas getting better,'' said Applewhite, who serves as
Simms' sounding board in team meetings. ``What some magazine says
doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that we have a true
freshman behind me who hasn't played. I don't want Texas to lose a
single game, especially not because I went down with an injury. So
I answer every question he's got. How selfish would I have to be
not to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a guy with his priorities in order. The kind you'd
have a hard time displacing as a team leader, either now or in the
future.
A FASHION STATEMENT
</P>
<P>
   As a nominee for the Jim Thorpe Award, given annually to the
nation's top defensive back, Baylor cornerback Gary Baxter is doing
his part to help the Bears look sharp on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, however, he'd like to do more. A fashion design
major who refuses to wear T-shirts or tennis shoes on campus
(they're not stylish enough), Baxter said he longs to serve as a
clothes consultant to some of his frumpish teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to coach them, if they'd let me. But most of them
have their own little ways,'' Baxter said, sighing. ``We have a
couple of guys who know how to dress, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baxter, naturally, considers himself in that group. He's big on
khakis, loafers, and Armani suits. His favorite casual labels
include Dockers, Polo, and Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved clothes,'' said Baxter, who led the team in
interceptions (four) and pass breakups (18) last season. ``I always
want to look first-class. I don't even own a pair of tennis shoes.
Just dress shoes, loafers, and casual shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Once his football career ends, Baxter has an interest in
designing shoes and fine jewelry. But only if he can't break into
the lingerie business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do that. I think that would be the ideal job,''
Baxter said. ``What could be cooler than hanging around with female
models all day?''
QUICK HITS
STOP THAT POPPING
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech coach Spike Dykes is pleased the schedule-maker does
not require the Red Raiders to play before a Sept. 6 opener at
Arizona State. His team, he said, can use the time for fine-tuning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're like a `Popping Johnny,' '' Dykes said,
drawing blank stares from inquiring minds lacking agricultural
backgrounds. ``That's an old John Deere tractor that hits two licks
and then misses one. We're not smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can run three crisp plays in a row, then we have people
running the wrong way. Or we play good defense for three plays,
then turn someone scot-free. This week, we're going to get that
down. We need to. We couldn't beat Decatur Baptist today.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since Decatur Baptist College, which relocated in the
1930s to become Dallas Baptist University, no longer fields a
football team.
FRESH PERSPECTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Kansas coach Terry Allen said he's not worried about repeating
the debacle of 1993 when the Jayhawks meet Notre Dame in Saturday's
Eddie Robinson Classic (2:30 p.m., South Bend, Ind.). The last time
Kansas added a 12th game to its schedule, the Jayhawks were
swamped, 42-0, by Florida State in the 1993 Kickoff Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll handle this much better,'' said Allen, who is
stressing that players use the trip as a learning experience before
the team's ``real opener,'' on Sept. 11 against California
State-Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's 70-0 on Saturday and we've got 10 guys on stretchers,
I may feel different at that point,'' said Allen, whose team is
coming off a 4-7 season.
TEXAS TICKET TALLY
</P>
<P>
   With one day remaining to sell season tickets, Texas officials
anticipate cracking the 47,000 mark for the first time in school
history. Until this season, the previous high had been 39,743, set
in 1997. To put that in perspective, Texas' 1999 season-ticket
total will eclipse the number of seats available at Iowa State
(43,000) and rivals the stadium capacities at six other Big 12
schools: Baylor (50,000), Colorado (51,808), Kansas (50,250),
Kansas State (50,000), Oklahoma State (50,614), and Texas Tech
(50,500).
STUNNING SHUTOUT
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska returns four starters in its offensive line. Yet no
member of the group is being heavily touted for all-conference
honors. If preseason expectations hold, Nebraska will fail to
produce a first-team offensive lineman for the first time since
joining the Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the offensive line was an area of inexperience last
year and it showed,'' coach Frank Solich said. ``They were not as
good as some of the lines we've had in the past, but hopefully,
they'll step it up a notch this season. I think they've come a long
way in the areas they need to work on. I think you'll see a
much-improved line this season.''

HARLEM'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP TURNS AGAINST PLANNED YOUTH MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leading a wave of condemnation among the city's black
politicians, Rep.e Charles B. Rangel, Harlem's most powerful
political figure, Wednesday called for a boycott of a planned youth
rally, saying racially charged speeches and violent clashes with
the police at last year's rally proved that ``it is impossible for
any good'' to come out of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped last year if there was an increase in the kids
coming, the good would overcome the hatred of the organizers,''
Rangel said at a news conference in Harlem with Councilman Bill
Perkins, who reported that he was assaulted on Monday by organizers
of the rally, called the Million Youth March. ``But after the
events of last year, we would not encourage anyone to get involved
in the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent black politicians came forward Wednesday to
condemn both the march and its organizers. The statements marked a
shift among the city's black leaders, who last year condemned the
leader of the march, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, for his derogatory
remarks about Jews and whites, but grudgingly accepted the event as
a way to mobilize young blacks and in some cases even encouraged
them to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright of Harlem, who last year tried to
mediate between march organizers and city officials, issued a
statement Wednesday under the headline, ``Enough is Enough _ Why
the Million Youth March Should Not Take Place in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H.Carl McCall, the only black holding
statewide office, said in a statement Wednesday: ``I cannot abide
by Khallid Muhammad's evil message, and I cannot support his
march.''
</P>
<P>
   And C.Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president who
earlier this week spurned a plea for assistance from march
organizers, issued an appeal for all residents to ``douse'' the
``flames of divisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts to isolate Muhammad were driven by outrage over last
year's rally _ which resulted in injuries to 14 participants and 16
police officers _ and by anger at the treatment of Perkins, a
Harlem Democrat who said supporters of Muhammad surrounded him at a
political event on Monday night and shouted, ``We are going to kill
Uncle Toms like you.'' Perkins, who said he was considering
pressing charges, was offered police protection by Commissioner
Howard Safir during a meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a raucous news conference outside the Apollo Theater in
Harlem Wednesday night, as his supporters mixed threats toward
white reporters with chants of ``Black Power,'' Muhammad and other
organizers said the boycott calls did not reflect popular sentiment
in the community, and they accused black political leaders of
pandering to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the black elected officials are so far removed
from their own constituents that they are afraid to stand up for
the people,'' said Shaunette Daniels, a spokeswoman for the march.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad again denied that his supporters had assaulted Perkins,
but then added: ``Bill Perkins is my brother and he is a member of
the black nation, but he is a Tom that bootlicks white people like
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad has yet to secure a city permit for the rally, which is
scheduled for Sept. 4 along the section of Lenox Avenue known as
Malcolm X Boulevard. In their latest request to city officials, the
rally's organizers have said that, starting at 11 a.m., they want
to march from 135th Street to 118th Street, and then conduct a
program of educational speeches from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. between 118th
and 124th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad vowed Wednesday to march with or without a permit,
warning that there ``will be a state of emergency in Harlem'' if
the Police Department attempts to block the event.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani denounced the organizers as ``reprehensible,'' but
declined to say whether the city will issue a permit. Instead, he
blamed the news media for paying too much attention to Muhammad and
his organization, the New Black Panther Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are creating them,'' he chided reporters. ``They don't
have support. They don't have political support, they don't have
social support, they don't have support in the community. And by
constantly focusing on them, you are creating them, and I want to
say as little as possible to give them attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the public criticism, Giuliani's aides have been
quietly negotiating for weeks with Muhammad's lawyers over the
terms of a rally.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Connolly, the city attorney handling the negotiations,
declined to discuss his conversations with the rally's lawyers.
Connolly, however, has told march organizers that the city will
abide by a federal appeals court's decision last year that allowed
the youth rally to assemble for four hours on six blocks of Malcolm
X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says that the city is prepared to adhere to that
decision,'' said Jomo Thomas, a lawyer for the rally's organizers.
Thomas said the city's Corporation Counsel, Michael D. Hess, spoke
with the organizers Wednesday afternoon and said he hoped to avoid
another court battle.

ABORTION FURY GROWS  
 HULL DEFENDS MOVE TO SEND TEEN OUT OF STATE. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
ABORTION Abortion furor intensifies 
ABORTION By CHRIS MOESER AND KARINA BLAND(at) 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. Jane Hull on Wednesday defended her decision to let a
teenager who is 23 weeks pregnant be sent out of state for an
abortion, saying it's in the child's best interests to resolve the
matter quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Hull also disputed critics' claims that the abortion violates
Arizona law and stressed that the 14-year-old herself chose the
procedure after reviewing all her options.
</P>
<P>
   The decision created an uproar among abortion foes, who flooded
radio talk shows and lawmakers' offices with outraged calls.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INSERT WED NITE VIGIL
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jeff Groscost, R-Mesa, and other legislators
continued to criticize Hull's decision Wednesday. But the governor
refused demands to appeal the court order, issued Friday, requiring
officials to take the girl to a state where abortions are performed
after 20 weeks of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Abortions are not currently performed in Arizona after 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hull added that Attorney General Janet Napolitano told her there
was little room to appeal the judge's order. Napolitano herself
said the court order prohibited her from commenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think abortion is wrong. I don't like abortion,'' Hull said.
``. . . We can draw lines in the sand, but are we going to draw
lines in that child's life? I think we have to let the process move
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor added, ``My gut feeling is tremendous sympathy for
this child, for what she's gone through since she was 5. What can
we do at this point? There's a court order.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights advocates rallied to the state's defense
Wednesday, agreeing with Hull that state officials are acting
legally in assisting the child.
</P>
<P>
   They also demanded an immediate investigation of how information
about the case, which by law is confidential, was leaked to the
press.
</P>
<P>
   New details also emerged about the girl, who has been a ward of
the court since age 5.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Judge Maurice Portley of Maricopa County Juvenile
Court said the girl's court-appointed guardian, an attorney,
requested the abortion after discovering that the child had been
raped or had sex with an adult, which is statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
   The girl is a chronic runaway who told the court that she used
myriad illegal drugs during her pregnancy, Portley said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's mother died in January, and her body was found near
the Glendale Municipal Airport, according to police reports. The
39-year-old woman was last seen the day before in the 7100 block of
North 80th Avenue in the company of a man. Glendale police still
are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's father is in prison. Portley said no other adult
relatives are willing or able to care for her.
</P>
<P>
   The guardian and others talked to the girl about her options,
including giving up the baby for adoption, Portley said.
</P>
<P>
   And, at Hull's request, a veteran Child Protective Services
caseworker met with the child again Tuesday to go over the child's
options in detail. The girl also met with a psychologist and was
examined by a Phoenix doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The caseworker that was sent in yesterday at my request was an
experienced person who had dealt with this and could give the girl
her options,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl continued to insist that she wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   After a hearing, Judge William Sargeant of Maricopa County
Superior Court determined that it was in the girl's best interest
that she have an abortion, Portley said. The girl, who was at the
hearing, reiterated her wish to have the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Portley said he hasn't received any requests that the matter be
reconsidered. The girl's court records have been sealed.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, who opposes abortion rights in most cases, said the
child's wishes should be respected.
</P>
<P>
   ``She, too, has to have a choice in her future,'' Hull said. ``I
would be almost as frightened of government as I am if government
made decisions for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents continued calls for the state to appeal the
decision. Bishop Thomas O'Brien of the Catholic Diocese of Phoenix
issued a statement expressing his ``horror and outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I must also express my grave disappointment with the governor
and the relevant state agencies for their failure to appeal this
ruling,'' O'Brien wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters, however, said state officials were
doing nothing wrong by complying with the court order. They
disputed critics' assertions that it was against state law to
perform abortions after 20 weeks in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Although no doctors currently perform the procedure at that
stage of pregnancy in Arizona, there is no specific requirement
that cuts off abortions after 20 weeks, said Joseph Feldman of
Planned Parenthood of Central and Northern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The standard, Feldman said, is whether the fetus is able to
survive outside the womb. That determination is made by the doctor,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``This abortion would not be illegal in Arizona,'' Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents also had argued Tuesday that taking the girl
out of state for the abortion violates a state law that forbids the
use of state funds for abortions. But state officials have said the
procedure would be paid for with federal funds, a point Hull
reiterated Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not one penny of state funds is being used,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funds can be used for abortions for the poor in cases of
rape, incest or if the mother's life is endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights supporters, in letters to Hull and Napolitano,
trained their fire on abortion foes, demanding to know how details
of the case were leaked.
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Hull and Napolitano, Bruce Miller and Brian Finkel
highlighted comments by abortion opponent John Jakubczyk in
Wednesday's ``Arizona Republic'' in which Jakubczyk said he had
been tipped off by officials familiar with the girl's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A crime has been committed,'' said Finkel, a doctor who
provides abortions. ``We have state or court employees who have
knowingly violated the rights of a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakubczyk, president of Arizona Right to Life, said
abortion-rights supporters are diverting attention from the real
issue at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Hull said she will attempt to find out who leaked the
information.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Sue Grace, chairwoman of the Senate Health Committee,
agreed that state officials need to find out who leaked the
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a privacy issue. How did they find out?'' asked Grace,
R-north Central Phoenix. ``This poor girl, even though her name is
not being used, knows we're talking about her. I'd like to see her
pain diminished as much as possible and be done with it.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI backed away from six years of unqualified
denials to Congress and the public Wednesday and conceded that it
used ``pyrotechnic'' tear-gas canisters on the final day of the
1993 standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said the devices were ``pyrotechnic'' only in a
limited sense and bounced harmlessly off a concrete structure six
hours before the compound's main building, built of wood, erupted
in flames.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people, including 24 children, were found dead after
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation, after repeated staunch denials, that federal
agents used pyrotechnic devices of any definition was deemed so
serious that Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis
Freeh on Wednesday night ordered an exhaustive inquiry into the
events of April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 FBI agents have been assigned to the review, and
everyone who was at Waco that day will be re-interviewed, said John
Collingwood, a bureau spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that law enforcement did not start the
fire,'' Collingwood said. But there were clear signs Wednesday
evening that the backtracking had spawned a serious credibility
crisis for the FBI and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new information requires a thorough investigation of
whether the Justice Department has misled the American people, and
the Congress, about what happened at Waco,'' Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., who heads the Committee on Government Reform, said
Wednesday night in a statement. ``I intend for the Government
Reform Committee to get to the bottom of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's committee, along with the House Judiciary Committee,
held hearings in 1996 on the Waco incident that were scathingly
critical of the Justice Department, the FBI and Reno as well as of
the Treasury Department and its Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, which had a confrontation with the Branch Davidians that
preceded the April 19 assault. But the lawmakers said there was no
indication that the FBI had caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said Wednesday night that he applauded
Burton's stand. ``Was there testimony to the Congress that was
knowingly wrong?'' Barr said in a telephone interview. He, too,
called for congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Another FBI spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the devices in
question were ``pyrotechnic'' only in a limited sense _ that is,
that they generated heat even as they dispensed tear gas. He said
they were fired at the concrete ``bunker'' about 100 yards from the
main wood structure after less potent tear gas canisters failed to
pierce the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agents wanted to get tear gas into the bunker
because they feared the Davidians would try to escape through a
tunnel between it and the wooden building, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The two pyrotechnic devices, military-type gas canisters known
as M-651 grenades and fired by an FBI agent from a range of about
40 yards, also bounded off the bunker roof and into a nearby
puddle, where they lay harmlessly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After flames consumed the wood building, the remains of the cult
leader, David Koresh, and his followers were found. Autopsies
showed that some had died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, others
from the flames or smoke. A few escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI spokesmen, while insisting that there is no new
information to challenge the finding that the Davidians themselves
started the fire, acknowledged Wednesday night that the necessity
to ``recant and modify'' earlier statements was acutely
embarrassing to the FBI. Asked if he thought there had been a
coverup, one spokesman replied, ``absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno came under heavy criticism immediately after the raid, but
then regained respect as she accepted responsibility and answered
questions with seeming candor. Her credibility and that of the FBI
are at stake with the disclosures about the use of the
military-type gas grenades. Freeh was not the FBI director at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about the two pyrotechnic canisters were first carried
by The Dallas Morning News this week based on an interview with a
former senior FBI official.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of force used by federal agents on April 19, 1993,
could be critical in a wrongful-death suit filed by some Branch
Davidian survivors and relatives of the dead and scheduled to open
on Oct. 18. Some plaintiffs are represented by former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark. And the question of whether the FBI used
pyrotechnic devices has been the subject of a separate inquiry by
the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and Justice Department are far more worried that the
recantation will fuel the suspicions of people who have long
doubted the federal government's motives and actions in the
incident. ``We're fighting the conspiracy theorists,'' one bureau
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A former soldier, Timothy McVeigh, was so enraged by the
incident at Waco that he bombed the Federal Building in Oklahoma
City on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people, according to evidence
at his trial. Prosecutors said he chose the second anniversary of
the Waco incident for symbolic vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI explained Wednesday night that on April 19, 1993, a
bureau agent was driven to within 40 yards of the Davidians'
concrete bunker in an Army Bradley fighting vehicle, then fired the
two military canisters. He was 100 yards away at the time and was
firing away from the wood structure, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The unsuccessful use of those two canisters was noted in
documents at the time, the bureau said Wednesday night. The issue
began to resurface this week, when Danny Coulson, a former senior
FBI official in Texas, told The Dallas Morning News that
pyrotechnic grenades had indeed been used.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law enforcement officials backed up his recollections.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They said a continuing investigation by the Texas Rangers had
turned up evidence of the use of the M-651s. And a review of
internal FBI documents supported the Texas findings, bureau
spokesmen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Denials by the FBI and the Justice Department that tear-gas use
could have caused the fire have been consistent from the time of
the siege. Just 10 days after the fire, Reno told the House
Judiciary Committee: ``I wanted and received assurances that the
gas and its means of use were not pyrotechnic. I was concerned
about intentional or accidental explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked on July 29 at a news conference about the Texas
Rangers' investigation and the fire, Reno said, ``I have gone over
everything, and I know of no such evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FBI restores its credibility on the episode, it will
remain one of the saddest chapters in its history and in that of
the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1993, the Branch Davidians were little known outside
Texas. In summer 1992, the ATF in Texas began an investigation into
rumors that members were stockpiling illegal weapons and
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   After an undercover operation run from a small house across from
the cult's property, the ATF decided to search the cult property
and arrest Koresh. On Feb. 28, 1993, a force of 76 ATF agents
stormed the compound, touching off a fierce gun battle that killed
four federal agents and two cult members.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI then took control of the situation, and the compound was
under siege for 51 days. Negotiations were fruitless, and the
bureau decided to break the siege on April 19. After the
unsuccessful, and until now largely unknown, use of the pyrotechnic
gas grenades, as well as the use of more conventional gas
canisters, a tank was brought in to puncture the wood building and
force gas inside it. Shots were heard inside the buildings before
flames and smoke towered over the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators found evidence that gasoline, charcoal
lighter fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the wooden
structure, and they said that the fire appeared to have started in
three places. The FBI also cited evidence from listening devices
that included recordings of Davidians discussing plans for a fire
just hours before the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee later criticized the
Treasury Department and the ATF in particular, concluding that the
bureau had shown gross incompetence. It also criticized Reno and
the FBI, saying they should have known that a ``violent and perhaps
suicidal reaction'' might be touched off.

FIRST IT WAS BLEACH; TATTOO COULD BE NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ TCU punter Royce Huffman has performed his
devious magic again.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the last day of two-a-day practices, Huffman exacted
a promise from coach Dennis Franchione that if the Horned Frogs win
the Western Athletic Conference championship this season Franchione
will get a tattoo.
</P>
<P>
   During two-a-days last year, Huffman talked Franchione into
agreeing to bleach his hair if TCU went to a bowl game. One Sun
Bowl-berth later, Franchione's salt-and-pepper locks were blond.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Franchione looked to be escaping this two-a-days
without any such promises.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been on the case,'' said Huffman, whose arrival at
two-a-days was delayed because he was playing baseball in the
Houston Astros' minor-league system. ``He said he'd get a permanent
tattoo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa, we never said anything about permanent,'' Franchione
said.
</P>
<P>
   Huffman and Franchione are still debating the permanency of the
tattoo. But if the WAC is won, there will be a tattoo of some sort.
GAME PLAN BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs began introducing their game plan for Arizona, which
plays at TCU on Sept. 5, during two-a-days.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione faced Arizona in the Insight.com Bowl while at New
Mexico in 1997, and he remembers the special problems the Wildcats
present with their less-than-conventional defense. They play their
middle linebacker between the two tackles less than a yard behind
the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real good linebacker with real good quickness and a lot
of experience,'' Horned Frogs center Jeff Garner said. ``The first
couple of plays we need not to be so aggressive and see how he is
playing. Then as the game goes on, you get more comfortable and get
in a groove. Then, you can start going after him more, get in his
face and get more aggressive.'' `GREEDY' FOR NEW STYLE
</P>
<P>
   When Edwin ``Greedy'' Daniels attended a sociology class at 8
a.m. Wednesday, he officially became a member of the Horned Frogs
basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made sure I was official early,'' Daniels joked.
</P>
<P>
   Daniels, who played guard for Nevada-Las Vegas last season,
announced his decision to transfer to TCU last week. He said UNLV's
style of play didn't mesh with his abilities, whereas TCU's does.
He averaged 7.4 points, 3.3 assists and 2.4 steals last season.
Daniels said UNLV coach Bill Bayno suggested TCU might be a good
fit for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew how I played in high school, and they thought it
would be a good decision,'' Daniels said. ``TCU fits my style and
my style of play. And I love Coach (Billy) Tubbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniels said he also considered Mississippi State, Fresno State,
Connecticut and Maryland. He must sit out this season but will be
eligible for the 2000-01 season. He will have two years of
eligibility remaining. BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ TCU women's basketball coach Jeff Mittie said Wednesday he has
hired two assistant coaches. Larry Tidwell spent six seasons as an
assistant at Baylor, and Lonnette Hall coached with Mittie at
Arkansas State for three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ TCU offensive lineman J.T. Aughinbaugh hyperextended his left
knee in practice Wednesday and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Frogs had 20 more players walk on Wednesday, including
Jordan Porter from Aledo and Clay McNutt, Matt Scratchard and Jon
Edmonson from Carroll High School.

   WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS No. 1 Houston Comets (26-6) vs. No. 2
Los Angeles Sparks (20-12) Best-of-three series begins at 7:30
tonight, Great Western Forum, Los Angeles TV: ESPN Game 2: 3 p.m.
Sunday in Houston, KXAS/Channel 5 Game 3: 9 p.m. Monday in Houston,
ESPN _if necessary Season series: 2-2 How they got here: Comets
owned Western Conference's best regular-season record; Sparks
defeated Sacramento, 71-58, in the first round Tuesday By the
numbers 57.3: Combined scoring average of Houston's Sheryl Swoopes,
Tina Thompson and Cynthia Cooper in four games against Los Angeles.
6: Number of losses LA has suffered in its past seven road games;
the current streak is four. Key matchups Houston G Cynthia Cooper
(22.1 ppg., 2.8 rpg., 5.2 apg.) vs. Los Angeles G Mwadi Mabika
(10.8 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 3.5 apg). Cooper led the league in scoring
again and makes life miserable for any defender. Houston C Polina
Tzekova (6.1 ppg, 5.1 rpg) vs. Los Angeles C Lisa Leslie (15.6 ppg,
7.8 rpg). Leslie averaged 15 points and 8.3 rebounds in the season
series and needs to continue that streak for the Sparks to win.
What to watch: LA outshot Houston in the season series but
committed three more turnovers per game. Leslie and DeLisha Milton
can match Swoopes and Cooper as well as any duo in the league.
However, don't be surprised if Thompson doubles on Leslie in an
attempt to limit the LA center around the basket. Prediction: The
Sparks have the league's best chance to pull the upset against
Houston, and they will win one game before falling in three.
EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS No. 1 New York Liberty (18-14) vs. No. 3
Charlotte Sting (15-17) Best-of-three series begins at 7 p.m.
tomorrow, Charlotte Coliseum, Charlotte, N.C. TV: Lifetime Game 2:
7 p.m. Sunday, New York, Lifetime Game 3: 7 p.m. Monday, New York,
ESPN _if necessary Season series: 2-2 How they got here: New York
owned the East's best regular-season record; Charlotte defeated
Detroit, 60-54, in the first round Tuesday By the numbers 12-3:
Charlotte's record when leading at the half 15-1: The Liberty's
record when outshooting opponents Key matchups New York C Kym
Hampton (9.2 ppg., 5.6 rpg.) vs. Charlotte C Rhonda Mapp (9.5 ppg.,
6.4 rpg.) Hampton, who is retiring after the season, will need
defensive help to stop Mapp, who averaged 11.3 points and 9.7
rebounds in the season series. New York G Teresa Weatherspoon (7.2
ppg., 6.1 apg.) vs. G Dawn Staley (11.5 ppg., 5.5 apg.) Four years
ago this matchup of former Olympians would have been one of the
best guard matchups ever. Neither is the scorer they used to be,
but are two of the game's most mature ballhandlers. What to watch:
For Charlotte to have any chance, G Andrea Stinson must maintain
her recent surge and try to better her 14-point average she posted
against the Liberty. If she produces the way she did against
Detroit in the first round Tuesday (16 points, 14 rebounds, 5
steals), the Sting could go to New York up 1-0. Prediction: New
York's starting five is deeper than Charlotte's; Liberty prevails
in two games. nn

 HUNTE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A self-described bounty hunter who shot and killed a young
couple after he bashed into their west Phoenix home was spared the
death penalty Wednesday when a judge ruled Michael Martin Sanders
did not intend to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sanders, who also caused a stir recently though his
jailhouse romance with his defense attorney, will never set foot in
the ``free world'' again, vowed Judge Gregory Martin of Maricopa
County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   After calling Sanders devoid of any ``moral conscience'' and
lacking any ``intent to be law abiding,'' Martin sentenced him to
two consecutive life terms in prison for murdering Spring Wright,
20, and Christopher Foote, 23.
</P>
<P>
   Family members and friends of the victims hugged each other
after the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   But they also remain upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``He killed two people. He deserved to die,'' said Wright's
mother, Melody Mueller. ``He'd probably still be out doing this if
he hadn't been shot at.''
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Foote, Chris' sister-in-law, said she hopes Sanders
``burns in hell for what he did to our family.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris' father, Tom Foote, was more generous.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we know where he's going to be the rest of his
life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also imposed an additional 99 years' imprisonment on
Sanders for 11 other crimes related to the killings, including
armed robbery and aggravated assault.
</P>
<P>
   Four other men accompanied Sanders. Two await trials. Two have
entered guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors insist the bounty-hunting argument is just a ruse.
They say the break-in was really a robbery that went sour.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Foote and Wright were rousted awake when hooded men
in black military garb and bulletproof vests burst into their
modest home in August 1997. The men terrorized several adults and
children in the home, placing two adults in plastic handcuffs and
hitting one woman in the head with a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   Foote, who was sleeping in a back bedroom with his girlfriend,
Wright, woke to men shouting, ``Bail enforcement! Bail
enforcement!,'' according to court testimony. Foote grabbed for a
gun at his bedside and began shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders fired back.
</P>
<P>
   Martin called Sanders' actions ``senseless'' and ``horrible.''
But under the law, he could not justify a death sentence, he said.
When Sanders and the others broke into the couple's home in the
middle of the night, their intent was to rob, not kill, the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bail absconder whom Sanders and the others claimed they were
looking for was not in the house that night. In fact, his
bail-recovery papers had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders and the others, including a getaway driver who waited
outside listening to a police scanner, wanted to make ``big money''
ripping off drug dealers, prosecutors said at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed in the judge's decision (against the
death penalty), especially in light of the fact these crimes were
committed under the color of the law, saying they were bounty
hunters,'' said Bill FitzGerald of the County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Wednesday's two-hour hearing, Sanders smiled and
whispered frequently to his attorney, Carmen Fischer. Fischer has
had a sexual relationship with Sanders during and after his murder
trial. Their relationship came to light when jailhouse detention
officers reported seeing Sanders and Fischer kissing and touching
each other in visiting rooms.
</P>
<P>
   When Sanders was called to stand before the judge to hear his
sentence Wednesday, he continued to whisper to Fischer. At one
point, he winked at her.
</P>
<P>
   His mood changed when he described his shootout with Foote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Chris several times to show me his hands and put the
gun down,'' Sanders said.
</P>
<P>
   When Foote started shooting, Sanders dropped to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was flat on my back and then, and only then, did I return
fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders denied prosecutors' assertions that he has never shown
remorse for the killings. He said he did not know Wright was next
to Foote until he was at a hospital being treated for bullet
wounds. A nurse mentioned that two people were killed in the
shooting, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a punch in the gut,'' said Sanders, 42. ``I was
absolutely devastated.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused three times while reading his statement, appearing to
choke back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm brokenhearted over Spring's death,'' he said. ``To openly
show my sorrow is undignified. It's not the way I was raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders did not apologize to the two dozen family members
sitting in the gallery, including Wright's mother, who dabbed
constantly at the tears rolling down her face.
</P>
<P>
   Attending in support of Sanders were his mother-in-law and his
young son. The tow-headed little boy called out in a loud whisper,
``Hi, Daddy,'' when Sanders was brought into the courtroom in
jailhouse stripes, handcuffs and ankle chains.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the boy said, ``I'm tired,'' and promptly fell
asleep in his grandmother's lap. He woke up in time to wave goodbye
as his father was led out of the courtroom in shackles.
</P>
<P>
   The killings, two years of court proceedings and publicity
generated by Sanders' relationship with his lawyer have devastated
the families, Tom Foote said.
</P>
<P>
   Children and teenagers from both families have trouble sleeping,
are afraid to sleep alone and will not answer the door anymore,
court records say. Several of the adults also have trouble
sleeping. And Wright's mother told court officials she abused
alcohol and prescription drugs for a period after the killings.
</P>
<P>
   They now must endure the trials of David Brackney, 46, and his
son, Matthew Brackney, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jay Robbins, 29, and Ronald Eugene Timms, in his late 20s,
have pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and burglary.
</P>
<P>
   The Brackneys have said they believed they were on a legitimate
bounty-hunting mission that night. &QL;

HIJACKING OF MOROCCAN JET ENDS IN SPAIN WITH PASSENGERS UNHURT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ A French-speaking man hijacked a Moroccan
airliner with 88 people aboard late Wednesday after it left
Casablanca en route to Tunisia but surrendered early Thursday in
Barcelona, where he had diverted the plane and demanded fuel to fly
to Frankfurt, Spanish officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The airliner, Royal Air Maroc Flight 0572, bound for Tunis, was
carrying 79 passengers and nine crew members.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacker told the pilot of the Boeing 737 that he had a gun,
officials said, and forced him to fly north across the
Mediterranean to Barcelona's El Prat airport, landing about 10:50
p.m. Wednesday. Security forces took up positions near the plane,
which taxied to a runway some distance from the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15 a.m. Thursday, the hijacker surrendered to a government
negotiator who was allowed to board the plane, said Eduardo
Planells, a government official in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Planells said the passenger list seemed to indicate that the
plane was full of people of Arabic origin, but he could not confirm
news reports that all aboard were from Morocco, Tunisia and Gabon.
</P>
<P>
   Officials initially thought there were three hijackers, because
two people were seen looking out of the rear of the plane after it
arrived in Barcelona. Later, they determined there was just one
hijacker, Planells said.
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials said they did not immediately know the
motive or nationality of the hijacker, who spoke only French to the
Spanish authorities.

   Early Thursday morning, the hijacker was under arrest in
Barcelona, and the passengers were gathered inside the airport
terminal. Authorities double-checked their identities to insure
that there were no other hijackers hiding among them, Planells
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and Interior Minister Jaime
Mayor Oreja were awakened in the night; both were on vacation in
Spain. Mayor Oreja was monitoring the situation.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis team composed of top police and government officials in
Barcelona, an interpreter and psychologists was assembled at the
Barcelona airport and negotiated directly with the hijacker.

   TOMBSTONE _ The Rev. Victoria Collins still can't believe it
happened here on Toughnut Street, where many a man has lost his
life in a barroom brawl over a woman.
</P>
<P>
   On July 6, Collins unwittingly hitched two women in the
courtyard of her bed and breakfast and chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they did present Collins with a marriage certificate
issued at Cochise County offices in Bisbee earlier in the day. The
groom, Aida Lopez, 20, wore a loose shirt and manly vest. The
bride, Brianna Thomas, also 20, was carrying a 2-week-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   They kissed and pledged to honor and cherish each other as
Thomas' parents lovingly looked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see any boobs on her,'' Collins said of Lopez. ``It
didn't look like she had any disguises on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez had more than a little interesting background.
</P>
<P>
   She was about to start serving at least five years in prison for
robbing and kidnapping an elderly Sierra Vista couple. Lopez also
had married a Sierra Vista man last year, that time as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the only matter that has tongues wagging in the
Town Too Tough to Die.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a judge pro tem in nearby Sierra Vista, Ann S. Lund,
married what turned out to be two men, Richard Edgar and Tiffany
Edgar, who's undergoing treatments to become a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The Cochise County Attorney's Office is investigating possible
criminal charges in both cases because state law prohibits same-sex
marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Fraud charges are being considered in the Lopez-Thomas case
because Lopez had signed a space indicating that she was a male on
the marriage certificate. Lopez also could be charged with bigamy
because court records indicate she's not divorced from her first
husband.
</P>
<P>
   The Edgars also could be charged with fraud, because Tiffany had
signed a blank on the marriage license intended for brides. The
Edgars filed for divorce in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing shocked my gizzard,'' said Ben Harrison, 77,
a tour guide at the Bird Cage Theatre in Tombstone. ``It's the
weirdest darn thing I've heard in my life. This whole thing is
against God and every other thing I know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Darris took a break from tending to her OK Corral curios at
the neighboring Dawn Dee Gift Store.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some screwy people in the head down here and I don't
like that a bit,'' Darris said.
</P>
<P>
   As far as county records are concerned, Richard Edward Edgar,
26, a male, married Tiffany Edgar, 43, a female, in Sierra Vista on
March 5.
</P>
<P>
   Let Richard tell the rest of the story.
</P>
<P>
   He was living in Daytona Beach, Fla., in the early 1990s and met
a male drag queen named Clayo F. Gallihue Jr. in a bar. They
immediately hit it off and had a relationship, although Richard
says he isn't gay.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Gallihue had designs on being a woman, changed
his name to Tiffany Edgar shortly thereafter and started taking
estrogen treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Which definitely was cool with Richard, who said he was looking
for a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The Edgars moved to Sierra Vista last year. That's when
Richard's mother, Pat Lyons, met the bride-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   ``She looked like a woman to me,'' Lyons said. ``I thought they
were in love and I never questioned any of this. Heck, I was even
maid of honor at the wedding. But it turns out that she was a he,
and I'm still in shock over this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Richard thought he was marrying a woman, even
though one male vestige remained.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany isn't saying what she thinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing about any of this. I have no comment,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez and Thomas, the two married women, couldn't be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cochise County court documents, Superior Court
Clerk Denise Lundin learned Aug. 11, on a tip from a county health
worker, that she had issued a marriage certificate to two women.
</P>
<P>
   ``She (Thomas) told me twice, `I married a man,' '' Lundin
wrote. ``She also said that her friends had mentioned to her that
her husband had a female's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it odd, though, that she was very interested in the
law against same-sex marriages and asked me several questions about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Collins, the Tombstone minister who said she conducts more
than 100 marriages a year, said court officials weren't the only
ones taken for a ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been to drag queen shows in San Francisco,'' she said.
``I've seen the best. In this case, you just couldn't tell.'' &QL;

KINGS, BERG NEAR AGREEMENT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The year-long contract dispute between the
Los Angeles Kings and talented young defenseman Aki Berg might be
close to a resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Petri Lehto, a close friend of Berg's, said Wednesday that the
22-year-old Finn _ who spent last season playing in his homeland _
is willing to accept a one-year contract worth $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kings general manager Dave Taylor, meanwhile, expressed a
willingness to sign Berg to a one-year deal, and sounded more
optimistic that Berg will rejoin the team than he has at any point
in the last 12 months. Berg previously has threatened to sign this
season with a team in Sweden, but both sides said it's not
impossible that Berg could be under contract by the time training
camp begins in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor declined to say how much the Kings were willing to pay on
a one-year deal, but an NHL source said the team's offer is in the
neighborhood of $750,000. In other words, the gap appears to be no
greater than $150,000, a pittance in modern sports economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's clear that both parties would like to get a
contract done, and that is, in fact, a change,'' said Berg's agent,
Larry Kelly. ``At this time last year, Aki was very comfortable
with his decision to stay in Finland.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said: ``In the end, we'll probably do something on a
one-year basis. I think it's important for him to get over here and
play this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor also is trying to sign two other key players, defenseman
Mattias Norstrom and right wing Glen Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Norstrom, 27, earned $950,000 last year, was an all-star for the
first time and is the defense partner of the team's captain, Rob
Blake. Norstrom's agent, Don Meehan, said he made a contract
proposal to the Kings recently and is expecting to hear from
assistant general manager Kevin Gilmore by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor: ``(Norstrom) is a very good defensive defenseman, a very
good person, he provides leadership, he comes to play every night.
We'd like to get a deal done.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said the Kings also would like to wrap up negotiations
with the 26-year-old Murray, who had 16 goals and 31 points in 60
games last season. Murray was off to the best start of his career
when he suffered a knee injury in January that sidelined him for
nearly two months and limited his effectiveness in the season's
final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, looking from the beginning of the 1997-98
season through his injury, we believe he was the best forward on
the team during a period of 120 games,'' said Murray's agent, Anton
Thun. ``Realistically, the only forwards you could argue may have
been better at various periods of time were Jozef Stumpel and Luc
Robitaille, but in that time, Glen Murray was probably the best
forward on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray earned $675,000 last season, Stumpel $1.6 million and
Robitaille $3.5 million. Thun said he wasn't expecting the Kings to
match the salary of Robitaille, who has scored more than 400 career
goals more than Murray. But it's safe to say Thun is expecting the
Kings to give a healthy raise to a player expected to be their
second-line right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jason Podollan also remains without a contract.

MARION JONES FALLS, LOSES CHANCE FOR MULTIPLE GOLD MEDALS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones' bid for a sweep of the 100 and
200 meters at the world track and field championships ended in
agony Wednesday, and the rest of her season could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has already won the 100 meters, clutched her lower
back and crumbled onto the track, grimacing in pain as she raced
toward the finish line in the 200-meter semifinal. She lay
motionless until she was carried off the field on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' husband, shot putter C.J. Hunter, was watching from the
stands and slammed his fist in disgust after Jones went down.
Hunter rushed to the track to be by her side.
</P>
<P>
   The budding superstar from Thousand Oaks High just west of Los
Angeles suffered back spasms and cramps, a statement from USA Track
&AMP; Field said.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two hours of therapy in the medical center,
Jones walked gingerly out of the stadium under her own power.
</P>
<P>
   Normally outgoing, she refused to comment and headed to her
hotel to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply affected by the injury ... and I am sure that
millions of fans around the world share this sentiment,'' said IAAF
President Primo Nebiolo. ``I am sure Marion will face this
difficult moment with courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 23, was seeking an unprecedented four gold medals at the
world championships. She twice lowered the championships record in
the 100 meters on the way to her second consecutive world title,
winning the final in 10.70 seconds Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, she placed third in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 200, Jones was planning to run in either the
400- or 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the chance for multiple gold medals, the injury could
cost Jones financially. She is one of four athletes still in the
running for the $1million jackpot given by the International
Amateur Athletics Foundation for going undefeated in the Golden
League series. The injury already has cost her $60,000 awarded to
event winners at the world championships. Also at stake for Jones
is a share of $80,000 as a member of a championship relay team.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred in the second semifinal of the 200. Jones,
running in lane 3, was third behind Jamaica's Merlene Frazier and
Debbie Ferguson on the curve. Halfway down the straightaway, she
grimaced in pain for several strides before grabbing the left side
of her lower back and falling to the track.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes have complained about running so often on the hard
Mondo track and the risk of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate but I think she will be fine,'' said Kevin
Little, one of two American men to qualify for the 200-meter final
along with Maurice Greene. ``It just goes to show you how tough the
conditions are, the hard track and the heat.''

&HT;     HARLEM'S POLITICAL LEADERSHIP TURNS AGAINST PLANNED YOUTH
MARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 10th graf to correct Muhammad quote.)  (js) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leading a wave of condemnation among the city's black
politicians, Rep.e Charles B. Rangel, Harlem's most powerful
political figure, Wednesday called for a boycott of a planned youth
rally, saying racially charged speeches and violent clashes with
the police at last year's rally proved that ``it is impossible for
any good'' to come out of the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hoped last year if there was an increase in the kids
coming, the good would overcome the hatred of the organizers,''
Rangel said at a news conference in Harlem with Councilman Bill
Perkins, who reported that he was assaulted on Monday by organizers
of the rally, called the Million Youth March. ``But after the
events of last year, we would not encourage anyone to get involved
in the event.''
</P>
<P>
   Other prominent black politicians came forward Wednesday to
condemn both the march and its organizers. The statements marked a
shift among the city's black leaders, who last year condemned the
leader of the march, Khallid Abdul Muhammad, for his derogatory
remarks about Jews and whites, but grudgingly accepted the event as
a way to mobilize young blacks and in some cases even encouraged
them to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright of Harlem, who last year tried to
mediate between march organizers and city officials, issued a
statement Wednesday under the headline, ``Enough is Enough _ Why
the Million Youth March Should Not Take Place in Harlem.''
</P>
<P>
   State Comptroller H.Carl McCall, the only black holding
statewide office, said in a statement Wednesday: ``I cannot abide
by Khallid Muhammad's evil message, and I cannot support his
march.''
</P>
<P>
   And C.Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president who
earlier this week spurned a plea for assistance from march
organizers, issued an appeal for all residents to ``douse'' the
``flames of divisiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts to isolate Muhammad were driven by outrage over last
year's rally _ which resulted in injuries to 14 participants and 16
police officers _ and by anger at the treatment of Perkins, a
Harlem Democrat who said supporters of Muhammad surrounded him at a
political event on Monday night and shouted, ``We are going to kill
Uncle Toms like you.'' Perkins, who said he was considering
pressing charges, was offered police protection by Commissioner
Howard Safir during a meeting Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a raucous news conference outside the Apollo Theater in
Harlem Wednesday night, as his supporters mixed threats toward
white reporters with chants of ``Black Power,'' Muhammad and other
organizers said the boycott calls did not reflect popular sentiment
in the community, and they accused black political leaders of
pandering to whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the black elected officials are so far removed
from their own constituents that they are afraid to stand up for
the people,'' said Shaunette Daniels, a spokeswoman for the march.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad again denied that his supporters had assaulted Perkins,
but then added: ``Bill Perkins is my brother and he is a member of
the black nation, but he is a Tom that bootlicks'' white people.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad has yet to secure a city permit for the rally, which is
scheduled for Sept. 4 along the section of Lenox Avenue known as
Malcolm X Boulevard. In their latest request to city officials, the
rally's organizers have said that, starting at 11 a.m., they want
to march from 135th Street to 118th Street, and then conduct a
program of educational speeches from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. between 118th
and 124th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad vowed Wednesday to march with or without a permit,
warning that there ``will be a state of emergency in Harlem'' if
the Police Department attempts to block the event.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference Wednesday, Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani denounced the organizers as ``reprehensible,'' but
declined to say whether the city will issue a permit. Instead, he
blamed the news media for paying too much attention to Muhammad and
his organization, the New Black Panther Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are creating them,'' he chided reporters. ``They don't
have support. They don't have political support, they don't have
social support, they don't have support in the community. And by
constantly focusing on them, you are creating them, and I want to
say as little as possible to give them attention.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the public criticism, Giuliani's aides have been
quietly negotiating for weeks with Muhammad's lawyers over the
terms of a rally.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Connolly, the city attorney handling the negotiations,
declined to discuss his conversations with the rally's lawyers.
Connolly, however, has told march organizers that the city will
abide by a federal appeals court's decision last year that allowed
the youth rally to assemble for four hours on six blocks of Malcolm
X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says that the city is prepared to adhere to that
decision,'' said Jomo Thomas, a lawyer for the rally's organizers.
Thomas said the city's Corporation Counsel, Michael D. Hess, spoke
with the organizers Wednesday afternoon and said he hoped to avoid
another court battle.

FBI ADMITS IT USED HEAT-GENERATING DEVICES AT 1993 WACO DEBACLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change 24 to 25 in 3rd graf. No other changes.)  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI backed away from six years of unqualified
denials to Congress and the public Wednesday and conceded that it
used ``pyrotechnic'' tear-gas canisters on the final day of the
1993 standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said the devices were ``pyrotechnic'' only in a
limited sense and bounced harmlessly off a concrete structure six
hours before the compound's main building, built of wood, erupted
in flames.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 people, including 25 children, were found dead after
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   But the revelation, after repeated staunch denials, that federal
agents used pyrotechnic devices of any definition was deemed so
serious that Attorney General Janet Reno and FBI Director Louis
Freeh on Wednesday night ordered an exhaustive inquiry into the
events of April 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 FBI agents have been assigned to the review, and
everyone who was at Waco that day will be re-interviewed, said John
Collingwood, a bureau spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to believe that law enforcement did not start the
fire,'' Collingwood said. But there were clear signs Wednesday
evening that the backtracking had spawned a serious credibility
crisis for the FBI and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new information requires a thorough investigation of
whether the Justice Department has misled the American people, and
the Congress, about what happened at Waco,'' Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind., who heads the Committee on Government Reform, said
Wednesday night in a statement. ``I intend for the Government
Reform Committee to get to the bottom of this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's committee, along with the House Judiciary Committee,
held hearings in 1996 on the Waco incident that were scathingly
critical of the Justice Department, the FBI and Reno as well as of
the Treasury Department and its Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, which had a confrontation with the Branch Davidians that
preceded the April 19 assault. But the lawmakers said there was no
indication that the FBI had caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., said Wednesday night that he applauded
Burton's stand. ``Was there testimony to the Congress that was
knowingly wrong?'' Barr said in a telephone interview. He, too,
called for congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Another FBI spokesman said earlier Wednesday that the devices in
question were ``pyrotechnic'' only in a limited sense _ that is,
that they generated heat even as they dispensed tear gas. He said
they were fired at the concrete ``bunker'' about 100 yards from the
main wood structure after less potent tear gas canisters failed to
pierce the concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The federal agents wanted to get tear gas into the bunker
because they feared the Davidians would try to escape through a
tunnel between it and the wooden building, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The two pyrotechnic devices, military-type gas canisters known
as M-651 grenades and fired by an FBI agent from a range of about
40 yards, also bounded off the bunker roof and into a nearby
puddle, where they lay harmlessly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After flames consumed the wood building, the remains of the cult
leader, David Koresh, and his followers were found. Autopsies
showed that some had died of self-inflicted gunshot wounds, others
from the flames or smoke. A few escaped.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI spokesmen, while insisting that there is no new
information to challenge the finding that the Davidians themselves
started the fire, acknowledged Wednesday night that the necessity
to ``recant and modify'' earlier statements was acutely
embarrassing to the FBI. Asked if he thought there had been a
coverup, one spokesman replied, ``absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno came under heavy criticism immediately after the raid, but
then regained respect as she accepted responsibility and answered
questions with seeming candor. Her credibility and that of the FBI
are at stake with the disclosures about the use of the
military-type gas grenades. Freeh was not the FBI director at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about the two pyrotechnic canisters were first carried
by The Dallas Morning News this week based on an interview with a
former senior FBI official.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of force used by federal agents on April 19, 1993,
could be critical in a wrongful-death suit filed by some Branch
Davidian survivors and relatives of the dead and scheduled to open
on Oct. 18. Some plaintiffs are represented by former Attorney
General Ramsey Clark. And the question of whether the FBI used
pyrotechnic devices has been the subject of a separate inquiry by
the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   But the FBI and Justice Department are far more worried that the
recantation will fuel the suspicions of people who have long
doubted the federal government's motives and actions in the
incident. ``We're fighting the conspiracy theorists,'' one bureau
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A former soldier, Timothy McVeigh, was so enraged by the
incident at Waco that he bombed the Federal Building in Oklahoma
City on April 19, 1995, killing 168 people, according to evidence
at his trial. Prosecutors said he chose the second anniversary of
the Waco incident for symbolic vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI explained Wednesday night that on April 19, 1993, a
bureau agent was driven to within 40 yards of the Davidians'
concrete bunker in an Army Bradley fighting vehicle, then fired the
two military canisters. He was 100 yards away at the time and was
firing away from the wood structure, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
   The unsuccessful use of those two canisters was noted in
documents at the time, the bureau said Wednesday night. The issue
began to resurface this week, when Danny Coulson, a former senior
FBI official in Texas, told The Dallas Morning News that
pyrotechnic grenades had indeed been used.
</P>
<P>
   Texas law enforcement officials backed up his recollections.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   They said a continuing investigation by the Texas Rangers had
turned up evidence of the use of the M-651s. And a review of
internal FBI documents supported the Texas findings, bureau
spokesmen said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Denials by the FBI and the Justice Department that tear-gas use
could have caused the fire have been consistent from the time of
the siege. Just 10 days after the fire, Reno told the House
Judiciary Committee: ``I wanted and received assurances that the
gas and its means of use were not pyrotechnic. I was concerned
about intentional or accidental explosions.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked on July 29 at a news conference about the Texas
Rangers' investigation and the fire, Reno said, ``I have gone over
everything, and I know of no such evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the FBI restores its credibility on the episode, it will
remain one of the saddest chapters in its history and in that of
the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1993, the Branch Davidians were little known outside
Texas. In summer 1992, the ATF in Texas began an investigation into
rumors that members were stockpiling illegal weapons and
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   After an undercover operation run from a small house across from
the cult's property, the ATF decided to search the cult property
and arrest Koresh. On Feb. 28, 1993, a force of 76 ATF agents
stormed the compound, touching off a fierce gun battle that killed
four federal agents and two cult members.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI then took control of the situation, and the compound was
under siege for 51 days. Negotiations were fruitless, and the
bureau decided to break the siege on April 19. After the
unsuccessful, and until now largely unknown, use of the pyrotechnic
gas grenades, as well as the use of more conventional gas
canisters, a tank was brought in to puncture the wood building and
force gas inside it. Shots were heard inside the buildings before
flames and smoke towered over the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators found evidence that gasoline, charcoal
lighter fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the wooden
structure, and they said that the fire appeared to have started in
three places. The FBI also cited evidence from listening devices
that included recordings of Davidians discussing plans for a fire
just hours before the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The House Government Reform Committee later criticized the
Treasury Department and the ATF in particular, concluding that the
bureau had shown gross incompetence. It also criticized Reno and
the FBI, saying they should have known that a ``violent and perhaps
suicidal reaction'' might be touched off.

3 COPPER CONCERNS JOCKEY IN MERGER DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Ariz., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two copper companies in the midst of a merger said Wednesday
that they were willing to discuss being taken over by Phelps Dodge
Corp., one of the world's largest mining companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies, Asarco Inc., based in New York, and Cyprus
Amax Minerals of Englewood, Colo., demanded a 25 percent premium
Wednesday to the original offer of $2.66 billion from Phelps Dodge,
which they had immediately rejected last week.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge called the new proposal ``totally unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued at its headquarters in Phoenix, Phelps
Dodge said it would review the Asarco and Cyprus proposal, but said
it believed that its original offer was ``fully priced.''
</P>
<P>
   As a condition to discussions, the two companies also said that
Phelps Dodge would have to take responsibility for any ``antitrust
problems'' that might develop in a three-way combination.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the latest offer was a
sincere invitation to discuss combining forces or a ploy to fend
off Phelps Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   But in what appeared to be an effort to dampen criticism by
investors of the combination of Asarco and Cyprus Amax alone, the
chief executives of the companies, Francis McAllister of Asarco and
Milton Ward of Cyprus Amax, said they planned to make a special
payment of $5 a share to stockholders of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint statement, McAllister and Ward said the Phelps Dodge
offer ``fails to reward our stockholders for the values derived
from the Asarco-Cyprus transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   They said their demand for $3.33 billion for the two companies
``gives recognition to the fact that our shareholders would be
contributing approximately 50 percent to the value of a three-way
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge said the Asarco-Cyprus Amax proposal ``would
deliver nearly all of the economic value of the three-way
combination to Asarco and Cyprus shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising questions about the tactics of Asarco and Cyprus Amax,
Douglas Yearley, the chief executive of Phelps Dodge, said that if
they were ``not just posturing, we would be more than willing to
begin real discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Neither company has attempted to sit down with us.''
</P>
<P>
   One mining expert said that ``almost no takeovers in this
industry are executed on the first bid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost invariably, if agreement is reached,'' he said, ``it is
with some bartering. The first offer is usually unacceptably low
and the counteroffer unacceptably high. I would expect this process
to go on for sometime.''
 &UR;  &LR;  If the three-way deal goes through, it would create a company
that would surpass Chile's state-owned Codelco as the world's top
copper producer and would unite production in the copper-rich
American Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The world copper market is now being flooded with copper from
Chile and Indonesia, where mining costs are lower and mines are
newer. Many analysts expect that copper prices, which have plunged
in recent years, will remain relatively flat for the foreseeable
future. Cooper has been trading at about 70 to 75 cents a pound,
the lowest levels in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The jockeying among Phelps Dodge and the two other companies is
part of a larger trend involving all basic commodities including
aluminum, chemicals and oils. Commodity giants have been pairing up
to gain market share and reduce costs in response to a surplus of
raw materials as well as declining demand.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the world's largest aluminum maker, Alcoa Inc., said
it was acquiring Reynolds Metals. That came on the heels of a
three-way, trans-Atlantic merger to unite Canadian, Swiss and
French aluminum makers into a giant competitor to Alcoa.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge made its bid to take over the two companies last
week in two stages. Early in the day it offered $2.4 billion. Then
a few hours later it sweetened the deal to $2.66 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, all in stock, was based on a Phelps Dodge closing
price on Aug. 20 of $59.125. Phelps Dodge's top offer was
calculated to give 0.3135 of a Phelps Dodge share for every share
of Cyprus Amax and 0.4098 share of Phelps Dodge for every share of
Asarco share.
</P>
<P>
   In the counterproposal, the two companies increased the ratio to
0.4055 a share of Phelps Dodge for a share of Cyprus Amax and
0.5330 a share of Phelps Dodge for a share of Asarco. At $57.625,
the closing price of Phelps Dodge Wednesday, the total at the
higher price would come to $3.33 billion.

MARION JONES FALLS, LOSES CHANCE FOR MULTIPLE GOLD MEDALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones' bid for a sweep of the 100 and
200 meters at the world track and field championships ended in
agony Wednesday, and the rest of her season could be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has already won the 100 meters, clutched her lower
back and crumbled onto the track, grimacing in pain as she raced
toward the finish line in the 200-meter semifinal. She lay
motionless until she was carried off the field on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' husband, shot putter C.J. Hunter, was watching from the
stands and slammed his fist in disgust after Jones went down.
Hunter rushed to the track to be by her side.
</P>
<P>
   The budding superstar from Thousand Oaks High just west of Los
Angeles suffered back spasms and cramps, a statement from USA Track
&AMP; Field said.
</P>
<P>
   After more than two hours of therapy in the medical center,
Jones walked gingerly out of the stadium under her own power.
</P>
<P>
   Normally outgoing, she refused to comment and headed to her
hotel to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply affected by the injury ... and I am sure that
millions of fans around the world share this sentiment,'' said IAAF
President Primo Nebiolo. ``I am sure Marion will face this
difficult moment with courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 23, was seeking an unprecedented four gold medals at the
world championships. She twice lowered the championships record in
the 100 meters on the way to her second consecutive world title,
winning the final in 10.70 seconds Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, she placed third in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 200, Jones was planning to run in either the
400- or 1,600-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the chance for multiple gold medals, the injury could
cost Jones financially. She is one of four athletes still in the
running for the $1million jackpot given by the International
Amateur Athletics Foundation for going undefeated in the Golden
League series. The injury already has cost her $60,000 awarded to
event winners at the world championships. Also at stake for Jones
is a share of $80,000 as a member of a championship relay team.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred in the second semifinal of the 200. Jones,
running in lane 3, was third behind Jamaica's Merlene Frazier and
Debbie Ferguson on the curve. Halfway down the straightaway, she
grimaced in pain for several strides before grabbing the left side
of her lower back and falling to the track.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes have complained about running so often on the hard
Mondo track and the risk of injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate but I think she will be fine,'' said Kevin
Little, one of two American men to qualify for the 200-meter final
along with Maurice Greene. ``It just goes to show you how tough the
conditions are, the hard track and the heat.''

CALVES' TALE COMES UP TOO LEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's been a bum steer from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   The police stop a guy with five big-eyed bull calves jammed into
the trunk of a sagging Impala and every burger-busting carnivore in
Phoenix has a cow.
</P>
<P>
   And the meatheads in the press go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never received more calls of sympathy, concern and
outrage,'' said Kim Hicks of the Arizona Humane Society.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 concerned citizens contacted the animal shelter
offering money, support and sanctuary for the calves.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, flesh-eating members of the general public demanded
that authorities tan the hide of 29-year-old Juan Mora, who was
driving the car.
</P>
<P>
   And they did.
</P>
<P>
   After being grilled by police, Mora was tossed on the flaming
barbecue of the American justice system. Six felony counts now
simmer like hot coals beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, more and more the TV stations and newspapers
produced stories about the little bulls.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Humane Society's Hicks, a ``farm sanctuary'' in
California offered to accept the animals, promising safe refuge and
plenty of pasture. But that could only happen after weeks of being
nursed back to health.
</P>
<P>
   When the weakest of the five calves passed on to hamburger
heaven, the entire community mourned.
</P>
<P>
   If author E.B. White were covering the story, he would have said
the loss we felt was not the loss of veal, but the loss of calf. &QL; 
The media feasted on it. As stories go, this was filet mignon. Full
of poignant moments. Full of heartfelt expressions.
</P>
<P>
   Full of baloney.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of asking, ``Where's the beef?'' everyone in the press
steered clear of the real story, as if they were dealing with
sacred cows instead of baby bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a public patty-meltdown of enormous proportions,
reporters stuck with the happy ending for four lucky calves and
ignored the reality for thousands of others, which are sold off
legally every year to fellows like Juan Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say that bull Jersey calves have very little
value in production of agriculture,'' said Lloyd Brown,
communications manager for the state Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean, exactly?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are learning more about their lot in life now,'' said the
Humane Society's Hicks. ``People are telling us that, in reality,
dairy bulls are, in agricultural terms, a waste. Frequently,
they're sold for 50 cents to $5 a head to anybody who wants them,
for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may not be the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, from the Agriculture Department, said, ``One of the
questions posed to me by a reporter _ and we've been inundated by
reporters in the last 10 days or so _ was, `Is this unusual?'. And,
although it's unusual that we had a car with five baby calves
stuffed in the trunk, the fact that we were called out to
investigate a complaint involving baby calves probably is not that
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like this: You like milk and burgers.
</P>
<P>
   You can't have your calf and eat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (at the Humane Society) are doing what we can,'' Hicks
said. ``We're saving who we can when they're exploited, abused or
treated inhumanely. Does this mean the Humane Society is going to
take on the dairy farmers? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   What about those who purchase the calves, like Juan Mora?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he was probably going to eat them,'' she said, adding,
``but we are not going to take on the Beef Council, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, would it be the Veal Council?
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the calves has gone on for weeks, appearing in
publications all over the country. Even now, it would behoove some
news operation to step forward, take the bull by the horns and
produce a meaty expose. Unfortunately, that won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Species problem, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of the story are cattle. We're chickens. &QL;

EVEN WITH NEW PREMIER, B.C. STILL LIKELY TO FACE TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ Dan Miller was sworn in Wednesday as British
Columbia's fifth premier of the 1990s, taking what he acknowledged
is ``a fairly onerous job'' amid trying times for Canada's Pacific
province.
</P>
<P>
   The former Prince Rupert pulp mill worker has agreed to serve
only until the ruling New Democratic Party picks a permanent
replacement for controversial, confrontational Premier Glen Clark,
who resigned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia, which has deep left-right divisions, treats
politics as a blood sport _ and no place has seen more blood on the
floor than the premier's office in the west wing of Victoria's
ornate Parliament Building.
</P>
<P>
   Three premiers have been driven from office by scandals during
the 1990s. A fourth, Rita Johnston, held office for a few months in
1991 and was then voted out by residents of her own legislative
district.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says he will go out of his way not to make waves, but the
province is still likely to face months of political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats and the Liberal Party will duke it out in the
B.C. Legislature while a range of candidates maneuver for the
premier's job, which will be filled in four or five months.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into what may be the most politically risky job in
Canada, Miller, 54, said Wednesday he will not go out on any limbs,
pick any fights or singlehandedly try to run the government _ all
of which were complaints against Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's there just to make sure that the ship stays afloat,''
said Norman Ruff, a University of Victoria political scientist. It
won't be easy, he added, given the hard feelings that followed
disclosure that Clark has been under a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The province nicknamed ``lotus land'' still feels the pains of
Asia's economic downturn, downsizing that has cost 20,000 forest
industry jobs, and a slowness to embrace the information-based
economy that fueled phenomenal growth in the rest of the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   More turmoil is likely as the province's political divide
continues to preclude bipartisan problem solving.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Liberal Party _ which is conservative despite its
name _ has soared as high as 60 percent in the polls, as Clark's
support plummeted to the low teens.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberals' leader, former Vancouver Mayor Gordon
Campbell, is widely unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   He is going to extreme lengths to counter his uptight, stuffy
public image.
</P>
<P>
   This week he is climbing Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro, part of a
campaign to raise money to fight Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The stridently pro-Liberal Vancouver Sun is letting the Campbell
family write about the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats already have regained a chunk of support lost
in the wake of Clark's resignation, according to a poll released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the left-leaning party still trails far behind the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a large floating constituency in this province
that wants a progressive agenda. Our job is to bring it back
home,'' said Andrew Petter, a Cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited leadership contest is shaping up, involving at least
two of the Cabinet ministers who pushed Clark from power, as well
as Canada's only openly homosexual member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A leading candidate is Gordon Wilson, provincial finance
minister. He joined the New Democrats late last year after leading
two other parties in the British Columbia Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is a moderate and a policy wonk, whose responsibilities
have included digging B.C. Ferries out of $200 million (Canadian)
in cost overruns following Clark's effort to build three fast
catamaran ferries.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson kicks off his campaign with good news Thursday as he
releases a first quarter report showing that British Columbia's
deficit is less than projected, and that forest products firms are
recovering from the Asian flu.
</P>
<P>
   A second contender is Attorney General Ujjal Dosanj, an
Indo-Canadian who symbolizes the role of immigrants in shaping
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He has a tough-on-crime reputation and would push to sharpen
Canada's lethargic response to the upsurge in drug smuggling along
the Interstate 5 corridor.
</P>
<P>
   But Dosanj is the person who disclosed last week that Clark was
being investigated for his possible role in a neighbor's casino
application.
</P>
<P>
   A police source alleges Clark was offered, but turned down, a
bribe.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the investigation was the final controversy
that forced Clark to resign, and Clark loyalists are furious at
Dosanj for it. Clark has denied all allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A third leading contender, if she chooses to run, would be Joy
MacPhail, who quit Clark's Cabinet in July.
</P>
<P>
   As finance minister, MacPhail tried to hold down the province's
deficit but was overruled by Clark's office, which produced a
budget with a projected deficit of $812 million.
</P>
<P>
   Svend Robinson, a Federal Parliament member, also may run. A
leading headline hunter in Canadian politics, Robinson has been
arrested in environmental protests and led demonstrations against
the 1997 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Vancouver.
He recently demanded that references to God be deleted from
Canada's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who has disclosed that he is gay, brought a male
swimmer from Canada's national team as his date to the Governor
General's Ball, the highlight of Ottawa's social season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, an outside possibility is agriculture minister Corky
Evans, who settled in British Columbia as a Vietnam War draft
resister.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were first elected in 1991, the New Democrats have
nearly doubled British Columbia's park system, which now protects
more than 11 percent of the province. Over mining industry
opposition, two of the world's largest protected areas were created
in northern British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The party has also raised the minimum wage to Canada's highest,
held the line on college tuition, and offered free tuition for
adults completing their high school education.
</P>
<P>
   And Clark negotiated British Columbia's first major aboriginal
treaty, giving land and recognition that the Nisga'a Indians of
northern B.C. had sought for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   But those achievements were drowned in budget red ink. Showpiece
projects suffered huge overruns. And Clark made himself a pariah by
taking a confrontational stance on U.S.-Canada salmon treaty
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats will pick a leader (and premier) at what is
expected to be a spirited convention in December or January.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, furious faceoffs between the New Democrats and the
opposition Liberals will continue in the B.C. Legislature.

legally every year to fellows like Juan Mora.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to say that bull Jersey calves have very little
value in production of agriculture,'' said Lloyd Brown,
communications manager for the state Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   What does that mean, exactly?
</P>
<P>
   ``We are learning more about their lot in life now,'' said the
Humane Society's Hicks. ``People are telling us that, in reality,
dairy bulls are, in agricultural terms, a waste. Frequently,
they're sold for 50 cents to $5 a head to anybody who wants them,
for any reason.''
</P>
<P>
   And that may not be the worst of it.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, from the Agriculture Department, said, ``One of the
questions posed to me by a reporter _ and we've been inundated by
reporters in the last 10 days or so _ was, `Is this unusual?'. And,
although it's unusual that we had a car with five baby calves
stuffed in the trunk, the fact that we were called out to
investigate a complaint involving baby calves probably is not that
unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   It's like this: You like milk and burgers.
</P>
<P>
   You can't have your calf and eat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (at the Humane Society) are doing what we can,'' Hicks
said. ``We're saving who we can when they're exploited, abused or
treated inhumanely. Does this mean the Humane Society is going to
take on the dairy farmers? Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   What about those who purchase the calves, like Juan Mora?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he was probably going to eat them,'' she said, adding,
``but we are not going to take on the Beef Council, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, would it be the Veal Council?
</P>
<P>
   The saga of the calves has gone on for weeks, appearing in
publications all over the country. Even now, it would behoove some
news operation to step forward, take the bull by the horns and
produce a meaty expose. Unfortunately, that won't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Species problem, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects of the story are cattle. We're chickens. &QL;

BOEING, MACHINISTS DRAW BATTLE LINES FOR A STRIKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Boeing Co. and its most potent union have begun
drawing the battle lines for a strike, even as the two sides
struggle to find common ground on a new contract for 44,000
Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the International Association of Machinists told
their troops to begin preparing, which means collecting wood for
barrel burns and reviewing picket procedures. Meanwhile, Boeing has
already painted the green lines around its plants that tell
picketers how close they can get to buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The two camps are making the preparations because they have only
another day before Boeing has promised to hand the union a final
offer. That handoff will set in motion a review and vote by the
Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiators can't agree on a new contract, both sides said
they're ready if Machinists walk off their jobs and onto the picket
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the company is doing what they're doing, you have no
choice,'' said Wayne Lemieux, a 12-year Boeing employee, as he left
a union hall in Seattle Wednesday after a briefing on strike
procedures. ``I've been putting money away for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the union must make a decision. The negotiating team
can send the expected offer from Boeing to its members with either
a positive or negative recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the decision, the 44,000 Machinists will have the final
say.
</P>
<P>
   The current contract is set to expire in the early morning hours
of Sept. 2. So, on Sept. 1, Machinists are expected to cast their
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Even if workers reject the company's offer, they don't
necessarily go on strike. Their ballots have two parts. Even if a
majority of those voting reject the contract, the offer is accepted
unless two-thirds vote to strike.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators could also decide to extend the talks, and thus the
contract for a few days, in an attempt to resolve their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the two camps discussed the future of pension
benefits for union workers. The union was expected to suggest
shifting future pension contributions to a union-sponsored plan
during the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the talks haven't gone well and union leaders say a
strike is looming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's looking more and more like it all the time,'' said Steve
Vergala Sr., a union steward, who works at Boeing's Everett plant.
</P>
<P>
   So, the union is briefing its members on everything from the
proper code of conduct on a picket line to how to collect strike
benefit payments.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has its own worries. The aerospace giant is likely
fielding calls from anxious airline customers that are concerned
about their orders, worth tens of millions of dollars, if
Machinists lay down their tools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every prudent company needs to be prepared for all
contingencies, and the company is prepared should the union choose
to use its ultimate weapon, the strike,'' said Peter Conte, a
spokesman for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analysts say Boeing could weather a short strike.
However, a protracted labor dispute could sour relations with some
clients just as Boeing is recovering from two years of production
problems, according to Peter Jacobs, an aerospace analyst for Ragen
MacKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A protracted strike would have some bigger implications,''
Jacobs said. It could affect the ``relationships with airlines that
are already strained by the production problems over the last two
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the two sides are talking and could still settle their
differences, according to negotiators and analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a strike is inevitable at this point. (But)
given the tone of the union negotiators, it certainly doesn't sound
good,'' said Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   The union is upset because it says the company is taking a hard
line on a long list of issues, ranging from health care to
preserving union jobs as the company hires outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing suggested having workers pay a portion of
future health care costs if those expenses jump in the next year,
according to officials at the International Association of
Machinists. That's an explosive issue among union workers at
Boeing, since the company currently pays their health care
premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the fate of the contract, and at least the
short-term fate of Boeing, is in the hands of its largest
collective bargaining unit.
</P>
<P>
   And while many workers said they are disappointed in the
company's approach, at least some are waiting to see the final
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to read between the lines,'' said Fred
Eastland, a 25-year Boeing veteran, who works across from Boeing
Field. ``I'll see it for myself.''

QUESTIONS LINGER AS COWBOYS CLOSE CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys' four-week happy hour at Midwestern State
University is finally over.
</P>
<P>
   And considering that more players were spotted shooting pool at
Graham Central Station nightclub than on the injury-riddled
practice field at times, training camp 1999 in Wichita Falls,
Texas, was generally much ado about nothing.
</P>
<P>
   It seemingly wrought more questions than answers.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerback situation went from bad to worse. Not only is
Deion Sanders' availability in doubt, but so is that of Kevin
Smith, the only other experienced veteran at the position.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the Cowboys are more optimistic about Sanders and his
return from April toe surgery than they are about Smith, who has
been sidelined with a ruptured disk in his back.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Sanders has progressed so well in
his rehab that he's very encouraged about him returning early in
the season. Whether that means he'll be ready for the season opener
Sept. 12 against the Redskins is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones said the Cowboys will find out more in the next few
days when the team resumes practices at its Valley Ranch
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders ``has begun to step it up in the areas you are most
concerned about _ pushing and reacting,'' Jones said. ``The next
stage is him emulating covering by working with receivers in
coverage-type situations. That's going to be coming real soon. It
could come before the week is out.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the eight-year veteran Smith, who has not been on the
practice field in more than two weeks, the Cowboys say they are
hoping he'll be back soon, but say they have no timetable.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, five-year veteran Charlie Williams, who has
three career starts, will play alongside three-year veteran Kevin
Mathis, who is entering his first season as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   We also saw very little of receiver Raghib Ismail and linebacker
Quentin Coryatt _ two of the team's three prized free-agent
additions _ on the practice field and not at all in any of the
three preseason games because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt took a Chris Warren-like leave of absence the past few
days to visit a specialist in Indianapolis about his bad Achilles'
tendon. He has missed so much time that he is no longer guaranteed
to start at strong-side linebacker when he returns. Second-year
Darren Hambrick is the favorite to start in the season opener
against the Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The return of suspended defensive tackle Leon Lett remains in
question, as is the Cowboys' ability to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys get credit for taking a chance on formerly troubled
Chicago Bears lineman Alonzo Spellman. He could be a solid
replacement for Lett.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, his move from end to tackle has to be categorized
as a desperate retreat because of the disappointing training-camp
play by the initial list of potential Lett stand-ins.
</P>
<P>
   The litany of disappointments doesn't end there:
</P>
<P>
   Free safety Izell Reese has not yet developed into a replacement
for veteran George Teague as the Cowboys had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for more speed on offense was set back some when
receiver James McKnight, whom the Cowboy acquired from Seattle for
a third-round pick, was lost for the season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   The team is not certain if backup running back Chris Warren will
be available for a full season.
</P>
<P>
   The season-ending knee injury to Mike Kiselak left the Cowboys
without an experienced backup center and long snapper.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Cowboys will tell you there is time to find some
of the answers before the season opener 17 days from now.
</P>
<P>
   But, so far, it hasn't been pretty.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, leave it to the eternal optimist Jones to put a positive
spin on the 1999 training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Among his highlights are the healthy return of offensive guard
Everett McIver and tight end David LaFleur, the play of defensive
end Greg Ellis, the potential of the speedy Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   He also lauded receiver Michael Irvin for his play and attitude.
Four weeks ago, the Cowboys feared Irvin might be a disruptive
force because of their plans to reduce his role in the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Irvin ended up having a heck of a camp,'' Jones said.
``He needed to have a good camp because everybody was looking at
him. And he had a good camp. He toed the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Only during the lost days in Wichita Falls, when not much looked
good, can not being bad be considered a highlight. nn

ROGERS IS NEARLY UNTOUCHABLE AS METS WIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Kenny Rogers kept tossing sinkerball pitches on the
inside and outside and the Houston Astros kept hitting grounders.
The left-hander, who has been his enigmatic self with the Mets,
made pitching look simple Wednesday night. He did not stray from
the cozy spot he found on the right side of the rubber and was
robotic in his approach. Wind up, pitch, get another ground-ball
out, return to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   It is not always easy. Teams make adjustments and Rogers can get
rattled. But the Astros had never seen Rogers and they never
adjusted, and Rogers looked as calm in the seventh inning as he had
listening to Peter Frampton three hours earlier. Peter Frampton?
Yes, Rogers can be quirky, too.
</P>
<P>
   Everything worked for the Mets at Shea Stadium as they used one
blinding two-out rally against Shane Reynolds and Rogers' precision
pitching to dump the Astros, 4-0. The Mets were in danger of
tumbling two-and-a-half games behind first-place Atlanta for the
first time since July 20, but Rogers silenced the Astros until the
Mets solved Reynolds, and Robin Ventura delivered the big hit in a
four-run sixth. Then it got very loud very quickly in Flushing and
the Mets stayed two games back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny Rogers was big, huge and very good,'' Manager Bobby
Valentine raved.
</P>
<P>
   Who can figure out Rogers? The Mets acquired him from Oakland to
bolster their pursuit of a post-season berth and he had shown some
good, some bad and some unexplainable stuff in his first five
starts, just as he had in two years with the Yankees. But Rogers
was all good Wednesday night while throttling the Astros on no runs
and seven hits in eight-and-a-third innings, barely missing his
second complete game in three starts.
</P>
<P>
   When Rogers locates his sinker as effectively as he did against
Houston, he can be dominant in his own way. Batters do not feel
overpowered; they feel outsmarted. Rogers did exactly what he
wanted to by collecting 18 of the 25 outs on the ground. The other
outs came on five strikeouts, one infield popout and one pickoff.
No Mets outfielder had a putout.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, that's the way I wish I could be able to pitch in
every game,'' Rogers said. ``The sinker was very good. The team
hadn't faced me before so that helped me. You still have to pitch.
I went in and out and did what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who had to leave his last start after three innings
because of back spasms, felt stiffness in his back again after
striking out on a split-finger fastball in the third. So Rogers
tried to stretch his back while on the mound and in the dugout and
even received a massage before the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine saw Rogers grimacing early in the game and told the
pitcher he ``would keep pitching until the cows came home'' because
the Astros were flailing at his pitches and because the Mets'
bullpen was tired. Rogers nodded and then worked through the back
stiffness to improve to 3-0 with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was comfortable with it,'' Rogers said. ``If it takes that
to have the kind of sinker I had, I'll take it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds retired the first 11 batters he faced and had limited
the Mets to three hits when Rickey Henderson singled in the sixth.
Two outs later, Mike Piazza stroked a double into the left-field
corner to put Mets on second and third for the second straight
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros could have walked Robin Ventura and faced Darryl
Hamilton. They did not and it hurt them. Ventura lined a two-run
single to center and scooted to second on the throw home. With
Ventura standing on second, the fans chanted, ``M-V-P, M-V-P,''
which surely made the mild-mannered third baseman blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice, but it's more important that we win,'' Ventura
said. ``I think it's funny. As long as we keep winning, I'll take
the chant.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hamilton rifled a sharp single to right, Ventura tried to
score and it looked as if he would be out by about 15 feet. Matt
Mieske made a strong throw, but catcher Tony Eusebio had to hustle
about 10 feet up the third-base line to collect the toss. Ventura
dodged to the catcher's left, avoided the tag and then dived to
touch the plate with his hand. It was a smart slide and it gave the
Mets a 3-0 lead. Ventura, whose uniform pants were dirty and torn,
said he is used to sidestepping catchers because he is so slow.
</P>
<P>
   The inning continued to unravel for the Astros as Roger Cedeno
hit a slow roller to third, which Ken Caminiti fired past first
base to enable Hamilton to trot in with the fourth run. Rey
Ordonez, who has no homers this year, came close when he hit a ball
off the left-field fence for a double. Reynolds finally got the
third out by retiring Rogers on a grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had two runners against Rogers in the fifth and the
eighth and he squelched both rallies by getting double plays.
Ordonez started the first by fielding a chopper barehanded and
shoveling the ball to Edgardo Alfonzo, and Ventura generated the
second one.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers held the Astros to one hit in eight at-bats with runners
on base and received a standing ovation when he departed in the
ninth. He waved to the 44,640 fans, still looking calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy I went out and did what I was supposed to do,'' said
Rogers. ``I expect to pitch well.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INSIDE PITCH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BOBBY JONES &UR;  &LR; had a magnetic resonance imaging test Wednesday
that revealed inflammation of the bursa sac in his right shoulder.
Dr. DAVID ALTCHEK &UR;  &LR; advised Jones to have a cortisone shot, take
three days off and then resume his minor league rehabilitation
stint. The 29-year-old pitcher hedged at first and, after talking
with Dr. LEWIS YOCUM, &UR;  &LR; the medical director for the Anaheim Angels,
the right-hander agreed to get the shot Thursday. If Jones had
decided not to get the shot, he knew that he might miss the rest of
the season. Now there is a chance he could return next month. ...
RICK REED &UR;  &LR; (strained middle finger on right hand) will start for
Class AAA Norfolk Friday and is expected to be activated after
that. &QL;

HIGH SCHOOLS BAN ARMY RECRUITERS AMID ALLEGATIONS OF SEX
HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DEBERA CARLTON HARRELL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Shoreline School District has banned Army recruiters from
Shorewood and Shorecrest high schools in Shoreline, Wash., in
response to two cases of alleged sexual harassment of female
students.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases, which allegedly occurred in May and January 1998,
have parents and administrators concerned about student safety and
the way two Army recruiters allegedly abused their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The Army says it's taking the ban seriously and wants to regain
the district's trust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army shares the district's concerns about student
safety,'' said Lt. Col. David Hagg, commander of the Seattle
Recruiting Battalion, calling the cases ``very regrettable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a pattern; this is a very rare occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   The recruiter in the January 1998 case was acquitted after
facing an Army court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   But Paula Danielson, the mother of then 17-year-old Shorecrest
senior involved in that case, said she considered his acquittal ``a
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not harassment,'' she said last night. ``It was
assault. ... It was a bad court-martial and the case needs to be
retried.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielson said her daughter, now 20 years old and enlisted with
the U.S. Marine Corps, had wanted to join the Army and earn a
college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army was something she wanted to do,'' Danielson said.
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old recruiting officer, a sergeant, allegedly
touched the girl's chest, buttocks and put her hand to his groin.
He allegedly also made sexual jokes and remarks about her body.
Danielson said her daughter, a petite girl, had felt
``intimidated'' and ``scared'' by him.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded letter sent to the Army recruiting office
after the alleged incident, Shorecrest High Principal Susan Derse
banned the sergeant from the campus, saying he failed to comply
with recruiting guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the school's investigation, Derse wrote in a letter
dated Jan. 22, 1998, the sergeant committed ``numerous acts of
sexual harassment'' against the student.
</P>
<P>
   He also allegedly tried to contact the student in an effort to
discourage her from reporting the incidents, the principal alleged
in the letter.
</P>
<P>
   The acts allegedly took place when the two were alone, either at
the recruiting station or in his vehicle, according to Derse's
letter.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, which allegedly happened in May, the
Shoreline Municipal Court recommended that a second recruiter
receive a gross-misdemeanor charge for communicating with a minor
for immoral purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The case allegedly occurred May 26 and involved a 16-year-old
Shorewood student who said a 29-year-old Army recruiter offered her
a ride and later asked for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Hagg and district Superintendent Marlene Holayter will meet
Sept. 14 to discuss the ban.
</P>
<P>
   Hagg said Wednesday he hoped the two could ``work out a plan.''
He said he will offer to personally conduct recruiting missions in
the future, if that would help regain the district's trust.
</P>
<P>
   District spokeswoman Marjorie Ledell Wednesday emphasized the
seriousness of the allegations and the district's goal of
protecting its students. But she said Shoreline School District
also recognizes the importance of student access to scholarship and
other opportunities offered by the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not drawn a line in the sand and said, `forever and
ever there will be no more Army recruiting on campus,''' Ledell
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to arbitrarily cut students off from information
and post-secondary opportunities; we don't want to punish students.
It's a balance. Certainly, safety comes first, and we need to feel
assured that incidents like this won't reoccur.''
</P>
<P>
   Danielson said the incidents ``were very upsetting ... She was
just a kid. Kids don't know anything about handling these
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the incidents changed her daughter's life: ``She has
had a hard time. She's had nightmares and bad dreams ... She has
tried to go on with her life but she wants the man off the streets.
She doesn't want this to happen to anybody else. She thinks he
should get help.''
</P>
<P>
   King County Prosecutor Dan Donohoe said Wednesday the
prosecutor's office did not file separate charges in the 1998
incident because of the military's jurisdiction. The case could be
revisited, however, though no such decision has been made, Donohoe
said,
</P>
<P>
   For some, news of the ban was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Shorecrest High sophomore David Chong said he didn't agree with
it. ``Not every Army recruiter is going to be like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other school districts, including Bellevue, Edmonds and Tacoma,
said Wednesday they know of no improprieties involving military
recruiters in their schools.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Turner, a spokeswoman with the State Office of the
Superintendent of Public Instruction, said ``we have had no
complaints concerning any military people on school property.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Milner, a self-described peace activist who has been
pushing the district the last three years to provide equal access
to those espousing a non-military point of view, first alerted the
media to the ban.

   SACRAMENTO _ Gymnast Vanessa Atler pierces the air like a
declarative sentence, leaving a vapor trail of exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   The New Mary Lou! An Incredible Athlete! Competes More Like a
Guy than a Girl! When Atler is at her acrobatic best the
superlatives flow like elements in her balance-beam routine, one on
top of the other until it is downright dizzying.
</P>
<P>
   The Canyon Country resident has her own Web site
(www.atler.com), a few television profiles in the can and a
commercial, for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, that started airing on
T.V. last week.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what will happen if her major international debut this
fall is a success.
</P>
<P>
   The way Atler, 17, is being trumpeted you'd think the all-around
gold medal from the 2000 Olympics was already around her neck
instead of merely in her grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Olympic sweethearts weren't manufactured, they
just materialized, as if by magic, before our eyes. Olga Korbut was
a relative unknown competing in her first international meet when
she stole the spotlight right out from under her Russian
compatriot, Lyudmila Turischeva, at the 1972 Summer Olympics in
Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve years later, Mary Lou Retton vaulted from obscurity to
celebrity at the L.A. Games in what turned out to be one giant leap
for U.S. women's gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce since has acted on the Games like an anabolic steroid,
turning them grotesquely out of proportion. The most popular sport
now isn't gymnastics, track and field, swimming or figure skating,
it's commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Avenue suits are going all out to be the one to catch
lightning in a bottle, preferably before the first thunderclap.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Atler's reign. It's not her fault Corporate
America has become so agog about cashing in on the Olympics it
can't wait to see what develops during the actual event.
</P>
<P>
   But where's the safety net? Such is the build-up of Atler, a
likable young lady who has limited experience in international
competition, the potential exists for a fall more jarring, more
psychologically scarring, than the recent spills she has taken on
the uneven bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good to be (highly touted) but it's also
nerve-wracking,'' Atler said before the start of the U.S.
Championships, which run through Saturday. ``You want to keep on
proving people right.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, where there are leaps of faith, there often are
awkward landings. Before Atler, Kristie Phillips was the anointed
one. She made the cover of Sports Illustrated at 14, then failed to
qualify for the 1988 Olympics three years later. Kim Zmeskal was
projected to be the star of the 1992 U.S. Olympic team, but Shannon
Miller had other ideas. In 1996, Dominique Moceanu was the
pre-Olympic pet, but Kerri Strug was the one getting all the
strokes afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to Vanessa is, I just hope she knows how good she is
no matter what the future holds for her,'' said Phillips, who is
fashioning a comeback at the age of 27. ``She is an incredible
athlete. She has a great gift.''
</P>
<P>
   Atler is indeed the rare gymnast capable of pumping up an
audience and the degrees of difficulty in her routines with equal
aplomb. She hurls herself through the air as launched from a silo
and thoroughly engages the crowd with her expressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way she approaches events is more like a guy would than a
girl,'' said three-time U.S. all-around champion Blaine Wilson.
``She raises her hand, goes out there and blows her routines away.
She's a very powerful gymnast.''
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it there's not an ounce of fear in Atler's compact
4-foot-11 frame. This is a gymnast, remember, who watched China's
Sang Lan break her neck while attempting a vault at last summer's
Goodwill Games and then went out and performed as though she had
antifreeze in her veins and won the event.
</P>
<P>
   Atler since has flinched ever so slightly, if only in her
dreams. ``Whenever I think about the Olympics, it's weird. I'm
always doing routines that are impossible to do,'' Atler said. ``I
never think about the Olympics seriously because it scares me a
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, Atler didn't have the haunted look of someone who
feared the next year could become her own personal ``Blair Witch
Project.''
</P>
<P>
   She didn't sound worried about finding her way back to the top
of the U.S. standings after losing her national crown to Kristen
Maloney last August. In fact, Atler seemed preternaturally calm for
someone who, by her own admission, is ready to raise her arm to the
judges and launch into ``the biggest two years of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of Atler's life begins tonight, with the finals of the
women's all-around at the national championships at Arco Arena. The
competition is the first of two showcase events from which the U.S.
squads for the World Championships in China in October and the
Olympics in Sydney next September will be chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Atler wants to reclaim the national title she won in 1997. When
she calls tonight's featured event ``The Showdown,'' her tongue is
only halfway in her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   Atler, who has been bothered by a sore ankle since March,
understands the confrontations that matter most are months away.
The Romanians and the Chinese will let her know if she's deserving
of her close-up.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what they've seen so far, Atler doesn't imagine they're
too impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably just think I'm another one of those hyped people
from America,'' Atler said, and a sly smile perfectly illuminated
her features.

GOING WITHOUT GALLOWAY COULD BE MORE COSTLY TO SEAHAWKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ TV Guide's regional cover this week has a photo of the
first major mistake of Mike Holmgren's Seahawks regime.
</P>
<P>
   Pictured is Joey Galloway, next to the headline, ``Hot Hawks!''
</P>
<P>
   Darn those early publication deadlines. They can make a football
genius look a little foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Not to put too fine point on it, but Galloway is the
strawberries for Holmgren's new shortcake. Without him, the offense
will be as sweet as a bite of TV Guide. Now that fellow wide
receiver Mike Pritchard is injured, the Seahawks may be forced to
ask U.S. Rep. Steve Largent to give up the extreme right wing and
return to Seattle's single wing.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway's speed, quickness and elusiveness after the catch are
vital in what Holmgren wants done in his West Coast offense. At any
other position save quarterback, the Seahawks would lose a little
with a backup. Without Galloway at wide receiver, they lose a lot.
</P>
<P>
   So Galloway's contract holdout, which seems destined to drift
into September, is a far bigger deal than the Seahawks would care
to acknowledge, not to mention accept responsibility for.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway is hardly an innocent in this unsavory matter. A
bright, proud guy who has a view of himself little short of Ali in
his heyday, Galloway tends to hold himself above the fray, as well
as above his teammates and away from any pass routes over the
middle. So he becomes the unsympathetic figure of Joey Stayaway.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, he held himself out despite a valid contract and a
firm commitment from Holmgren to renegotiate a deal that all
parties agreed was below market for a player of his experience,
statistics and game-breaking skills.
</P>
<P>
   He had a promise from the previous ownership that his deal would
be reworked before its fifth and final year. That promise is being
kept, just not at the numbers Galloway fancies.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are, of course, preposterous to those machinists
contemplating a strike against Boeing. But since nobody throws to a
machinist on third-and-long against the Broncos, the standard
request is made here to suspend disbelief while contemplating pro
sports salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Seahawks offer of seven years at $35 million,
including a $7 million signing bonus, falls short of Galloway's
goal of $24 million over five years, including a $9 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed average for Galloway is about $4.6 million
annually, about the same as San Francisco's Terrell Owens but shy
of Antonio Freeman's newly signed deal in Green Bay that averages
$5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Though Galloway's stats are equal to or better than Freeman's,
Freeman's team has done better, and besides, Freeman was a free
agent. The Seahawks offer will put Galloway among the top five
receivers in the NFL, including Jerry Rice. The contract value
difference between himself and his age peer, Freeman, is hardly
huge.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Is that difference worth the potential sacrifice
of all or part of a season, particularly when the season is the
first under a new coach and system?
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of what happened to Seahawks quarterback
Warren Moon last year, certainly not.
</P>
<P>
   The holdout of Moon, who like Galloway wanted to avoid the
rigors of training camp and also wanted a career-reward figure,
cost him in credibility and performance and gained him little
money.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Galloway, his value is much higher and more
obvious. That also means the question above should not have had to
be asked.
</P>
<P>
   This situation should not have reached impasse this close to the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are in charge of any deal, and Holmgren is in full
charge of the Seahawks. Given Galloway's importance to this
offense, Holmgren's renegotiation attempt should have been more
important than the successful new deal for defensive end Michael
Sinclair. It should have been done before minicamp in June and
certainly before Freeman's deal in Green Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seahawks underestimated the difference between Galloway
and Sinclair, not to mention Galloway's resolve and the high market
for receivers.
</P>
<P>
   By standing firm, the Seahawks are hoping to send a business
message to players contemplating a future holdout: Be like Mike,
not Joey.
</P>
<P>
   Though that would be swell, the fact is that Sinclair played
instead of holding out, and he accepted less than full market value
because he had other reasons for wanting to stay in Seattle. In
that regard, he is like the Mariners' Edgar Martinez, who could
have made more elsewhere but liked his Seattle gig more than extra
money.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other pro athletes, Galloway is more interested in
cash, prestige and ego gratification. Lament all you want about
that observation; it is an inevitable part of the baggage of
big-time pro sports. Holmgren knows that, and also that prima
donnas, not the chorus, sell the opera.
</P>
<P>
   But now he's boxed himself in. He naturally doesn't want to be
seen as caving to Galloway. The financial precedent, it is assumed,
would be odious.
</P>
<P>
   But it is submitted here that there is something worse than
salary precedent: starting a season with an Erickson-style thud.
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget another pro sports axiom: Don't make TV
Guide look stupid.

TOXIC BACTERIUM CLOSES SEATTLE'S POPULAR GREEN LAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT MCCLURE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For 74 years, Bill Bayard has been walking the shores
of Green Lake. And he was there again Wednesday with his dog
Charley. But Green Lake was different than he'd ever seen it
before. Visibility was maybe one foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a heck of a lot cleaner. I can't remember ever
seeing it this muddy,'' Bayard said as he strolled past a series of
fluorescent lime-green signs that read: ``Warning: Toxic algae.
Green Lake is closed to recreation activities including boating,
swimming and fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   The signs went up Wednesday as authorities warned that people
and animals could be sickened by contact with the lake. The
unprecedented closure of the lake prompted by a toxic bacterium
comes at the height of the water-sports season and highlights the
failure of the city's long struggle to clean up the popular lake.
</P>
<P>
   The waters of Green Lake in recent weeks have deteriorated into
a murky, pea-green gruel, the result of the pollution-aided and
explosive growth of a toxic bacterium that is commonly _ though
inaccurately _ dubbed ``blue-green algae.''
</P>
<P>
   At the lake's sandy north-end beach, where raucous groups of
kids from summer camp normally frolic, only a few diehard
sun-worshipers lounged lakeside Wednesday. Despite a stiff breeze,
no windsurfers glided across the lake located about five miles
north of downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The closure will last at least until Friday. The Seattle Parks
and Recreation Department warning stems from water quality tests
conducted earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The tests revealed that the lake contained Aphanizomenon sp., a
bacterium that numbers among the class of bacteria that originally
made life on earth possible by generating the oxygen in the
atmosphere 3.5 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, though, those bacteria can make life miserable for
swimmers or others who ingest enough of the tainted water.
</P>
<P>
   From a half-hour to one day after accidentally swallowing some
of the bacteria-laced water, people may notice the onset of muscle
weakness, vomiting or diarrhea, said Bill Lasby of the Seattle-King
County Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Other possible symptoms include nausea, thirst, the yellow
complexion that accompanies jaundice and pulse irregularities. The
Health Department warned people who swam at Green Lake and suffered
such symptoms to contact a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria can attack the liver of those affected. There are
no confirmed instances of human deaths from it, though. Health
authorities were alerted to the severity of the toxin in recent
years when dogs and birds that drank from other contaminated water
bodies became ill or died, Lasby said. Although waterfowl can be
affected, there is no way to control their access to Green Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first and foremost concern is animals, because they will
go and drink the water, while most people won't drink it because
it's green and slimy,'' Lasby said. Affected animals may show signs
of lethargy and disorientation, and may vomit or experience
seizures, Lasby said.
</P>
<P>
   Green Lake has been closed in decades past when the algae blooms
grew too thick. But that was because lifeguards feared they would
be unable to see swimmers in trouble in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent years have scientists discovered the toxic
properties of the bacteria. Another species, Mycrocystis
aeruginosa, led to the closure of Lake Sammamish in 1997.
Similarly, American and Clear lakes in Pierce County were closed in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Factors that promote the growth of Aphanizomenon include
sunlight, warm temperatures and pollution in the form of the
nutrient phosphorus.
</P>
<P>
   Phosphorus is washed into Green Lake mostly from the excrement
of animals. An important part of the problem, authorities say, is
the rapidly growing population of Canada geese that line the shores
and make strolling through the lawns of the park dicey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to kill them,'' Bayard said as he walked by the
lake Wednesday. ``But every time you go to get rid of them, boy,
you get all the do-gooders coming at you.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a half-dozen Canada geese swooped noisily overhead
and landed on a nearby lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The city has tried in several ways to control the geese, said
Dewey Potter, a spokeswoman for the parks department, including
``one-way tickets to east Washington.'' But the population
continues to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all unhappy with the geese. We're trying to work with
the feds on this,'' Potter said. ``We want them to take the lead on
a regional basis. ... If we chase them off, they'll just go to the
next beach. ''
</P>
<P>
   The lake's problems with algae, though, predate the geese by at
least several decades.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the name Green Lake derived from the green algae that
has long been present.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1960, municipal officials wrestled with schemes to
import Lake Washington water to make Green Lake a more pleasant
place to swim.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 city crews spread 181 tons of aluminum sulfate, more
commonly known as alum, into the lake. Alum binds up the phosphorus
and makes it unavailable to fuel the growth of the algae. Officials
said the alum treatment would retard the growth of the
Aphanizomenon for about five years.
</P>
<P>
   The alum increased visibility from six feet to 21 feet. But it
soon slipped back to 17 feet and deteriorated from there.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the geese, European carp that have overpopulated
the lake are an important part of the problem, said Kevin Stoops,
manager of major projects and planning for the Seattle Parks
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The fish stir up sediments and make the phosphorus available for
the algae.
</P>
<P>
   A recent experiment with ``electro-fishing'' _ using electrical
shocks to stun the carp and scoop them out of the lake _ showed
that the method was far too labor-intensive to work, Stoops said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between the birds and the fish, the alum treatment's been
undone,'' Stoops aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy thing to get your hands on and solve all the
problems at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday at the Green Lake beach, Beth Deitzel showed up with
her little girl Lauren, who is about to turn 2.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren was looking forward to jumping into the water, but
instead tore around the beach fully clothed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She tried to go in a couple of times,'' Beth Deitzel said,
``but I told her not to because it's yucky.''

EVEN WITH NEW PREMIER, B.C. STILL LIKELY TO FACE TURMOIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICTORIA, B.C. _ Dan Miller was sworn in Wednesday as British
Columbia's fifth premier of the 1990s, taking what he acknowledged
is ``a fairly onerous job'' amid trying times for Canada's Pacific
province.
</P>
<P>
   The former Prince Rupert pulp mill worker has agreed to serve
only until the ruling New Democratic Party picks a permanent
replacement for controversial, confrontational Premier Glen Clark,
who resigned Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   British Columbia, which has deep left-right divisions, treats
politics as a blood sport _ and no place has seen more blood on the
floor than the premier's office in the west wing of Victoria's
ornate Parliament Building.
</P>
<P>
   Three premiers have been driven from office by scandals during
the 1990s. A fourth, Rita Johnston, held office for a few months in
1991 and was then voted out by residents of her own legislative
district.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says he will go out of his way not to make waves, but the
province is still likely to face months of political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats and the Liberal Party will duke it out in the
B.C. Legislature while a range of candidates maneuver for the
premier's job, which will be filled in four or five months.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping into what may be the most politically risky job in
Canada, Miller, 54, said Wednesday he will not go out on any limbs,
pick any fights or singlehandedly try to run the government _ all
of which were complaints against Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's there just to make sure that the ship stays afloat,''
said Norman Ruff, a University of Victoria political scientist. It
won't be easy, he added, given the hard feelings that followed
disclosure that Clark has been under a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The province nicknamed ``lotus land'' still feels the pains of
Asia's economic downturn, downsizing that has cost 20,000 forest
industry jobs, and a slowness to embrace the information-based
economy that fueled phenomenal growth in the rest of the Pacific
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   More turmoil is likely as the province's political divide
continues to preclude bipartisan problem solving.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Liberal Party _ which is conservative despite its
name _ has soared as high as 60 percent in the polls, as Clark's
support plummeted to the low teens.
</P>
<P>
   But the Liberals' leader, former Vancouver Mayor Gordon
Campbell, is widely unpopular.
</P>
<P>
   He is going to extreme lengths to counter his uptight, stuffy
public image.
</P>
<P>
   This week he is climbing Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro, part of a
campaign to raise money to fight Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The stridently pro-Liberal Vancouver Sun is letting the Campbell
family write about the adventure.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats already have regained a chunk of support lost
in the wake of Clark's resignation, according to a poll released
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the left-leaning party still trails far behind the Liberals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a large floating constituency in this province
that wants a progressive agenda. Our job is to bring it back
home,'' said Andrew Petter, a Cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
   A spirited leadership contest is shaping up, involving at least
two of the Cabinet ministers who pushed Clark from power, as well
as Canada's only openly homosexual member of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   A leading candidate is Gordon Wilson, provincial finance
minister. He joined the New Democrats late last year after leading
two other parties in the British Columbia Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is a moderate and a policy wonk, whose responsibilities
have included digging B.C. Ferries out of $200 million (Canadian)
in cost overruns following Clark's effort to build three fast
catamaran ferries.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson kicks off his campaign with good news Thursday as he
releases a first quarter report showing that British Columbia's
deficit is less than projected, and that forest products firms are
recovering from the Asian flu.
</P>
<P>
   A second contender is Attorney General Ujjal Dosanj, an
Indo-Canadian who symbolizes the role of immigrants in shaping
British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   He has a tough-on-crime reputation and would push to sharpen
Canada's lethargic response to the upsurge in drug smuggling along
the Interstate 5 corridor.
</P>
<P>
   But Dosanj is the person who disclosed last week that Clark was
being investigated for his possible role in a neighbor's casino
application.
</P>
<P>
   A police source alleges Clark was offered, but turned down, a
bribe.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the investigation was the final controversy
that forced Clark to resign, and Clark loyalists are furious at
Dosanj for it. Clark has denied all allegations.
</P>
<P>
   A third leading contender, if she chooses to run, would be Joy
MacPhail, who quit Clark's Cabinet in July.
</P>
<P>
   As finance minister, MacPhail tried to hold down the province's
deficit but was overruled by Clark's office, which produced a
budget with a projected deficit of $812 million.
</P>
<P>
   Svend Robinson, a Federal Parliament member, also may run. A
leading headline hunter in Canadian politics, Robinson has been
arrested in environmental protests and led demonstrations against
the 1997 Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation conference in Vancouver.
He recently demanded that references to God be deleted from
Canada's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who has disclosed that he is gay, brought a male
swimmer from Canada's national team as his date to the Governor
General's Ball, the highlight of Ottawa's social season.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, an outside possibility is agriculture minister Corky
Evans, who settled in British Columbia as a Vietnam War draft
resister.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were first elected in 1991, the New Democrats have
nearly doubled British Columbia's park system, which now protects
more than 11 percent of the province. Over mining industry
opposition, two of the world's largest protected areas were created
in northern British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The party has also raised the minimum wage to Canada's highest,
held the line on college tuition, and offered free tuition for
adults completing their high school education.
</P>
<P>
   And Clark negotiated British Columbia's first major aboriginal
treaty, giving land and recognition that the Nisga'a Indians of
northern B.C. had sought for more than a century.
</P>
<P>
   But those achievements were drowned in budget red ink. Showpiece
projects suffered huge overruns. And Clark made himself a pariah by
taking a confrontational stance on U.S.-Canada salmon treaty
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The New Democrats will pick a leader (and premier) at what is
expected to be a spirited convention in December or January.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, furious faceoffs between the New Democrats and the
opposition Liberals will continue in the B.C. Legislature.

FINLEY SOLID IN DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The contents of a large box next to Chuck
Finley's locker pretty much summed up the Anaheim Angels these
days. In the box was a brand-new golf bag.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are 36 game remaining in their season, it's
obvious by their play on the field many Angels are looking ahead to
the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Angels' 7-2 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays Wednesday
afternoon at Edison Field couldn't be blamed on Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was impressive for his fifth consecutive start, striking
out nine and allowing three runs in seven innings. Then he watched
the bullpen give up four runs in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very frustrating year,'' said Finley (8-11), who
is 3-1 with a 1.69 ERA since the July 31 trading deadline. ``I've
been on some bad teams, but day-in, day-out, this is more
frustrating. Just when you think you might be squared away and you
might make something good out of the year, we can't get anything
going. There's no flow, no momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays left town with a two-game sweep, and the Angels
leave today for a seven-game road trip _ to Cleveland and Boston _
having dropped four of six on the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Only one team in the majors _ the Kansas City Royals with 23 _
has fewer home victories than the Angels (25).
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins did his usual postgame interview
session, praising Finley, then praising the other team's pitcher
for shutting down his team's offense. Finally, he said: ``That's
all I have to say. I can't say anything else I haven't said the
last three months.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels' only offense off Blue Jays starter Joey Hamilton
(7-7) came in the fifth, when Jim Edmonds drove in one run with a
two-out single and Mo Vaughn followed with an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen games like this go by when we just can't put
anything together,'' Edmonds said. ``Bad swings, bad at-bats, it
just keeps adding up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing really stands out as to why we're bad. We're just bad.
One thing leads to another. There are no excuses, it's just
reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley followed the same formula of teammate Ramon Ortiz one
night earlier: Throw seven strong innings, hand the ball over to
the bullpen and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   But expect the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz's only mistake in Tuesday night's game was the two-run
homer he allowed to Carlos Delgado. Finley fell into the same trap.
</P>
<P>
   He took a 2-0 lead into the sixth and got the first two outs
before hitting Shawn Green with a pitch. Delgado followed with his
homer to tie the game, No. 37 of the season and No. 11 in August,
tying a Blue Jays record for home runs in a month.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Shannon Stewart extended his hitting streak to
to 23 games, but more importantly it drove in Jacob Brumfield from
second base with two out to give the Blue Jays a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Al Levine took over for Finley and gave up four runs in the
eighth, but all four were unearned. With two out and nobody on,
Delgado hit a ground ball to rookie second baseman Trent
Durrington. But Durrington's throw sailed over Edmonds' head at
first base and the Blue Jays hitters took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to Tony Fernandez, Tony Batista had an
RBI double and Brumfield followed with a three-run homer, sending
the Angels to another loss in a dreadful season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the business, part of the game,'' Collins said.
``There are a lot of good times and a lot of crappy times. This is
a crappy time. And you'd better be man enough to deal with it.''

L.A.'S HOT WEATHER NOT ABOUT TO LOOSEN GRIP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the sun beaming overhead and temperatures at
104, sweat beaded on Raul Garcia's brow Wednesday as he and his
work crew got ready to pave a blistering stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't expected to get any better Thursday when Garcia's crew
actually begins to lay steaming asphalt _ forecasters predict
temperatures will reach the century mark again across Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking forward to that but you have to do it,''
Garcia said. ``You try to get used to the heat but you never do.''
</P>
<P>
   The only record broken Wednesday was on Mount Wilson, where the
mercury reached 92, as compared with 90 on the same day in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday's going to be the hottest day, most likely, but
certainly temperatures are going to stay well above normal right
through the weekend,'' said meteorologist Laura Hannon of
AccuWeather Inc. ``We'll have a gradual downturn in temperatures
late in the weekend and early next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Highs through the weekend should stay between 70 degrees and 80
degrees on the coast, to near 90 degrees in the Los Angeles Basin
and 105 degrees or more in the Valley, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   For the heat-wave weary, the only possible relief could be
thunderstorms in the mountains and desert. The chance of rain today
is put at 30 percent in the desert and 40 percent in the mountains,
rising Friday to 40 percent in the deserts and 50 percent in the
mountains, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   Pierce College in suburban Woodland Hills led the San Fernando
Valley at 109 degrees, followed by nearby Chatsworth with 107
degrees, according to the Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Civic Center hit a high of 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures topping 100 degrees are expected through Sunday in
much of the San Fernando Valley, parts of Ventura County and the
deserts, weather officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the misery, low pressure over Baja California will
draw humidity from the remnants of Hurricane Bret into Southern
California beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main concern is the monsoonal moisture,'' according to
National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Hoffer.
</P>
<P>
   Winds out of the south will gradually shift to the east
Thursday, guiding in the moisture, he said. ``The easterly flow
could generate a thunderstorm or two drifting across the (San
Fernando) Valley on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   What rain comes will bring little relief to workers like Ramon
Abarca, a 21-year-old cook who works with his mother and brother in
the small kitchen of El Zarape Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   The ceiling fan that keeps the air moving is no match for the
steam drifting up from boiling pots or the grill's incessant
sizzle, Abarca said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that makes it seem a lot worse,'' he said. ``It gets
tough. We're really thirsty and we sweat a lot so we drink a lot of
water with ice.''
</P>
<P>
   As do the customers, according to his mother, Enedina Abarca,
45.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're selling more drinks than food today _ mucho agua,'' she
said Wednesday. ``I just want to be home all day in the swimming
pool or air conditioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Her niece, Martha Castillo, 24, of suburban Sylmar, dropped by
for lunch and to offer some sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work in a catering truck so I know what it's like in
there _ it's like an oven,'' said Castillo, who draped a white
cloth over a stroller to keep her 4-month-old daughter protected
from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Jose M. Oliver, 33, a messenger for a Van Nuys service, stocked
up on two large drinks and a torta before hitting the road to
Bakersfield to deliver documents.
</P>
<P>
   He planned to make the drive with the window down, as the car's
air conditioning gives him a headache, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can stand 80, 90 degrees, but not if it's over 100,'' said
the Pacoima resident.
</P>
<P>
   That's just where the mercury crested Wednesday for much of the
San Fernando Valley

RODRIGUEZ RETURNS TO WORK FOR ROUND 2 WITH YANKEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Frankie Rodriguez came off his seven-day suspension
Wednesday, just in time to prepare for another bout with the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he was on the mound against the Yankees Aug. 6,
Rodriguez was one of the instigators of a bench-clearing melee,
leading to what Rodriguez considers an excessive penalty. He hit
Chuck Knoblauch with a pitch and then got into a fight with New
York catcher Joe Girardi on his way off of the field, igniting the
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The time off didn't leave Rodriguez bitter, however. It made him
think about what it would be like to be sitting home and out of
baseball for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just see how at any moment it can be taken away from you,
whether it's a suspension or an injury,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   During the suspension, Rodriguez worked out every day and kept
up his off-day pitching routines to maintain his arm strength. He
wouldn't mind getting a start again, possibly in Chicago on the
second leg of the seven-game road trip, but he's ready to come in
and fill any roll that manager Lou Piniella has for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou asked me if I was ready, so that usually means you're
going to get in there,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners are to make any moves in the wild card race,
they have to win on the road in New York. When the Yankees were
here during the fight-marred four-game series, they swept the M's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to worry about every game,'' Rodriguez said. `` ... We
need to make an unbelievable run. This team is capable of it.''
</P>
<P>
   SIX DAYS A WEEK: Piniella hopes to go into New York and Chicago
with a starting pitching staff that is finally getting adequate
rest due to what amounts to a six-day rotation because of the
off-days for travel. He believes the rotation will help younger
pitchers such as Freddy Garcia, Paul Abbott and John Halama in the
final month of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids have pitched a lot of innings,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia, who pitched a complete game Tuesday night against
Detroit, won't pitch again until Monday against the White Sox in
Chicago, .
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these young kids have never pitched into September
much,'' Piniella said. ``They're now pitching on about six days'
rest and have gotten stronger. We've kept them all in rotation and
haven't skipped anybody, so it's helped all of our pitchers out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the best of worlds, Piniella would always have five starters
to pitch over a six-day period with a day off every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have five pitchers pitching well in the summer with a
day off, you might just be able to skip one every once in a
while,'' Piniella said. ``I think it helps them immensely and they
can use the time off from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   LEADING QUESTION: Hitting in the leadoff spot is not a position
that Brian Hunter particularly relishes, but he understands that he
probably is the best man for the job because of his natural
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he never feels quite comfortable in a role that requires
a patient hitter who can go deep in the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never liked leadoff, but because of my speed it's what
I've always done,'' Hunter said. ``You're supposed to be patient
and take pitches, but I always try to be more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter also has batted in the ninth position in the past week,
but he was 3-for-4 Tuesday in his return the leadoff spot,
something Piniella noted was important to generate runs. Hunter was
back in the leadoff spot Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you need from your leadoff hitter: to set the
table,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, hitting .248, knows he has struggled at the plate over
the past month, going 0-for-22 during one stretch in early August.
But he believes he's making solid contact now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been tough,'' he said, ``but I was lining out on the
same ones that fell in Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   BUHNER'S PENANCE: As Frankie Rodriguez was put back on active
duty Wednesday, right fielder Jay Buhner began serving his
three-day suspension that is the result of a fight July 11 in Los
Angeles. The M's had hoped to sign a veteran position player, but
there was no news on the front Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   TICKET UPDATE: There are still several thousand tickets
available for the next home series against Boston Sept. 3-6 at
Safeco Field. About 6,000 tickets are available for the Friday
night game; a limited number of single tickets are available for
the 1:05 Saturday afternoon game; 3,000 tickets are left for the
Sunday afternoon game; and 8,000 are left for the Labor Day game,
which starts at 1:35 p.m.

YANKS' SPIGOT RUNS DRY, BUT MARTINEZ STAYS HOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Tino Martinez has a hard time having fun when
he plays baseball, Manager Joe Torre said the other day, a trait
that was no more apparent than after Wednesday night's 7-3 loss to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was asked about the importance of this Yankee road
trip. ``I've had two good games,'' Martinez said sharply,
contesting the notion that his spurt of hits and runs batted in
meant anything at all.
</P>
<P>
   Two good games. On Monday, he had four hits and drove in four
runs. On Tuesday, he hit a home run and drove in four runs.
Wednesday, he slugged a home run and hit the ball hard in three
at-bats. By Martinez's stringent standards, one of those games did
not qualify as a success.
</P>
<P>
   But as far as Torre was concerned, Martinez's recent burst was
the best part of the Yankees' trip, on which the team won four of
six games, including two of three from Texas _ a club the Yankees
may face in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored 34 runs in the first 23 innings of the series
against the Rangers, taking a 3-0 lead before the Rangers came back
to beat on Hideki Irabu (10-5). Esteban Loaiza pitched seven
innings for Texas, and Rafael Palmeiro hit his 39th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has been in an odd slump all season, never really going
through a horrific 0-for-20 or 0-for-30 stretch but never
consistently hitting for power and driving in runs. For much of the
year he has been in the habit of lurching at the ball anxiously,
resulting in pop-ups or ground balls to the right side. And his
troubles have nagged at Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a perfectionist,'' catcher Jorge Posada said. ``He
follows suit, in the mold of Paul O'Neill.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his position in the Yankees' lineup, hitting behind
the likes of Derek Jeter, O'Neill and Bernie Williams, Martinez is
obviously crucial to the offense; going into Wednesday's game he
had 138 at-bats with runners in scoring position, more than any
Yankee other than O'Neill. Recently, opposing managers had taken to
pitching around Williams and going after Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   But Martinez seemed much more comfortable at the plate in this
series, showing greater patience _ maybe because he had
consistently faced left-handed relievers on the trip. When Martinez
faces left-handed pitchers, Torre noted, he must remind himself to
keep his front shoulder tucked in and wait on the ball longer, and
he does not lurch at the ball.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Martinez homered against the left-hander Mike Munoz,
and his game-winning three-run homer Tuesday came against Corey
Lee, another left-hander. ``He's actually going to get to feel good
and more relaxed,'' Posada said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said: ``He's going to have his year _ he's going to
drive in 100 runs, and hit 20-something home runs. It's his time to
be hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said, ``I'm just trying to have a good game and go from
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees scored twice in the first against Loaiza, and
Martinez's home run in the third gave them a 3-0 lead; it appeared
as if they were on their way to a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu could not maintain the advantage, however. He had moved
easily through the Texas lineup in the first two innings, throwing
only 25 pitches. As he began his third inning, however, his
fastball _ subpar Wednesday night, often 88 to 90 miles an hour _
began drifting high in the strike zone, as if, in the Texas heat,
he was not always following through on his delivery. Irabu admitted
later to feeling out of balance in his mechanics; Torre believes he
is not driving toward home plate as he did earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored four runs in the third inning, added two more
in the sixth, and the Yankees' record fell to 77-49. But all in
all, it had been a good trip for the Yankees, and for Tino
Martinez. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INSIDE PITCH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DEREK JETER, who struggled badly in going 1 for 10 in the first
two games of the series, was given the night off. ... Left fielder
RICKY LEDEE was scratched from the starting lineup after he felt
ill before the game. ... If DAVID CONE had somebody else's medical
history, or was younger, his performance Tuesday _ one and
two-thirds innings, seven hits, six runs _ would be quickly
forgotten. ``For the lack of a better phrase, it was just an off
night for me,'' Cone said. Cone said he felt fine, and there is
ample evidence he is simply a better pitcher with extra rest. When
he pitches on four days' rest, the minimum in a five-man rotation,
he is less effective. JOE TORRE &UR;  &LR; and the pitching coach MEL
STOTTLEMYRE have opted to keep their five starters in line, rather
than drop somebody to take advantage of an off day, and so Cone has
had five or more days of rest for 13 of his 25 starts. In those
games, Cone has a 1.92 ERA. Over the last four months of last
season, he had a 1.57 ERA when working with five or more days of
rest. In his 12 starts this season with the minimum four days of
rest, his ERA is 4.46. Over the last four months of last season
with four days' rest: 3.79.

EDMONDS ACKNOWLEDGES ROLE IN ANGELS MISERY
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ After Wednesday's 7-2 loss to the Toronto Blue
Jays, Jim Edmonds said he ``shouldered part of the blame for the
Anaheim Angels' horrible season.''
</P>
<P>
   How could Edmonds, who had shoulder surgery in April, be at
fault when he missed four months? It is !ital!because he missed
four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put the blame on my shoulders,'' said Edmonds, who is
hitting .247 with one homer and 10 RBIs in 22 games. ``I wasn't
here for anybody. Deep down I'll always put blame on my shoulders.
I could be at fault as much as anybody. We might still be five, 10,
15 games out, but we wouldn't be 22 games out if I had been here
all year. Every guy adds a different dimension. We lost three
dimensions (Edmonds, Gary DiSarcina and Tim Salmon). We've had guys
out there who aren't supposed to pick up the slack.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Back to Fenway: Mo Vaughn returns to Boston this weekend for
a three-game series Friday-Sunday, but it won't match the hype of
his first visit there in May.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was the biggest story of the year in Boston to that
point, and he had a forgetable three days, going 1 for 11 with six
strikeouts. And it didn't help that Vaughn's severely sprained left
ankle was in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn missed the entire four-game series with the Red Sox in
Anaheim earlier this month because of a staph infection in his
right shin.
</P>
<P>
   __ Numbers game: At 51-75, the Angels are on pace to lose 96
games this season, which would set a club record. They lost 95 in
1968 and '80.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, the Angels are 10-30. They have played
so poorly that the embarrassing 100-loss mark is not out of the
question. The Angels need to go 12-24 in their final 36 games to
avoid 100 losses.
</P>
<P>
   In order to match their record under manager Terry Collins in
his first year in Anaheim in 1997, the Angels would have to go 33-3
the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   __ Erstad to return: The Angels will activate first
baseman/outfielder Darin Erstad from the disabled list today. In
order to make room for Erstad on the 25-man roster, pitcher Mike
Holtz was placed on the 15-day DL with a strained right hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   __ Matchups: The Angels are off today and will begin a
seven-game trip to Boston and Cleveland on Friday. Pitching
matchups for the three games in Boston: Friday (4:05 p.m., KCAL-9)
_ Jarrod Washburn (0-2, 8.56 ERA) vs. Kent Mercker (6-5, 5.12);
Saturday (1:05 p.m., no TV) _ Steve Sparks (5-10, 4.90) vs. Tim
Wakefield (4-9, 5.33); Sunday (10:05 a.m., KCAL-9) _ Tim Belcher
(5-7, 6.55) vs. Pat Rapp (5-5, 4.36).

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The pain of losing their teammate is very
much present. It's been only a week since Kim Perrot died and two
days since her funeral.
</P>
<P>
   So for now, the Houston Comets are taking it one day at a time,
as the two-time defending WNBA champions prepare to face the Los
Angeles Sparks in the best-of-three Western Conference finals
beginning today at 5:30 p.m. at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The series moves to Houston's Compac Center on Sunday, and if
necessary, Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the reigning champs, who lost only six of their 32
regular-season games, the Sparks know they can't afford a sluggish
start like they had Tuesday against the Sacramento Monarchs. They
trailed by 11 at halftime but were able to pull out a 71-58 victory
in that first-round single elimination game behind Lisa Leslie's 22
points.
</P>
<P>
   But it came only after Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge snapped
them out of their funk with a halftime tirade.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks are 2-2 against the Comets and the only team to win
two games against them. But two-time Most Valuable Player Cynthia
Cooper did not play for Houston in last Friday night's 68-64 Los
Angeles victory. She sat out after flying to Los Angeles a day
after Perrot, her best friend, died following a battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better,'' said Cooper, the WNBA scoring leader who
returned to the court the following night and had 27 points in the
Comets' 74-65 victory over Utah in the final regular-season game.
`` . . . You don't cope, I lost my mother six months ago, I lost my
best friend . . . How do you cope?''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Comets are a stronger team because of Perrot's
positive spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through a lot this year and this is adding to what
we've gone through all season long,'' said the Comets' Sheryl
Swoopes, who is separated from her husband. ``I think as a team
we've done very well sticking together. It shouldn't be anything
different.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Sparks are afraid of. Defensive intensity will
play an important role for the Sparks. La'Keisha Frett and Mwadi
Mabika have perhaps the toughest jobs _ trying to contain Swoopes
and Cooper. Leading the league in scoring for the third consecutive
season is Cooper, who averages 22.1 points. Swoopes is third with
18.3 points per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play some great basic basketball, meaning they keep the
floor spread wide where if they don't have their NBA range
3-pointers, they can drive and penetrate and just kick,'' Sparks
forward DeLisha Milton said. ``That's basketball at its basic form,
just drive and kick or pick-and-roll. That's just how simple it is,
but they execute it so well.''

WILL THE FANS FORGIVE MONDESI?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ The last time the Los Angeles Dodgers were home,
Raul Mondesi was jeered constantly, a reminder from the fans that
they were unhappy the right fielder lashed out in a profanity-laced
tirade at Dodgers manager Davey Johnson and general manager Kevin
Malone.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's comments, which included a desire to be traded, jolted
the organization. But Dodgers president and CEO Bob Graziano said
it's time to forgive and forget.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two weeks since Mondesi made the comments and he
since hasn't talked about the situation publicly. However, Mondesi
and his agent, Jeff Moorad, did meet with Johnson, Malone and
Graziano during the last homestand. The Dodgers return home
tomorrow to face the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Raul was sincere when he apologized, and he apologized
on several occasions,'' Graziano said. ``I certainly can get beyond
that incident because I know his apology was sincere and we all
make mistakes. If you can't get beyond people's mistakes, you're
never going to have stability in the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mondesi, with his $20.5 million guaranteed contract over
the next two seasons, could find himself on the trading block.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano acknowledged the Dodgers must make moves during the
offseason, but he remained consistent with his field manager and
Malone on the severity of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to tear it down and start over,'' Graziano said.
``Obviously, changes need to be made, just from the team's
performance, but it's not an issue of starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   __ No relief: After giving up two more runs in one inning and
taking the loss, Pedro Borbon (3-2) might see his role as
situational lefty out of the bullpen slipping away. Borbon was
brilliant before the All-Star break but now is floundering.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon's ERA since the break is 10.50 and it has risen from 1.64
to 4.00. Onan Masaoka, used primarily as a long reliever and in the
middle of games, could slide into that role.
</P>
<P>
   Borbon was dominant against lefties until lately, and even so
they're hitting .139 against him. But left-handed hitting Dave
Nilsson's two-run double off Borbon in the seventh inning Wednesday
broke a 7-7 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Masaoka has a 3.97 ERA. Righties are hitting .198
against him, but lefties are batting .253.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to keep bringing (Borbon) back,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``As long as he's on the team, I'm going to
keep throwing him out there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Meeting of minds: Graziano and Rick Welts, president of Fox
Sports Enterprises, were in town to meet with baseball commissioner
Bud Selig. Graziano said many things were discussed, including the
economics of the game and how the Dodgers fit into it.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: Angel Pena, currently on the suspended list at Triple-A
Albuquerque for violating teams rules, won't be a September call-up
for the Dodgers. Instead, he'll head to Peoria, Ariz., and rehab
his injured throwing arm in the Instructional League. Pena, the
Dodgers' top prospect and one of the top catching prospects in
baseball, has a strained right forearm and is expected to miss two
to three weeks. . . . Lefty Carlos Perez was so impressive in his
latest start for Albuquerque that he might rejoin the Dodgers
during the upcoming six-game homestand. He allowed two runs on
eight hits in seven innings Tuesday, and his final pitch of the
game was clocked 90 mph. . . . Adrian Beltre (ankle and groin)
returned after missing the last three games with injuries and went
3 for 4 with his 14th homer of the season. He was a triple shy of
the cycle. . . . The five runs the Brewers scored in the sixth
innings off Brown equaled the number of earned runs he allowed in
his last five starts. It was also the most runs the Brewers have
gotten in an inning since scoring seven July 16 against Kansas
City.

F.M. THROWER, 89, OF TV'S YULE LOG FAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fred M. Thrower, a former New York television executive who
contributed the televised Yule log to New Yorkers' Christmas Eve
celebrations, died on Aug. 16 in Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich,
Conn. He was 89 and lived in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Thrower began his career as an advertising sales executive with
the ABC radio network in 1942. After serving as a Navy lieutenant
in World War II, he joined CBS as a sales executive and vice
president in the early 1950s, then became general manager of
WPIX-Channel 11, an independent station, in 1953. He held the
position for 19 years before becoming chairman in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he had the idea of televising a burning Yule log on
Christmas Eve for the benefit of people who had no hearth of their
own. The first log burned in the fireplace at Gracie Mansion, the
mayor's residence, accompanied by traditional Christmas music.
</P>
<P>
   During Thrower's tenure at the helm, WPIX faced a contentious
challenge to the renewal of its license by a group called Forum
Communications that sought, among other things, greater minority
representation in the station's leadership. The Federal
Communications Commission eventually renewed the license, but its
highly publicized hearing on the matter lasted five years.
</P>
<P>
   Thrower retired in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, F. Mitchell Thrower III of La Jolla,
Calif., and a daughter, Wendy Thrower Vigars of Mill Valley, Calif.

THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE BRUISES OF CAMP COWBOYS '99
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the Dallas Cowboys, Y2Camp at Wichita Falls, Texas, is over.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing about this town of 136,600 or its Midwestern
State University facilities that should keep the Cowboys from
coming back for a third training camp in 2000, although that
decision by owner Jerry Jones remains on hold.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, this was a camp of ups and down, temperatures of hot
and hotter, controversies that would fit inside a thimble, and far
more injuries than any team should have to endure in one month.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Kavika Pittman broke a hand within the first five
minutes of his first practice, with a freak fall during a one-man
dummy drill. He since has returned.
</P>
<P>
   But looking back, that was an omen.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver James McKnight, acquired from Seattle for a
third-round draft pick next year, has reason not to get the
warm-and-fuzzies about Wichita Falls. After all, his season ended
Aug. 5 when his cleats stuck in the unforgiving rug of Memorial
Stadium, causing him to tear ligaments in his left knee during a
non-contact, seven-on-seven drill during the Blue-White scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of the roster was either afflicted by injury or
bogged down with rehabilitation work on existing injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the memorable moments, both good and
not-too-good, that occurred during the 31 days of camp.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest non-story: Wide receiver Michael Irvin, who was supposed
be upset over coach Chan Gailey's plan to play him less in order to
save on Irvin's 33-year-old body. However, Irvin never fussed,
never missed a beat ... and couldn't tell the difference between
this camp and most of the previous 11.
</P>
<P>
   Second-biggest non-story: Defensive end Alonzo Spellman, who was
supposed to be a free-agent risk because of a bipolar disorder,
which led to a series of irrational behavior and police-related
incidents in the past, turned his 1998 release from the Chicago
Bears into little more than a footnote. Spellman has been effective
on the field _ moving this week to defensive tackle _ and causing
no stir off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest tease: Wide receiver Raghib `Rocket' Ismail, whose
slightly separated left shoulder (diving for a pass during an Aug.
4 practice) has kept him from making his Cowboys debut. `Rocket'
will make his first preseason appearance Sunday night against
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Second-biggest tease: Linebacker Quentin Coryatt, who has missed
most of camp and three preseason games with a strained hamstring
and Achilles' tendon. The No. 2 pick overall in the 1992 NFL draft,
at least for now, has lost his starting job to Darren Hambrick.
Gailey keeps the faith by recalling those images of Coryatt playing
against Pittsburgh when Gailey was offensive coordinator of the
Steelers.
</P>
<P>
   Best camp for a veteran: Tackle Flozell Adams, who has wasted
little time in readjusting to left tackle after being forced into
starting duty at right guard last season in place of the injured
Everett McIver. ``Flozell has had a great camp,'' Gailey said. When
asked to name the best left tackle in the game, Adams thought a
moment, then replied, ``Larry Allen but he doesn't play there
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Best camp for a rookie: Defensive end Peppi Zellner, who was
drafted in the fourth round, has proved to be much more than a good
basketball player from Fort Valley State. Zellner hasn't backed
down from even the biggest and the best in training camp _
including Erik Williams. An early camp injury to Pittman opened the
door for Zellner, and he has taken advantage of the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Worst camp for anybody: Offensive tackle Oliver Ross, who has
had a rough preseason with five holding penalties in three games.
But there are two games remaining before the final cutdown to 53,
and Ross has shown the coaches that he has a hold on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest surprise: Cornerback Duane Hawthorne, who more than
adequately replaced Kevin Smith, who replaced Deion Sanders at
right cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest disappointment: Defensive tackle Michael Myers, who is
trying to replace Leon Lett, whose fate is yet to be determined by
the league office. The jury is still out on Myers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Longest odyssey: Linebacker Dat Nguyen, who was conceived in
Vietnam, born in a Vietnamese refugee camp in Arkansas, and raised
in Rockport. He has made a rapid transition from Lombardi Trophy
winner at Texas A&AMP;M to rookie standout with the Cowboys.
Unofficially, Dat signed more autographs in camp than any other
Cowboy.
</P>
<P>
   Second-longest odyssey: Defensive end Ebenezer Ekuban, who was
born in Ghana, raised in Maryland and has made an equally rapid
ascent from North Carolina to signing a lucrative rookie contract
with the Cowboys for five years, $5.6 million, including a $3.5
million signing bonus. No Cowboys newcomer has impressed more
people in this camp than Ekuban with his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   Third-longest odyssey: Running back Chris Warren, who took a
week to fly to Colorado Springs, Colo., and back to receive
treatment for a recurring groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Best advertisement for orthopedic surgeons: Wane McGarity, who
leads all receivers with six catches, including three for
third-down conversions. Despite three knee surgeries ('92, '94, and
'97), McGarity gives the Cowboys much-needed speed at wide
receiver. He is especially sure-handed and can also return punts.
</P>
<P>
   Best-kept secret: Defensive tackle Brandon Noble, who doesn't
have the height, bulk or speed to play in the NFL. He just makes
plays.
</P>
<P>
   Second best-kept secret: Center Ben Fricke, who was signed as a
``camp body'' Aug. 3 because of injuries. Fricke is a long shot to
make the team, but that's a considerable leap from where he
started.
</P>
<P>
   Worst-kept secret: Jones' belief that the team, with healthy
quarterback Troy Aikman, is capable of winning Super Bowl XXXIV in
Atlanta. nn

OKLAHOMA STATE LINEBACKER SAVORS THE CHANCE TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 ST.-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What began as a summer-evening walk for munchies ended in
gunfire, physical and mental trauma and the realization for Jack
Golden that even good intentions can sometimes result in senseless
violence.
</P>
<P>
   And that sometimes, the peacemaker pays the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't know what can happen these days; you really
don't,'' said Golden, back as a key member of Oklahoma State's
highly regarded linebacking crew. ``Without going into it too much,
it was one of those things of being in the wrong place at the wrong
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden was shot in the right calf in a drive-by shooting on July
10, 1998. The incident occurred a few minutes after he broke up an
argument between a teammate and an unknown group at a combination
gas station-food mart near the OSU campus. And if blessings ever
come from the barrel of a .38 caliber revolver, then Golden counts
one of his as being able to finish his collegiate playing days with
28 other OSU seniors.
</P>
<P>
   What happened ``is one of those things that's not bothering me
right now, though at the time it was mentally rough,'' he said.
``It was a humbling experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know what? I'm glad to get to come back and play with
teammates like Kenyatta Wright, Tarrell Knauls and Raymond Cato.
It's ironic that something like that would happen to work out for
the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden could have played last season, though he figures he might
not have been in football shape until the second or third game.
Playing a partial season wasn't the way he wanted to go out. And
having Golden back only adds to an already good situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always like Jack's demeanor,'' Cowboys coach Bob Simmons
said. ``He's a heck of an individual _ personable, athletic, a lot
of speed. He's always had the promise of being a big-time
linebacker. He took the redshirt year to build himself up, and I
look for him to step up to the plate and (become) that.''
</P>
<P>
   Knauls, Wright and Cato have combined for 60 starts. Dwayne
Levels is coming off a solid redshirt freshman season. Sophomore
Jake Riffe and redshirt freshman Terrence Robinson have coaches
excited about their potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our linebackers have the potential to be the best we've had,''
Simmons said. ``They are all gifted athletically. If they accept
the challenge of going in and playing up to their capabilities as
we believe they will _ well, we'll answer that question as to
whether or not they're the best at the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Knauls says the defense is planning 12 shutouts as the Cowboys'
focus has become atonement for a 5-6 season. Golden has witnessed
that sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I sat back last year and watched the games, the team's
attitude and stuff, it was disappointing to me to see us go 5-6,''
Golden said. ``We were lacking in some things. And there was an
emphasis during three-a-days to get those little things taken care
of so the big things fall into place.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys have been generally snubbed in preseason
consideration despite the defensive potential and the return of
players like quarterback Tony Lindsay, a three-deep situation at
tailback and a solid core of seniors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have made a difference had we gone to a bowl last
year,'' Simmons said. ``I like (being overlooked) in a sense. But
what we do now in ``our'' minds and how we end up the season is the
most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State capsule Coach: Bob Simmons (22-24, 5th season).
</P>
<P>
   1998: 5-6 overall, 3-5 in Big 12, T-4th in South Division.
</P>
<P>
   Returning starters: 5 offense, 5 defense.
</P>
<P>
   What has to go right: The Cowboys must capitalize on the
leadership of an unusually large senior class, Tony Lindsay's
renewed attitude, top-notch defensive expectations and make good on
a vow to eliminate last season's costly mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   What can't go wrong: OSU doesn't yet feel good about any backup
quarterbacks. Losing Lindsay to injury could spoil South Division
title hopes.
</P>
<P>
   Update: The Cowboys should enjoy three-deep luxury at tailback,
though Nathan Simmons has not had any contact work since an
off-season knee operation. Returning alternate Jamaal Fobbs and
sophomore Reggie White add quality depth. ... Bob Simmons says he's
debating on a No. 2 QB, indicating sophomore B.J. Tiger hasn't put
any distance between himself and freshmen Aso Pogi and Ben Bowling.
... Simmons also said he has never seen Lindsay sharper. ... OSU is
counting on a more aggressive cover scheme and some position
changes under former Baylor defensive coordinator Mike Cassity to
eliminate the long-distance completions (10 plays longer than 34
yards) that plagued the defense last season. ... Top offensive
lineman Adam Davis, the anchor of a group that lost a combined 66
starts, rejoined practice this week after recuperating from
off-season arthroscopic knee surgery. nn

TRIUMPH, TRAGEDY MARK COMETS' THIRD TITLE QUEST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two deaths and a divorce. Plus work ... and win. This is what
the Houston Comets deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two weeks have been real hard for me,'' Houston coach
Van Chancellor said. ``I wish it didn't have to happen this way,
but all of this made us realize just how fragile life is and how
special playing and competing as a team is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets have had to overcome more obstacles this season than
most teams do in a decade, yet nothing changed in terms of game
results. After finishing with the league's best record _ 26-6 _ for
the third consecutive season, the two-time WNBA champions play at
Los Angeles (20-12) in the best-of-three Western Conference finals
at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   The problems started before the season when Sheryl Swoopes
endured a difficult divorce. Later, Cynthia Cooper's mother died
from cancer. Shorty thereafter, doctors diagnosed guard Kim Perrot
with cancer. Her seven-month fight against the disease ended last
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of ths comes from Kim; she had so much fight,''
Chancellor said. ``I think they (his players) are scared because
they don't want to let Kim down, and I think that comes from
Cynthia Cooper.''
</P>
<P>
   One game after the death of her close friend, Cooper led the
Comets to a victory at Sacramento, scoring 27 points with 10
assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not bet against Houston,'' said Detroit coach Nancy
Lieberman-Cline, whose Shock was eliminated from the playoffs by
Charlotte. ``There is a lot of love and caring around that team for
what Kim meant as a teammate and a person. She was their glue
between (Sheryl) Swoopes and (Cynthia) Cooper.''
</P>
<P>
   That glue will be pulled by the Sparks, who split the four-game
season series with Houston; those two defeats are one-third of the
Comets' 1999 losses.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that has been marked as a heavy underdog, Los Angeles
has two advantages. One, the Sparks are host to Game 1. In last
season's Western Conference finals, Houston lost at Phoenix in Game
1 before rallying to win at home in overtime in Game 2 and
eventually the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like this format because I don't think it gives the
team that had the best record the home-court advantage,''
Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' other advantage is a bench that outscored the
Comets' bench by an average of 7.5 points in the series. For a team
that had little playoff experience before Tuesday, those are
reasons to literally exhale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't breathe in the beginning,'' said LA reserve Allison
Feaster, whose team rallied from an 11-point halftime deficit to
defeat the Sacramento Monarchs in the first round. ``But a team
like Houston would take a 10-point lead and make it 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Over in the East, New York accomplished its goal set at the
beginning of the season by earning the conference's best record
(18-14). However, the Liberty faces a Charlotte team, at 7 p.m.
Friday, that is as predictable as a roulette wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The Sting entered the playoffs on a five-game losing streak but
won at Detroit in the first round. More disconcerting to Liberty
coach Richie Adubato is the fact that his team has lost the last
two games to Charlotte and has had no answers for the combination
of Rhonda Mapp and Vicky Bullet. The pair averaged more than 22
points and 15 rebounds against the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two present difficult matchups for us,'' Adubato said.
``We have to control (Dawn) Staley. We also must refocus and try to
get motivated again. We've accomplished our goals we set in the
beginning of the season. Now, our goals are to win the East and to
win a championship.''

RANGERS, LOAIZA FINALLY SOLVE YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Right-hander Esteban Loaiza, who this spring
pitched himself out of the Rangers' rotation, delivered a statement
last night to manager Johnny Oates.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza let it be known through his pitching performance that he
wants to be a part of the Rangers' postseason rotation, and beating
the defending World Series champion New York Yankees at The
Ballpark in Arlington spoke volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza pitched seven effective innings during the Rangers' 7-3
victory after right-handers John Burkett and Mike Morgan combined
for only 6 2/3 the previous two starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about track records,'' Oates said of Loaiza, ``and
since the All-Star break, the team is 8-0 in games he's pitched.
This is what we've been waiting for. We've been waiting for him to
back it up. We're talking about seven starts now. This is exciting
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza (7-1) allowed the Yankees only three runs and none after
a third-inning, solo home run by first baseman Tino Martinez during
his 94-pitch effort. The victory improved Loaiza to 6-0 with a 2.82
earned-run average through six starts since joining the rotation
July 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his decision if I pitch in the postseason, but it would
be a dream,'' said Loaiza, who allowed only three base runners in
his final 3 1/3 innings last night. ``I didn't even get a chance to
throw a pitch last year in the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates dismissed talk of the Rangers' postseason rotation as
premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make the postseason,'' the manager said, ``before I
start making postseason plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Loaiza let it be known that it will be difficult to
dislodge him.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Yankees' two-run first inning and Martinez's home run
did not faze him. Loaiza battled and kept pitching scoreless
innings while the Rangers rallied with a four-run third inning that
included consecutive run-scoring singles by second baseman Mark
McLemore, catcher Ivan Rodriguez and left fielder Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez then gave the Rangers a lead that
Loaiza never relinquished with his sacrifice fly that scored
Rodriguez from third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to let go of that lead,'' said Loaiza, who
benefited from the defensive efforts of McLemore, Gonzalez, center
fielder Tom Goodwin and shortstop Royce Clayton. ``I can't do the
job all by myself. You've got to give them credit, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers built a 6-3 lead with a two-run sixth inning that
included a solo home run by Rafael Palmeiro and a run-scoring
single by Lee Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Loaiza did not want to leave the mound with that three-run lead,
and he became angry in the dugout after being informed in the
bottom of the seventh inning that his work was done. Loaiza
responded by ripping off his jacket in the dugout and slinging it
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep on going,'' Loaiza said. ``We had a 6-3 lead,
but it's the manager's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman and closer John Wetteland pitched
the eighth and ninth innings to complete the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing strikes and hitting the corners,'' Loaiza said,
``and that's what I've been doing lately.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to make a strong pitch for the Rangers' postseason
rotation.

HASKINS LEFT LEGACY THAT MADE HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bear has gone into hibernation.
</P>
<P>
   When UT-El Paso coach Don Haskins announced his retirement late
Tuesday afternoon, effective immediately, college basketball lost a
pioneer, an icon and a legend. Haskins _ nicknamed The Bear _ will
forever be known as the coach who helped break the color barrier in
college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, after all these years, I still get black players,
coaches, people, coming up to me and thanking me for what I did,''
Haskins said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1965-66 season, Haskins played his best lineup. That
his five best players were black caused a minor stir wherever Texas
Western, the school's name then, played. That stir became a vortex
on March 19, 1966, when the Miners played Kentucky for the national
championship in College Park, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky was coached by Adolph Rupp, who had consistently
resisted integration. His lineup was all white. That added a social
context to a game expected to be a blowout. Kentucky was a heavy
favorite to win its fifth national championship, partly because it
was Kentucky, partly because Texas Western was unknown and partly
because (it was whispered) an all-black team couldn't beat an
all-white team.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Western 72, Kentucky 65 caused college basketball to quake
and change.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other national championship that's ever been won
by any other coach, that team did more for the sport,'' said
Arkansas coach Nolan Richardson, an El Paso native who played for
Haskins. ``The significance of that championship will go down in
history to every black as `The Beginning.' Any black person who was
around at that time, you have to remember 1966.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Adolph Rupp said that was his best team,'' said Pittsburg
(Kan.) State coach Gene Iba, a former Haskins assistant and former
head coach at Baylor. ``I think it's great people remember him for
that. That was one of the great underdog victories of all time.
That's a (Jim) Valvano story.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Haskins will be remembered for that championship and
its social impact, his legacy also includes longevity and loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Enid, Okla., spent his entire career at UTEP _ 38
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unbelievable I've been here this long,'' said
Haskins, who was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball
Hall of Fame in 1997. ``I don't know what it's like to have
somebody get on me. We've had some down times, but I've been pretty
lucky. I looked at the paper today ... it's like I'm a damn hero.''
</P>
<P>
   His 719 victories rank 10th on the all-time list. Many of those
victories were accomplished with hand-me-down players. Certainly,
players like Nate Archibald, Tim Hardaway, Jim Barnes and Antonio
Davis were outstanding, but El Paso is a basketball outpost. Of the
22 top scorers in school history, only eight are from Texas and
only two from El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closest civilized population (in the United States) of
more than 30,000 is Albuquerque and that's 250 miles away,'' Iba
said. ``Dallas is 600 miles away. El Paso is a great town, but
that's a tough basketball job. It's a long, hard haul to get
players in there. Don taught those people out there about
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who coached against him would tell you there was
nobody they liked to play against less. He would beat you with less
talent. His teams were mentally tough because of Don Haskins. He
came closer to willing teams to play and win than anybody. He spent
a lot of years pushing rocks up the hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskins played college basketball at Oklahoma A&AMP;M under the
legendary Henry Iba. While Haskins the player had problems adapting
to Iba's defense-first-last-and-always system, Haskins the coach
kept the Iba legacy alive. His teams were hard-nosed,
defensive-minded and rarely took a bad shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always measured every coach against him and none has
been able to compare,'' said Chicago Bulls coach Tim Floyd, a
former UTEP assistant who credits his coaching success to Haskins.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins had been contemplating retirement since midway through
last season. It had been reported that the 1999-2000 season would
be his last. But willing another team through a season was not
something Haskins wanted to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that I just sort of got tired of it all,''
Haskins said of coaching. ``Everybody said there has to be a reason
for this, that I'm mad at somebody or somebody's mad at me. Nothing
like that. It was just time. I didn't need to be here another
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskins, 69, underwent triple-bypass surgery in 1996 after
suffering a mild heart attack. This year, he had a pacemaker
installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good; my health is not a reason for me making this
decision,'' said Haskins, who plans to do some part-time consulting
with the Bulls. ``Everybody is telling me I look good. I ran into
this 91-year-old fella at the health club and he said there are the
three stages of life _ you're young, you're middle-aged and you're
looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Iba said that Haskins is ``one of the most bashful people
I've ever known.'' For Haskins' sake, it's good he retired when he
did. Now, there won't be a ``Don Haskins Farewell Tour'' around the
Western Athletic Conference this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, I wouldn't like anything like that,'' Haskins said.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins was unique. He was a pickup and open-collar shirt guy.
We won't see his kind again in college basketball. This breed of
Bear is extinct.
Haskins facts His 38 seasons at UT-El Paso was second in longevity
among active coaches at one school. Jim Phelan has coached at Mount
St. Mary's for 44 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   As coach of Texas Western in 1966, he led the Miners to the NCAA
championship. That remains the only Division I basketball title won
by a school from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   His 719 victories rank 10th all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins is one of 13 coaches with 700 or more victories. He
recorded his 700th with a 66-64 victory against SMU on Jan. 3,
1998, in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   UTEP won seven Western Athletic Conference titles under Haskins,
the most recent coming in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Miners made 14 NCAA Tournament appearances under Haskins,
including seven consecutive from 1984 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   UT-El Paso's last NCAA Tournament appearance was 1992. In the
second round, the Miners upset top-seeded Kansas, 66-60, before
losing to Cincinnati, 69-67.
</P>
<P>
   School record of 12 coaches before Haskins: 417-432, .491
winning percentage, no NCAA Tournament appearances.
</P>
<P>
   School record with Haskins: 719-353, .670 winning percentage, 14
NCAA Tournament appearances. nn

CHESTER BROOKS KERR, 86, SCHOLARS' EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Conn.)  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chester Brooks Kerr, a leading figure in both commercial and
noncommercial book publishing, died on Sunday in an extended-care
facility in New London, N.H. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr had previously lived in New Haven, said his son John.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning 30 years, Kerr worked as the top editor or
editorial director of Harcourt, Brace &AMP; Co., Atlantic Monthly
Press, Yale University Press, Reynal &AMP; Hitchcock and Ticknor &AMP;
Fields, a division of Houghton Mifflin Co..
</P>
<P>
   As a commercial publisher, he counted among his prize
acquisitions Eugene O'Neill's bleak drama ``Long Day's Journey Into
Night,'' Calvin Trillin's frolicsome ``Third Helpings'' and Sir
John Masterman's grim tale of espionage ``The Double-Cross System
in the War of 1939 to 1945.''
</P>
<P>
   The books he published in his 20 years at Yale reaped a number
of Pulitzer Prizes, National Book Awards and Bancroft Prizes, but
Kerr was best known in the industry for his report on the status of
scholarly publishing, which became known as ``the Kerr report.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, invited by the Association of American University
Presses to analyze their industry, Kerr studied each of the 35
university presses then in existence. He concluded that
noncommercial publishers were becoming increasingly like their
commercial counterparts, adopting their distribution and marketing
methods. But he added that the university presses would never
become self-supporting if they maintained their primary goal, the
scholarly quality of their publications.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the report came, Kerr was interviewed by Publishers
Weekly, the trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scholarly publishing is the third function of the university,
without which it is incomplete,'' he said. ``There is the faculty,
for teaching and research; the library, as a storehouse of
knowledge, and, to complete the act, you have to have the
publishing house.'' Kerr added that when the well-known bibliophile
and author Wilmarth Lewis had once tried to make the same point to
the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer, he got nowhere until he wrote
on a blackboard: ``Faculty + Library (EQ) Publication.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr also defended the practice of some university presses of
publishing ``works of scholarship with commercial potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our way,'' he said, ``of trying to place the university
press in the mainstream of contributions to society. If _ within
the boundaries of scholarship always _ we can make a contribution
to culture, to politics, to the environment, then we shouldn't
stand aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerr went on to say that he had managed to keep Yale University
Press solvent while others failed by ``the stained-glass
approach,'' persuading wealthy alumni to memorialize distinguished
relatives by donating a publication fund in their memory to the
university press.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr was not reticent about his mistakes. In 1976 he jokingly
told a reporter for The New York Times that he had rejected a
manuscript called ``God and Golem Inc.'' by Norbert Wiener,
considered the father of cybernetics, because no one on his staff
could make head or tail of it. The manuscript was then submitted to
the M.I.T. Press and immediately accepted, although, Kerr said, he
had been told that no one at M.I.T. had even opened the book. ``God
and Golem Inc.'' won a National Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Aug. 5, 1913, in Norwalk, Conn., Kerr graduated from
Yale in 1936. He left Atlantic Monthly Press in 1942 to serve
during World War II as chief of the Book Division of the Office of
War Information. From 1965 to 1967, he served as president of the
Association of American University Presses, and from 1975 to 1978
he was a consultant to the Ford Foundation's publishing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kerr's wife, the former Joan Paterson, died in 1995. In addition
to his son John, of Lincoln, Mass., Kerr is survived by three other
sons, Philip, of Ann Arbor, Mich., Alexander, of Philadelphia, and
Brooks, of New York City; a daughter, Claudia Kerr Grose of
Cambridge, Mass.; three step-children, and 13 grandchildren. &QL;

SCHWAB STOCK RISING AMONG SATISFIED INVESTORS, SURVEY SAYS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGOURA HILLS, Calif. _ Online traders gave Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.
Inc. top honors for customer satisfaction, according to a survey
released Wednesday by J.D. Power and Associates.
</P>
<P>
   In its first Online Trading Customer Satisfaction Study, Agoura
Hills-based J.D. Power ranked Schwab _ the nation's largest online
brokerage _ ahead of Fidelity Investments, Datek Online and 11
other major online operations.
</P>
<P>
   The study ranked each company based on six areas that constitute
what J.D. Power calls ``overall investment satisfaction'': customer
service, information/education, integrity/reputation, processing,
portfolio management and fees/commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab scored a 110 overall, followed by Fidelity at 108 and
Datek Online at 105. The industry average was 100.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew ``Skip'' March, director for financial services for J.D.
Power, said the study revealed that customer service, not price,
was the most important factor for customer satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Price is not necessarily what's going to build loyalty,''
March said. ``It's building the relationship and the brand with the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   That relationship is especially vital for an online brokerage
because its competitors are just a few mouse clicks away, March
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Amar Mehta of CIBC World Markets said price is still
important, especially for people who only dabble in online trading.
</P>
<P>
   But as online investors mature and begin to look for more
comprehensive services from their online brokerage, Mehta said,
``cost is not going to play as important a role as it does now.''
</P>
<P>
   The J.D. Power study found the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average online investor is 37 years old and has been
active in the market for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Men constitute about 59percent of online traders and are more
active than their female counterparts, conducting an average of
45percent more trades annually.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nearly 90percent of survey respondents said they would trade
after the close of markets if allowed that option.
</P>
<P>
   The J.D. Power study was based on direct customer feedback from
2,740 online investors nationwide. It was funded by J.D. Power, a
nationally recognized consumer research company, and will now be
sold to online brokerages and other businesses.

OPENER LOOKING GOOD FOR HUNTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM MATTHEWS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. _ By most accounts, the Sept. 1 early
dove-hunting season opener is shaping up to be bountiful in
Southern California, especially in the state's southeast corner _ a
mecca for the bird's pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of a series of tropical thunderstorms that drenched
portions of the desert area in July _ and threats of more heavy
rains before the opener _ dove numbers appear to be higher than
last year at this time in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of late hatches, I think the dove population is better
than what I had forecast earlier this year,'' said Sam Blankenship,
an associate wildlife biologist and upland game specialist with the
Department of Fish and Game in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   Early dove season runs through Sept. 15; the late season is Nov.
13 to Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   Call counts and nesting surveys by the DFG and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service reveal dove numbers are similar to that of 1998 in
California, but Arizona mourning dove numbers declined slightly
because of storms during the main nesting season this spring and
summer. This comes after several years of dove increases in
Arizona, largely attributed to new half-day hunting restrictions.
Often teeming with doves, the Yuma, Ariz., region is a popular
destination among California hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewing dove numbers in California and Arizona are up; these
birds seem to be particularly numerous this year all along the
Colorado River and throughout the Coachella Valley in Riverside
County and the Imperial Valley in Imperial County.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a downside, it is that desert rains have served to
scatter birds. The availability of water and good feed conditions
in the desert means that birds are not reliant on a few sources, so
they will be less concentrated. Any kind of major storm activity is
generally thought to run whitewing doves south and disperse
mourning doves off established patterns. It has happened before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this year is shaping up like (the strong season)
last year, but it could all change tomorrow,'' said Blythe game
warden Rich Colby.
</P>
<P>
   At the Colorado River, there were more birds in the north end of
Riverside County's Palo Verde Valley than last year. ``There are
good numbers of birds still, in spite of the monsoon rains. The
citrus on the mesa is still holding a lot of whitewings,'' said
Wayne Pinkerton at B&AMP;B Bait in Blythe.
</P>
<P>
   Pinkerton said the amount of wheat in the valley was way down
this year, but freshly harvested melon fields have been attracting
and holding many whitewings. There also is more corn in the valley
than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Farther south, the Cibola Valley and Cibola National Wildlife
Refuge has held large concentrations of both mourning doves and
whitewings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks pretty good. There are tons of dove around and lots
and lots of whitewings,'' said refuge manager Mike Hawkes, who
noted evening flights of whitewings along the Colorado River north
of the refuge have been impressive and should provide good
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   To the west in Imperial Valley, experts are gearing up for a
strong dove season, even with rains earlier in the summer that
seemed to disperse the birds. ``I've seen more whitewings than I've
seen in years,'' said Leon Lessica with Desert Wildlife Unlimited
Inc. ``I think it will be a pretty fair shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Lessica believes many Imperial Valley farmers should be
commended for continuing to allow hunters on their lands. ``Most of
the farmers are really super, super good about that. They don't
post their ground (with `no hunting' signs) much, and if you pick
up your empties and trash you are still welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Three fields of safflower will make the shoot much better than
last year at Imperial County's Imperial Wildlife Area, according to
refuge manager Pam Cherny. Two fields are on the Wister Unit,
northwest of Niland, and one is found at the Finney-Ramer Unit
south of Calipatria; all three fields are holding loads of birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a lot of whitewings _ more than last year,'' Cherny
said. Maps with directions to the fields are available for hunters,
she noted.
</P>
<P>
   During brood-count surveys for quail and chukar closer to home
in the Mojave Desert, DFG biologist Andy Pauli found dove
populations to be plentiful on traditional springs and man-made
water guzzlers between Apple Valley and Barstow in San Bernardino
County. Unfortunately, dove numbers there are down from last year _
which was a banner dove season for the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were heavy rains in spots throughout West Mojave, and it
has really greened up. There is still standing water in some
places,'' Pauli said recently.

   Hot weather will tend to concentrate the birds early and late in
the day on water sources in the desert and hunters should have good
success on flyways to the water. Major wash corridors also are
populated throughout the day, but finding the right location often
requires thorough scouting. Hunters are reminded that sitting on
desert springs or guzzlers for more than 30 minutes is illegal. &QL;

EXPERT TIPS
</P>
<P>
   Dove hunting is as good an introduction to the recreation as any
form of pursuing game. Observations and tips to make the experience
as productive as possible for newcomers, as offered by veteran
Valencia birder Derek Fong of the Santa Clarita Valley chapter of
Quail Unlimited:
</P>
<P>
   __ ``It's fun, social hunting. It's not solitary, like deer
hunting. It's a sport that you can take the entire family to and
pretty much drive right to your hunting location. Most of all, the
hunter can see instant gratification and success.''
</P>
<P>
   __ ``Hunting with a group of 25 to 40 people is not uncommon.
And when you have a good population of doves, the more the merrier
because the hunters keep the birds stirred and flying.''
</P>
<P>
   __ ``Take new hunters to a target-rich environment and don't
shortchange them. Don't buy them one box of shells. Buy at least 6
boxes (at 25 rounds per box of 12- or 20-gauge shells). Figure at
least five shots for every bird (with a daily bag limit of 10 doves
and 20 in possession), if not seven shots to one bird, or more.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fong recommends visiting the Bard and Winterhaven areas of
Southeastern Imperial Valley. ``It's the hub, the dove capital of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   __ ``Wear clothes that will blend in. A desert camouflage
T-shirt and hat; no need for full camo. Brown is OK for hiding near
bushes.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Have plenty of water, sunscreen, insect repellent and
something to sit on _ a hunting stool, box or bucket. This is often
a sedentary recreation. Most important, have your hunting license.
</P>
<P>
   __ ``I wouldn't call it easy hunting, so the final tip is that
the hunter go out to the local shooting range and get familiarized
or refamiliarized with the shotgun and then practice shooting a
couple of rounds of skeet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For an 11th hour hunter-safety course _ a prerequisite for a
hunting license _ call Quail Unlimited, (661) 296-2519, or the
Department of Fish and Game, (562) 590-5670 or (562) 590-5185. &QL;

ALEXANDRE LAGOYA DIES AT 70; INNOVATIVE CLASSICAL GUITARIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France)  (js) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alexandre Lagoya, a guitarist known for the elegance and
textural clarity of his performances, both as part of a duet with
his first wife, Ida Presti, and later as a soloist, died in Paris
on Tuesday after what the Agence France-Presse reported was a long
illness. He was 70 and lived in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Lagoya had a wide repertory that ranged from Baroque works he
transcribed for the guitar, through the standard 19th- and
20th-century Spanish guitar literature, to such crossover endeavors
as Claude Bolling's jazzy ``Picnic Suite.'' In the 1980s he
performed frequently with the flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal. The two
made several recordings together, including a live album recorded
on one of several U.S. tours in which they were recital partners.
</P>
<P>
   Lagoya was born in 1929 in Alexandria, Egypt, of Greek and
Italian parents. He began playing the guitar when he was 8 and gave
his first public recital when he was 13. He was also an amateur
boxer at the time, and when he played his debut concert, he had a
black eye that he had received in a match a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 19, he had given about 500 concerts
throughout the Middle East and decided to move to Paris to continue
his studies. He became a student of Jean Saudry, and studied
harmony and counterpoint with the Brazilian composer Villa-Lobos.
Shortly after his arrival in Paris, he was invited to perform for a
classical guitar society, and it was at that concert that he met
Ms. Presti, who was already a celebrity, having made her first
recording in 1934, when she was 10.
</P>
<P>
   On the spot, Ms. Presti declared Lagoya the best guitarist she
had ever heard. They were soon married, and from 1950 until her
death in 1967, they each gave up their solo work and performed
exclusively as a duo. At the time, Andres Segovia and other
guitarists were fighting to establish solo careers in a classical
musical world that still regarded the guitar as a folk instrument;
duos were comparatively rare. But by transcribing keyboard works _
pieces by Bach, Scarlatti, Debussy, Falla and Granados were among
their staples _ the couple assembled a repertory that they later
expanded through commissioning.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first new works composed for them, a set of 24
Preludes and Fugues by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, was undertaken at
the urging of Segovia, who attended the New York debut of the
Presti and Lagoya duo in the early 1950s and was so taken with
their performance that he wrote to the composer and asked him to
consider writing for two guitars. Castelnuovo-Tedesco also wrote
them a Concerto for Two Guitars. Andre Jolivet, Pierre Petit,
Federico Moreno Torroba and Joaquin Rodrigo wrote music for Ms.
Presti and Lagoya as well.
</P>
<P>
   Besides commissioning new works, Lagoya and Ms. Presti
reconsidered the technique of the guitar. One of their innovations
involved using the right side of the fingernail instead of the left
side, which most guitarists use. Lagoya said he believed that this
allowed for greater projection of sound. This technique has not
been widely adopted, but another technique that he and Ms. Presti
developed _ the cross-string trill _ is now an important element of
modern guitar technique. Instead of playing a trill on a single
string, Lagoya and Ms. Presti played it across two strings, so that
each note could ring out clearly. The effect was a trill that had
the clarity listeners associated with keyboards rather than
stringed instruments.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Presti died, during a tour of the United States, Lagoya
took a yearlong hiatus to reconsider his career and relearn some of
the solo works that he had neglected during his 17 years as part of
a duo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult,'' he later said of his return as a
soloist, ``not so much to play, but to play alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagoya remarried; his second wife, Monelle, survives him, as do
a daughter, Elisabeth, and a son, Sylvain.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1970s he was again touring regularly and making
frequent recordings, mostly for CBS Masterworks (now Sony
Classical). His recording of Bolling's Concerto for Guitar and Jazz
Piano gave his career a boost by attracting a crossover audience
that had already been charmed by the Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano
that Bolling had composed for Rampal. Bolling composed the ``Picnic
Suite'' for Lagoya and Rampal. Rampal is also the conductor on one
of Lagoya's concerto recordings.
</P>
<P>
   Lagoya taught for many years at the National Conservatory in
Paris and at the International Academy of Music in Nice.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The Rockets are involved in discussions with the Vancouver
Grizzlies that could land them Steve Francis, the No. 2 pick in the
1999 NBA draft.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francis, who has made it clear he does not want to play for the
Grizzlies, would be packaged along with Michael Smith, Lee
Mayberry, Tony Massenburg and possibly Rodrick Rhodes in exchange
for the Rockets' Michael Dickerson, Othella Harrington, Brent Price
and Antoine Carr.
</P>
<P>
   As is their custom, the Rockets would not comment on rumors or
possible player moves.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say the key to the deal from the Rockets' perspective is
getting Francis, a 6-3 guard who, because of his explosive and
spectacular scoring ability, has drawn comparisons to
Philadelphia's Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Francis, who started his college career at San Jacinto College,
where he averaged 12.5 points in 1996-97, averaged 17 points last
season at Maryland, shooting 52.3 percent from the field. He also
averaged 2.8 steals per game.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies are apparently keen on getting Dickerson, a 6-5
shooting guard, and reuniting him with point guard Michael Bibby.
The two not only were teammates at Arizona but roommates as well,
and the Grizzlies foresee a seamless transition in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   And Harrington would give them a strong low-post presence,
freeing Shareef Abdur-Rahim to face the basket more as a small
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver had been mulling an offer from Detroit that would have
swapped Francis and whatever flotsam the Grizzlies could throw in
for Jerry Stackhouse and Loy Vaught. But the Grizzlies reportedly
have soured on that deal, concerned about Vaught's back. Vaught
underwent surgery Dec. 15, 1997, to repair a degenerative disk
condition after playing just 10 games for the Los Angeles Clippers.
The 6-9 power forward, who signed a five-year, $22.5 million deal
with Detroit, averaged just 3.4 points and 3.9 rebounds for the
Pistons last season.
</P>
<P>
   And the Grizzlies were just as concerned with what is perceived
to be a prima-donna attitude displayed by Stackhouse, who averaged
14.5 points for the Pistons last season but shot just 37.1 percent
from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The shaky alliance between Francis and the Grizzlies took
another turn this week when the New York-based Edelman Public
Relations firm said Francis has scheduled a news conference for
noon Friday in his hometown of Takoma Park, Md. Rumblings around
Vancouver are that if Francis is not traded, he could announce he
would sit out the year and re-enter the draft next season. Edelman
representative Peter Land would say only that the subject of the
news conference was ``basketball-related.''
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver general manager Stu Jackson doesn't know what to make
of Francis' news conference _ or his unwillingness to play in
Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to wait, but I'm not going to wait with bated
breath,'' Jackson said Wednesday. ``I don't know what he's going to
announce. But I'll tell you this: Any announcement that he has
isn't going to lever us one way or the other. We're going to do
what's in the best interest of our club when we feel we have to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done everything we possibly can. It's not just myself;
it's the entire organization that has bent over backward to try to
address every issue that Steve has. All we're trying to do is hand
him over $9 million (the slotted rookie deal Francis would receive
as the No. 2 pick) and make him a very well-known basketball
player.''

CONSTANTINE S. NICANDROS, 66, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF CONOCO OIL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Constantine S. Nicandros, a former chairman of Conoco Inc., the
multinational oil and gas company, and a leading patron of the arts
in his adopted hometown, Houston, died Monday at a hospital in
Houston. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, according to a statement released by his
son, Steve C. Nicandros of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Nicandros spent 39 years at Conoco, eventually becoming
president and chief executive from 1985 to 1995 and then chairman
for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Nicandros also served as an executive vice president and later a
vice chairman of E.I. du Pont de Nemours &AMP; Co., which merged with
Conoco in 1981; Conoco became a separate company again in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the arts, Nicandros served on the boards of the Houston Grand
Opera, the Houston Symphony, Houston Ballet Foundation and the
Museum of Fine Arts. He was also a former chairman of the symphony
and the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine Stavros Nicandros was born to Greek parents in Port
Said, Egypt, on Aug. 2, 1933. He graduated from the Ecole des
Hautes Etudes Commerciales in Paris and got a law degree and a
doctorate in economics from the University of Paris and an MBA from
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Fluent in seven languages, Nicandros joined Conoco in 1957 in
Houston as a research associate in the planning department. By
1966, he had advanced to the post of director of economic planning
and by 1978 was executive vice president for worldwide supply and
distribution. When Conoco merged with Du Pont in 1981, Nicandros
was co-chairman of the merger committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nicandros was thought to be the first foreign-born chief
executive of a major U.S. oil company. He was also chairman of the
American Petroleum Institute. After he left Conoco, he ran CSN &AMP;
Co., a private investment firm. He also served on several corporate
boards, as well as on the board of trustees of Baylor College of
Medicine and at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, Nicandros is survived by his wife,
Tassie; a daughter, Vicky Elliot of Houston, and four
grandchildren.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
NEW YORK _ If the National League playoffs began today, the Astros
probably would have to face New York Mets pitching and not Atlanta
Braves pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, that seems like a disconcerting thought for Astros
manager Larry Dierker.
</P>
<P>
   Mets pitching, which was supposed to be the weakest part of this
strong team, yet again quieted Astros bats Wednesday night in the
latest big-game disappointment for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   And it was all so confounding for Dierker after Wednesday
night's 4-0 loss to the Mets at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker expected better things from his offense in this
important series, but he got only the four-run 10th-inning outburst
in Tuesday night's 5-1 victory, the only Astros win of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for that one inning,'' Dierker said Wednesday, ``we
really didn't hit the ball a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   If you mentioned playoffs to Dierker after the Astros' dismal
loss to the Mets on Wednesday night, you got this response: ``I
just hope that we'll be there. I don't know. If we keep playing
like this, we don't have to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the playoff chase stands, the Astros hold a slight NL Central
Division lead over the Cincinnati Reds, the Braves and the Mets are
locked in a battle in the NL East and the Arizona Diamondbacks are
running away with the West.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros look like a playoff team, and somewhere down the road
you have to think Cincinnati's inexperience will show _ perhaps
Sept. 28-29 when the Reds come to the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   But who would have thought the pitching staff against which the
Astros might stand a better chance in the playoffs would be the
Braves' bunch? Just two weeks ago, the Astros managed 12 runs in
three games against Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz.
</P>
<P>
   A case could be made that the Astros could have won each of
those games, but mental mistakes and big Braves hits led to their
getting swept.
</P>
<P>
   But here amid the din of Shea Stadium against the likes of the
previously struggling Masato Yoshii, Al Leiter and Wednesday's
starter, Kenny Rogers, the Astros had an all but impossible time.
</P>
<P>
   The 10th-inning barrage Tuesday that led the way to the only win
of the series came against Mets reliever Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had that one inning,'' Dierker said, ``but except for that,
there wasn't a lot we could do.''
</P>
<P>
   On the way out of New York, where his team dropped two of three
against its potential playoff opponent, Dierker couldn't help but
voice serious concern. And it was all about the last thing anyone
previously considered a problem area, especially Dierker: the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst slump we've been in all year,'' Dierker
said. ``It seems like every hitter is lunging. We're not patient.
We're swinging at bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to wholly endorse Dierker's opinion, considering
the Astros have won seven of their last 11 games despite the bad
New York experience.
</P>
<P>
   They also have thrown up a few crooked numbers along the way and
have hit 11 home runs on this five-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
   But it is true that when the Astros haven't made a lot of noise
with their bats, those bats have been all but silent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's shutout marked the third time this month the
Astros have been blanked. Previously, they were shut out only twice
for the season.
</P>
<P>
   One night before Rogers' 8-inning, seven-hit effort, the Astros
could muster little against Yoshii.
</P>
<P>
   And the night before that, after Leiter led the way to a 3-2
Mets win, Dierker said he believed last year's Astros offense would
have chased Leiter early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But not this offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just not an offensive team anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Dierker gave Rogers credit for battling, he couldn't
believe Rogers' floating changeup and 86-mph fastball could so
confuse his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was some of the slowest stuff we've seen all year,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The principal spokesmen for the Astros _ Jeff Bagwell and Craig
Biggio _ begged to differ with their manager.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell credited Rogers for consistently changing speeds well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of guys out in front,'' Bagwell said. ``To his
(Rogers') credit, he kept the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Biggio: ``(Mets shortstop) Rey Ordonez can make you look
like you're in a slump. Anything you hit on the ground, it's going
to be an out.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Astros might rather be in Atlanta come playoff
time.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Kenny Rogers has been with the New York Mets for only a
month, but he already has discovered the best strategy for winning:
Induce ground balls and let the best collection of defensive
infielders in baseball take care of the rest.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rogers might as well have been conducting a clinic on changing
speeds, and the Astros were cast in the role of lab rats in a 4-0
loss at Shea Stadium on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros managed only seven hits and hit into 17 ground-ball
outs, a few of which were achieved on dazzling plays by Mets
shortstop Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   ``What better defense to get ground balls than the one they have
here?'' Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lead the majors in fielding percentage, and after
taking two of three games from the Astros, they trail only Atlanta
for the best winning percentage in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros missed a chance to stretch their National League
Central Division lead against Cincinnati. The Reds lost at Atlanta
for the third day in a row and remained 1{ games behind the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it means squat,'' shortstop Tim Bogar said of
the Astros' showing in New York. ``Every game is just as important
as the next. Losing two of three to these guys is just like losing
two of three to Milwaukee.''
</P>
<P>
   Except that Milwaukee isn't a possible playoff opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to bear down against these (playoff-contending) teams,
because if we play well against them now, we'll feel better about
playing if we see them later down the road,'' shortstop Ricky
Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   Astros manager Larry Dierker said: ``If we keep playing like
this, we won't have to worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Shane Reynolds didn't have much to worry about in the
early part of the game, when he was almost unhittable. Reynolds was
perfect through three innings and retired 12 of the first 13
batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   But when the sixth inning rolled around, the Mets seemed to hit
everything.
</P>
<P>
   New York scored all four of its runs with two out in the sixth
inning against Reynolds (14-10), who has gone four starts without a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was pretty much the ballgame,'' Reynolds said of the
sixth. ``Before that, I was hitting my spots and I was in a pretty
good rhythm. But this is a tough lineup, and if you make mistakes
they're going to capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers (3-0) didn't make any mistakes. He spaced seven hits over
8 innings and continues to make pitching in the NL look easy. The
Mets are 6-0 in Rogers' six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tough,'' Bagwell said. ``Every pitch was a different
speed. There was no way to gauge it. You couldn't even get locked
in. It's tough to hit that kind of stuff. You really have to be
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros aren't the most patient offensive team in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go in streaks,'' Bagwell said. ``But we do have a lot of
free swingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson native Dennis Cook relieved Rogers with two on and one
out in the ninth inning and retired both batters he faced,
including a game-ending strikeout of Bogar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let him off the hook,'' said Bogar, who entered as a pinch
hitter. ``He didn't throw one strike the whole at-bat. That was my
fault. I was trying to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were down four runs, and we needed all the baserunners we
could get. I was looking for a pitch in a certain area, and I
thought I got it. Obviously, I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' six hits in the sixth inning were one more than they
had in Tuesday's 10-inning game.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura got the critical hit, a two-run single with two
out. Darryl Hamilton followed with an RBI base hit, and another run
scored on a throwing error by third baseman Ken Caminiti.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Astros couldn't put anything together. Only two
of their seven hits came back-to-back, and they were followed by a
strikeout and a double play _ only the fourth twin killing Craig
Biggio has grounded into all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a great pitch to hit,'' said Biggio, who started in left
field for the first time since 1990. ``I just didn't hit it. There
were a lot of ground-ball outs, and that's going to happen here
because they have a very soft ground, and Ordonez gets to
everything. He's unbelievable at what he does.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SEVILLE, Spain _ Ludmila Engquist thought she knew everything there
was to know about getting over obstacles. She is the defending
world and Olympic champion in the 100-meter hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Then she woke up one morning last March and was confronted with
the biggest hurdle of her life. A routine self-examination revealed
a lump in her right breast, and a consultation with her doctor
confirmed she had cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Engquist was told her career as a world-class hurdler was over.
Then she was given a more optimistic prognosis that, maybe, just
maybe, next year she could return to the track.
</P>
<P>
   Which for Engquist, a Russian-turned-Swede, only meant the race
was on.
</P>
<P>
   She had a mastectomy April 21, her 35th birthday, began
chemotherapy in May and now is competing in the World Track and
Field Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people believe that cancer is the end,'' Engquist
said. ``But that is not what I believe anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of her sprinting down the track, her hair still blond
and healthy, her muscles strong and limber, throwing herself over
each hurdle, is enough to change anyone's beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's first round at the Estadio Olympico, Engquist had
the fastest qualifying time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's her willpower that has put her back to where she is
now,'' said her husband, Johan.
</P>
<P>
   In this summer of Lance Armstrong's incredible victory in the
Tour de France, it seems anything is possible. A stubborn,
relentless Texan overcomes what was seen three years ago as a death
sentence of testicular cancer to win the world's most famous
cycling race, and now a woman who has found a home in Scandinavia
takes the baton of grit and determination on the next leg of hope
for cancer patients everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she had the operation, the therapist and the doctor said,
`Please come back in six weeks, and then we'll have a session and
you'll learn how to lift your arm,''' Johan recalled. ``And we just
looked at each other, and we smiled.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day after her mastectomy, Engquist had the nursing staff
in shock as she climbed up on her own and began performing bedside
squats. She was using small weights and jogging lightly within five
days and had resumed a nearly complete training routine, including
clean-and-jerk exercises with weights of more than 120 pounds, in
11 days.
</P>
<P>
   Her only concession has been to cut back her training to roughly
50 percent during the time when she is taking chemotherapy. She has
had four sessions, the last July 15, usually lasting three hours,
and will have two treatments in late August and September. She is
given three forms of medication intravenously and wears an ``ice
cap'' on her head to preserve her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is maybe the worst part,'' she said with a smile. ``It is
like putting your head into a deep freezer or frozen lake.''
</P>
<P>
   She refuses to take painkillers, trying to hold down the level
of drugs in her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot have survival as my only goal,'' Engquist said.
</P>
<P>
   She trains and works and pushes herself to the same level of
expectation as any other world-class athlete and has the same
desires, only wearing a prosthesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to compete,'' Engquist said. ``I will not be
completely satisfied unless I get a gold. I'll be half-satisfied to
take any medal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is left to everyone else to be impressed with how far she has
come. Engquist points out her case is different from Armstrong's
disease, a different kind of cancer. Yet there is another
difference. Armstrong did not return to competitive cycling until
nearly three years after his chemotherapy. She is in the middle of
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Engquist has found a new country and a new sense of home in
Sweden. She had won the world title in 1991 while competing under
the name Ludmila Narozhilenko for the Soviet Union. The next year
she tested positive for steroids.
</P>
<P>
   But a four-year ban was lifted in 1995 when her former husband
testified that, without Ludmila's knowledge, he had spiked her
protein powder with a banned substance.
</P>
<P>
   Since marrying Johan in 1996 and moving to his country, she has
refused to speak anything but Swedish and English, immediately
winning a loyal following. That was solidified in Atlanta when she
became the first woman representing Sweden to win a gold medal in
track.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback race was July 30 in her hometown of Stockholm,
where the crowd gave her a standing ovation and showered her with
flowers as she entered the stadium. There was another roar, a round
of applause from her fellow hurdlers as she lined up for the start
of the race, and tears, so many of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luckily, I stopped crying when it came time to run,'' Engquist
said.
</P>
<P>
   And she ran fast enough to win in 12.68, just .18 off her
gold-medal time in Atlanta. She has since posted the fifth-fastest
time in the world this year and had the best time (12.62) in the
first round of competition Wednesday at the Estadio Olympico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good, but it was not like Engquist,'' she said. ``I'm
starting to feel it now. I'm very aggressive, angry. I can feel the
vibrations in my legs.''
</P>
<P>
   And you can see the gleam in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Husband Johan says they are plotting a course for the defense of
her Olympic title in Sydney next year, and Ludmila has a plan for
how she might celebrate another gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   She says she'll throw her prosthesis into the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   After all, there are hurdles, and then there are hurdles.

TWINS STRIKE BACK AT RED SOX

 SOX-TWINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Somewhere in the Red Sox handbook it says that
winning two out of three is as good as a sweep.
</P>
<P>
   And that's probably the best way to look at a 6-3 loss to the
Minnesota Twins Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night before a crowd of 11,185 at the
Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had a grand time in winning the first two games here
by 4-1 and 7-1 margins. And despite how awful the Twins are, they
still managed to salvage the finale rather easily.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Twins won this one; the Sox didn't give it
away. Mark Portugal (7-12) had one of those outings in which he
could point to a half-dozen things that went wrong. But he was
outpitched by Brad Radke (10-12), who is 2-0 with a 1.44 ERA
against the Red Sox in three starts this season. He managed to win
20 for the Twins two years ago. Portugal has lost four straight but
deserved a better fate Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, Portugal pitched pretty darn good,''
said manager Jimy Williams. ``But the key was Radke. He pitched
better. It was still a game at 3-1, and Portugal was hanging in
there. He wasn't hit hard but he gave up some hits. Balls went away
from people. It happens like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the three-game series, the Red Sox played fairly well,
considering they were swept in Texas and shut out Sunday night. Pat
Rapp pitched the Red Sox to a much-needed victory Monday. Pedro
Martinez was so dominating in a 7-1 rout the next night that his 15
strikeouts seemed almost routine.
</P>
<P>
   But a Red Sox series sweep? Forget it. They've only done it five
times this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win or split a series on the last part of this road
trip, it's OK,'' said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanley said it better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter whom we're playing right now,'' said
Stanley. ``We're trying to win series each time. Obviously, we
didn't do that in Texas but we were able to do it here. Now we need
to go home and continue to play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put a guy like Radke on the mound, you know he can
throw a gem at you. That's what he did today. I felt like we swung
the bats pretty well the first couple of games. After Texas, we
could have folded and come in here with a negative attitude. But we
didn't. We came in and won two of three. That is what we wanted to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal's troubles began in the first inning as Minnesota
jumped to a 2-0 lead. Jacque Jones led off with an infield single
to second. Denny Hocking then hit a grounder to first that Brian
Daubach booted for an error. Portugal walked the next batter, Marty
Cordova, to load the bases, and Matt Lawton followed with a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota took a 3-0 lead in the fourth. Ron Coomer hit
Portugal's first offering for a home run, his 15th of the season
and a career high. Boston bounced back with a run in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   But the game exploded on the Red Sox in the sixth as Portugal
gave up three runs on two singles, a double, and a triple.
</P>
<P>
   After a single by Cordova and a ground out by Lawton, Coomer
drove in the first run with a double into the left-field corner.
Todd Walker struck out, but the next batter, Terry Steinbach, hit a
drive to right that Trot Nixon played into a triple, making it 5-1.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbach scored on a base hit by Corey Koskie, driving Portugal
from the game in favor of Rich Garces, but by then it was out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Boston managed to score twice more. With one out in the eighth,
Daubach hit a double that scored Butch Huskey from first, sending
Radke to the showers. With two out in the ninth, Damon Buford,
playing his first game since coming off the disabled list, socked
his fifth home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good things happen here,'' said Williams. ``Our
bats came back a little, and we'll need them down the stretch.
That's why I had Buford in there, Scott Hatteberg and Butch Huskey,
too. We need to get them in some games so they can be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a rotation. We've got Kent Mercker with the team and
he will pitch Friday. We've got Saberhagen backed off to a point
that if he's healthy we can use him. And believe me, we need him.''

 NASA TO DIG UP MARS' DIRT FOR EVIDENCE OF WATER  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have selected a gently rolling plain near the south
pole of Mars as the landing site for a new mission that will punch
into the Martian crust for the first time to search for evidence
that oceans _ and thus, perhaps, life _ once existed on the Red
Planet.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's newest spacecraft, dubbed Mars Polar Lander, is now
flying toward its target with a cargo of high-tech instruments and
will make a rocket-assisted soft landing there December 3, the
mission's leaders announced Wednesday. The landing will be slowed
in the thin Martian atmosphere by a heat shield, a parachute and
retro-firing jets.
</P>
<P>
   Five minutes before the spacecraft lands, it will eject two
metal containers, each the size of a basketball. Weighing about 24
ounces each, they contain a miniature drill and an entire chemical
laboratory. The two packages will crash on the Martian surface with
enough force to probe as far as six feet deep into the layered
soil.
</P>
<P>
   With a touch of the dramatic, NASA has named the subsurface
mission ``The New Millennium Microprobe.'' This attempt to dig
deeper into the Martian soil than any previous mission is only the
first of dozens that in future years will excavate soil samples all
over the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In an even bolder effort, robot Mars missions now scheduled for
2005 and 2007 will attempt to bring larger samples of the planet's
soil back to Earth for detailed grain-by-grain analysis, the
scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing for reporters at NASA's Washington headquarters
Wednesday, Richard Zurek, the Polar Lander's chief scientist, said
the landing site was selected at the edge of the planet's icy south
polar cap where the surface appears distinctly layered _ an
important clue to how the surface of Mars has been shaped over the
ages by wind and weather and perhaps even by tectonic forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this layered terrain is a record of climate changes
on Mars, and, in a sense, digging into its surface will be like
reading tree rings or the layers in an ice core,'' Zurek said.
</P>
<P>
   The two ``microprobes'' carried by the spacecraft will each
carry a tiny drill to bore into the subsurface soil and extract
material that will be vaporized by an equally tiny laser and
analyzed chemically.
</P>
<P>
   Each probe will also include a package of instruments that will
remain on the surface with an antenna to report by radio what the
underground drilling has found.
</P>
<P>
   According to Suzanne Smekar, project scientist for the probe
mission, water vapor will be a sure sign that in the past,
significant amounts of water must have existed well beyond the
planet's polar regions.
</P>
<P>
   And if the chemical analysis shows that some of the soil
particles contain carbonates, Zurek said, it will indicate that
winds must have blown the particles south from ancient seas that
existed on Mars millions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This latest mission to Mars, with its landing in December, will
occur during the late Martian spring when the sun remains low on
the horizon throughout the Martian day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the land of the midnight sun,'' Zurek said _ until
the sun dips below the Martian horizon three months later, and the
mission ends as the spacecraft's solar batteries finally die.

REVOLUTION MAKE A POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ There was plenty of room on the field
and in the stands at Giants Stadium Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. The result
was a wide-open MLS game in which the Revolution tied the
MetroStars, 1-1, in regulation time, then won the shootout before
an announced crowd of 9,143.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse attendance was justified by the MetroStars, who set
an MLS mark with their 10th successive defeat. The Revolution,
meanwhile, broke a seven-game losing streak and had their nine-game
losing streaks of 1997 and '98 erased from the record book.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were committed to attack, and probably should have
had more goals. The MetroStars went with a three-striker offense
and had the Revolution reeling early in the game as Mike Duhaney
converted in the 14th minute.
</P>
<P>
   But the Revolution, with goalkeeper-coach Walter Zenga suspended
as a player and Leonel Alvarez out with a pulled right quadriceps
late in the first half, rallied. Joe-Max Moore converted 40 seconds
into the second half, his 12th goal of the season, and the
Revolution remained committed and focused, matching the MetroStars'
daring with three defenders and a gambling style. The Revolution
displayed some unexpected resourcefulness as Jeff Causey and Paulo
Dos Santos compensated for the loss of Zenga and Alvarez and the
team earned its first point since July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we had to get forward and be dangerous in front of the
goal,'' Moore said. ``We tried to get the 3 points, but we had some
good moments and the 1 point helps. Now, there is no reason we
can't go to Chicago (Saturday) and win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Revolution appeared to gain confidence and galvanize
as the match progressed. This was probably the most significant
aspect of the game for the Revolution, who have been outscored,
17-6, and failed to win in regulation time in the second half of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media reminds us of the losing streak, but for us
everything is a battle now,'' midfielder John Harkes said.
``Nothing is going easy for us. But when we stick together and
fight as a team we get stronger as a unit. We were very committed
in the second half, and when you score a goal right away it makes a
difference. We walked away with a point but we've still got to
eliminate the easy goals, stay compact, and maybe give a foul
rather than let them score goals like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars nearly broke the tie when Eduardo Hurtado headed
a cross off Causey's right post, but Causey stopped Billy Walsh's
rebound and Hurtado was ruled offside going for an open net on the
second rebound early in the second half. Sasa Curcic kept the
pressure on with some skillful play for most of the game, but
became less effective in the final half-hour as the Revolution
gained control.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's best chances were a header by Ivan McKinley,
spectacularly saved by Tim Howard in the 67th minute, and a series
of shots in the final minute. Harkes shanked a volley with the net
open, and the Revolution recovered to score an offside goal by
Giovanni Savarese. In fact, Moore was offside as the ball was sent
in on goal, where Howard parried to Savarese, who headed it in
after the offside flag was raised and referee Kevin Stott correctly
nullified the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the game, the guys were very tired and we had
calls go against us,'' Harkes said. ``But that happens away from
home. We showed some resilience and character to pull it out and we
finished well in the shootout. That builds confidence, and having
Paulo Dos Santos and Kris Kelderman come in off the bench and have
strong games shows we have balance and can count on them doing the
job.''

 NOTE TO MAYOR: `A FEW BAD PEOPLE BRING DISGRACE'  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Happy Birthday on Sunday to the cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrate or march in protest; it's your call (so to speak).
</P>
<P>
   The cell, or its forefather, was born August 29 of 1908, down in
Pre-Silicon Valley. Cyril Elwell, a Stanford grad and a former
professor, demonstrated to a few friends that he had perfected the
McCarthy wireless telephone system. A call was made to a receiving
station three-quarters of a mile away, so no roaming charges were
incurred.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: Following paragraph may contain columnist's
embellishment:) Then Elwell made some calls from behind the wheel
of his Model T, running several other motorists off the road due to
his distracted driving. Then he went to lunch and annoyed everyone
in the restaurant by making loud and obnoxious business calls.
</P>
<P>
   WHEN COPS turn on cops:
</P>
<P>
   It's a quiet afternoon in the Sunset. In front of the Police
Credit Union, several cars are parked at expired meters.
</P>
<P>
   A PCO (parking control officer, a.k.a. meter maid) comes along
and is writing tickets, because that is the job of a PCO. In one of
the cars, a woman is sleeping. The officer wakes the woman and
tells her she'll need to drop a quarter in the meter or get a
parking citation.
</P>
<P>
   The woman dashes into the credit union, returns with a small
(five or six people) but angry group. They curse, berate and
threaten the PCO. Is he blind? Can't he see the Credit Union
monthly planners placed carefully on the dashboards, subtle
indicators that these are the cars of special people with immunity
to city parking ordinances?
</P>
<P>
   The PCO takes refuge in his three-wheeler, and two or three of
the aggrieved pound on the windows and hurl vile curses.
</P>
<P>
   Sigh. Might be time for some folks to switch to decaf.
</P>
<P>
   REQUIEM FOR a comrade-in-legs: Tim Lockfeld writes, ``Jon Marsh
(Jack to everyone) died in a motorcycle accident last Wednesday. He
was a bike messenger for 20 years, he hopped freight trains all
over the country, he surfed, he skated and was president of JAK's
skate team, he worked nights at Bimbo's. He looked a little like
Elvis. He hung around the Mabuhay as a teenager and broke a hundred
hearts. His wake will be Saturday, Stairway No. 3, Ocean Beach, 6
p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   ASTRONAUTS, at least six of 'em, will auction off some of their
personal memorabilia, such as a space suit and a name tag that was
worn on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who paid for that stuff in the first place?`` inquires Peter
William Brown. ``How big was Buzz Aldrin's lunch box that he could
walk out of Cape Kennedy with a space suit? I thought people got
fired for this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   My question: If you walk on the moon, considering how light the
lunar foot traffic is, do you really need a name tag?
</P>
<P>
   AT ONE S.F. firehouse, they're still chuckling about the
firefighter who told the chief, ``I can't go to fires anymore, I've
got asthma'' and handed over a doctor's note.
</P>
<P>
   What's left? Cat-in-tree duty?
</P>
<P>
   SMOKE POLICE up ante: The Health Dept. is now laying down to bar
owners a new, tougher interpretation of the no-smoking law. Before,
the owner's responsibility was to inform smokers that they are
performing an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
   Now, bars can't have ashtrays around, nor matches, and if a
customer smokes, the barkeep has to stop serving him or her. Or
risk a big fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you can go into the streets and give out free needles to
heroin users, and you get a medal,'' says Jim Brandt at the Gold
Coast, ``but if you provide an ashtray or a match _ watch out.
Maybe they should supply us with those big foam bats. Guy starts
smoking, we bop him over the head.''
</P>
<P>
   POSTCARD from the edge of civilization:
</P>
<P>
   A Korean man in town on business is waiting in a shuttle-bus
line near Pier 41. A man behind him says, ``Hey, you've got ice
cream smeared on the back of your suit,'' and proceeds to help the
man wipe it off and proceeds to boost the man's wallet.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean man's letter to Mayor Brown should be inscribed on a
plaque at Fisherman's Wharf. The letter concludes:
</P>
<P>
   ``An event of happening is finished. But still remains for the
unpleasant and uncomfortable are there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the San Francisco is a beautiful city and a good
memorial city in my heart. Only a few bad people bring disgrace on
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a song that `If you are going to San Francisco, put
the flowers on your head.'
</P>
<P>
   ``This song could change that `If you are going to San
Francisco, be careful the ice cream on your back side.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Amen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Fundamental baseball the way it was meant to be
played: an old-fashioned pitchers' duel, some hit-and-run offense,
a sacrifice fly and solid defense at the corners.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all finished in just over 2{ hours Wednesday night,
the Mariners had clawed their way back to .500 with a 3-2 win over
the Detroit Tigers before 43,789 at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   The decisive run was scored in the eighth inning when Brian
Hunter laid down a perfect bunt for a base hit that Detroit starter
Brian Moehler was unable to field cleanly. Hunter, taking off on a
hit and run, raced to third when Rafael Bournigal laced the next
pitch into left field. Hunter then scored on a long sacrifice fly
by Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa worked the ninth for his 29th save, striking out the
last two batters he faced to preserve the win for John Halama, who
earned his 10th win in 15 decisions and ended a personal three-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing very well defensively and we've worked very
hard at that,'' M's manager Lou Piniella said. ``It's really
starting to bear some fruit here and it really helped our pitching
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Halama's win marked the third game in a row that a Mariner
starter had pitched through the eighth inning and come away with a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we're on a three-game winning streak, and hopefully we
can carry that over to the New York series,'' Halama said before
packing his bags for a seven-game road swing through New York and
Chicago that starts Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was pleased that his team was able to execute the
fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the Mariner trio of Griffey, Alex Rodriguez and
Edgar Martinez struck first against Moehler, who had been 2-1 with
a 1.69 ERA in three previous starts in Seattle, all in the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   A single to left by Griffey, a double by Rodriguez into the
left-center gap, and another opposite-way grounder through the hole
between second and first by Martinez gave the Mariners a 2-0 lead
over Moehler.
</P>
<P>
   Halama, who had faced the minimum number of batters through four
innings, only faltered in the fifth when he gave up a solo home run
to Tigers first baseman Tony Clark, and then allowed three
consecutive singles by Bobby Higginson, Damion Easley and Gabe
Kapler that tied the game at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   Halama had struggled in his last three outings. Although the M's
are 10-6 in games he's started, Halama hadn't had a win since he
pitched 62/3 innings in the M's 5-2 win over Tampa on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Halama retired the first nine Tigers he faced before allowing a
leadoff triple to Kimera Bartee to start the fourth inning. But
Bartee never came in to score as M's third baseman Russ Davis
picked up a shot down the line by Dean Palmer, tagged Bartee as he
tried to get back to the base and then threw Palmer out at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heck of a double play and you don't see that play
very often in major league baseball,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   Halama said the play helped pick up his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great boost to get a play like that, and it carried
over _ we scored two runs the next inning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The play also was a confidence-booster for Davis: ``The ball
gave me momentum, so I was able to tag him and make an accurate
throw. ... It was just instinct that took over.''
</P>
<P>
   But the play of the night proved to be the hit-and-run executed
by Bournigal, who had entered the game in the eighth inning when
second baseman David Bell was feeling dizzy and had a migraine
headache. Bell will not travel with the team to New York Thursday
and will be evaluated by doctors before rejoining the team,
Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou is a very aggressive manager and he'll put on a
hit-and-run at any time,'' Hunter said. ``As a base runner or a
hitter, you always have to be looking for it, and it worked out
perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   In past situations, Bournigal said he has tried to slap the ball
to the right side of the infield. But Wednesday he got a pitch to
pull and put it through the hole as Detroit shortstop Deivi Cruz
moved toward second to cover the bag as Hunter took off on the
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make sure I put the ball on the ground,''
Bournigal said. ``If Brian Hunter is running, he's going to be at
second base if I just put it on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella hopes the pitching and execution continue on the road
with the Yankees, who swept the M's earlier in the month at Safeco
Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at 63-63, and every time we get to the .500 level, we
run into the Yankees or Cleveland,'' Piniella said. ``Let's just
see what happens.''

   ERITREA-WOMEN-FIGHTERS (On the Badme Plain, Eritrea) _ Eritirea
is one of the few nations in the world where women fight
side-by-side with men, and in the 15-month war against Ethiopia,
they have killed and been killed like any other soldiers. There is

   GAY-LAWMAKER (Phoenix) _ By his own account, Stephen May knew
from the time he was a teen-ager that he wanted to be a
conservative Republican politician. He was elected last November,
at the tender age of 26, to the Arizona state legislature. Then
earlier this year, May angrily spoke his mind, this time not as a
Republican, a Mormon, or a soldier _ but as an openly gay man. His
denunciation of an anti-gay bill and its right-wing sponsor
triggered one of the more unusual investigations under President

   HANNIBAL-BOOK (Undated) _ The hidden attitude at work in Thomas
Harris' ``Hannibal'' and in so many other pop cultural successes of
the moment is that the work either can't or won't stand alone. And
it counts on other media, secondhand star quality, spinoffs or
tie-ins to help make its connection with popular tastes. That sets
it off from the more genuine, unencumbered work that needs no such
calling cards. Nobody could accuse the beguiling music documentary
``Buena Vista Social Club'' of cashing in because its elderly Cuban

Toms River team (3-0) defeat Phenix City (2-1) for the second time
this week, it will be only the third team to return to the finals

   TEN-USOPEN-SCENE (New York) _ The real Open starts on Monday,
but this week there are qualifying rounds in which 256 men and
women compete for 32 slots in the most important tennis tournament
in America. Before the big names start playing, before the ladies
in the wide-brimmed hats fill the corporate boxes, die-hard tennis
fans by the thousands flock to Flushing Meadows-Corona Park,
streaming through the open gates to watch top-notch tennis for the
cost of a subway ride. It is one of New York's best-kept secrets, a
late-summer tradition for those in the know. By Jodi Wilgoren. With

   BKL-FINALS (Undated) _ The New York Liberty arrived for practice
at Madison Square Garden two days ago to find the Knicks'
orange-and-blue banners draped over the scorers' tables. When the
Liberty returned Wednesday, the banners were still courtside and
flapping. Were Garden officials trying to send a subliminal message
to the Liberty as the team enters the semifinals of the Women's

Charlotte Sting team. Something like: ``Don't forget the Knicks,
who surprised everybody and made it to the finals of the NBA
playoffs.'' By Lena Williams.

MARINE WORLD ROLLER COASTER STALLS IN MID- 
 RIDE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KEVIN FAGAN and CHARLIE GOODYEAR 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEJO, Calif. _ A roller coaster train lurched to a halt
mid-track Wednesday at Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo,
terrifying riders and dangling them about 75 feet in the air _ some
nearly upside-down _ for up to 31/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   No one appeared to be seriously injured, and rescuers used a
cherry picker to extricate all 28 riders. But the incident was
particularly unnerving, given the fatal accident on a ride during
the weekend at Great America.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began at 3:45 p.m. on the Boomerang, a thriller that
sends riders 125 feet into the air and whips them down through
three corkscrew loops at up to 50 mph. After reaching a peak at the
other end, the coaster train roars backward through the loops to
the boarding platform.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds before the seven-car train halted, witnesses saw a long,
thick black cable attached to the ride break loose and lash back
and forth around the tracks. The effect on riders and onlookers was
immediate and horrifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard this loud cracking sound, saw this black cable start
whipping around all over the place,'' said Todd Dufren, who was
visiting the park with his family. ``The screams on the roller
coaster changed from fun screams to `Oh my God we're gonna die'
screams of terror, and the whole ride just stopped all of a sudden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women, kids, everyone down on the ground started crying and
screaming too, and rushing over. It was pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Up on the coaster itself, panic hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know what was going on, we were freaking out,'' said
Danielle Williams, 20, of Vacaville, who was in the middle of the
train. ``I was scared to death. I was afraid I was going to die.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and other passengers calmed down after several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   They later said they had noticed something wrong even before the
train stopped: After being hauled to the top at the ride's start,
the cars were inexplicably kept there for about 10 minutes, they
said, which was longer than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Park spokesman Jeff Jouett said the initial wait sounded unusual
and park officials will look into that as part of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's incident was the first significant problem the park
has had with the Boomerang since the ride opened in March 1998,
Jouett said. There have been no fatalities at Marine World since
the park opened in Vallejo in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Jouett said the problem appeared to have been with the coaster's
``lift truck,'' a small car at the rear of the train that pulls it
to the top of the tower at the start of the ride. The truck is
supposed to let loose of the train so it can speed down on gravity,
but it evidently failed to detach properly, Jouett said.
</P>
<P>
   The cable that flapped around was still hanging down about 30
feet off the back of the train throughout the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Jouett said the train apparently stopped short when it ran out
of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials said rides sometimes have to be stopped for
maintenance with passengers on them, but the Boomerang had never
been halted between loops before. The last time the coaster had to
be emptied was July 20, when a full seven-car train was stopped on
its initial ascent and riders were walked down a flight of stairs
on the tower. Jouett said he did not know what caused that
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's problem was ``unusual'' for Marine World, Jouett
said. ``Statistically, amusement parks are one of the safest forms
of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a similar incident occurred in April at another Six
Flags park in Kentucky when 27 riders were left dangling upside
down for nearly four hours on a roller coaster much like the
Boomerang. The Vampire, at Kentucky Kingdom, had the same speed,
height and looping effect as the Boomerang, and was built by the
same maker, Vekoma Manufacturing. Inspectors later blamed the
problem on the braking system.
</P>
<P>
   As the Marine World riders were taken off the roller coaster
Wednesday, riders were walked carefully to wheelchairs for medical
examination. Four passengers were taken to Sutter-Solano Medical
Center in Vallejo with heat-related problems, but rescuers said
their ailments did not appear to be major.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter-Solano nursing supervisor Carol Huber said that all four
patients were women and that two were treated for heat exhaustion
and released quickly. The other two were being treated at nightfall
for similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews of park workers and Vallejo firefighters first
rolled the train carefully back about a foot before beginning the
extrications, and passengers were given water, towels, umbrellas
and hats as they waited in the close-to-100-degree heat. About 50
people near the coaster were moved from the area and two smaller
rides nearby _ a tilt-a-whirl and the Ark, a swinging ship _ were
shut down to make room for emergency crews.
</P>
<P>
   The last passenger was extricated at 7:25 p.m. The most upside
down of the cars _ canted at a severe angle _ was unloaded last.
The train remained stuck on the tracks, empty, as darkness fell.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomerang is on the western edge of the ``African safari''
part of Marine World, and that whole region, about a third of the
park, was shut down for the evening. Marine World workers handed
out tickets good for a free admission to long lines of people as
they left.
</P>
<P>
   Deepa Mathew, 13, of San Jose, was next in line for The
Boomerang when the coaster got stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The announcer came on and said we're going to fix this, but
the girls around me started screaming, saying, `it's not OK, it's
not OK,' '' Deepa said, still unnerved by what she saw. ``I'm going
to take a break from from roller coasters for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the worried attention to park safety this week after the
Great America death in Santa Clara, Calif., ``sensitivities are
very heightened right now, so we're doing everything we can to
reassure people that things are going to be OK,'' said park
spokeswoman Kristi Vonne.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve-year-old Joshua Smurphat of Sunnyvale died Sunday
afternoon when he pitched out of his seat on the Drop Zone ``free
fall'' ride at Paramount's Great America. The next day, five people
were injured at Knott's Berry Farm in Orange County, and one man
died at a Paramount ride in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries and deaths highlighted long-simmering concerns
about amusement park safety, particularly in California, where
there is no state oversight of the rides at permanent parks. A
state bill requiring oversight and inspections at the parks passed
a key Senate committee this week, and proponents hope the recent
tragedies help propel it into law soon.
</P>
<P>
   Marine World began its stint in Vallejo mostly as an animal and
water-fun park, but when Premier Parks acquired it a couple years
ago it changed focus sharply to amusement rides. The park spent $25
million on new attractions this year, including a huge new wooden
roller coaster called Roar.
</P>
<P>
   The last major trouble at the park came last year when a San
Jose woman was mauled by a Bengal tiger during a
pose-with-an-animal photo session.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, federal oversight of permanent amusement parks ended
in 1981, and California is one of only 12 states that has no
oversight of its own to replace that. Industry representatives,
however, insist that new regulations are unnecessary, pointing out
that for the past two decades there has been an average of just two
deaths a year among all of the nation's parks.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 million visitors went to the country's 750 parks
last year. There were 4,600 accidents, 36 of which required
hospitalization, according to the U.S. Consumer Product and Safety
Commission.

CISCO GOBBLES TWO NETWORKING COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DEBORAH SOLOMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ In its biggest acquisition to date, Cisco
Systems will announce Thursday that it is buying Cerent Corp. _ a
two-year-old telecommunications equipment company in Petaluma with
only 287 employees _ for a staggering $6.9 billion in stock.
<P>
   San Jose-based Cisco is the leader in computer networking
equipment, and it got that way in part by acquiring companies _
more than 30 since 1996 _ that could expand its product line.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's aiming to do the same in the lucrative
telecommunications-equipment industry, which is feasting off the
explosive growth in telephone and Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Cerent sells gear that can carry voice, video and data at high
speeds on a single network. Its customers include long-distance
phone companies, such as Qwest Communications and Williams
Communications, and newer local phone-service providers that
compete with the Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Cerent's equipment is cheaper and less bulky than its
competitors, which include Nortel Networks, Fujitsu and Lucent
Technologies. All are making next-generation equipment that will
let customers download Web pages and send e-mail more quickly and
help corporate computer networks route data more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfied with just the Cerent deal, Cisco also will
announce Thursday that it's swallowing Monterey Networks of Texas
for about $500 million in stock. Monterey makes equipment that
increases the capacity of fiber optic lines so that networks can
handle larger amounts of phone calls and Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Both acquisitions will help Cisco in its battle with Lucent and
Nortel, its biggest competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The explosive growth in Internet usage has strained many
corporate computer networks, causing blackouts and slowdowns in
service. Both Cerent's and Monterey's products help phone companies
and Internet service providers unclog their networks.
</P>
<P>
   While $6.9 billion may seem steep for a company as small as
Cerent, industry watchers said its impressive customer list and
technology make up for the sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very good fit,'' said Chris Stix, an analyst with SG
Cowen in New York. ``Cerent has a great management team and a
next-generation product that phone companies are interested in
because it takes up less space.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerent recently signed a $25 million contract to supply gear to
Williams Communications, which plans to install Cerent's equipment
in its national high-speed network.
</P>
<P>
   Cerent had planned to go public and filed in July to raise as
much as $100 million through an initial public offering. Because
companies usually sell a small percentage of their total stock in
an IPO, Cerent's market value would have been many times that
number.
</P>
<P>
   Sources familiar with the deal said Cerent's management decided
to merge with Cisco rather than go public because it would give the
company access to a much broader customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has experienced dramatic growth ... but to get to
the next level requires a partner of Cisco's capability,'' said a
person involved in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between Cisco and Cerent was first broached about two
weeks ago and an agreement was hammered out in 10 days, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are already familiar with each other _ Cisco
invested $15 million in the company. Michael Dell, founder of Dell
Computing, also has a $30 million investment in the company through
his investment fund, MSD Capital LP.
</P>
<P>
   The company was conceived by Vinod Khosla, Cerent's chairman and
a partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, the Silicon Valley
venture capital powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   In its IPO filing, Cerent disclosed that since its founding in
1997, the company has lost $59.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cerent and Monterey, which has 130 employees, will become
part of Cisco's optical internetworking business unit. The division
will be headed by Kevin Kennedy, senior vice president of Cisco's
service provider line of business. No layoffs are expected.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Will it come, or won't it?
 &HT;    (For immediate release.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ This is the lousy part. There is a storm out there,
somewhere between there and here. It's sitting, deciding which way
to go, growing in strength. And you don't know when to panic.
</P>
<P>
   Do you become unnerved when the local TV station sends a
reporter and cameraman out to some sparsely settled Bahamas island
to take film of a puddle and a swaying palm tree? Or do you wait
until the supermarket is sold out of corned beef hash, bottled
water and potato chips?
</P>
<P>
   Not knowing is almost as bad as getting hit.
</P>
<P>
   Still playing on those of us who have experienced killer
hurricanes are the images of the horrors in Central America and the
Caribbean last year; different from the Turkish earthquake only in
that in Turkey buildings collapsed on thousands and in Central
America the thousands were swept away by rivers of mud.
</P>
<P>
   So you sit and watch local TV. The weather advisory doesn't
change every hour, but you watch anyway, somehow thinking that
station has a special connection with the storm itself, and will
tell you what the weather bureau won't or can't.
</P>
<P>
   TV stations have put out more video of hurricane-wary people in
the checkout line at Home Depot than I have seen of Monica Lewinsky
hugging Bill Clinton. And, like the hugging scene, it never
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you find everything you wanted?'' the predatory TV
reporter asks the consumer. ``No,'' he answers, ``all they had left
was wallpaper.'' Or the lady in line at the supermarket, stacking
cases of Tidy Bowl onto the checkout belt, as everything else was
gone and she hated to go home empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the buildup to a hurricane, which, unlike an
earthquake or tornado, gives so much warning as to scare hell out
of you _ and often doesn't even bother to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   I started the week watching Bret wimp out over the Texas Gulf
Coast, then turned my attention to a growing zephyr off western
Africa. She was named Cindy and she was so far off that, were this
the 1970s, nobody would know it was there.
</P>
<P>
   But technology being what it is, we so firmly affixed our
attention on Cindy that we hardly noticed Dennis being born just
north of Hispaniola, in our back yard. Suddenly, there he was _ and
so was his sister, Emily, way down near the Leeward Islands.
</P>
<P>
   So there were three for us to watch and wonder what lay in store
over the next week or so. When there's a possibility you might get
tagged with three storms, there's likely even a need for Tidy Bowl
and wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   The water, the foodstuffs, the batteries? Anyone with experience
already went out and got those when hurricane season began June 1.
Those who wait beyond that must rummage through what remains.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how prepared you are, however, you really are not
prepared. Do you make an ass of yourself and put up your storm
shutters when the storm is still 500 miles away _ and it swerves
off _ or do you wait until you get crowned with a wind-driven
coconut before you do?
</P>
<P>
   After being walloped by Hurricane Andrew in 1992, I readily
admit to you that I'm given to early panic.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of work that has to be performed in advance of an
approaching hurricane is immense; you have no idea of how much junk
is lying loose in your yard that might come flying through your
roof, and you have even less knowledge of what your neighbor left
lying in his yard that also may come flying through your roof.
</P>
<P>
   As prepared as one can be for a hurricane, you can only be as
prepared as your neighbor. In 1992, Andrew blew roof tiles and
2-by-4s from one yard to another. A neighbor across the street had
his walls penetrated by a 2-by-4 that came like a javelin from
another neighbor's yard. I still don't know what was that lump of
concrete that came through our roof and opened our house to the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   There is only so much you can control, the remainder is left to
chance.
</P>
<P>
   As so we wait, and anticipate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, I'm looking at six cans of corned beef hash and an
equal number of tins of tuna fish, while my wife bakes up a batch
of cookies and I search for the 9-volt batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's preparation!

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: AMA's right to lean left on health plan
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Generation X-ers who remember the olden times B.MTV. (Before
MTV) can only stare dumbfounded at the sight of the American
Medical Association throwing in with a Democratic-led plan for
federal regulation of the practice of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when the AMA, socially inert and politically stodgy,
was one of the informal mainstays of the Republican Party and was
cocked to explode like a cheap pistol with charges of ``socialized
medicine'' at almost any effort to legislate medical coverage
beyond the commodity model.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed. The AMA, all on its own, has developed a bit
of a social conscience. The GOP has hied itself off so far to the
right it has estranged many mainstream organizations. (It is on the
outs with the American Bar Association, too, over several matters.)
</P>
<P>
   And, crucially, the choice for physicians is no longer between
government interference and retail medicine but between
insurance-company interference and federal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors are going for the protection, to their own and the
public's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations are not, generically, ogres.
They have produced a major upgrade in preventative medicine. The
best are unfairly tarred by the missteps of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the best there is tension between their good-health
mission and their charge to hold down employer health-plan costs
and to succor insurance profits. Experience has pinpointed problems
only legislation can fix.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed repairs passed by Senate Republicans were a sham,
covering a fraction of HMO patients and sloughing off essential
patient protections. One House plan _ mainly Democratic but with
bipartisan sponsorship _ is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would assure HMO patients access to emergency room care
and to specialists, permit referrals outside the HMO, allow
patients to choose gynecologists or pediatricians as primary-care
physicians and to sue HMOs for, in effect, malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   These are common-sense proposals, likely to pass unless the
House Republican leadership uses a procedural shell game to limit
the vote to a reworked GOP proposal that goes beyond the Senate's
empty gestures but still protects insurers more than the insured.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out that the biggest boost to the eventual creation
here of the universal health coverage most developed societies
provide was the defeat of President Clinton's plan. HMO problems
that would have cropped up in any event would have been used to
discredit any federal plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though piecemeal and inefficiently, legislation with broad
public support is plugging health-care defaults and even extending
coverage at the margins. (To poor children, workers who change jobs
and so on.)
</P>
<P>
   We're sneaking up on a national health care system in small
steps. But keep it to yourself. We wouldn't want to scare Harry and
Louise, the distraught insurance industry fronts who worried the
Clinton plan to death in TV commercials.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: POLITICAL CHRISTMAS GIFTS
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Each year, a radio station hereabouts sponsors a
``Christmas in August'' festival. It could serve as metaphor for a
time when most voters, while far from ready to select the next
occupant of the White House, don't mind listening to some
unseasonal mood music.
</P>
<P>
   The verbal snowflakes swirling about the presidential races
would serve as an amusing late summer diversion were it not for the
serious millennial issues of governance at stake. Even an
electorate that increasingly tends to brush aside policy positions
to make its choices on the basis of perceived likability requires a
tether to reality.
</P>
<P>
   If the 2000 contest were being waged in Roman times, the
Democratic faction in the white togas would no doubt anoint Al Gore
and Bill Bradley, as their former Senate brethren, to rule the
Empire jointly.
</P>
<P>
   As centrists, both are imbued with the idea of marginally
expanding social and economic justice in ways that do not
significantly shake the political architecture. If they were ever
to be shipwrecked on a desert island, they would soon seek each
other out, contentedly awaiting rescue beneath the same coconut
palm.
</P>
<P>
   The political press corps, drawing battle scenes where none
exist, largely fails to report that it would make scant difference,
in terms of governance, whether Gore moved up or whether Bradley
sunk enough long shots to claim victory.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the media's performance in handicapping a Democratic race
that promises to be decided in the early primaries seems prescient
compared to our coverage of the Republican contestants, among
which, at this point, there is no real race to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   Even low-watt pundits should be able to discern that the
Republican mainstream has coalesced around the candidacy of Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and will continue to support him unless he
stumbles in some totally unforeseen way.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Bush's seeming inevitability in gaining his party's
nomination reflects inherent Republican weaknesses more than any
deep political mastery on his part. Assuming that they can retain
their congressional majorities, the Republicans seek above all else
a winner who would end the omnipresent veto threat that forces them
to haggle with a Democratic president.
</P>
<P>
   Other declared candidates simply fail to measure up. In terms of
Roman-type gravitas, Bush's closest rival remains John McCain.
Although the Arizona senator is disliked by some insiders as a
maverick with too many media pals, he is Bush's most likely choice
as a running mate _ for the same reason that Ronald Reagan chose
Bush's father to join the ticket in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her neo-Thatcherite advantages, Elizabeth Dole comes
across to many insiders as a lightweight. Magazine magnate Steve
Forbes again wages an overexposed vanity candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the first primaries still many months away, it should
be obvious that the other candidates are either niche figures, like
Pat Buchanan and Gary Bauer, or doomed losers, like Dan Quayle and
Orrin Hatch. Come next February, when the snowflakes are really
falling in New Hampshire, those conclusions should still stand.

 BUSINESS TRAVEL: CROWDED PLANES; AIRLINE UPDATE; WILL CARNIVAL BUY
PRINCESS?  (Duplication warning: also moving in `t' category) 
(mk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you wonder whether the flights you have been on in recent
months are always crowded, or whether you are just a victim of bad
timing or bad luck, the load factors _ the percentages of available
seats occupied by paying passengers _ for most U.S. airlines last
month are revealing. So are the year-to-date load factors.
</P>
<P>
   Every major carrier had load factors at least in the 70s in
July, and most had them in the mid- to high-70s. Two airlines,
Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines, had them in the 80s
that month; TWA's 2.4 million domestic passengers resulted in what
the airlines said was its ``best month in modern history'' for
domestic boardings.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines also broke records in July. The 79.1 percent load
factor at Delta Air Lines, for example, was the highest for any
month in its 70-year history, while the 77.8 percent at Continental
Airlines was not only the highest of any July in its history, but
its second-highest month ever.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think you can easily get an overnight ``red eye''
flight or a Saturday flight, both of which used to be readily
available because few business travelers flew then. Now they have
to fly when there are seats. On several recent Saturdays, for
example, occupancies on Delta flights have averaged above 80
percent, and on a recent Saturday reached 86.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has driven people to what used to be underused
flights, because those fares tend to be cheaper and passengers are
willing to fly at those times for a bargain price,'' said John
Kennedy, a Delta spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The only two major airlines whose year-to-date passenger loads
were below 70 percent are America West at 67.4 percent and Alaska

   The annual average load factors hovered in the high-50s and

today. What this means, of course, is that packed airplanes are not
just the result of the luck of the draw but a permanent condition
for most passengers, at least until the economy weakens.

   Analysts are not all convinced that Carnival Corp. will succeed
in buying Princess Cruises, but neither do they think it is a pipe
dream, especially since Carnival confirmed that it had held talks
with Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co., Princess'
British owner. On Tuesday, Tim Gallagher, a Carnival spokesman,
said that the talks had occurred ``earlier this year,'' adding that
there were no talks currently and the company had no comment on
whether it had made an offer.
</P>
<P>
   Princess expects delivery of seven new ships between next year
and 2004, and that hardly seems like the action of a company
wanting to sell. On the other hand, when Carnival speaks, much of
the cruise industry rejoices or trembles. Its 35 percent market
share is far and away the largest, as is its fleet of more than 44
ships, with nine on order. Princess, by contrast, has a 15.5
percent market share and nine ships plus the seven on order. And a
British newspaper, The Daily Mail, reported that Carnival offered
$11 billion for Princess.
</P>
<P>
   If Carnival does buy Princess, within three years it is likely
to command at least 50 percent of the worldwide cruise market. If
it does not, Carnival still has come a long way since its inception
in 1972. It acquired its first ship _ the Empress of Canada _ from
Canadian Pacific for $5 million. Renamed the Mardi Gras, it
promptly ran aground on its maiden voyage from the Port of Miami.

 BUSINESS TRAVEL: CROWDED PLANES; AIRLINE UPDATE; WILL CARNIVAL BUY
PRINCESS?  (Duplication warning: also moved in `f' category) 
(mk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   If you wonder whether the flights you have been on in recent
months are always crowded, or whether you are just a victim of bad
timing or bad luck, the load factors _ the percentages of available
seats occupied by paying passengers _ for most U.S. airlines last
month are revealing. So are the year-to-date load factors.
</P>
<P>
   Every major carrier had load factors at least in the 70s in
July, and most had them in the mid- to high-70s. Two airlines,
Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines, had them in the 80s
that month; TWA's 2.4 million domestic passengers resulted in what
the airlines said was its ``best month in modern history'' for
domestic boardings.
</P>
<P>
   Other airlines also broke records in July. The 79.1 percent load
factor at Delta Air Lines, for example, was the highest for any
month in its 70-year history, while the 77.8 percent at Continental
Airlines was not only the highest of any July in its history, but
its second-highest month ever.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think you can easily get an overnight ``red eye''
flight or a Saturday flight, both of which used to be readily
available because few business travelers flew then. Now they have
to fly when there are seats. On several recent Saturdays, for
example, occupancies on Delta flights have averaged above 80
percent, and on a recent Saturday reached 86.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has driven people to what used to be underused
flights, because those fares tend to be cheaper and passengers are
willing to fly at those times for a bargain price,'' said John
Kennedy, a Delta spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The only two major airlines whose year-to-date passenger loads
were below 70 percent are America West at 67.4 percent and Alaska
Airlines at 62.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The annual average load factors hovered in the high-50s and
low-60s throughout the 1980s. In 1994 they rose to 69.3 percent and
thereafter began their ascent into the 70s, where they remain

AUSTRALIAN TEEN SWIMMER KEEPS WINNING AND GIVING 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JOHN SHAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ ``After all, Ian is still a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Williams was talking about Ian Thorpe, who is her son's
best friend and, at the age of 16 years 10 months, has become the
talk of international swimmimg.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Williams, 13 and now in remission from cancer, was at
poolside with his mother last Sunday to cheer Thorpe to the first
of his four world records, 3 minutes 41.83 seconds in the 400 meter
freestyle at the Pan-Pacific championships.
</P>
<P>
   That victory gained Thorpe a $15,000 bonus offered by a
telephone company to the first swimmer to break a world record in
the Sydney Olympic Aquatic Center. The center, opened in 1994 and
will stage the Olympic pool events just over a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe immediately donated half the prize to an institute that
conducts research on children's cancer, and the rest to a crisis
counseling service known as Lifeline. ``They need it a lot more
than I do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6-inch teen-ager will soon be a millionaire thanks to
seven sponsorship contracts, including one to promote breakfast
cereal, which will bring him around $325,000 a year. But his gift
was admired as proof of the neighborhood links he retains amid the
rush of training, travel, competition and media attention.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe met Michael Williams, who has a type of lymphoma, at East
Hills High, a technical studies school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ian was always there for Michael,'' Sylvia Williams said.
``Ian has been really good for Michael during his treatment. They
get on really well together.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe's personal home page on the Pan-Pacific Web site lists
interests typical of many teen-agers: computer games and grunge
music. Australians, particularly journalists following Thorpe's
400-meter and 200-meter records this week, are spraying
superlatives at the young swimmer, who joined teammates in smashing
the 200-meter freestyle world record with a time of 7:08.79
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A national radio commentator joked that without fresh
adjectives, television race callers and headline writers would soon
risk ``sounding like a broken record.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe did not start in the Pan-Pacifics as an unknown. He won
four gold medals at the Commonwealth Games held in Malaysia in
1998. However, the extent of his success this week has seemed to
have taken his coach, Doug Frost, the Australian head coach, Dan
Talbot, and others by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like that,'' the former American
Olympian Rowdy Gaines said of Thorpe's performance in the 400
meters, which took nearly two seconds off the previous world record
set in 1994 by Kieran Perkins, also of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Spitz, the American swimmer who won seven gold medals in
world record times at the 1972 Munich Olympics, said today,
``Thorpe has the potential to be one of the greatest champions ever
_ but the true sign of a champion is how he stands up to the
pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe seemed philosophical about the future. ``Looking ahead,''
he said Wednesday night, ``someone will swim over the top of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Other gold medals were decided Wednesday when the American Tom
Malchow swam the second-fastest 200-meter butterfly in history
(55.41) and the Australian Susie O'Neill took the 200-meter
freestyle (2:06.53), her time second only to Mary T. Meagher's
2:05.96 set 18 years ago. Joanne Marlar of Canada won the 200
individual medley in 2:13.63.
</P>
<P>
   In the 100 freestyle, Thorpe slowed just enough in his heat to
miss qualifying for the final. His countrymen Michael Klim (48.81)
and Chris Fydle (49.62) had faster qualifying times; only two
swimmers per nation can qualify for a final.

 &HT;    Flames of hate dividing Tennessee farming area
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BYBEE, Tenn. _ Tensions hang as heavy as clouds over this
community on the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains where an uproar
over a federally funded day care center for migrant farmers has
pitted neighbor against neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The feud is so nasty that the FBI has been called in to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 of the 600 people in the Bybee community have
signed a petition to keep out the Head Start program for children
of Hispanic workers. Many residents marched against the proposed
facility last month. Then, early July 24, someone torched the barn
belonging to the farmer leasing the tract for the center.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the project, who deny any role in the arson, said
Hispanic workers have tossed Molotov cocktails at their protest
signs, and they complain that while the FBI is investigating the
barn burning, it is not looking into the firebombings.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents view the Mexican migrant workers as a threat to
their families and to their way of life and future jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has literally torn this community apart,'' said
Danese Marshall, a longtime resident. ``This is not Bybee.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating the barn burning as a possible hate
crime. In 1997, the last year for which national FBI hate crime
figures are available, Hispanics were targeted in more than half
the ethnic-related incidents _ 491 of 836.
</P>
<P>
   James Ellison, 72, the farmer whose barn was torched, figures
his loss, including 170 rolls of hay, at around $30,000. He is
mostly in the beef cattle business now, but in the past he worked
as many as 16 migrants on his tobacco crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would see the little kids sitting in the hot sun in
vehicles. It's critical,'' Ellison said of the Head Start program.
``You'd never get any of the white people to do the job. Farming is
just about over with. If it weren't for the migrants, it would be
over.''
</P>
<P>
   But some residents contend the Mexicans steal from their stores,
leer at local women and contribute little to the economy because
they send most of their pay home in money orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll steal more than they buy,'' said Jack Lane, the owner
of a local store. ``I had three dozen pairs of rubber gloves. One
bought a pair and the rest of them they stole. You can't watch
them; it's like watching a bunch of flies.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the day care is stalled until an environmental impact
study can be done on the land, which opposition members said is
swampy wetlands _ of use only to the crayfish that burrow there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is worth the investment to dispel the concerns of the
community,'' said J. Davis, state director of the Telamon Tennessee
Migrant-Head Start Program, operated by the Telamon Corp., a
nonprofit organization based in Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   About two years ago, a similar project in nearby Parrottsville
was abandoned because of opposition that got so threatening that
the previous Head Start director left town, Davis said. ``It got
pretty frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Migrant farmers have been part of Southern agriculture for
generations, and in recent years many of them have been Mexicans.
The Hispanic population of the region has grown dramatically in the
1990s. In Tennessee, the increase was 73 percent between 1990 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
   In Bybee and Cocke counties, migrant workers harvest tobacco and
tomatoes from July through October. But locals said there are only
two big commercial farms left in the poor community, and that the
immigrant workers are taking jobs away from locals and bringing
problems that the day care center will only facilitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it that when one of these things comes in, the dope
comes in?'' asked Donald Strom, one of the opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mexicans have always been involved. That's why I'm opposed
to it. They are a liability. They are no assets to any community.
Why pay our tax money for something we have no use for? What we
need are good-paying jobs. We're prejudiced against what the
federal government is doing.'' The Head Start program would employ
25 people to care for 50 children ranging in age from infancy to 4
years. There are five other Head Start programs in Cocke County,
available to children of impoverished families who are too young to
go to school. ``We're not trying to do something secretive; we're
not trying to do something destructive to the community,'' Davis
said. ``And we're certainly not trying to get anyone hurt.'' Some
residents complain in particular about the absence of any public
discussion before the project was set in motion.
</P>
<P>
   It was only when the surveyors started working on the property
that next-door neighbor Robert Bible found out about the project.
</P>
<P>
   Bible said he was startled out of bed at 4 a.m. by law officers
the morning the barn burned. He denounced the violence but defended
the attitude of many residents against the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not against the children, but we want our community to
stay just like it is,'' Bible said.

 &HT;    A long-distance glimpse of Bush's summer digs
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWER COAST OF MAINE _ All the way to Portsmouth, N.H., from
Concord, we travel a winding, two-lane road that meanders through
the eastern part of the state, which looks much like Deep East
Texas except the temperature is 30 degrees cooler and ``Moose
Crossing'' signs dot the highway every few miles.
</P>
<P>
   Moose crossing. You think running into a white-tailed deer is
bad. Try smacking your Subaru up against a 1,200-pound real-life
version of Bullwinkle. The Manchester Union Leader, a charmingly
right-wing paper in the state's largest city, ran a story about a
woman killed after hitting a moose. Strangely enough, on the same
page the paper ran a story about the moose being available as art
on vanity license plates. Winner of this month's Taste and
Sensitivity Award, I figure.
</P>
<P>
   My uncle recently had a run-in with a bear. The bear crossed the
road near his house, and he swerved to avoid it and hit a boulder
instead. New Hampshire is big on boulders. Instead of barbed wire,
there are stone fences, which are undoubtedly a chore to build but
last a long time. Besides, as my brother pointed out, you have to
do something with all those danged rocks.
</P>
<P>
   We cross Northwood Lake in midmorning, where my godparents had a
lake house we practically lived at in the summers, water skiing,
fishing and living the life of Riley. We spy a flock of Canadian
geese sunning themselves in a pond along the road. Come winter,
they're liable to be passing overhead here in Deep East Texas,
heading for South Texas and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Soon we're at Portsmouth, an old ship-building town that is a
tourist mecca in the summer. The centerpiece of downtown, which is
filled with yuppie coffee shops and clubs, is the First
Congregational Church, home church to three signers of the
Declaration of Independence. George Washington attended a service
here once, a sign says.
</P>
<P>
   When you've lived in Texas long as I have, more than three
decades, you forget that in this part of the world distances are
much more compressed. In about as long as it takes to get from the
Piney Woods to the Louisiana boats, you're halfway up the coast of
Maine, stuck in a long line of cars heading to the beaches where
hardly anyone swims since the North Atlantic water is about 65
degrees at best. Maine's license plates say ``Vacation Land,'' and
obviously that's what this state is during the summer, though one
would have to be a masochist or polar bear to visit the coast in
the dead of winter.
</P>
<P>
   Onward and upward we go, stopping at Fort McClary, which has
protected the mouth of the Piscataqua River since the early 1700s.
The present structure is only 150 years old or so. A pamphlet I
picked up said the fort was manned during five wars, from the
Revolutionary conflict through World War I but saw little conflict.
Invading the United States by coming ashore in eastern Maine is
probably not the most efficient route.
</P>
<P>
   At York Harbor, we walk along the shore and look at the boats,
admire the rows of lobster traps set on a dock, gaze with envy at
the harbor homes, mainly made of cedar shakes painted bright colors
_ brick red and robin's egg blue are popular.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we reach our northernmost destination on this day trip
_ Kennebunkport, the summer home of former President George Bush.
We stop first at a lovely Episcopalian church on a point right on
the coast where the president, we figure, worships when in town.
Then we head north until we spy a bunch of people stopped by the
side of the road taking pictures. Sure enough, it's the former
president's summer compound. Through binoculars, I spy security
people walking around but alas, there's no sign of our 36th
president. He's probably out campaigning for his son. Kennebunkport
might pale when compared to the Kennedy's Hyannisport, but it beats
any lake house I've seen lately.
</P>
<P>
   We head back south and stop at the Kittery Trading Post where an
alarming number of Yankees are walking around toting rifles. This
is a combination sporting goods/clothing/souvenir store, about the
size of a small Wal-Mart. We don't stay long because our stomachs
are growling, and all those weapons on the shoulders of grim-faced
men make me nervous. Our final stop is Foster's Clam Bake, a York
Harbor institution.
</P>
<P>
   My youngest brother shells out $41 for a two-pound lobster,
which he personally sends to its death after picking him out of the
tank. I settle for a considerably cheaper plate of sea scallops and
mooch some of his lobster. The temperature has dropped to about 60
degrees as the sun begins to set, and the air smells fresh and
clean.
</P>
<P>
   A man could get used to living here, at least until that first
nor'easter hit about mid-October. Then I'd be hightailing back
across the Mason-Dixon line as fast as possible.

 &HT;    The words of our times
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Take a moment, close your eyes and listen to the
century. What do you hear? What you should hear is a century of
change, turbulence, war. You should also hear laughter and music.
You should hear the voices of people who made a mark on their times
and you should also hear the voices of people you loved and who
loved you.
</P>
<P>
   Here are but a few samples of quotes I think illuminate the
century. They are not represented as being comprehensive. They are
after all, a sample.
</P>
<P>
   OK, let's start at the beginning and see where it takes us.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Party's obit premature, Democratic leaders say
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Woe for Texas Democrats. In a dozen years,
they've gone from holding 25 of the 27 statewide elective positions
to holding none. They've lost their majority in the Texas Senate
and are four votes from losing it in the Texas House.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have a single statewide officeholder to head up the
2000 Democratic presidential campaign, which presumably will star
Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And if Gov. George W. Bush is the Republican nominee for
president next year, he will have more money and clout than God,
will be so popular they'll be stamping his image on coins, and even
usually Democratic Hispanics will be holding adoring pachangas and
naming babies after him.
</P>
<P>
   Popular Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who will be
seeking re-election to the Senate next year, will be right below
Bush's name on the ballot. Between her campaign and Bush's _ and
the soft money that can be funneled through the Republican Party of
Texas _ the GOP will have enough money to conduct a house-to-house
search for voters.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Republicans take over the Texas House, increase
their 16-15 margin in the Texas Senate and pick up a couple
congressional seats now held by Democrats. That would set the stage
for redistricting in 2001, when Republicans could draw political
districts to undo the 17-13 margin the Democrats now hold, plus
capture the two new seats Texas will get.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, heed Willie Nelson: ``Turn out the lights; the
party's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Hold up, says Texas Democratic Party Chairwoman Molly Beth
Malcolm. Bush may have gotten nearly 70 percent of the vote in
1998, but fellow Republicans Rick Perry and Carole Keeton Rylander
barely won their races for lieutenant governor and comptroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the Democrats still kept the (Texas) House, we kept every
one of our congressional seats, and we took back a Senate seat from
an incumbent.'' So, if Bush gets the GOP nomination, Malcolm added,
``it is not going to make any difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Gallego (D-Alpine), who chairs the Democratic Caucus
in the state House, said 1998 was the GOP's watershed year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's high tide, and it's passed,'' Gallego said, adding that
he does not believe a Bush nomination would affect other Texas
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Warren Chisum, a Pampa Democrat-turned-Republican who
is part of Democratic House Speaker Pete Laney's leadership team,
said he doesn't think Bush's presence would have a significant
effect on legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that voters have become more informed and willing
to split their tickets,'' Chisum said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Democrats haven't thrown in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate Democratic Caucuses have become more
active, staking claim to Democratic causes and issues. State Sen.
David Cain, D-Dallas, said the Senate Democratic Caucus has hired
seasoned Democratic political operative Doug Zabel ``to make sure
there is a Democratic message.'' The House Democratic Caucus met
Monday with Speaker Laney about the Children's Health Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego said he thinks insurance for kids will be one of the
issues that separates Democrats from Republicans. Education and
teacher pay will be others, he said. Malcolm says the state party
is building its grass roots infrastructure so that it won't matter
if there's an elected official heading the Texas presidential
effort.
</P>
<P>
   But how much can be accomplished without the money-raising
leverage and voter appeal top elected officials generate will be a
major question for the Democrats _ particularly with no heavyweight
yet considering taking on Hutchison.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Democrats are trying to undo years of neglect. Democratic
presidential candidates wrote off Texas from 1980 to 1992, because
Texan George Bush was on the ballot for vice president and then
president. Bill Clinton won without Texas in 1992, so he didn't
compete in the state in 1996. The 2000 Democratic nominee will
probably pass up Texas too, if Bush is the GOP nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaigns' meager Texas investment in TV ads
and get-out-the-vote efforts have left down-ballot Democrats to
fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Glen Maxey (D-Austin), who has overseen get-out-the-vote
efforts in Travis County in several recent elections, says he's far
less concerned about Bush's political impact in 2000 than his
policy impact in the 1999 legislative session on issues like
children's health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're waiting for the governor to move on what's good for
families and working Texans,'' Maxey said.

 &HT;    Quick, Bush, give reporters some other substance to report
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ What George W. Bush needs is someone to bomb.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfair, he's grumbling right now, that Bill Clinton has
someone to bomb and he doesn't. Al Gore has a similar advantage,
being vice commander in chief and adjutant general of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a governor in a weak-governor state with the Legislature
out of session. He's powerless to distract the nation from the
personal questions being asked about him.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton can send in commandos to some despotic minefield.
Bush can't even send in auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is refusing to play the reporters' game. They are refusing
to stop playing until he says yes or no to the only truly
scintillating question his presidential campaign thus far has put
on everyone's lips _ except maybe for, ``He raised $36 million?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush needs to be able to call a press conference and jar people
to distraction with some earth-shaking announcement or position
statement. His biggest recent announcement was naming a new
education commissioner. That's no way to stop the national Q&AMP;A
session that's missing the ``A.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, this particular question isn't the only one
left unanswered by the Bush camp. All the others have to do with
where Bush stands on issues that matter to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   It's early, the Bush camp says. Let the candidate baste his
audiences with buttery homilies first. Press corps dean David
Broder asked key Bush adviser Karl Rove when it would be that Bush
would divert from the stump speech he's been delivering ``almost
without variation'' since announcing.
</P>
<P>
   When ``every American can recite the words of this one by
heart,'' Rove retorted.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly how Bush works _ keeping things simple, heavy on
the generalities, light on the lightning-bolt stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is going to get awfully flustered with details people _
reporters, for instance _ along the way who want to know exactly
what he would to do as president, who would benefit, where, when
and why.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, with a weak-governor system, Bush can leave the
details up to someone else entirely and then claim victory later
with whatever Ws emerge.
</P>
<P>
   It's wrong to classify Bush as a lightweight based on this
approach to the details. He's been a successful governor. But to be
classified as a heavyweight nationally, and presumably to be
elected president, Bush will have some elaboration to do.
</P>
<P>
   From his first term as governor, Bush emerges as the
quintessential chairman of the board, the one who can do a
handshake here, a neck rub there, a wink here, a nod there and get
a lot of people to buy into a general principle, then head out on
the golf course (or presidential campaign exploration trail) and
let others figure the specifics out.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a masterful people person. He can win people over one on
one, a skill which could make him a smash hit in dealing with
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 25 years after the latter's removal, one can think of no
greater contrast than the social skills of George W. Bush and those
of Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Nixon knew the material, knew the world, knew the
specifics _ too many specifics, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, by contrast, tells supporters, ``Nobody needs to tell me
what to believe. But I do need somebody to tell me where Kosovo
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it satisfactory that the man who would be president would be
able to qualify that statement with, ``But I know how to ask''?
</P>
<P>
   Some will say absolutely. Some will say it just shows he's
human. He'll learn.
</P>
<P>
   Not satisfactory, said George Will, who blasted Bush over such
comments in what essentially was a ``grow up, George'' broadside
last week.
</P>
<P>
   A bombing strike would shut everybody up. What's a governor to
do?

 &HT;    Remembering a great writer of the New South
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I first became aware of Willie Morris way back in the 1950s when
I was managing editor of Hodding Carter's daily in Greenville,
Miss. Morris, a Mississippi native had been editor of the student
newspaper at the University of Texas in Austin and was a Rhodes
Scholar at Oxford, England, when he sent me a long piece about a
yank at Oxford. We ran the piece, of course. After all, a
Mississippi boy at Oxford was, in itself, enough to be news in the
Delta country just north of his home town of Yazoo City.
</P>
<P>
   Willie returned to Austin after his years at Oxford (the one in
England) to edit The Texas Observer when it was a weekly tabloid.
The Observer had a definite liberal leaning but was respected and
read by both sides of the aisle in the Texas Legislature. Every
Thursday when it came out, the floors of the House and Senate
looked like one of those old Philadelphia Enquirer ads where
everybody but one person on a bus or in a cafe was reading the
Enquirer and the cutline read, ``Almost everybody reads the
Enquirer.''
</P>
<P>
   From Austin, Willie moved north to New York City where he soon
became editor-in-chief of Harpers magazine. From that chair he
recruited some of the nation's best writers _ David Halberstam,
Larry L. King, William Styron, Norman Mailer and others and (in the
words of Halberstam) ``Brought that old magazine kicking and
screaming into modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   After moving to New York, Morris wrote the best seller ``North
Toward Home'' and followed it with other books, several written
specifically for young readers and several about his home state,
Mississippi. Not long after leaving Harpers in the late 1960s, he
returned home to Mississippi where he was for a time Writer in
Residence at Ole Miss and was married and moved to Jackson where he
wrote other books and explained his home state in articles and
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Willie died of a heart attack a couple weeks ago at the
relatively young age of 64, and even those who knew him fairly
well, as I did, were surprised by the way his fellow Magnolia
Staters honored him. He was the first person to lie in state at the
Old Capitol in Jackson since Sen. John Stennis in 1995. His funeral
and memorial services were attended by famous writers such as
Halberstam and Styron and the governor of Mississippi and a former
governor, William Winter, who was a lifelong friend of Morris'.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a blanket of sadness across the whole state,'' David
Sansing, historian at the University of Mississippi, told the
Jackson Clarion-Ledger, ``Everybody I've talked to says and
realizes that we've lost somebody very special to us.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said in a statement: ``He had an enormous
pride and love for the South, but he also had a passion to right
the wrongs of our racial history.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just a sample of the statewide outpouring of love and
sadness expressed in Mississippi after Willie's untimely death. As
a former Mississippi resident and newspaperman, I found myself
thinking such thoughts as:
</P>
<P>
   ``My, how things have changed over there across the Mississippi
River. Back in the 1950s when I was there, writing and printing
some of the same kinds of things Willie expressed in his books and
articles, they tried to run me and my editor Hodding Carter out of
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Who says the South won't rise again?
</P>

 &HT;    Britney doll makers hope to sit pretty, too
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Britney Spears' two biggest fans are not
giddy grade-school girls. When Jay Foreman, 37, and Charlie Emby,
32, go to bed each night, they pray for good health and giant hits
for the pop music phenom.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure,'' says Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' adds Emby.
</P>
<P>
   If Britney stays big, so does her mini-me _ the Britney doll,
available for $14.99 in stores mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman and Emby of Boca Raton are launching their new toy
company, Play Along Inc., with the Britney Spears doll. They say it
cost them ``millions'' to license, design, distribute and promote
the dolls.
</P>
<P>
   But they're betting Britney Jean Spears, who turns 18 on Dec. 2,
is worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Britney has the brand potential to be like a Barbie,'' says
Foreman. ``She's got another three, four years to develop her
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Spears surfaced with a debut record, ``Baby One More Time,'' in
January. The album _ 5 million sold so far _ spills sugary hits
like Froot Loops falling into a bowl. She's set to appear on an
episode of ABC's ``Sabrina the Teenage Witch'' and four episodes of
WB's ``Dawson's Creek'' during TV sweeps. There's the Rolling Stone
cover, too.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman and Emby know the toy truth: Strike while a star is hot.
They quit toy maker Empire Industries in Delray Beach last fall to
start Play Along in May. In the toy business _ just like pop music
_ you're judged by your hits.
</P>
<P>
   Emby sold Big Wheels, Barbie dolls, Lion King toys and the Koosh
Ball. Foreman helped engineer the success of Spice Girls dolls,
which earned $150 million pretax cash for toy maker Galoob.
</P>
<P>
   The Britney doll could click at cash registers if sold as a
collectible, says Marty Brochstein, executive editor of The
Licensing Letter, a New York City toy industry newsletter. ``KISS
dolls did very, very well.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the Emby/Foreman plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a demographic standpoint, she's perfect,'' says Emby.
``Barbie sells to girls (age) 3 to 5. Britney's the next level.
Girls won't play with her like Barbie, they'll display her.''
</P>
<P>
   And they can get basic Britney three ways _ featuring an outfit
from the videos for ``Baby One More Time,'' ``Sometimes'' or ``(You
Drive Me) Crazy.'' Three ``deluxe'' Britney dolls, $19.99 each,
will come with two concert outfits. Other clothes and collectibles
plus limited-edition dolls will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus for Play Along, says analyst Brochstein, is that
retailers like toys based on scandal-free stars. And after what
Foreman experienced with the Spice Girls _ ``from peeing in hotel
planters to carrying around Tutti Fruiti condoms'' _ he can't
envision bad behavior that would cost Britney her fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Spice Girls rode the wave for 18 months. M.C. Hammer didn't
last as long.
</P>
<P>
   Hammer, riding the hit ``Can't Touch This,'' was soaring in the
late '80s when he agreed to a doll and TV cartoon show. His urban
hip-hop audience hollered, ``Sell out!'' and fled. Hammer's career
plunged with a legendary thud.
</P>
<P>
   Foreman and Emby are so sure Britney will sell that they'd like
to lock up other hot pop acts. On a table at the Play Along offices
in Fort Lauderdale are prototypes of Ricky Martin (once licensed as
a Menudo doll), Backstreet Boys and 'N Sync dolls.
</P>
<P>
   But those performers, so far, have said no dolls to Play Along.
They know what happened to Hammer, and pop music wisdom is that
dolls are death to boy bands.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with Britney, whose mother, Lynn, and sister, Jamie,
collect dolls.
</P>
<P>
   When Foreman showed Britney her dolls, ``she flipped out. She
said, `I wish I was that beautiful. I can't wait until my mom and
sister see them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Foreman adds, ``Sporty Spice said the same thing when I showed
her her doll. `I can't wait to show me mum.'''

   JOEMURRAY-COLUMN _ MESQUITE, Texas _ I went recently to the new
30-plex that has opened here in Mesquite, a Dallas suburb where I
live. Thirty movies playing at one time. Entertainment is fine, but
can you say overkill? Driving home after the movie, I couldn't help
thinking about the little theater we used to go to in Greenville,
Texas. (Murray, Cox News Service) MOVED WEDNESDAY.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ LOWER COAST OF MAINE _ All the way to
Portsmouth, N.H., from Concord, we travel a winding, two-lane road
that meanders through the eastern part of the state, which looks
much like Deep East Texas except the temperature is 30 degrees
cooler and ``Moose Crossing'' signs dot the highway every few

Daily Sentinel.) MOVED. EMBARGOED for Sunday.

   GARCIA-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Take a moment, close your eyes
and listen to the century. What do you hear? What you should hear
is a century of change, turbulence, war. You should also hear
laughter and music. You should hear the voices of people who made a
mark on their times and you should also hear the voices of people
you loved and who loved you. Here are but a few samples of quotes I
think illuminate the century. (Arnold Garcia is editorial page

   YOUNG-COLUMN _ WACO, Texas _ What George W. Bush needs is
someone to bomb. It's unfair, he's grumbling right now, that Bill
Clinton has someone to bomb and he doesn't. Al Gore has a similar
advantage, being vice commander in chief and adjutant general of
the Internet. Bush is a governor in a weak-governor state with the
Legislature out of session. He's powerless to distract the nation
from the personal questions being asked about him. (John Young is

   SKOL-DRESSCODE _ For parents of school-age kids, going to the
mall with a ruler has become a rite of fall. School dress codes
dictate how short shorts can be, among other things. This year, the
shorts girls want -- and pretty much the only ones in stores -- are
too short for many schools, so the kids must wear long pants. Other
rules cause other little hassles: In Coweta, if your pants have
belt loops, you must have a belt -- so kids are searching stores
for beltless pants or cutting off their loops to comply. (Hill,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

   COXNET TRAVEL 0828 HIKING IN YOSEMITE -- I'm standing atop Half
Dome, a sheer granite cliff soaring impressively above this awesome
park. I can think of nothing but throwing up. My brother convinced
me I could stop along the way and read if I got tired. It was an
empty promise. It's the type of lie in which both parties consent,

   TRAVEL-BRAZIL _ RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _A two-part Brazil travel
series by Wendell Brock begins today. An introductory hold-to-cover
story will sketch out the writer's two week journey in Rio, Ouro
Preto, Salvador and Sao Paulo. While Europe is a far more popular
with American travelers, this expansive South American nation _
with its African culture, European architecture, endless beaches
and vibrant cuisine _ is a friendly alternative, especially with
nonstop flights from Atlanta and a very strong dollar. (Brock,

   TRAVEL-MALL _ BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ The Mall of America is a 4.2
million-square-foot faux-city that's two and a half times as big as
the new Mall of Georgia. Amenities such as a wedding chapel,
amusement park, health clinic and a university are mere supporting
players to the nearly 500 stores, with themes ranging from
refrigerator magnets to babushkas. In other words, a shopaholic's
dream, surreal as it may be at times. If the notion of heading to
Minnesota on a shopping vacation sounds a little indulgent, well,
there are deals that make it not so easy to dismiss. (Walker,

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ ``On September 24, 1943, at Fort Leavenworth in
Kansas, army captain James T. Quirk received a telegram advising
him that his wife, Elizabeth, had given birth that morning in
Philadelphia to their first child, a son.'' The words are
intentionally flat, straightforward in their factuality, without
hint of the future. But the son born 56 years ago next month would
be the lone witness to a familiar American tragedy. Rory Quirk was
James and Elizabeth Quirk's only child, and the legatee to dreams
that never quite came true. The story he tells in ``Wars and Peace:
The Memoir of an American Family'' is on one level his story, on
another his parents' and, on still another level, the story of a
generation that sacrificed without complaint. (Skube, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 31.

   SKOL-DRESSCODE _ For parents of school-age kids, going to the
mall with a ruler has become a rite of fall. School dress codes
dictate how short shorts can be, among other things. This year, the
shorts girls want -- and pretty much the only ones in stores -- are
too short for many schools, so the kids must wear long pants. Other
rules cause other little hassles: In Coweta, if your pants have
belt loops, you must have a belt -- so kids are searching stores
for beltless pants or cutting off their loops to comply. (Hill,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

with American travelers, this expansive South American nation _
with its African culture, European architecture, endless beaches
and vibrant cuisine _ is a friendly alternative, especially with
nonstop flights from Atlanta and a very strong dollar. (Brock,

players to the nearly 500 stores, with themes ranging from
refrigerator magnets to babushkas. In other words, a shopaholic's
dream, surreal as it may be at times. If the notion of heading to
Minnesota on a shopping vacation sounds a little indulgent, well,
there are deals that make it not so easy to dismiss. (Walker,

   BEIJING _ The unassuming old Chinese cobbler who works on a
narrow city alley suddenly realized he risked getting locked up. So
he took the logical step and stopped doing his daily meditational
exercises.
</P>
<P>
   And he makes sure everyone knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to practice Falun Gong, but now I know it's not good,''
he announced out of the blue to a foreigner who stopped to chat.
``It was a good thing the government explained this.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has not merely ``explained'' the evils of Falun
Gong to average Chinese like Liu Donghua, the 73-year-old who
quietly tends to broken shoes and zippers from his tiny alleyside
chair.
</P>
<P>
   It outlawed the popular regime of meditation and exercise, and
has blanketed this nation of 1.2 billion people with an unrelenting
propaganda barrage that even government supporters describe as
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Chinese followers of Falun Gong were detained at
least briefly, and thousands more like Liu now have renounced the
sect and its charismatic founder Li Hongzhi, who lives in exile in
New York. In coming weeks the movement's core leaders are expected
to be charged here and tried for crimes related to undermining
social order.
</P>
<P>
   Why this attack-dog response to a spiritual, mental and physical
regimen that draws on respected, centuries-old Chinese traditions
such as Buddhism and Taoism? Or is Falun Gong really something more
insidious?
</P>
<P>
   Beijing's communist power elite knows its country's history.
Such moralistic or quasi-religious movements undermined past
Chinese regimes, from the Donglin Society in the 1600s to the
Taiping uprising against the Qing rulers in the 1850s, as Chinese
unhappy with their lives became mesmerized by teachers promising to
show a better way.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the wake-up call jolted Beijing on April 25, when
10,000 Falun Gong members suddenly showed up at the capital,
quietly ringed the seat of government at Zhongnanhai compound and
protested their failure to win official recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The top leadership soon discovered that Falun Gong encompassed
not just cobblers, but military officers, educated professionals
and even Communist Party members. The group had set up 39 teaching
centers, 1,900 places of instruction and more than 28,000 group
exercise venues. It had also published books and produced videos,
and kept it all connected with high tech communications via
Internet, phone and fax.
</P>
<P>
   It was organized, and to an autocratic Communist regime that
does not countenance any other independent organizations, that
meant it was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   On July 22, Falun Gong was banned.
</P>
<P>
   A month-long drumbeat of government-sponsored propaganda against
the group has included daily articles in newspapers and
testimonials televised day and night from Chinese telling how their
lives or their loved ones were ruined by the practice of Falun
Gong. The tragedies included suicides and deaths from refusing
medical treatment, supposedly under Falun Gong influence.
</P>
<P>
   The promise last week(CQ) to prosecute key organizers carried a
pledge to go lightly with those who see their error and give up the
practice. But it also drove another wedge in relations with
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe people should be persecuted or prosecuted
simply for peaceful assembly or for exercising their religious
beliefs or practices, as long as they are not harming anybody,''
said U.S. State Department spokesman James Foley.
</P>
<P>
   China gave its normal response: keep out of our internal
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Falun Gong is an anti-scientific, anti-human, anti-social,
anti-government and illegal organization with all the
characteristics of an evil religion,'' a Foreign Ministry spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese government claims that Falun Gong has wreaked both
personal physical harm and broader societal damage are countered by
the group's response that it promotes a simple, take-it-or-leave-it
philosophy for better living.
</P>
<P>
   Li Hongzhi, 48, only devised the movement in 1992 as another
sibling in the Qi Gong (pronounced, ``Chi Gong'') family of
meditational exercise and martial arts. In America, the best-known
is Tai Chi.
</P>
<P>
   Until he started studying Qi Gong, Li was known for nothing
remarkable; playing the trumpet at a military stud farm while he
was a conscript in the People's Liberation Army and later working
in security at an agricultural enterprise in eastern China.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Li managed to attract as many as 70 million Chinese
adherents to his five meditational exercises, four done standing
and one seated. Slow-motion arm movements combined with clearing
the mind are said to relax and free the practitioner from stress.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in this time of change and uncertainty, some argue, the
greater attraction was his moral dictum to cultivate zhen-shan-ren
_ or truthfulness, compassion and forbearance _ while eschewing
unhealthy habits like cigarettes and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   However, the government's claims of anti-scientific teachings
have some basis in Falun Gong literature, all of which has been
banned.
</P>
<P>
   The group's Web site speaks to the ``supernormal capabilities''
of Li and other masters of meditation, such as ``penetrative'' and
``remote'' sight permitting them to see through objects and miles
distant. It suggests they can ``remove the evil spirit and pull out
the root of the disease'' from a person who is ill.
</P>
<P>
   Although Falun Gong defenders say they never propose
``disturbing the normal state of human society'' by using these
supernatural powers on a wide scale, the message certainly could be
bent in the mind of a mentally challenged or physically sick person
seeking comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Falun Gong has preached, and whatever average Chinese
truly think about it today, the government hit a societal nerve
when charging the movement incited disturbances and fostered
instability.
</P>
<P>
   Liu the cobbler, who had practiced Falun Gong for nearly two
years and said he is in great physical shape, nonetheless seemed to
have dropped it effortlessly. The explanation may lie in another
comment he made, when asked to cite the best change in China in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social stability,'' he said. ``It's improved peoples' lives in
every way.''

 &HT;    100 DAYS AND COUNTING: Vieques bombing protesters await Clinton
panel decision

<P>
   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ The protest camp perches on a rocky
hilltop next to the bullet-riddled hulk of an old tank. A Puerto
Rican flag snaps in the stiff August breeze, while far below waves
dapple the azure Caribbean in a panorama that tourists would gladly
pay to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no tourists on this remote tip of Vieques, a small
island off Puerto Rico's eastern coast. The protestors here are
illegally occupying a U.S. Navy bombing range, determined to end
the decades of military activity they say has brought environmental
destruction and hampered economic development on their 20-mile-long
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because this is a form of oppression,'' said Pedro
Zenon, 21, a student who has camped on the remote target zone for
more than 100 days. ``We are tired of the Navy bossing us around.
It's time for all of our island to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides await the recommendation of a Clinton-appointed panel
probing use of the bombing range, due Tuesday(Aug. 31).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battle over the Navy's 60-year presence on
Vieques, which the Navy considers essential for combat training,
has become a sore spot in the often-touchy field of U.S.-Puerto
Rico relations. In a rare show of unity, the island's normally
fractious political parties _ who argue endlessly over the
perennial question of statehood _ have joined hands in a call for
the Navy to leave Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy lives by an outdated philosophy,'' said Ruben
Berrios, a member of the Puerto Rican Senate and head of the
Independence Party, who also has logged more than 100 days in the
protest camp. ``They are still living in the image of (Gen.
Douglas) MacArthur the conqueror walking through the waves. That no
longer applies. We are fighting for the right to command our own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has dominated newspaper headlines in Puerto Rico all
summer, ever since a native-born security guard was killed by a
wayward bomb on Vieques in April. Protests in the capital of San
Juan have swelled with thousands of marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The tumult has crossed the Atlantic, too, stirring awareness in
the vibrant Puerto Rican communities in Florida, New York and New
Jersey. A large protest is planned in New York City next month, and
civil rights icon Jesse Jackson has joined the cause, recently
visiting Vieques to pledge support.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has even appeared on the radar screen of U.S.
presidential candidates, with former senator and Democratic hopeful
Bill Bradley calling the Navy's activities ``unacceptable'' during
a recent visit to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner, also has
weighed in on the issue. He has appealed to President Bill Clinton
to look for alternatives that might end the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ perhaps mindful of the large Puerto Rican vote in New
York, where his wife is a likely U.S. Senate candidate _ has
already appointed a commission to investigate. The panel listened
to several days of angry testimony in visits to Puerto Rico and
Vieques, and is scheduled to issue recommendations by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, meanwhile, has responded to the growing protests by
insisting the bombing range on Vieques is unique and irreplaceable,
the only spot in the Atlantic basin where it can conduct full-scale
war games complete with submarines, aircraft carriers, battleships,
landing craft and air power. Even U.S. NATO allies use the practice
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just bombing for the sake of bombing,'' said Navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob Garcia. ``We're asking our young men and
women to do very risky jobs, and we need to train them like they
are going to actually fight. Vieques is unique because it's the
only place in the U.S. that we can bring all of the elements of an
integrated battle group together for that training.''
</P>
<P>
   All war-making practice on the island has been suspended since
the security guard was killed, although the Navy is clearly eager
to resume its exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But the protestors are just as adamant. Puerto Rico's Attorney
General, Jose Fuentes Agostini, has hired the Atlanta law firm of
King and Spalding to prepare a lawsuit to block any efforts to
resume the bombing. The suit would be filed should the Clinton
commission recommend re-opening the Vieques range.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico was a much different place in the early 1940s when
the Navy opened its bombing range. After coming under U.S. control
in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the island remained
poverty-stricken for decades, with little political clout in the
U.S., even though its residents were considered American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the crisis-wracked early days of World War II, there was
little protest when the Navy condemned 22,000 of Vieques' 33,000
acres, moving small farmers and sugar cane workers off their land
to the island's center.
</P>
<P>
   But there was resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my grandfather's land and house and paid him $30,''
said Rabames Trinidad, 46, a lifelong resident. ``They came through
with front-end loaders and took it all, scooping up his house and
dumping it on a little cleared spot where he was supposed to move.
He was never the same after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents soon grew accustomed to the sound of Navy planes
droning overhead, followed by the whump of exploding ordnance.
Houses shook and dust from the bombing sometimes filled the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say many residents left, looking for work on Puerto Rico
or in the nearby Virgin Islands. But there were new Navy jobs for
locals as security guards, and there were new island residents _
lots of sailors _ who patronized local bars and restaurants,
creating new economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   With these opportunities, however, also came new tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say the sailors sometimes ran wild on leave, carousing,
engaging in drunken brawls, even molesting island women. Although
the Navy long ago moved all but 25 of its personnel off the island,
the resentments still simmer. Even today, signs are posted on the
outskirts of the village of Esperanza, warning the military that
the area is off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the bombing,'' said Trinidad, recalling the
history of tension. ``It's all of this in the past, which we cannot
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Vieques isn't the U.S. military's only possession in Puerto
Rico: the island is also home to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station; the
Army's Fort Buchanan; a Naval security group; a Coast Guard air
station; and two Puerto Rican National Guard facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rest of Puerto Rico has achieved a modest
prosperity in the past three decades, Vieques and its 9,300
residents are struggling to evolve into something more than a
military target range. While their 3.8 million neighbors on the
main island of Puerto Rico have attracted manufacturing firms and
built a bustling tourism industry, Vieques resembles the Caribbean
of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Small farms dot the island's central uplands, livestock
occasionally wandering into the narrow, winding roads. Fisherman
venture out daily from Esperanza, riding the choppy waves in
brightly-colored boats to dive or line-fish for grouper, snapper
and dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Per-capita income is only $3,000 a year, less than half the
figure for the rest of Puerto Rico, and unemployment is nearly 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small but growing tourism industry, with several
guesthouses catering to tourists looking for an alternative to San
Juan's dizzy casinos and discos. A small General Electric plant
employs a few dozen workers, while a government-sponsored resort is
rising on the island's west side.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders want more, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that beach,'' said Jorge Adams, 44, a fisherman and
lifeguard, who recently chauffeured a visitor by boat around part
of the island. ``What big hotel chain wouldn't like to build there?
How many jobs would we have from that? But who wants to come here
and listen to bombs exploding?''
</P>
<P>
   But just getting the Navy to shut down the bombing range and
leave Vieques isn't the islanders' only concern. They also want the
sailors to clean up the environmental damage caused by the bombing
and to help jump-start the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental damage is clear _ years of bombing have
devastated the 900-acre target area. Shrapnel, debris, shell
casings and bomb parts litter the landscape, along with the rusty
remains of vehicles used as targets. There are likely unexploded
bombs, along with what the Navy admits is a small number of
armor-piercing bullets tipped with spent uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen claim the bombing has devastated their livelihood,
damaging the coral reefs that harbor fish and help spawn the marine
food-chain.
</P>
<P>
   There is an even more troubling claim.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques is saddled with Puerto Rico's highest rate of cancer _
27 percent greater than any other Puerto Rican town, according to
government statistics. Residents blame the bombing, and want
reparations for the illnesses. The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry is looking into the allegations, although its
report may take many months to compile.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vieques' residents wait patiently, enjoying the
temporary bombing halt, hoping it soon will be made permanent. If
the Navy refuses to leave, they vow the protest camps on the
bombing range _ already in place for more than three months _ will
grow. Any attempts to remove the protesters by force will only
bring more Navy opponents, they promise, along with a new round of
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has the last word,'' said fisherman Jose Anibal
Guerra, 54. ``I think he is going to tell them they have to go. If
he lets them stay, there will be more protests and fights. The Navy
has to leave Vieques. They have become our enemy.''

AN ORPHAN, HIS DOG AND A WINNING FAMILY FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the title indicates, there's a dog in ``A Dog of Flanders,''
a black bouvier that does heroic deeds. But the movie, the fourth
big-screen depiction of a 19th-century children's novella, is more
about a little orphan boy named Nello and his passion for art. Much
of the story is familiar, but it's told with such care and
affection that it's hard to object to its sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   Nello (Jeremy James Kissner) and the dog, named Patrasche,
become friends when Nello and his grandfather (Jack Warden)
discover the dog nearly beaten to death in a Flanders field
(Parents beware: the beating is brief, but brutal). Much is made of
Nello and Grampa being poor but happy, and along with Patrasche
they form into a tight, loving unit.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are stacked against Nello, though, and he is frustrated
in his attempts to maintain a friendship with a young neighbor girl
named Aloise (Farren Monet), and to develop his artistic talent.
Artist Michel La Grande (Jon Voight) takes him under his wing,
encouraging Nello to enter an art contest that could help the boy
out of his impoverished life.
</P>
<P>
   This is a lot to stuff to cram into a brief family movie, but
director/co-writer Kevin Brodie manages to keep things from
becoming confusing and somehow avoids didacticism in a movie that
reveres God ``and'' artist Peter Paul Rubens. Brodie lets things
get away from him now and then _ for a movie with such beautiful
cinematography, it has some of the lousiest makeup jobs you'll ever
see, and the film's climax gets a little too New-Agey for its own
good _ but his respect for the material makes up for a lot of these
flaws.
</P>
<P>
   What's a little mystifying is his underplaying of the dog, which
was much more of a force in Marie Louise de la Ramee's vivid and
sentimental book (written under the pen name Ouida) _ the film
seems like it should be called ``A Boy of Flanders'' (a silent
version went by this title). But at least it avoids the common
family-movie traps of condescension and cheap humor.

`THE MUSE' BESTOWS INSIDE INSPIRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Write what you know'' is a common bit of advice, which must be
why moviemakers love to do films about making movies. In the past
couple of weeks, we've had Steve Martin's raucously entertaining
Hollywood farce ``Bowfinger'' and John Turturro's ambitious but
muddled ensemble piece ``Illuminata.'' Now we have Albert Brooks'
amusing fantasy ``The Muse.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all of Brooks' films, it's intelligent and low-key, and a
little uneven. He plays a screenwriter, that constantly
underappreciated wordsmith who's the starting point for any movie.
Brooks' character, Steven Phillips, is the type of guy who has won
a lot of ``humanitarian'' awards but has found the Oscar elusive.
He's trying to get a green light for his latest project, an action
thriller that sounds beneath him. But a series of smug, younger
executives keep telling him that he's losing his ``edge.'' None of
them, however, can define just what that edge is.
</P>
<P>
   Then Steven spots a mysterious woman leaving the house of a
friend (Jeff Bridges in laid-back mode) and after some prying
discovers that she's a Muse _ a mythical creation who helps inspire
blocked writers to reach new levels. She doesn't inspire just
anybody _ the movie has some very funny cameos (which some reviews
have unconscionably spoiled) from major filmmakers seeking her
assistance. She also turns out to be more than a little demanding
and worms her way into a room at Steven's house, where she also
inspires his wife (Andie MacDowell) to do a little creative work of
her own.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Stone has a great time playing the Muse. She's
flirtatious and devious, and although she revels in a role that has
few restraints, she doesn't indulge in any overacting tendencies.
All the Muse's manipulations are done with just the right touch of
smile or pout. It's the best performance in a movie that feels just
a little underdirected, although some people might find Brooks'
understated approach to be a relief after a summer of noisier
movies.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Brooks seems inspired by Stone, as well, because
his direction is most generous to her. He lets MacDowell drift (she
doesn't seem to be able to decide whether to conceal her Southern
accent) and allows Bridges to coast on his own charm. Brooks, as
always, is not afraid to portray himself as selfish and flawed,
although he's toned his stridency down a notch from his previous
movie, ``Mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Martin with ``Bowfinger,'' however, Brooks appears to be
intent on keeping ``The Muse'' a little too insiderish. Martin
relied on good old-fashioned farce, misinterpreted by too many
critics as satire, and made a more universal movie as a result.
``The Muse,'' with its cliquish digs at the industry, seems to be
made for writers, critics and movie addicts. It's most recommended
to those sorts; others should proceed a little more cautiously.

 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MONDAY, SEPT. 6, 1999) 
 (Includes color slides and black-and-white photos of ``Profiler''
star Jamie Luner) 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jamie Luner believes in visions.
 &HT;    ``We all have gifts,'' she says. ``Some people just don't
fine-tune them. Don't you ever go, `Oh my God! I thought about you
and then you called'?'' The flame-haired Luner, an exuberant
speed-talker, is promoting ``Profiler,'' the television drama in
which she plays a psychically endowed serial crimebuster who has
``the gift of vision.''
 &HT;    ``Everybody gets what they might call `coincidences,' but I
really believe it's the power of the mind,'' she says. ``I believe
that we all have it in us. The mind is an amazing, amazing
muscle.''
 &HT;    ``I get thoughts all the time that come true,'' says Luner, a
``Melrose Place'' and ``Savannah'' veteran whose new show kicks off
its fourth year on Saturday, Sept. 25.
 &HT;    Luner plays Rachel Burke, a gifted new member of the FBI's
Violent Crimes Task Force (VCTF).
 &HT;    She joins team leader Bailey Malone (Robert Davi), the group's
forensic specialist Grace Alvarez (Roma Maffia) and computer whiz
George Fraley (Peter Frechette) in a desperate effort to rescue Sam
Waters (Ally Walker) from the clutches of Water's longtime
tormentor, a psychotic jack-of-all-trades.
 &HT;    ``He kidnaps her and they bring in someone else who has the gift
of visions. And that's me,'' Luner says by cellular telephone from
a Los Angeles photo studio where she and the ``Profiler'' cast are
gathered.
 &HT;    ``I help find her, and then Sam decides to retire and raise her
child, and I take over,'' she says.
 &HT;    Fans of ``Profiler'' know that Walker played the show's central
figure since its inception in 1996. She's exiting the series for
reasons best described as ``creative differences,'' but agreed to
return for the two pass-the-torch episodes that open the season.
 &HT;    The situation sounds as if it could have made for a tense set.
Not so, Luner insists.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't uncomfortable at all,'' she says. ``If you go in
thinking it'll be awkward, it'll be awkward. If you go in there
with no fears and no expectations, then there are no
disappointments.''
 &HT;    Luner promises that audiences won't be disappointed by Rachel
Burke.
 &HT;    ``Rachel comes from an Irish family and has six older brothers,
so she can definitely hold her own,'' she says, laughing. ``She's
smart, she's tough, she's really fun and she has a great sense of
humor.
 &HT;    ``She's also got the power of visions and she sees that as a
gift. We'll be defining her more and more as we go ... Along with
all of the wonderful profiling scenarios, they're going to get more
into the personal lives of Rachel and the other characters the
audience already knows.''
 &HT;    Any ``Melrose'' and ``Savannah'' aficionado zoning in on
``Profiler'' to check out Luner is in for a major surprise: The
actress is no longer the conniving, scenery-chewing vixen she
played on those two shows.
 &HT;    ``It's definitely a change-of-pace role for me,'' Luner says.
 &HT;    Just before signing on for ``Profiler,'' Luner shot an
independent action-thriller called ``Sacrifice,'' which co-stars
Michael Madsen, best known as the ear-slicing thug in the classic
low-budget film ``Reservoir Dogs'' (1992).
 &HT;    In fact, Luner got the call to audition for ``Profiler'' while
on location for ``Sacrifice'' in Mobile, Ala.
 &HT;    ``There's a serial killer out there, which is funny because we
have the serial killer (plots) on `Profiler.' Michael and I have to
find the person who killed his daughter,'' Luner says, helpfully
encapsulating the ``Sacrifice'' plot.
 &HT;    But back to ``Profiler.''
 &HT;    If the masses make the psychic connection, and if Luner's
presence helps spike the ratings, is the actress ready to profile
for a couple of years?
 &HT;    ``Absolutely, baby!'' she says, practically shouting. ``From
your mouth to God's ears.
 &HT;    ``I think we've got a huge hit on our hands,'' she says,
plunging into character to peer into her professional future.
``They've made some wonderful changes, and it's going to be a
really, really good year.''

   MOSCOW _ In the former Soviet Union, Big Brother may not be
watching you any longer, but he'd like a peak at your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's security service, the FSB, the main successor to the
Soviet-era KGB, is tapping into most of the country's Internet
service providers under a federal directive that allows it sweeping
powers to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But one crusading Internet company in the southern city of
Volgograd has balked, and has launched a legal challenge in what
could be the first privacy-rights fight of its kind in
post-Communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be able to use the Internet without fear that
someone is watching them,'' said Nail Murzakhanov, 33, general
director of Bayard-Slavia Communications in Volgograd, a city of 1
million on the banks of the Volga River.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are relying on their grandfather's methods,'' he said,
referring to the Soviet spy agency. ``That's not the way Russia is
supposed to work today.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, FSB agents came to the firm's offices to demand a list
of his clients and the ability to read their e-mail. The agency
also wanted the Internet provider to buy the thousands of dollars
of equipment its agents would need to carry out its electronic
snooping, and train them how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   They threatened to shut him down if he did not comply,
Murzakhanov said, and soon afterward the company abruptly lost its
lease on the Moscow-based satellite service it used.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 850 clients in the Volgograd region can e-mail
each other on the local network, but are cut off electronically
from the outside world. Murzakhanov said he and other employees of
the company received personal threats if they did not drop their
objections to the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians in Russia say the regulations, known as
SORM-2, violate the spirit of Russia's constitution by giving the
government vast and unchecked powers of surveillance, similar to
the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   In theory under the regulations, the FSB would need a warrant to
monitor e-mail exchanges. But the rules also require that a ``black
box'' be attached to every Internet system, allowing agents to sit
at computer screens in the FSB offices and tap via a high-speed
fiber-optic line into the e-mail exchanges anytime they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the
course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says
Internet providers must render assistance. But access to the
(Internet) system should be carried out by a court order and under
the rule of law. Not this way,'' said Ina Zemskova of St.
Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman declined to discuss the new regulations or the
Volgograd case with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the routine business of hunting spies and criminals, the
United States and most advanced countries maintain
intelligence-gathering networks capable of intercepting telephone
calls and data transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   A recent flap erupted in the European Union over the reach of
the U.S. National Security Agency, the super-secret spy
organization that specializes in eavesdropping. With the help of
the British government, the NSA reportedly has established a system
to monitor every e-mail, fax and telephone call made in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The task for countries large and small has become more difficult
and expensive in the Internet age, requiring security services to
gain greater technical expertise and expensive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In cash-strapped Russia, the FSB wants it done for them. The
SORM-2 regulations _ SORM is the acronym, when translated from
Russian, means System for Operational-Investigative Activities _
require telecommunications companies to shell out thousands of
dollars to equip the FSB, or risk losing their licenses to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 companies provide Internet services to an
estimated 1 million computer users in Russia, mainly in the larger
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies had their arms twisted and were compelled to
get the equipment,'' said Andrei Shipilov, editor-in-chief of
Komputerra, an on-line and published Russian-language computer
magazine based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, where corruption is rampant, Shipilov suggests
that many companies may simply be able to bribe their way around
the rule to avoid giving the FSB access to their systems.
</P>
<P>
   More than just individual rights of privacy are at stake, say
computer and legal experts. In Russia, the FSB's system also could
be used for corporate espionage. After the Soviet Union fell in
1991, many of the KGB's top agents left to enter the lucrative
field of corporate security and many still have ties to the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``If providers grant the FSB this kind of access, the
information could be sold to the highest bidder,'' said Viktoria
Yevgorova, a journalist who writes for Russia's Libertarian
movement.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain just how far and wide the new rule has been
applied.
</P>
<P>
   The SORM-2 rules were written in 1998 by the FSB and the State
Communications Agency and enacted this year. The new rules updated
a 1995 version that applied only to telephone, fax and pager
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have been slow to be applied because of the highly
technical nature of the Internet and the inconsistent way
regulations are enacted in Russia, varying from region to region.
Because they are administrative regulations and not law, they
required no presidential or legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Milechko, an official with GlasNet, one of Russia's
largest Internet providers, said his company has not yet been
approached by the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, MTK-Mobile, said it and other firms have slowed
the process by seeking negotiations with the FSB. ``In practice, we
know we have to do something but we need to know the legal basis
and the technical specifications,'' said Alexei Volchkov, the
company's technical director.
</P>
<P>
   In its first legal step, Bayard-Slavia Communications asked the
local prosecutor to take up the case as a constitutional matter and
file an appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn the law on the
public's behalf. The prosecutor refused in an Aug. 18 reply,
stating that the FSB had the legal authority to pursue its
monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the company plans to appeal to the nation's chief
prosecutor. If that fails, it will file a lawsuit directly with the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to fix this problem in silence. We want to
overcome this problem publicly so all will know that there is
nothing to fear,'' said Murzakhanov, head of the Volgograd Internet
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given the sophisticated nature of Internet
technology, the FSB is probably reading the e-mail only of those
with nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, the FSB is only going to have access to ordinary
users. Anyone engaged in espionage or criminal activity will easily
get around it using encryption software that the FSB doesn't have
the means to decipher,'' said Shipilov, the computer magazine
editor.

VIKING EPIC SACRIFICES PLOT AND CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT TO COOL
BATTLE SCENES

   John McTiernan's bloody, violent Vikings vs. cannibals epic
``The 13th Warrior'' is exactly the kind of swordplay vehicle I
would have eaten up as a 13-year-old boy. And, as I haven't matured
all that much since then, I found this grisly adventure almost as
much fun as John Boorman's 1981 ``Excalibur.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that this somewhat historical yarn will have much appeal to
anyone beyond avid players of Dungeons &AMP; Dragons, past and present,
but it's almost delightfully junky enough to find a wider audience,
especially with Antonio Banderas in the lead as a reluctant
warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Michael Crichton's ``Eaters of the Dead'' (a much
cooler title), ``The 13th Warrior'' refers to Banderas' character,
Ibn Fahdlan, an Arab emissary banished from his homeland and
recruited by a band of Norsemen to help combat a mysterious enemy
known for devouring its foes.
</P>
<P>
   In a remote Northern homeland ruled by an elderly king, Ibn and
his colorfully crude companions first encounter their enemy, which
attacks at night under a shroud of fog. They're believed to be
demonic, bearlike creatures with razor-sharp claws that attack
swiftly and savagely, leaving behind none of their dead. But every
enemy has a weakness, and Ibn's level-headed approach helps his
bloodthirsty brethren discover their foes' darkest secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Banderas, who has proven himself an impressive action hero with
``The Mask of Zorro'' and his convincing turn here, is pretty much
it for star power, unless you count Omar Sharif's brief cameo early
in the film. The warriors are mostly unfamiliar faces, which
actually suits them, considering that you have a hard time telling
them apart, anyway. The standouts are Vladimir Kulich as the
group's valorous leader and Dennis Storhoi as Ibn's boisterous
ally. The rest are so much cannibal chow, but you're not supposed
to miss a few heroes as the 13 get gradually shaved down by the bad
guys.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this is a John ``Die Hard'' McTiernan film, so count
on plenty of well-choreographed battle scenes at the expense of a
story or character development. And just be grateful that it's
Banderas swinging that sword on screen, and not Bruce Willis.

DUDLEY DONE WRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ARNOLD WAYNE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Ward was a genuinely brilliant satirist whose creative
medium just happened to be animation. With ``The Bullwinkle Show''
and ``George of the Jungle,'' he brought a '60s counterculture
ethic to a mainstream TV audience. His genius was both the
rat-a-tat delivery of the crafty one-liners dashed off by his
characters and, most importantly, his ability to be topical without
being time-sensitive; until the fall of the Soviet Union, the Cold
War pranks of Boris and Natasha had as much significance to those
born after the Bay of Pigs as it did to their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it is knowing Ward's sensibilities that makes it
especially difficult to endure ``Dudley Do-Right,'' a limping,
downright embarrassing attempt to give real-life actors the
opportunity to tribute Ward's creativity.
</P>
<P>
   If Ward were alive, I doubt he'd feel honored.
</P>
<P>
   Do-Right (Brendan Fraser) is the bumbling, brain-dead Canadian
Mountie who constantly thwarts the moustach-twirling villainy of
the evil Snidely Whiplash (Alfred Molina), usually in spite of
himself. Dudley and Snidely also compete with each other while
vying for the affections of the fresh-scrubbed damsel Nell Fenwick
(Sarah Jessica Parker).
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon was broken down into perfect four-minute doses, but
the film can't seem to find a way to sustain itself, even in spite
of its staggeringly brief running time. Rather than keeping the
action moving through an elaborate series of outrageous set pieces,
the script quickly settles into a dumb plot about bilking tourists
and salting streams with gold nuggets, with barely a ridiculous
cliffhanger and cringe-worthy pun in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The utter failure of ``Dudley Do-Right'' almost defies
expectation. Writer/director Hugh Wilson's most recent attempt to
flesh out Ward's characters _ 1997's live-action ``George of the
Jungle,'' also starring Fraser _ grossed $100 million and was
thoroughly likable. But this time Fraser's performance is almost
painfully flat, with none of the grinning lack of self-awareness
that made Dudley the ideal cardboard hero. Parker's Nell is pure
window dressing, a vacuous and nondescript leading-lady part.
Wilson's script and direction are both choppy and distracting, with
already-trite references to Pokemon and Riverdance.
</P>
<P>
   Worse yet, the film is preceded by one of Jay Ward's classic
``Fractured Fairy Tales,'' which merely goes to serve as a sad
reminder of just how off the mark ``Dudley Do-Right'' is.
</P>

 &HT;    RILEY TAKES BACK-TO-SCHOOL BUS TOUR OF THE SOUTH
 &HT;    550&AMP;adds. Final optional add can be used for textbox or graphic.
For release Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Education Secretary Richard Riley heads back to his
native South Monday to conduct a rolling teach-in on a five-state
``back to school'' bus tour.
</P>
<P>
   The tour is intended to dramatize two of Riley's strongest and
longest-held beliefs: That more adults should pitch in to improve
children's education, and that education is the engine that powers
economic growth in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be traveling through Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, South
Carolina and North Carolina,'' said the former South Carolina
governor. ``If you pass me on the highway, be sure to wave.''
</P>
<P>
   He should be easy to spot as he follows a winding route of
Interstate highways from Chattanooga to Charlotte. Riley will be
riding in an air-conditioned, 35-seat, 40-foot-long ``executive
coach'' that has been wrapped in a vinyl banner painted to look a
yellow school bus. ``Success Express'' is printed on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Governors who have made education a prime priority will climb
aboard to join Riley and luminaries such as National PTA president
Ginny Markell for part of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Gov. Don Sundquist of Tennessee will join them in
Chattanooga, and Gov. Dan Siegelman of Alabama in Gadsden and
Birmingham. On Wednesday, Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia will hop on
the bus in Atlanta, and Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina in
Greenville. On Thursday, Riley will be joined by Gov. Jim Hunt of
North Carolina in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Riley will join local bigwigs at back-to-school rallies for
thousands in large cities, tour schools in smaller communities,
dine with business leaders and legislators, and squeeze in a
meeting with chief state school officers from eight Southern
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back to school time is not just for kids any more,'' Riley
said. ``If our schools are going to do the job we expect them to
do, everyone must pitch in and help.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been honing variations on that theme for use with
different groups he will encounter on his tour:
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers: ``Be family friendly. Give your employees the time
to meet with teachers or volunteer for school activities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Parents: ``Start early and read to your youngest children.
Share books with your older children.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Educators, community leaders and law enforcement officials:
``Talk about ways to help troubled youth and find ways to connect
each young person to at least one caring adult.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Teachers and school officials: ``Reach out to families and
remove the obstacles that sometimes make them reluctant to get
involved in school activities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Older students: ``Challenge yourselves. Take the tough courses
in middle and high school that will put you on the road to college
and careers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Younger students: ``Elementary school students should focus on
reading, reading, and reading _ and math too.''
</P>
<P>
   And for those who think lower taxes might be better than higher
education spending, he has another blunt reminder: Education pays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education has been at the very heart of the economic progress
that the South has made in the last 20 years,'' Riley said. ``I'm
taking this trip to get a first hand look at the progress that has
been made, and what can be done to get ready for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional adds follow)
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't get much argument with that in this part of the
country,'' said Mark Musick, president of the Atlanta-based
Southern Regional Education Board.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, half of the nation's new jobs were created in the
16-state territory covered by the regional board's interstate
compact. Four decades ago, only three of the 16 states had per
capita incomes equal to 90 percent of the national average; that's
true of half of them today.
</P>
<P>
   Musick said the South's economic growth is a payoff for years of
work by a long line of Southern ``education governors,'' including
Riley and Hunt in the Carolinas, Bill Clinton in Arkansas, Lawton
Chiles in Florida and Lamar Alexander in Tennessee. ``They
absolutely bled and believed that education and economic growth are
interwoven,'' Musick said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of today's Southern governors are keeping the faith. All
five states that Riley will visit increased spending per student on
elementary and secondary schools in the 1990s, even though the
number of students exploded dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Musick said that helps explain why the number of high school
graduates and workers with college degrees is rising in the South,
while the number of high school dropouts is falling.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up the region's attitudes, Musick said, ``Stressing the
link between education and economic growth is a good tool for
improving education, (because) it's concrete, it's tangible and
it's saleable. It has the added advantage of being true.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Between 1990 and 1998, state appropriations per pupil rose from
$3,664 to $5,272 in Tennessee, from $3,327 to $4,737 in Alabama,
from $4,275 to $6,037 in Georgia, from $4,082 to $5,347 in South
Carolina, and from $4,290 to $5,247 in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, state spending on education rose between 1998 and
1999 by 4 percent in Tennessee, 7 percent in Alabama, 2 percent in
Georgia, 8 percent in South Carolina and 12 percent in North
Carolina, according to a study by Illinois State University.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the trend continued. Legislatures raised basic
education spending by about 3.2 percent in Tennessee, 5.4 percent
in Alabama and 6.6 percent in Georgia. South Carolina added $256
million for public schools and $118.5 million for higher education,
and North Carolina's state budget, up 11 percent over all, included
$240 million for teacher pay increases and $180 million for other
education initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was quality neglected. This year:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tennessee has ordered a report on the reading proficiency of
elementary school students.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alabama is offering voters a chance this fall to vote for a
constitutional amendment that would let the state finance
Georgia-style merit-based scholarships through a lottery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Georgia's new reform study commission is to deliver a
preliminary report in December and final recommendations in April
on the state's education needs.
</P>
<P>
   _ South Carolina agreed to borrow more than $1 billion for
school and college construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   _ North Carolina's state board of education approved testing of
students in third, fifth and eighth grades, and will start in 2003
to require high school seniors to pass an exit exam to graduate.

LAWRIE'S LIFE STILL AN OPEN BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ Paul Lawrie had time to fill. He had just moved
from the practice tee at the Firestone Country Club for his
scheduled interview, but the media was not finished questioning PGA
Tour commissioner Tim Finchem.
</P>
<P>
   So Lawrie waited in a small room inside the entrance. The door
opened and closed. People came and went. Those who should know and
those who might not know walked right by Lawrie, barely giving him
a glance.
</P>
<P>
   Some 41 of the world's best golfers are here for the NEC World
Golf Championships _ most of the members of the United States and
European Ryder Cup teams as well as the world team of the
Presidents Cup event _ and it might be the safest of wagers that 35
of the 41 are known quicker by sight to Americans than Lawrie. Who,
after all, happens to be the reigning British Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   So Lawrie waited. The Scotsman thumbed through a pile of media
books and media releases listing the contestants and describing
their triumphs and glories. Lawrie eventually got to the page _ his
page _ that said he is, indeed, the 1999 British Open champion.
</P>
<P>
   More people came and went. Only one or two noticed Lawrie
standing in their midst. Now, if Jean Van der Velde were standing
there . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean should have won (the Open), but he didn't win,'' Lawrie
replied after finally being able to go inside the interview room
and being asked the inevitable question of whether he won the Open
or Van der Velde lost it. ``Obviously, Jean is going to get a lot
of attention because of what he did on 18, and 17, and still didn't
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie is truly golf's Unknown Soldier, even now. Seven or eight
years ago, Lawrie would go to the home of his sponsor in Aberdeen,
Scotland, dream of golfing glories, enjoy a party or get-together
and when he left his sponsor's home he would say to his wife, ``I'd
love to own this house someday.'' But Lawrie would only trudge
through golf's hills and valleys for year after year, fighting this
golf battle and that, glory eluding him, obscurity grasping him by
the shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   But six weeks ago, Lawrie was touched by the golfing gods.
Ordinarily, coming from 10 strokes behind on the morning of the
Open's final round and then winning the Open would be gallantry
enough, perhaps golf gallantry for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Far from it, though. It is Van der Velde, not Lawrie, who is
known the golf world over, and it is Van der Velde who is a
sympathetic figure far beyond the 19th holes of the world. Lawrie,
it seems, was merely a role player in the Van der Velde drama that
so captured sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt as though I had won, and it wasn't handed to me'' said
Lawrie in that Scottish burr so foreign here in the heartland of
America.'' I went out and got it. But everyone's opinion is
obviously going to be that he threw it away, which he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie and Van der Velde have met three or four times since that
climactic Sunday that thrust not one, but two, unknowns into a
spotight that might take years to dim. And when the two have talked
those three or four times, the one subject that has not come up is
one most clearly on the minds of all _ the 18th hole at Carnoustie
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not reminisced with Jean about the Open, no,'' said
Lawrie. ``We haven't talked about the Open at all since it
happened. Obviously, you don't want to go and start talking about
the Open (with Van der Velde). But there's no problem between Jean
and me. I've got a lot of respect for his golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Only Shakespeare could have plausibly invented two men such as
Lawrie and Van der Velde, whose roles are so full of life's
emotions. But Lawrie and Van der Velde are real, not characters,
and that drama they played out one midsummer's afternoon in
Scotland will live on and on.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that when word reached Akron Wednesday that the
Frenchman had fired his caddy, Christophe Anglolini, who had been
roasted by golf critics _ but not Van der Velde _ for not
intervening in Van der Velde's decision-making on that fateful 18th
hole that resulted in a triple-bogey 7, it was talked about by
many.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Lawrie's tale, that was still ignored. From the
extreme of how Lawrie once had won another tournament, a minor
event at Carnoustie (``It was called the Daily Express Pro-Am,'' he
said) to the other extreme of how Lawrie twice reached for a 4-iron
on the third and fourth playoff holes of the Open and hit the two
shots of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have come up to me since and said, `It's th
best shot I've ever seen' (of the 4-iron on the third playoff
hole)' and that kind of stuff. But you're not thinking of that when
it's going on. The 4-iron at 18 was nice and the one at 17 was
equally as good.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be only in his home city of Aberdeen that what Lawrie did
on the final round, coming from 10 strokes in arrears, and what he
did in the three-way playoff is appreciated. His phone at home rang
non-stop for a week and when he walks the streets of Aberdeen the
adulation still pours upon him. Aberdeen ``is not a huge place and
everybody knows me anyway,'' he said. ``So when you go into a
restaurant, people still say, `Well done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fame may not have come from the Open, but money did. Lawrie has
moved up from a Subaru to a Porsche 911 (``Second-hand, I can't be
wasting money, you know'') and he has bought the large house of his
sponsor, the one he had dreamed of owning for the last eight years.
``It came up for sale right after I won,'' he said, ``and I said to
my wife, `I've always wanted this house, so let's have it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, he said, ``is from the country and doesn't really
spend much. But she'll be getting better at that this next little
while. She's learning quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrie, of course, will be in Brookline next month with the
European Ryder Cup team and when an innocent American asked if that
will be the most pressure he's felt in his golfing career, the Scot
quickly disabused the notion. ``The most nervous I've ever been and
ever will be was when the playoff for the Open started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The playoff, which all must be reminded, that Paul Lawrie won.

PETE CARROLL IS AT EASE ON CENTER STAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ The coach went to the piano Wednesday and
began to play a song. His hands moved across the keys easily. He
would often pause to listen to questions about him and his team.
He'd answer. Then he would play again. If music is a way to reveal
what truly stirs in the soul, Pete Carroll is more than confident
right now. He is fearless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this kind of stuff,'' Carroll said as he played what
sounded like 1920s ragtime. ``I took piano lessons for two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Another pause. A smile. More classic melody. It wouldn't have
shocked me if the Patriots coach had abruptly stopped with the
Joplin and begun singing a little Marilyn Manson.
</P>
<P>
   I think Carroll knows he has been miscast in his two seasons
here. He is often seen as Gomer Pyle with a headset, a nice
aw-shucks coach who can't take control of his team. The label is
far too simple for a complex and surprising man. But that was even
more reason for Carroll to smile Wednesday, the last day of
training camp. His job security has already been a camp topic, so
you would expect his personal soundtrack to be a methodical dirge.
But he seems to be comfortable; I think he knows his team has been
underestimated, too. The NFL is a league of quarterbacks and
Carroll has Drew Bledsoe on his team. That would help me relax if I
were a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sound of Music _ Smithfield Version'' is not the only
difference you can see in Carroll this summer. On Monday, he said
nose tackle Garrett Johnson looked like ``a guy getting thrown out
of a bar'' on one play against the Cowboys. On Tuesday, he spoke of
sports talk radio star Butch From The Cape. He never spoke this way
during his first two camps and regular seasons. Why not?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started here, I simply wanted to prove myself,'' he
said. ``I wanted to come in and win. I'm a football coach. So
concentrating on what I said to the media and how I said it was not
a priority for me. I am not an entertainer. I know there were times
when I didn't give you guys anything extra.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and laughed a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``But maybe you didn't ask the right questions.''
</P>
<P>
   If he is mentioning talk radio, that must mean he is a listener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you have to be aware of what is said and written about
your team,'' he said, ``but it would be a terrible, terrible
mistake for me to get caught up in what's said and written. There
are coaches who have done that and it has affected them. They go
way up and down, depending on what's said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say I spend 10 minutes being upset about something
you've written. That's a distraction from winning. That's all it
is. I want to win. I don't want to focus on anything that will
distract me or my team.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, the music was filling the auditorium. The coach
seemed to be playing bigger and freer than he did when he first
began to tap the keys. It sounded like the work of an experienced
musician, definitely someone who had been playing longer than two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I took lessons for two years,'' he said, ``but I've
been playing for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons Carroll is misunderstood, beginning with
the way he looks. He would come out ahead in a $5, guess-your-age
wager. He appears to be closer to 40 than 50, but he'll turn 48
Sept. 15, three days after the Patriots play the Jets. He is a
former college assistant coach, which is not surprising. But he is
also a former building supplies salesman. That was his first job
out of college. He enjoys competition so much that having a
conversation with him often turns into a game. He volunteers some
information, but he wants to see how much you can get out of him.
You would never guess this from looking at him. I would never play
poker with the man.
</P>
<P>
   Since Carroll grew up in San Francisco and attended college at
the University of the Pacific _ he smashed people from his safety
position because ``I didn't have the wheels to be a cornerback'' _
I guessed that his favorite player would have to be an old 49ers
hitter. His favorite baseball player is Willie Mays. His favorite
basketball player is John Havlicek. Favorite football player?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never guess this one,'' he said. ``Gale Sayers. I loved
Gale Sayers growing up. Every chance I got, I wore his number (40).
No one ran like Sayers. I remember telling myself that I had to
meet him, or at least see him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carroll was a college student, he saw Sayers after a Bears
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple things stand out about the guy. He was slight. And I
remember that he didn't wear thigh pads,'' Carroll said. ``Our next
game was against San Diego State and I decided that I wasn't going
to wear thigh pads, either. Man. You should have seen me.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to his right thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a bruise from here to there.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Carroll didn't realize it, but he tipped off some of his
thoughts during Wednesday's press conference. He said he hasn't
decided if Kevin Faulk can carry the entire running back load
through 16 games ``and the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)And the playoffs.(unitals) The coach can only hide so
much. He is psyched for the season. I think he plans to be in the
area for a while. It took Patriots fans a few seasons to truly
appreciate Bledsoe. It might be the same for Carroll, The Piano
Man, this season. For now, there is no fear with him. You can see
that. You can hear it, too.

NO PROFIT IN PROS FOR THE PGA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was coincidental yet poignant counterprogramming.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of one of its two marquee events, last month's PGA
Championship at Medinah, Ill., the PGA of America showed off its
goodwill. The agenda had been established long before commerce
overtook patriotism as the consuming concern surrounding the
organization's other crown jewel, the Ryder Cup. But the day after
the now notorious meeting with PGA Tour representatives at which
the Treaty of Medinah supposedly was forged, it was as if the PGA
of America were saying to the extravagantly compensated
barnstorming pros, ``This is where the money goes.''
</P>
<P>
   It set the stage by honoring Bill Dickey with its Distinguished
Service Award for his work with various golf organizations, in
particular minority and collegiate projects.
</P>
<P>
   Then during his annual State of the PGA news conference,
embattled CEO Jim Awtrey announced that his group would support the
campaign to recognize as a historical designated landmark Clearview
Golf Club in East Canton, Ohio. It is believed to be the first
course created and run by an African American _ Bill Powell, who
undertook the effort when he encountered segregation in golfing
circles upon returning home from serving in Europe during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   After Powell and his family took their bows, the spotlight
turned to Chip Beck, whose record-tying round of 59 in 1991 served
as a springboard for an annual college grant in conjunction with
the Chick Evans Scholarship Fund. Beck presented it to David
Pawlowski, a student-athlete and community activist who will attend
the University of Illinois as an engineering major.
</P>
<P>
   But the humanitarian respite was momentary. US Ryder Cup captain
Ben Crenshaw brought the financial beast raging back to life later
in the afternoon at his press conference. He criticized certain
Ryder candidates _ whom he later identified as Mark O'Meara, Tiger
Woods, David Duval, and Phil Mickelson _ for perpetuating the
distraction created by some touring pros' insistence that they
should have a say in how the PGA of America distributes its take
from the event to various charities.
</P>
<P>
   And once again buried beneath the dogfight over dollars was the
bottom line:
</P>
<P>
   Zero.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the PGA of America keeps for itself from its Ryder
net share, which is projected to be more than $20 million from the
$63 million gross generated by the US-Europe matches at The Country
Club in Brookline Sept. 24-26. Its headquarters in Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., are not a repository for the funds but rather a
conduit for them. The money is funneled right back into the game in
the form of youth and minority programs, scholarships, and advanced
education for the 24,000 members and apprentices who form its
constituency. While the contentious touring pros have worthy pet
charities _ schools and hospitals and inner-city programs and the
like _ it's not as if the Ryder money currently is going into
secret Swiss bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to ignore that fact, because for a nonprofit
organization, the PGA of America recently has undergone more
scrutiny of its books _ and motives _ than a Fortune 500 giant
under congressional investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Awtrey futilely tried to set the record and the math straight
when he said, ``Virtually everything we do goes back in the game.
You take our entire budget this year _ only $100,000 is budgeted to
go to the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   And the rest of the PGA of America's estimated $160 million in
operating costs, Awtrey emphasized, isn't used for golden
parachutes or crystal chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our PGA members cannot receive a direct contribution of a
dollar to themselves,'' he said. ``It can't go into a retirement
account. It can't go directly into a deferred compensation account.
So whatever we do has to create programs that allow our members to
take advantage of them to better themselves. And in so doing, we
intend to put money back in in support of growing the game of
golf.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that has been growing lately is hostility. But
despite the popular misconception that the PGA of America is some
aloof monolith, its historical mission has been philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   That was the imperative when the organization was formed in 1916
during a luncheon hosted by department store tycoon Rodman
Wanamaker in New York City. Its twofold objective was to promote
both the game and the status of its professionals. At the time,
that umbrella was all-encompassing, covering both club and touring
pros. But 30 years ago, a splinter group of touring pros contended
their needs weren't being satisfied _ in other words, they felt the
PGA wasn't cashing in sufficiently on golf's television
possibilities _ and seceded to form a Tournament Players Division,
which in 1975 became the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent appearances, Awtrey and PGA Tour commissioner Tim
Finchem insist there is no animosity between the groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PGA Tour and the PGA members have always been part of the
same family,'' said Awtrey. ``(The touring pros talk) about their
coaches, their teachers, their mentors, in many cases their fathers
or family members who were PGA members. When you look at the
players, the PGA members, there's not an issue with those people.
Does that mean corporately we always agree on everythinjg? No. All
you have to do is look at our history. But that's pretty much
normal in business relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   What isn't normal is that such an infinitesimal fraction can
raise such a stink. The overwhelming majority of PGA Tour pros also
belong to the PGA of America. But the Ryder ruckus makes it seem as
if there's a roiling feud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is absolutely no tension between the PGA Tour and PGA of
America,'' said Finchem.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not. But lost in the rhetoric is that, the 150 or so
touring headliners aside, the PGA of America members have one role:
to serve the public. As one official put it, they ``enhance others'
enjoyment of the game through teaching, running pro shops, and
serving tournament operations.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, they're the stagehands, anonymously providing
the means for the actors _ the touring pros _ to take the curtain
calls. And the fact is, without the PGA of America, there would be
no curtain.

   1. MYSTERIOUS BATS Much remains mysterious about the behaviour
of bats. Their nesting habits and migratory patterns are only
sketchily understood, due to their nocturnal and quiet lifestyle.
But researchers are learning much more as they use ingenious new
equipment to track the animals. Armed with new information, they
are trying to convince government officials, architects and
carpenters to design ``bat-friendly'' buildings and structures in a
bid to save this endangered and often misunderstood species. By
Martin Meister. From GEO magazine. 2,500 words. (English

<P>
   ON THE INTERNET The Internet, that symbol of unfettered freedom
of speech, has annoyed several of the world's totalitarian regimes.
There is only restricted access to the Net in 45 countries. The
French association, Reporters Sans Frontihres, recently publicly
denounced the worst offenders, which it describes as ``the 20
enemies of the Internet.'' By Jean-Jacques Bozonnet. From Le Monde.
500 words. (English translation available.)

WHY NOT NOW? After 35 years of liberal activism as a Democrat,
Warren Beatty writes that he is being urged by some people to spend
40 years of fame on a presidential campaign. ``I choose to weather
the cynicism toward ``bleeding heart celebrities'' and try to help
persuade the slightly more liberal one of the two accounting firms
we call our major parties to return to the principles of the
Democratic Party of my youth.'' (Warren Beatty is a movie writer,
director, producer, actor and longtime Democrat.) New York Times
Op-Ed. 800 words.

IMPROVE TIES WITH CHINA, BUT NOT AT TAIWAN'S EXPENSE Contradictory
and alarming signals are coming from China, and they are meeting
with sharp but mixed responses which only add to the muddle.
Evidently, this is a moment of tension in the Beijing leadership
and possibly of important decision. It is necessary to try to see
the picture from Beijing's point of view, but recognizing the
problems does not make it any less important for American and
western views of the relationship to be sorted out as clearly as
possible. By Flora Lewis. 800 words.

ON-LINE NEWS LURES OLD HANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To many, the term ``on-line journalist'' conjures images of
22-year-olds with multiple tattoos or Matt Drudge, a Walter
Winchell-wannabee who sees no difference between fact and rumor.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, on-line news is luring increasing numbers of
established journalists, many of whom _ like former CNN
``Moneyline'' anchor Lou Dobbs _ want to cash in on the cyberspace
gold rush. And the recent migration of several of journalism's most
venerable veterans into the land of ``dot com'' suggests that old
hands may be very valuable in providing new media with the stamp of
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel proud of being a part of a pioneering effort,'' says
former CNN star Peter Arnett, who, in his mid-60s is now chief
foreign correspondent for foreignTV.com (http://www.foreigntv.com).
``I have a sense of the early CNN days. (But) when cable came out,
we were ridiculed. No one is ridiculing the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, when Arnett departed CNN under what he calls
``cloudy circumstances,'' it was widely seen as delayed punishment
for his role as narrator of the network's ill-fated 1998 Tailwind
story. (Ironically, he is now writing the authorized history of
CNN.) ``I felt that my television news days were numbered,'' Arnett
says. ``After CNN, how could I possibly cover a war for Fox?''
</P>
<P>
   So, he accepted an offer from the fledgling foreignTV.com, an
Internet broadcaster of overseas news, and in his new role, has
conducted interviews with former Pakistani leader Benazir Bhutto
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Arnett is bullish on Internet
news, but not unmindful of the adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it's an effort to get people to interview,'' he
says. ``They say `Peter Arnett, yes. But you're not with CNN.' It's
a matter of recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Schanberg, 65, gained fame as the author of the book that
inspired the movie ``The Killing Fields,'' and won a Pulitzer for
international reporting during a 40-year career. Since leaving
Newsday four years ago, he's been freelancing and trying to
convince news outlets to hire him as a press critic.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Schanberg toured the headquarters of APBNews.com
(http://www.apbnews.com), a new on-line enterprise that bills
itself ``as the first national news organization exclusively
covering the criminal justice world.'' It was love at first sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really taken by the energy of the place,'' Schanberg
says. ``What I saw was a lot of young journalists with a lot of
energy working on something new.'' He now leads the APBNews
investigative team, despite knowing nothing about the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to learn from everybody about the technology,'' he
says. ``This thing is sprouting limbs in all directions. It tickles
me that I'm going into (this). I'm a newspaper man.''
</P>
<P>
   What's next? Will Bob Woodward leave The Washington Post to
create deepthroat.com? Not likely, says Jon Katz, a former CBS,
Boston Globe, and Washington Post staffer who became one of the
first mainstream journalists to go on line in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber journalism ``is not yet a career choice,'' for big-name
journalists because ``the on-line community is so fragmented,''
Katz says. And many veterans who move to the Internet, he adds,
``are being forced or they're in transition'' _ a fair description
of the Arnett and Schanberg career paths.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, you can't teach an old newshound new tricks.
Three years ago, former New Republic editor and major pundit
Michael Kinsley dramatically shifted gears to edit Slate
(http://www.slate.com), the Microsoft-funded on-line magazine of
news, politics, and culture. Critics say that the Beltway-oriented
Slate doesn't understand the alternative culture of cyberspace. And
Kinsley seemed to be looking for the exits last year when he toyed
with trying to succeed Tina Brown as editor of The New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I didn't leap at The New Yorker shows I must be
pretty contented here,'' he insists. But he admits that ``here's
all sorts of stuff we haven't figured out. Every day, I go to the
site and say `this is a mess.' ''
</P>
<P>
   We'll check back with Arnett and Schanberg in a few months.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do women really want? Well, an awful lot of them want to be
able to walk out their back doors into a beautiful garden and cut a
bouquet of fresh flowers. Sounds like a modest ambition, but it's
trickier than one would think.
</P>
<P>
   Many flowers wilt without conditioning (see sidebar), and it's a
challenge to cut flowers out of a landscaped display garden without
diminishing it. That's why traditional estates like Hammersmith
Farm in Newport, R.I., and Blithewold in Bristol, R.I., grow their
cutting flowers in rows like crops. So I was intrigued when Pauline
Runkle, who has professionally arranged flowers for the Boston
Pops, the Museum of Fine Arts, and the Dalai Lama, said she gets
much of the material for her company, Floral Artistry, which
specializes in corporate and private events, out of her home garden
in Manchester-by-the-Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Like other professional arrangers, Runkle buys most of her cut
flowers. But she also grows flowers and foliage that are difficult
to purchase commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Her acre of planted flower beds, winding around another 3 acres
of woods and lawn, is a masterful example of smart planting. It
yields mountains of unusual material for arrangements over a long
season, while still managing to look lush.
</P>
<P>
   Runkle shared many tips on how to cut your garden and have it,
too, during an interview this summer. Her garden is almost entirely
composed of bulbs, shrubs, perennials, and self-seeding biennials
that can be planted now to provide cutting material next year.
(Early fall planting is Secret Number One to a floriferous spring
and summer garden.)
</P>
<P>
   Though Runkle indulges in a few high-maintenance delphiniums
near her front door for the sheer glory of them, she tends to take
a hard-nosed approach to getting the most cutting material for the
least amount of effort. What she tries to grow are flowers,
berries, and decorative foliage that are self-seeding, undemanding,
and fragrant, that hold up for at least three days in arrangements,
and that are expensive or impossible to buy from floral
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a winning strategy as increasingly picky consumers thirst
for the unusual in their bouquets, and it's one that can help make
your own home-grown arrangements unique. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Starting with the soil &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It all starts with good soil, of course. When Runkle and her
husband, Joe, an inventor, bought their house, the site was ledgy
with little topsoil. Runkle's first act was to purchase eight
trailer loads of loam.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the soil must have been dredged from wetlands,
because it came loaded with seeds of invasive purple loosestrife.
Fifteen years later, she is still weeding it out.
</P>
<P>
   Many ledges continue to protrude, but Pauline Runkle works with
them. Or, rather, she plays with them. Some ledges act as pedestals
for an unusually effective collection of metal garden sculpture,
all natural subjects by Roger DiTarando of Vernon, Conn. An
impressionistic metal goat stands triumphantly atop a rocky
outcropping near the front door, surrounded by sedums and other
alpine and deserty plants that prefer good drainage to rich soil.
</P>
<P>
   April begins the cutting year in Runkle's garden, with pansies
and unusual miniature daffodils, both of which she will place in
small vials of water that give the stems extra length when tucked
into arrangements. She also continues to cut from her large
collection of winter-blooming hellebores.
</P>
<P>
   April also yields no-maintenance lily-of-the-valley,
self-seeding biennial forget-me-nots, and the neglected
old-fashioned shrub spirea prunifolia, the true bridalwreath
spirea, which blooms several weeks before the more common
vanhouttei spirea with which it is often confused.
</P>
<P>
   May brings tulips. As she does most spring bulbs, Runkle orders
them from John Scheepers Inc. (860-567-0838) and Van Engelen
(860-567-8734). ``They stand behind their product.'' She always
plants several hundred White Triumphator lily-flowered tulips in
the fall. She also likes the new grape hyacinth Valerie Finnis,
with its scent and unusual shade of light blue. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Shrubs and trees &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shrubs and trees yield a wealth of spring flowers and summer
berries. Runkle especially likes cranberry viburnums, lilacs, and
Korean dogwoods, but has given up on the much-loved American
dogwood, which has suffered from an onslaught of diseases. She
grows variegated weigela and purple-leafed Rosa rubifolia, not so
much for their so-so flowers as for their intriguing foliage, which
is pretty all season.
</P>
<P>
   June is rose month. Runkle's favorite of the many luscious David
Austin roses (modern reblooming hybrids of antique varieties) are
Eden and Heritage. Her yellow rose of choice is Austin's The
Pilgrim. Though some New Englanders have been disappointed with the
performance of these barely-hardy roses, Runkle swears they thrive
in her Zone 6 garden. ``The secret is that they don't do much for
the first three years. They're slow starters.'' The masses of
peach-size baby pink Eden roses dangling from her patio arbor
certainly look happy enough. ``I feed them compost and
Miracle-Gro.''
</P>
<P>
   She also grows cherry-apricot Baby Talk, a floribunda. Her top
performer is Bonica, which has replaced Betty Prior as the rose
that refuses to take the summer off. Runkle also grows the new
disease-resistant Meidiland roses from France.
</P>
<P>
   Fragrant mock orange, which she says takes several years to
develop a fragrance, is another June shrub for cutting.
</P>
<P>
   June is also the big month for self-seeding biennials, including
white Excelsior and yellow grandiflora foxgloves and the yellow and
white mullein, Verbascum chaixii. Americans have been slow to
embrace biennials, which sound inconvenient because they take two
years to flower, then die. But because many reseed in perpetuity
once you introduce them to your yard, clever gardeners like Runkle
are discovering that they are one of the shortcuts to maintaining a
large flower garden without a lot of planting.
</P>
<P>
   Old-fashioned hollyhocks are her dominant biennial this month
and a signature flower in her professional arrangements, as they
don't ship well enough to be marketed as cut flowers. They must be
arranged in a vase of water, not the green florist foam called
Oasis. They also require a sulfur spray every two weeks to banish
disfiguring rust disease. (Though the maroon-black hollyhock Nigra
is the rage now, Runkle says it's not effective in arrangements.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hooray for hostas &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Runkle also begins cutting hosta foliage in June and continues
through the season.
</P>
<P>
   July and August bring fragrant buddleia, ``the best thing in the
world for a little bouquet by somebody's bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Runkle collects hydrangeas of various kinds, which she purchases
from specialists at the Bell Family Nursery (503-651-2887; catalog
$4.50, refundable with purchase, from Box 389, Aurora, OR 97002;
fax 503-651-2648). Through the summer these shrubs pump out
bouquet-size flower heads of papery bracts, which can cost as much
as $7 a stem to purchase commercially.
</P>
<P>
   A little-known native perennial called queen of the prairie
(Filipendula rubra Venusta) produces flower heads as large and pink
as cotton candy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do very much with annuals at all. They don't last very
long in flower arrangements.'' But three she does bother with are
fragrant heliotrope and cosmos, especially the white strain of
Sensation, and the sunflower varieties Italian White and Mahogany.
She also cuts seedheads of annual nigella, which are everlasting.
</P>
<P>
   Fall is a rich time for arranging, with the berries of cranberry
viburnum (V. trilobum), the inflorescences of artemisias and
ornamental grasses such as miscanthus, the colorful fall foliage of
witch hazel, and the blooms of asters and scented geraniums. Runkle
also grows dahlia varieties with purple foliage. A plot of cute
miniature pumpkins adds humor to the autumnal garden and the
arrangements that come out of it.

THE GRAND OLD SPENDING PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 1994 congressional elections that swept them into power,
Republicans declared in the Contract with America, were a mandate
to ``transform the way Congress works.'' Accepting that mandate,
they promised a transformation that would bring about ``the end of
government that is too big, too intrusive, and too easy with the
public's money.''
</P>
<P>
   The first item on their agenda was to control the federal
budget. ``Isn't it time we hold Congress accountable for how much
they spend _ and for what?'' the GOP asked. ``The American people
demand resonsibility from Congress. The spending madness must
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   How sweetly quaint those words sound today.
</P>
<P>
   The ``spending madness'' in fiscal 1994, the last year that
Congress was controlled by Democrats, totaled $1.46 trillion.
Outlays in fiscal 2000 will add up to roughly $1.74 trillion. In
the space of six years, the bloated federal government will have
grown by nearly one-fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Early in 1995, the House Budget Committee released a list of 300
unnecessary federal agencies and spending programs that were going
to be ``zeroed out'' of existence. The feckless Department of
Education, Jimmy Carter's payoff to the teachers unions, was on the
list. The Department of Commerce, home office of corporate welfare
as we know it, was on the list. The Economic Development
Administration, a vast barrel of government pork, was on the list.
The scandal-plagued National Endowment for the Arts was on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   Not one was abolished. Virtually every money pit on the Budget
Committee's roster made it through unscathed; most devour more tax
dollars today than they did in 1995. The Economic Development
Corporation's budget has jumped from $350 million then to $438
million now. The Commerce Department budget has grown from $3.4
billion to $4.8 billion. And the Department of Education, which
Republicans have inveighed against since its creation, has gotten a
raise of more than $3 billion since the Republicans took over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today there is no strategy and no will power to cut
(itals)anything(unitals) out of the budget,'' the Cato Institute's
Stephen Moore has written. ``Not maple syrup research grants, not
Jimmy Carter's home heating subsidies, not military funding to
build skating rinks in Alaska, not taxpayer handouts to Fortune 500
companies. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has a political party failed more comprehensively to
translate its platform into reality. In 1997 and 1998, the
GOP-controlled Congress passed budgets that actually spent more
money than Bill Clinton had requested. And this is the party that
is supposed to stand for leaner government and keener bookkeeping.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few months of 1995, Republicans did try to
practice what they had preached for so long. But with Clinton's
propaganda victory over the government shutdown, GOP morale
collapsed. Ever since, the party's small band of fiscal
conservatives has been routed at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it can be frustrating,'' says John Ashcroft, a Missouri
senator who in 1998 tested the waters for a possible White House
run. ``The constituencies for federal spending are aggressive,''
and almost impossible to beat back absent a tax cut deep enough to
reduce the flow of dollars into Washington. Last year Ashcroft
developed an economic plan that would have reduced federal taxes by
$1.7 trillion over five years. By comparison, the tax cut pending
in Congress now _ less than $800 billion over 10 years _ is small
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall the Republican Congress enacted a monster
transportation bill _ at $214 billion, the most obese public works
package in US history. It was stuffed with pork, 1,467
``demonstration'' projects for members of Congress to brag about
back home. To get the bill passed, the leadership resorted to naked
vote buying. In a memorable column, Robert D. Novak quoted the
voice-mail message phoned in to one congressman's office by an aide
to Representative Bud Shuster, the Transportation Committee
chairman:
</P>
<P>
   ``We had notified you that there was $10 million in the bill for
your boss. We're upping that by $5 million, so you have $15
million, and I'm trying to figure out where you want to put the new
money, the new $5 million.'' A few GOP backbenchers refused to be
bought. But only a few.
</P>
<P>
   Four and a half years into the Republican ``revolution,''
Capitol Hill burns through taxpayers' money more greedily than
ever. The Senate has just passed a $7.4 billion ``emergency'' farm
bill, ``showering cash,'' The Washington Post reported, ``on
farmers of grain, soybeans, livestock, dairy cows, tobacco, cotton,
and `specialty crops.' '' This comes less than a year after the
last ``emergency'' farm bill, which poured $6 billion into farmers'
pockets _ and less than four years after Congress enacted the
Freedom to Farm Act, which was supposed to put an end to these
subsidies. The latest bill bestows $500,000 on pig waste management
in North Carolina, $63,000 on goat research in Texas, and $5.2
million on wood use research in Maine. Some emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to build me'' _ this is Willie Stark in ``All the
King's Men'' _ ``the God-damnedest, biggest, chromium-platedest,
formaldehyde-stinkingest free hospital and health center the
All-Father ever let live. Boy, I tell you, I'm going to have a cage
of canaries in every room that can sing Italian grand opera, and
there ain't going to be a nurse hasn't won a beauty contest at
Atlantic City and every doorknob will be 18-carat gold, and by God,
every bedpan will have a Swiss music box attachment to play `Turkey
in the Straw' or `The Sextet from Lucia,' take your choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All the King's Men'' is fiction, but Willie Stark is all too
real. So far Congress hasn't appropriated funds for musical
bedpans. But then, the House hasn't gotten to the farm bill yet.

BUSH HAS BEEN STEADILY TOUGH ON DRUG USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush doesn't
want to reveal any history he might have with cocaine, but as Texas
governor he has not been reluctant to talk tough about hard drugs
and stiffen the penalties for those who break drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Elected on a law-and-order platform in 1994, Bush has signed
laws that make it more likely that people convicted of possessing
small amounts of cocaine will go to jail, drug felons won't be
paroled, and drug dealers who sell to children or can be linked to
drug-related deaths will receive longer sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incarceration is rehabilitation,'' Bush said during his first
gubernatorial campaign, and some critics in the field of criminal
justice believe the governor has taken his own words to an extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has taken a zero-tolerance approach to drugs in
the state of Texas,'' said Danny Easterling, a Houston lawyer who
heads the 400-member Harris County Criminal Defense Lawyers
Association. ``He has a `lock 'em up' mentality, as opposed to a
give-them-treatment mentality, that is very unfortunate. When you
apply that to cocaine possession, it has a lot of people's blood
boiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's overall approach to criminals, and particularly to
first-time drug felons, causes Texans like Easterling to question
Bush's much touted ``compassionate conservatism.'' Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz accuses Bush of ``rampant hypocrisy'' for
contemplating cutting welfare benefits to poor people who have
abused drugs if, as a presidential candidate, he won't flatly deny
that he ever used hard drugs himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been dogged by the media to respond to unsubstantiated
rumors that he has used cocaine, which is a felony in Texas.
Initially, Bush cited his zone of privacy and refused to answer the
question. Last week, when asked if he could pass an FBI background
check for drugs, the governor indicated he had been drug-free for
at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the governor's eight rivals for the GOP nomination has
denied ever using illegal drugs. Some of them have suggested that
Bush's credibility on law enforcement issues hinges on giving a
direct answer to the drug question.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush's campaign message is that young people should
stay away from illegal drugs, and as governor Bush has put more
resources into preventing drug use than in treating drug addiction.
The candidate also has said that those who experiment with drugs
should learn from their mistakes and be forgiven, an attitude that
seems at odds with some of his punitive policies back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor wants to make sure that when you commit a crime,
there is going to be a punishment, and it will be swift and sure,''
said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign. ``It is his
responsibility to enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texas law that Bush signed in 1997 mandates that judges
sentence first-time felons convicted of possessing a gram or less
of cocaine to a minimum of 180 days and a maximum of two years in a
state jail. Under Bush's predecessor, Governor Ann Richards, such
first-time offenders received automatic probation with drug
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabelo, director of the Texas Criminal Justice Policy
Council, said that in 1998, some 4,000 of the felons in state jails
were drug offenders, and approximately 2,800 of them had been
incarcerated for possession of a gram or less of cocaine or heroin.
Still, more than 80 percent of the drug felons who could have been
sent to state jail had received probation instead, Fabelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Easterling said that ``a lot of people are going to jail instead
of receiving probation and rehabilitation'' for being found guilty
of possessing cocaine in amounts that suggest personal use, not
drug dealing. The majority of those being jailed, he said, are
minorities and the poor, who can't afford private attorneys and
don't get into treatment programs before their cases come to trial.
``They are under a lot of pressure to plead guilty and move on,''
Easterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Fabelo confirmed that 58 percent of the drug felons in state
jails are black, 17 percent are Hispanic, and 23 percent are white.
State jails in Texas house only nonviolent felons.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas prison population _ as opposed its state jail
population _ has tripled during the Bush administration to 149,000,
making Texas second only to Louisiana in having the highest ratio
of inmates, with more than 700 per 100,000 people. A $2 billion
prison-building program started by Richards created so many prison
beds that Bush has been able to enhance his crime-fighter image by
backing tougher criminal sentencing and cracking down on parole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the parole board appointed by Richards granted parole
to 79 percent of the eligible inmates. This year, under a
Bush-appointed parole board, the rate has fallen to an all-time low
of 16 percent. The parole rate for drug offenders in prison is
about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big old revolving door has shut,'' said Glen Castlebury, a
spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``Our
parole board has flat out quit paroling people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Habern, a criminal defense lawyer in Riverside, Texas, who
specializes in parole, says the parole rate proves that Bush is
conservative, but not compassionate. ``There is no justification
for such an extreme reduction in parole, or for the damage . . . on
those who aren't released,'' Habern said. ``Bush is not tough on
crime, he is dictatorial on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence Shapiro, a Republican state senator from Plano, Texas,
and a champion of antidrug legislation, says Bush is being unfairly
branded as a zealot on drug laws when they have been just a small
piece of a larger crime-control package he has put forward as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes in law and order, and he is committed to making
the streets safe, but the governor did not isolate drugs as his
issue, or stand up and say, `This is what I stand for,' '' said
Shapiro, noting that Bush's greatest influence has been on
overhauling the state's juvenile justice system, which, she said,
``had been coddling bad boys for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed two drug bills that Shapiro wrote: One toughens the
penalties on felons convicted of dealing drugs within 1,000 feet of
a school. A second lengthens the prison term for dealers who sell
drugs to someone who dies of an overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Bush of slashing substance-abuse treatment
programs in Texas prisons. But authorities in the state say the
14,000 treatment beds proposed by the Richards administration in
1991 never materialized because the corrections department could
not demonstrate the need, not because Bush opposed rehabilitation.
``It has been proven that 5,800 beds was and is the correct number,
and that Texas is doing the optimum with what we all want done,''
Fabelo said.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan Reynolds, director of criminal justice studies for
the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, a
conservative think tank, says Bush faces a personal dilemma with
his antidrug record and the cocaine rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's message has been, `Be tough on crime, punishment works,
and people need to take responsibility for their own actions,' ''
Reynolds said. ``I don't think it works when that man, who wants to
be the chief law enforcement officer of the nation, looks like he
is hiding a felony crime. What about equal justice for all?''

NEW WORLD SYMPHONIES 
By Jack Sullivan 
Yale University Press, 262 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``New World Symphonies'' is a lively and entertaining book on an
important paradox that has not been sufficiently remarked upon.
</P>
<P>
   At a time, late in the last century and early in ours, when
American composers were fixed on imitating European models and
carrying a great tradition forward, European composers were turning
to music from America to freshen their outlook _ and the music they
turned to was the very music that most ``serious'' American
composers shunned: African-American spirituals and early jazz,
Native American music, and various kinds of popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, chairman of American Studies at Rider College, begins
with the pivotal work illustrating this paradox, Dvorak's ``New
World'' symphony, and the composer's controversial proclamation
that ``the future music of this country must be founded upon what
are called the negro melodies. This must be the real foundation of
any serious and original school of composition to be developed in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate that Dvorak inaugurated was the subject of a weeklong
festival at the New England Conservatory last fall; Sullivan treats
it with clarity, focus, and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Later, standing on firm literary ground, Sullivan writes of the
influence of literary America on European composers, devoting
chapters to the popularity of Longfellow's ``Hiawatha;'' the
attraction composers felt to the fiction and theories of Edgar
Allan Poe; the enduring appeal of Walt Whitman to composers of
every nationality. Another chapter discusses the influence of
American landscapes on European composers who saw, or imagined,
them. The last two chapters turn to American musical models that
European composers found especially attractive, Broadway and
Hollywood, and then, of course, jazz.
</P>
<P>
   The list of composers who found inspiration in various aspects
of America is long and it includes figures as diverse as Dvorak,
Debussy, Ravel, Milhaud, Varese, Messiaen, Weill, Britten,
Stravinsky, and Tippett. Sullivan discusses the pieces one would
expect, including Rachmaninoff's Poe setting ``The Bells'' and
Vaughan Williams's ``Sea Symphony,'' on Whitman texts, with
informed enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Boston Symphony audiences will hear one of the most
important works composed for the orchestra, Messiaen's
``Turangalila'' symphony, which brings together many diverse
sources, including three tales of Poe.
</P>
<P>
   An even more valuable part of Sullivan's book treats
less-familiar works such as Dvorak's patriotic cantata ``The
American Flag,'' Delius's opera ``Koanga,'' the ``Hiawatha''
trilogy of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Milhaud's massive opera
``Christophe Colomb,'' and various works banned by Hitler's Third
Reich that have recently come back onto the fringes of the
repertory.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan is particularly good on some of the European-born
composers who wound up in Hollywood, working for the movies,
especially Erich Wolfgang Korngold, although his discussion of
Korngold involves a couple of nasty swipes at John Williams, who is
always careful to acknowledge, with great affection, his debt to
his great predecessor (``Williams, who in interviews rhapdodizes
about the similarity of film music to opera, recaps Korngold's
words as well as notes'').
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan writes better than most musicologists, draws from a
vast score of entertaining anecdotes, and displays an ear for the
telling remark. ``Korngold always composed for Warner Brothers,''
the conductor Otto Klemperer sneered. ``He just didn't realize
it.'' Ravel, accused of being obsessed with the fantastic and
artificial, replied, ``Does it not occur to these people that I
might be artificial by nature?''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenberg's encounter with Irving Thalberg at MGM has become so
legendary that it's difficult to get the facts straight. Approached
about composing the score for ``The Good Earth,'' the composer,
according to Sullivan, insisted on complete control of the entire
soundtrack, including the dialogue, which he wanted delivered in
the Sprechstimme style of ``Pierrot lunaire,'' an excerpt from
which Schoenberg's friend Salka Viertel proceded to declaim on the
spot to the consternation of the mogul. (One of Oscar Levant's
books presents a variant on this story. Thalberg recounted the
climax of the film with growing enthusiasm, childbirth in the rice
paddies during a furious storm. ``At a moment like that,''
Schoenberg is said to have replied, ``who needs music?'')
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's book has not been very helpfully edited. There is too
much chapter-to-chapter recapitulation of the same points, and
detail is not always accurate _ in text and index, for example,
Viertel is identified as ``Sadka Vertiel.'' Sometimes Sullivan is
so concerned with aesthetic issues that he overlooks worldly facts.
Whitman has been set by more composers than T. S. Eliot who ``lacks
a strong musical legacy, though his verse is supremely musical''
for the simple reason that Whitman's work lies in the public
domain, and the Eliot estate presents formidable obstacles to
composers. Still, ``New World Symphonies'' succeeds where too many
other books on music fail: It makes you want to hear the music it's
talking about.

WHY SCHOOLS GET A FAILING GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's school time, so let's do a little remedial
math. Get your No. 2 pencils ready, class.
</P>
<P>
   A beginning teacher in San Francisco makes $31,176 a year. How
much is that per month? That's right, $2,598 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Subtract a third of that for taxes, and what's left? You have
it, $1,732.
</P>
<P>
   Now, for new math, San Francisco-style.
</P>
<P>
   If that beginning teacher, taking home $1,732 a month, pays the
average San Francisco apartment rent of $1,844, how many quarters
does he or she have to panhandle a month to make the rest of the
rent?
</P>
<P>
   That's right. Your teacher's cardboard sign says, ``Will teach
for 448 extra quarters a month.''
</P>
<P>
   The social studies lesson? Let them eat in soup kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the bigger question,'' said Kent Mitchell, president of
United Educators of San Francisco, the local teachers union. ``In
the last four or five years, people have been coming into teaching
in San Francisco with that fire in the eyes, the kind we had when
we started as teachers. How do we keep them?
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you invest yourself in the community, when the most you
can make after 24 years is $56,000?''
</P>
<P>
   I know what you're going to say. Teachers work about 55 fewer
days a year than the rest of us, who don't get summers off or long
weekends because of Indigenous Peoples Day.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I had it soft as a teacher, making $3,000 a year in a
church-run private school in the early 1970s. I had the opportunity
to work weekends and summers as a bartender at a steak house, where
I made more money than I ever did in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   We value a good martini more than a kid who can read.
</P>
<P>
   It was fun for a while living in a communal house and eating
watery veggies on brown rice, but it got old fast. So I believe in
paying teachers well. But there's more to the problem of getting
and keeping good people in teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Education schools and teaching credentials should be abolished.
Teachers should receive a liberal arts or technical education, and
then be trained by apprenticeships in the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Most education schools don't introduce future teachers to actual
kids until the last semester.
</P>
<P>
   Great teachers come from teachers colleges. But they waste
valuable college years on theories of teaching and new math instead
of history and, well, math.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: Now that public schools have taken a dive,
where do parents want to send their kids? Private school.
</P>
<P>
   What teaching credentials do most private schools require? None.
Private schools try to find smart people who can teach.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I ended up teaching in a couple of private schools
(inner-city private schools, not the fancy variety). But I
eventually learned that even though I was semi-smart, I wasn't all
that good a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   It's a hard job and not everybody can do it. So, if they can,
pay them a bundle.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I took teacher certification courses, and kept
dropping out because they were so deadly dull.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Graduate School of Education had stopped certifying
teachers when I went there 25 years ago. That's how much that
prestigious institution thought of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other students, I was there to get a career boost out
of classroom teaching, the infantry of the education business, and
I ended up developing curricula for handicapped kids.
</P>
<P>
   That means you get paid more money, and only have to drop in on
classrooms as a consultant. Naturally, the job had higher pay and
prestige than being a grunt classroom teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I had enough pride not to enter an education doctoral
program. At education schools like Harvard, that's where school
administrators come from.
</P>
<P>
   My comprehensive plan to improve education calls for fewer
administrators paid less money. That's another secret of private
schools. No bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   School principals should be the most valued administrators in a
system. A good principal is worth his or her weight in
superintendents, who come and go with the political winds, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up news of former San Francisco school
Superintendent Bill Rojas. As superintendent of the Dallas schools,
Rojas is paid $260,000, the highest paid superintendent in the
country. He just created six positions for administrators at
salaries of up to $175,000.
</P>
<P>
   One of those top-paying jobs went to William F. Coleman III. As
chief financial officer of the San Francisco schools, Coleman did a
great job of leading the system into a deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recruited the best and the brightest, and I expected to pay
them competitive salaries,'' Rojas was quoted as saying last week
in the Dallas Morning News. Good luck, Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   People like Rojas should promise to pay competitive salaries to
the people who count, the teachers, and we might have better
schools. But then, superintendents wouldn't keep failing upward to
higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Be thankful that the acting school superintendent in San
Francisco, Linda Davis, is not a person like Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   At a party for school officials on Friday, she was talking with
a group of schoolchildren and someone commented, ``You know, she
actually does not mind talking to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, for a superintendent.
</P>
<P>

CUSTOMERS BAIL OUT OF FIDELITY GROWTH &AMP; INCOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember when investors cared who managed their mutual funds and
what kind of long-term records those managers had?
</P>
<P>
   Well, those days are gone. And if you don't believe us, we offer
up the experience of Steven Kaye as evidence. A longtime Fidelity
Investment portfolio manager, Kaye could be the poster child for
the ``What have you done for me lately?'' thinking that has come to
dominate the investment world.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye is one of Fidelity's veteran stars. Since he began managing
big money in 1990, he has turned in consistently strong numbers. In
1991, his Blue Chip Growth fund had a return of 54 percent. At
Growth &AMP; Income, which he has managed since 1993, Kaye has
regularly outperformed his peers.
</P>
<P>
   His fund ranks 18 out of 237 among growth and income funds since
the beginning of 1993, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
That's means Kaye has done better than 92 percent of his rivals, if
you are keeping score. His ranking in the universe of general
equity funds is nearly as good.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye has not topped the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index since 1994,
but in most years he has trailed the index by only a small amount.
</P>
<P>
   Until this year. Like Roger Clemens, Kaye is having a
disappointing 1999. As of Tuesday, Growth &AMP; Income had returned
just 5.3 percent this year, compared with 11.8 percent for the S&AMP;P
500.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis by Morningstar Inc., which tracks
mutual funds, Kaye has bet too heavily on drug stocks and financial
stocks, neither of which have done well in 1999. A big position in
cigarette maker Philip Morris hasn't helped either. On the flip
side, Kaye has not had enough money in technology, the best
performing sector of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have noticed _ and voted with their feet. Since the
beginning of the year they have yanked $1.7 billion from the $50
billion fund, according to Alpha Equity Research in Portsmouth,
N.H. The fund has had outflows in every month this year.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other Fidelity fund, Fidelity Low-Priced, has seen more
money go out the door in 1999. Last year Growth &AMP; Income had
inflows of more than $1.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just shows you how quick people are to pull the trigger
these days,'' says William Dougherty of Kanon Bloch Carre, a mutual
fund consulting firm. Until a few years ago such shifting was
unusual. But these days it is the norm, at Fidelity and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't hard to see why. Investors are bombarded with
information about funds. They can check how their funds are doing
each day in the newspaper. Once a quarter, and sometimes even once
a month, funds are rated and ranked by performance.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to better technology, reacting to that information has
become easier. Investors can switch funds by making a phone call or
pushing some buttons on the computer. If the money is in a
retirement plan _ 77 percent of Growth &AMP; Income's dollars are
retirement assets _ the switch can be made without any tax
consequences. Growth &AMP; Income has been closed to new investors
since last year, but participants in retirement plans can still put
money into the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Finally investors are reacting to big gaps in performance that
have persisted for the past several years. At the risk of
oversimplification, funds that have had money in large-cap
</P>
<P>
   technology stocks _ Dell, Microsoft, Cisco, IBM _ have done very
well, while practically every other kind of fund has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   All the changes have contributed to an emphasis on short-term
performance. In this kind of environment Stephen Kaye's good
long-term track record might as well have been achieved during the
Pleistocene era.
</P>
<P>
   Does Fidelity care?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not much. The mutual fund giant took in $23 billion in
new money in the first half of '99, up 26 percent from the same
period a year ago. The money has been pouring into Fidelity's
hottest funds, a blend of index funds and growth funds. One
particularly hot fund, Aggressive Growth, which is up nearly 40
percent this year, had inflows of more than $2 billion in the first
seven months of the year. Presumably much of the money that has
left Growth &AMP; Income has found its way to other Fidelity funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity's latest advertising campaign _ which highlights funds
that have been doing well in 1999 _ seems to recognize the way the
game is played.
</P>
<P>
   So who gets hurt by this constant shuffling of money from fund
to fund?
</P>
<P>
   Investors. ``I call it the rear-view mirror syndrome,'' says
Burt Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant based in Philadelphia.
Investors, he says, are reacting to what has already happened. They
move into funds that have done well, often just in time to catch
the next downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a winning game for most investors,'' agrees
Dougherty. ``Eventually they are going to get clocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the hyperspeed Internet era, no one has demonstrated
that a frenetic pace of investing will pay dividends. Old-fashioned
as it sounds, it still makes sense to have a balanced portfolio
made up of funds that have done well over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   History suggests that a stock picker like Steven Kaye will
eventually get his touch back and that his shareholders will reap
the rewards _ except for those who bailed out during his slump.

WHEN PIZZA LOSES IT'S APPEAL, TRY SOME DORM CUISINE

   LOUDONVILLE, N.Y. _ No oven, no stove top, no problem. A college
dorm may not be the Four Seasons, but that doesn't mean you can't
feast like a king.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, sometimes, the limited resources make for a more
creative dish, says Norman Kvam, director of dining services at
Siena College in Loudonville. For 11 years, Kvam has been working
his brand of culinary magic at Siena, which includes a ``stand-up
dog and pony show'' at freshman orientation and an evening seminar
on cooking in the dorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strictly for comic relief,'' Kvam says. ``Students earn
priority points, which put them in a raffle for a town house. They
don't get graded.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, says Kvam, his evening cooking class is more useful as
a ``real-life experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It teaches survival tips like how to eat when the cafeteria is
serving chicken and you're a vegetarian.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make several vegan and vegetarian dishes,'' Kvam says. Many
colleges have kitchens available to students, but in individual
dorm rooms not much is allowed other than a mini-refrigerator and a
small microwave.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, Kvam says. Cooking possibilities are still
limitless, especially using a soft taco. Add any filling you want,
with the meat precooked, and turn it into a luscious burrito in one
zap.
</P>
<P>
   Pizza bagels involve very little work, requiring only two halves
of a bagel, a handful of cheese and some prepared pizza sauce.
Spread the sauce and cheese on the bagel and microwave 1 to 2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   A turkey melt can satisfy the snacking need, but don't try to
toast the bread. Stack a hard roll with presliced turkey, cheese,
tomato, lettuce, perhaps a pickle. Then, ``zap it for one minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Even chicken Parmesan, using precooked chicken, can be prepared
in the allowed appliances. The pizza bagel and cheese quesadilla
cater nicely to vegetarians, and soups can easily be made without
meat, Kvam says. For another vegetarian dish, add 1/2 cup prepared
alfredo sauce to ramen noodles. Add frozen peas or broccoli thawed
in the microwave and you have Chinese Noodles Alfredo.
</P>
<P>
   Couscous also works nicely; you need only to follow the
directions on the box, ``cutting the times about in half from the
stove top instructions,'' Kvam says. Stir halfway through whenever
you microwave. For a side of won tons, the directions are again
simple. Follow them exactly, ``including the basics of boiling
water,'' Kvam says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every freshman should be able to pull this off. It's very
basic stuff but very good on cold nights.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools allow coffee makers in dorm rooms, and this gives
way to a whole slew of cooking possibilities, such as scrambled
eggs and chocolate mousse, which are included in ``The Coffee Maker
Cookbook,'' by Peter Mazonson. For students, cooking tips like
these bring a little independence, the prospect of a midnight
snack, and provide a cheap alternative to fasting when your stomach
turns at the scent of the meal in the cafeteria.

THERE'S MORE TO SCHOOL LUNCH THAN TASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Parents who do their food safety homework can
protect their children's brown-bag lunches from hungry bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria love school-room temperatures, which allow them to
multiply quickly when there's also a source of food and moisture,''
says Dr. Debby Demory-Luce, registered dietitian with the USDA
Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine
in Houston. To ward off harmful bacteria, Demory-Luce has some
suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Before the school year begins:
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy well-insulated lunch boxes or bags, insulated bottles for
hot and cold foods and several days' supply of freezer gel packs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stock up on shelf-stable food: canned fruit or puddings with
pop-top lids, peanut butter, crackers, fresh fruit, bottled water,
single-serve packets of mayonnaise and boxes of 100-percent fruit
juice. Disposable silverware and individual hand wipes are also a
good idea.
</P>
<P>
   At home:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash hands, food preparation surfaces and utensils with hot,
soapy water before making the lunches. Wash raw fruit and
vegetables thoroughly and dry them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Avoid using mayonnaise or mayonnaise-type dressings as a
spread or salad base for lunches that cannot be refrigerated.
Handle other perishable foods like sandwich meats with care.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prepare lunches the night before and store in the refrigerator
or freezer. Frozen sandwiches, bottled water and juice boxes offer
additional protection and will usually thaw completely by
lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tightly wrap cold foods in plastic and place them around an
ice pack or juice box.
</P>
<P>
   _ Preheat or prechill insulated bottles to maximize the
protection they provide. Fill with piping hot water or ice water
and let stand a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At school:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have kids store their lunches out of direct sunlight and away
from heaters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tell the kids to throw out any leftovers because the ice packs
and insulated containers won't keep the food safe all day.
</P>
<P>
   After school:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wash lunch boxes, gel packs and insulated bags with hot, soapy
water and air dry. Using a little baking soda helps control food
odors. Put the gel packs back in the freezer.

CONDITIONING IS KEY TO LONGEVITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   People should only expect a flower arrangement to last three
days, Pauline Runkle says. But conditioning will certainly increase
the life of cut flowers. ``And floral perservatives really are
necessary. There's lots of new ones on the market. But I think
they're all pretty much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   She always uses ultra-clean buckets that have been washed with
bleach to kill germs. The most important aspect of conditioning
flowers is to recut the stems under water, even if you've received
them as a gift through a florist. (``Purchased roses dehydrate in
shipping. To rehydrate, lay them in a sink full of water
horizontally while you recut the stems.'')
</P>
<P>
   After harvesting material, Runkle trims (but does not rip or
pull) the leaves from the stems so none will be under water in the
finished arrangement. Then she recuts the ends in a bucket of
nearly hot water. Runkle cuts a cross 1 to 2 inches up the length
of branches of shrubs. ``The woodier the stem, the hotter the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she sets her buckets of blooms in a cool dark place
overnight to encourage the flowers to drink up before they're
arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh cut daffodil stems exude a poison (that's why they're
pest-proof), so Runkle conditions them separately from other types
of flowers. But they can be added to mixed arrangements after
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   After re-recutting (under water, of course) and arranging, she
keeps the vase filled. ``Cut flowers drink all the way up the stem,
so don't just have 3 inches of water in the bottom of the
container.''
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to change the water, Runkle says. But when
topping off a vase after a few days, she holds it under running
water and flushes it.
</P>
<P>
   Some types of flowers last longer than others, so pull out the
faded ones to keep the arrangement fresh-looking.

`THE MUSE' DEFINITELY NOT AMUSING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Albert Brooks has made a career out of writing,
directing and starring in fine movies that have been largely
ignored by the public. ``Real Life,'' ``Modern Romance,'' ``Lost in
America'' and parts of ``Defending Your Life'' and ``Mother''
contain smart, funny and biting looks at human foibles and cultural
quirks. The movies are wholly original, wholly Brooks and minor
treasures that deserve to be discovered by future generations.
</P>
<P>
   But with his latest effort, ``The Muse,'' Brooks has succeeded
in making a movie that (START ITAL)deserves(END ITAL) to be shunned
by moviegoers. An uninspired look at the nature of creativity,
``The Muse'' is an awkwardly filmed, virtually humor-free film so
unrelentingly bad that you're left to wonder how it could have
possibly been made by anyone, much less a filmmaker as talented as
Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' features cheap slapstick, lame Hollywood satire and
self-absorbed navel-gazing of a kind that will appeal only to
industry insiders or those living near the 90210 ZIP code. Not one
moment of the movie is believable, which may have been Brooks'
intention. Precious few moments are funny, which most certainly was
not by design.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks plays Hollywood screenwriter Steven Phillips, a onetime
Oscar nominee who, word has it, has lost his edge. (Unfortunately,
this seems to be one of movie's many autobiographical elements.)
Steven loses his deal, his office at Paramount (who, wisely, turned
down ``The Muse'') and his confidence in one fell swoop. This leads
him down a quixotic trail and to an unlikely brush with Zeus'
family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently there's a muse (Sharon Stone) living in Hollywood who
has revived flagging careers and turned lifelong hacks into
box-office champions. Steven learns of her existence through a
screenwriter friend (Jeff Bridges) and begs her to take him on as
her latest project. The muse accepts, even though she has movers
and shakers like James Cameron, Martin Scorsese and Rob Reiner (all
of whom make cameos) lined up at her door.
</P>
<P>
   Steven, a chronic whiner, quickly realizes he may be in over his
head. Stone's muse is a demanding spirit, requiring Steven to put
her up in the Four Seasons Hotel and fetch her Waldorf salads in
the wee hours of the morning. And she doesn't seem to be helping
his career, instead concentrating her energies on Steven's wife,
Laura (Andie MacDowell), and her dreams of a gourmet cookie empire.
(The movie spends far too much time on this annoying subplot.)
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' jabs at Hollywood seem the tired and bitter lashings of
a man who has been forced to fight for every movie he has made.
When Steven finally hits on a screenplay courtesy of the muse _
``The Beverly Hillbillies'' in an aquarium _ it seems ludicrous to
believe that the script will resuscitate his career.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's probably the point. Brooks is decrying the
garbage that Hollywood sells and the public buys. But that doesn't
explain why everyone _ Steven and Laura included _ believes the
screenplay is the modern-day equivalent to ``Some Like It Hot.'' In
short: Why is everyone in this movie laughing? And, more to the
point, why aren't we joining in?
</P>
<P>
   Stone can add comedy to the list of things she can't do in
movies. She tries to play off her diva image here, much as Eddie
Murphy spoofed himself in the far superior ``Bowfinger.'' But Stone
doesn't have the chops or the benefit of a smart script, and
Brooks' unimaginative direction cripples her at every turn. She
looks like she's trying too hard. Her wooden scenes with MacDowell
will likely be playing on a continuous loop in a cineplex somewhere
in hell along with clips from ``The Haunting'' and that mechanical
spider from ``Wild Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, though, ``The Muse'' chokes on its insularity, not
its performances. We don't need another movie about Hollywood
self-involvement, particularly one with nothing new or amusing to
say. Next time, Albert, go for the funny bone and save the rants
for your agent. And hire a better muse. This one failed you
miserably. &QL;

THE PAN IS SECRET TO GOOD RED CABBAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The little slip of paper fell out of the
envelope. ``Would you please tell me how to make red cabbage either
hot or cold,'' was all that was written on it.
</P>
<P>
   Sure. But first I have to tell you that this is my mother's
sacred red cabbage recipe. It's usually served with a pork loin
that has been dressed with salt, pepper and onion slices and
roasted. And with potatoes that are also roasted until they turn a
nice golden brown on the outside while remaining tender on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to this recipe lies in the pan. You must use a deep,
heavy-bottomed skillet or Dutch oven with a lid, preferably one
that has been seasoned with the elbow grease of cooking for a
family.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the pan and add four or five slices of bacon. Cook until
crisp and remove the bacon to paper towels to drain. Pour off all
but 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease. Add 1/4 cup granulated sugar
and stir. Add in 1/4 cup cider vinegar and cook, stirring, until
sugar dissolves. Add 1 head red cabbage, cut into shreds, and toss
until cabbage is coated with sauce. Turn down heat, cover and
simmer until cabbage is cooked through, 15 to 20 minutes. Crumble
cooked bacon into the cabbage and serve.

FLOWERS THAT MAKE THE CUT _ AND THOSE THAT DON'T 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is Pauline Runkle's list of the best and worst flowers for
growing for bouquets. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BEST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Biennials. Forget-me-nots (Myosotis scorpioides), foxgloves, and
hollyhocks are all good for cutting. Leave a few to reseed.
</P>
<P>
   Catmint. Perhaps the easiest blue flower. Long-lasting. Fragrant
gray foliage. (Not to be confused with catnip.)
</P>
<P>
   Cosmos. The best annual. Easy to grow and arrange. White
Sensation is choice.
</P>
<P>
   Daffodils. Easy and perennial. And they can be mail-ordered in
many varieties not available through florists. She likes the
fragrant and diminutive Ice Wings, Petral, Thalia, Sun Disk, and
Poeticus.
</P>
<P>
   Flowering shrubs. The best bargain. Especially spireas, mock
oranges, viburnums, buddleias, hydrangeas, and shrubs with colored
foliage or berries.
</P>
<P>
   Lady's mantle. The best filler because its green sprays make
other flowers look more vivid. A self-seeding perennial that
tolerates shade.
</P>
<P>
   Lilacs. Easy. Fragrant. She orders early and late varieties
through Fox Hill Nursery (207-729-1511).
</P>
<P>
   Lily-of-the-valley. Fragrant. Easy. Expensive to buy.
</P>
<P>
   Peonies. Zaftig Victorian beauty. Some are fragrant. ``But they
come and go so fast, you should grow them in a separate bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Roses. Unusual but easy types. Give them three full years to
establish themselves, but after that, yank them out if you're not
satisfied, and give the space to another variety.
</P>
<P>
   Tulips. An amazing range of types, mostly unavailable from
florists. Runkle buys wholesale through catalogs and pulls up and
discards the inexpensive bulbs after harvest, as they're at their
best only the first year. Her favorites include Swan Wings, White
Parrot, and Spring Green.
</P>
<P>
   Variegated Solomon's seal. Easy in shade. Unusual and effective
in arrangements because of the arching stem. &QL; 
 &QL; 
WORST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Annuals. Most don't last as cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Dark maroon and ``black'' flowers. Though faddishly popular,
they disappear like black holes in arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Day lilies. Good garden plants but bad cutting flowers, because
each bloom collapses after a day and just hangs there.
</P>
<P>
   Delphiniums and monkshoods. The flowers shatter.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese maples. The beautiful leaves drop.
</P>
<P>
   Lilies. Even if you're not cursed with the red lily-leaf beetle,
they're cheaper to buy as cut flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Oriental poppies. Fragile, short-lived, and hard to arrange.
</P>
<P>
   Sweet William. Too stiff.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Watching the offbeat romantic comedy ``The Very
Thought of You'' brought to mind that great line from Wes
Anderson's ``Rushmore'': ``With friends like this, who needs
friends?''
</P>
<P>
   Laurence (Joseph Fiennes) has two such friends, Frank (Rufus
Sewell) and Daniel (Tom Hollander), chums he has known since his
grade-school days. The thing is, Laurence is near 30 now, and these
relationships are based more on the past than any commonality in
the present.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Laurence is a man, an English man no less, so he's not
given to examining the deep meaning behind it all. Life is what it
is _ until a woman named Martha enters the picture, the same woman,
it turns out, who has bewitched each of the three friends
unbeknownst to the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Very Thought of You,'' like most romances, stacks the deck
heavily in favor of love, so much so that the movie loses some of
its appeal. You know it's a cinch that there's going to be a clinch
right before the closing credits. And it's a pretty goofy clinch at
that.
</P>
<P>
   The film does have its small charms, though, and boasts
agreeable enough turns from the ever-brooding Fiennes and Monica
Potter as his would-be soulmate. You could do worse on a date
night.
</P>
<P>
   Potter plays Martha, a down-on-her-luck American beauty who
decides to make a new life in London, not because she knows anyone
there, but because the airplane ticket costs her just $99. Martha's
solo mission quickly turns into a foursome, which, in turn,
threatens the rather tenuous bond shared by Laurence and his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   The movie begins rather slowly but picks up steam once it fully
introduces the three men and their lady. Director Nick Hamm,
working from a clever but uneven screenplay by Peter Morgan,
manages a few nice twists on the romantic-comedy genre, going back
and forth in time and perspective with stylish imagination.
</P>
<P>
   But for every moment of ingenuity, ``The Very Thought of You''
has a lapse in credibility. There are too many coincidences, too
many heavy sighs.
</P>
<P>
   And given the overwhelming stupidity of his two friends, the
choice Laurence must ultimately make certainly shouldn't give him
much pause for thought. That it does is a dilemma we just can't
buy. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``The Very Thought of You'' (PG-13; language). &UR;  &QL;

Fiennes. &UR;  &QL;

THE NEW NISSAN MAXIMA: $21,000 CARS DO NOT SOUND LIKE THIS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Through several generations of cars and trucks, Nissan developed
a loyal following and a reputation for reliable cars that seemed
designed to match whatever Toyota had up its sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Brand loyalty and good financial times followed _ for a while.
Now, in times of tangled finances and a product line that went
stale, Nissan is pushing for a comeback. And with its sights set on
young drivers and families, it has produced the Xterra SUV, the
Frontier Crew Cab pickup truck, and let out word that the Z sports
car will be returning.
</P>
<P>
   But the staple of the Nissan fleet has long been the Maxima, and
back in 1984 when it was given a V-6 engine, it was a leader among
peppy sports sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the 2000 Maxima, and it is more powerful, bigger, and
better handling than any of its predecessors. And with a base price
of just $21,049 for the GXE, it is a wonderful bargain considering
that, performance and comfort-wise, it is in a league with cars
that cost a third to nearly twice as much more. Even the
top-of-the-line GLE is priced at $26,249, still well below many
comparable cars.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has taken a 3.0-liter DOHC, 24-valve V-6 and cranked out
222 horsepower. That's more horses than corraled by the 1999 Toyota
Camry, the V-6 Accord, or the Lexus ES 300.
</P>
<P>
   The secret? New intake and exhaust manifolds, a variable
induction system for air intake control, equal length exhaust pipes
coupled with a muffler off the high-performance Skyline GT-R (a
muffler flap valve opens at 2,000-2,400 rpms and cuts exhaust
system back pressure), and platinum-tipped spark plugs good for
100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   All this gives you 32 more horsepower than the last Maxima, and
it delivers the power with a wonderful guttural rumble that the
Nissan folks say surprised even them. Cars that cost $21,000 do not
sound like this.
</P>
<P>
   Available in five-speed manual or 4-speed automatic, this
base-model Nissan GXE (automatic transmission) cruised easily at 75
miles per hour while turning only 2,600 rpms. This was while
delivering about 25 miles per gallon in a week of testing.
</P>
<P>
   It often happens that when a manufacturer wants a car to appeal
to those who appreciate power, they bring on the power but lose
something in handling _ all part of keeping the cost down. Not so
with the Maxima. This is a balanced car that handles its boosted
power well. Got a peppy little Golf that wants to play tag with you
as you come off an entrance ramp and onto the highway? You'll leave
the Golf driver wondering how this snub-tailed car left him in the
dust of a decreasing radius turn.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the power, Nissan has beefed up stabilizer/antiroll
bars front and rear, with coil springs up front and a multilink
rear suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima tracks well in corners, snaps lane to lane on the
highway, and its braking, using 4-wheel disc brakes and ABS, makes
for straight and sure stops.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid that you might get too playful with the Maxima, Nissan
has installed an electronic shutoff at the 7,100 redline.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth generation Maxima and the folks at Nissan
Design International, Inc., in La Jolla, Calif., have set out to
retain some of the old look of the Maxima _ the chopped rear end,
for instance _ while adding softer, more curved lines from the
front and up over the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Seat yourself behind the wheel, and you know Nissan has not
skimped inside, either. Just grab the steering wheel, notice the
dimpled grips right and left, and you know Nissan meant this car
for drivers, not just for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample legroom front and rear, and with its windshield
sweeping out and away from a broad dash, and its center-dash
control panels flowing down to the console, it has the look of the
new Mercedes S Class.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at $60,000 less than the Mercedes, the Nissan is not
in that league. But it is in a league of its own for what it
delivers at this price. The seats are broad and firm, even in the
basic cloth models, and add to the big-car feel.
</P>
<P>
   The dark numerals of the gauges, set against an off-white
background, make them easy to read and give the car a certain retro
feel _ one I last noticed on the Chrysler 300M, another car I
liked.
</P>
<P>
   This base-model GXE comes with standard refined suspension, ABS,
keyless remote access, power windows, and locks. The test model had
a sliding glass sunroof and a comfort and convenience package
(including 16-inch alloy wheels, upgraded audio system, eight-way
power driver's seat) that added $2,068 to the price.
</P>
<P>
   When you review a car, it is important to ask just who might be
interested in it. In the case of the Maxima, I can see two key
groups for whom this is a fine buy: First, young drivers who want a
peppy car but just don't have the money for that BMW or Saab Turbo.
This is a great entry-level car while they wait for their next pay
raise in their new careers. Second, this is a good buy for drivers
who want comfort, reliability, and economy, coupled with a car that
has enough power to let them move nimbly along the highway as they
might in a more expensive sedan.

BRITISH FORMALITY ONLY SLIGHTLY LAMPOONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ English heritage movies sure could use a good
shaking up. Until something which does that comes along, ``Stiff
Upper Lips'' will have to do.
</P>
<P>
   The British farce takes a few potent jabs at the boring
pretensions that ``Chariots of Fire,'' ``Jude'' and the
Merchant/Ivory films, among others, deem so bloody important.
Austen, Forster and Lawrence tropes that have been cinematically
calcified into cliches all get a good thrashing.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, director Gary Sinyor and his co-writer Paul Simpkin,
while hardly dummies, fail to assault the Britflicks at their own
high level of intelligence. Of all the genres to lampoon, this one
requires the cleverest approach.
</P>
<P>
   But outside of a few choice broadsides at class inequity and
blinkered worldviews _ without, sadly, linking them to the audience
snobs who mistake this stuff for cinematic art _ ``Lips'' mainly
traffics in sexual burlesque and making fun of twits.
</P>
<P>
   The film's lineup of addled aristocrats includes well-bred young
lady Emily (Georgina Cates), her Aunt Agnes (``Fawlty Towers'''
Prunella Scales) who's desperate to get the girl properly married
off, oblivious brother Edward (Samuel West, who's actually appeared
in films like ``Carrington'' and ``Howards End'') and Ed's school
chum Cedric (Robert Portal), a spiff so stiff he even swims in a
full suit of clothes.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1908, so of course no one knows anything about sex. Cedric
is supposed to be the hard-to-please Emily's last-ditch suitable
suitor, but she hates how he constantly quotes Homer and, besides,
he has stronger feelings (which, naturally, he doesn't understand)
for Edward. Edward might reciprocate his friend's affections, but
he has even less of a clue about what that might mean (his diary
entries are about teddy bears, when they're about anything at all).
</P>
<P>
   What to do, then, but take the Grand Tour? Everyone decamps for
Italy, accompanied by the new working-class manservant George (Sean
Pertwee). Emily, of course, has her requisite erotic awakening in
the Mediterranean climate, and George is the only English-speaking
bloke around who knows what to do about it. Once he does, however,
it's ...
</P>
<P>
   Off to India! Here Aunt Agnes enjoys her own little fling with
dithering colonial pasha Horace (Peter Ustinov), while Emily has
trouble keeping her breakfast down. George sees no reason why class
differences should stand in the way of true love and marriage, but
everybody else does, so there's another problem. Will the sun never
set on these yearning hearts?
</P>
<P>
   We're not supposed to care, but the film would have been smarter
_ and funnier _ if it had somehow managed to make us care. After
all, despite their overreliance on furnishings and self-squelching
performances, the ``Remains of the Days,'' ``Emmas'' and ``Room
With a Views'' of the world do manage to engage our emotions while
smartly examining their characters' foibles. And they can often be
quite funny about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stiff Upper Lips'' takes on a deserving foe. Unfortunately,
it's outclassed by the very subjects it strives to skewer. &QL;

NEWCOMER GIA VENTOLA HAS DESIGNS ON THE STARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Gia Ventola has hit the jackpot. Just one year out of
design school, the Topsfield, Mass. native was asked to create a
costume for Britney Spears, a stretchable vinyl ensemble the pop
singer dons in the opening act of her 41-city tour, which arrives
in Boston next week.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about big breaks. Spears's fans _ mostly girls age 8 to 18
_ are notorious for emulating the 17-year-old's image. Moreover,
Teen People is running a story on Ventola in October titled ``Get
Britney's Look,'' which will include pictures of Spears in costume
and a toll-free telephone number for readers to order the goods
directly from Ventola's office in Beverly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true. It's incredible. I've wanted this
since I was a little kid,'' says Ventola, 23. ``Not many kids get a
chance like this.''
</P>
<P>
   If timing is everything, Ventola may become the hottest designer
in the Boston area. Her work has been featured in W magazine and
Women's Wear Daily, a fashion industry newspaper. InStyle magazine
says it's considering featuring a Ventola skirt icoming
issue. Sports Illustrated has also borrowed six Ventola swimsuits
for possible inclusion in the February 2000 swimsuit issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her stuff is great. We really like it,'' says MJ Figel, an
assistant editor at SI. ``It's very modern, very new
millennium-ish. It's definitely worth taking a look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ventola is in talks with Macy's and Nordstrom to carry a
juniors line. ``We have no orders yet. But it looks good,'' says
Barbara Hirsh, Ventola's New York business partner.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is great news for Boston's fashion community. The
more national exposure for the Hub, the more respect it gains from
retailers and major designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is absolutely wonderful,'' says Alfred Fiandaca, a
Newbury Street designer since 1960. ``Boston hasn't had a big buzz
on fashion since David Josef dressed Mrs. Dukakis in the (1988)
presidential campaign. (Ventola) is launching a name and it's
fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   But if money is a measure of success, Ventola might say she
hasn't quite arrived. Despite all her promise and exposure, she has
yet to earn a dime of profit. ``We've invested over $100,000 from
our 401(k),'' says Gia's mother, Diane Ventola, referring to
herself and her husband Jack. ``To get $15,000 in sales, you have
to spend $45,000. . . . We've already told Gia there's only so much
we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn that even a celebrity endorsement does not
guarantee success. ``Remember designers like Isaac Mizrahi and Todd
Oldham? All the celebrities loved them. Fashion editors loved them.
But when there's no money exchanged, you have no business,'' says
South End designer Josef, referring to two popular New York
designers. Last year, Mizrahi went out of business and Oldham
closed down his primary couture collection.
</P>
<P>
   Josef, who until last year was sold in stores like Saks Fifth
Avenue, Neiman Marcus, and Bloomingdale's, cautions that department
store placements aren't always the answer either. ``You have the
prestige of being in the store,'' he says. ``But they want
guarantees. If you ship 100 outfits and 60 aren't sold within, say,
six weeks, they want money back or they want you to take the
clothes back. It's very difficult. You're at the mercy of where
your clothes are displayed and who the sales staff is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventola _ whose headquarters in Beverly consists of a desk,
eight sewing machines, clothing racks, a cutting table, and two
full-time seamstresses _ isn't letting anything dash her hopes.
``Call me the next Alexander McQueen or Versace,'' she says. ``I
want to be sold in Louis, Boston. If they take Helmut Lang, why not
me?''
</P>
<P>
   No one can deny Ventola has style, one that is akin to Madonna's
clubby 1980s look. On a recent business day, the strawberry blonde
walked around her office in blue eyeshadow, bold black mascara, and
claw-like fingernails, with rings on multiple fingers. Her black
asymmetrical top matched her purple-and-black-striped pants and the
glittery silver scarf she had tied at the hip. She wore an arm band
on one arm and an arm sleeve (a sleeve not attached to the top) on
the other. ``A lot of people say I look like Madonna,'' she
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ventola has always loved fashion. The only child of a housewife
and the owner of a frozen seafood company, the budding designer
used to host fashion shows for her friends at home. When prom
seasons came around, she'd be the one applying makeup on her
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent varsity field hockey player, Ventola was written up
in The Boston Globe in 1992 for displaying ``winning fashion'' on
the field: blue eyeshadow, lipstick, and a gold, glittery
fingernail.
</P>
<P>
   Ventola attended Parsons School of Design in New York, earning a
bachelor of fine arts degree in fashion design in 1998. After
graduation, she lived in Italy and then with her parents in Ipswich
before approaching Hirsh, the owner of a New York showroom (where
retailers and fashion editors come to look at new collections) in
June.
</P>
<P>
   After examining Ventola's impressive samples, Hirsh agreed to
form a company with her called Gia V. (A Hirsh Signature), which
specializes in form-fitting leather sportswear aimed at women over
21. Ventola describes her current collection of white and black
lamb leather as futuristic _ ``like the Jetsons'' _ with
asymmetrical hemlines, zipper accents, and contrasting piping on
the seams.
</P>
<P>
   Priced $290 to $1,000, the line includes motor cross jackets,
bell bottoms, three-quarter-length-sleeve ruffle V-neck shirts and
even ball gown skirts. Hirsh says the three-month-old collection is
sold at Bergdorf Goodman and through the Saks catalog.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a Gia V. design that Hayley Hill, Spears's stylist,
requested days before Spears launched her tour in June. ``I had
originally wanted to use leather for her opening act,'' says Hill,
who is also fashion director at Teen People. ``But I was worried
about the leather not stretching when she danced.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventola, who thought leather was too sophisticated for a
teenager anyway, suggested white pleather (a stretchable vinyl)
instead, with pink elbow pads on the jacket and pink knee pads on
the pants. Hill was thrilled. ``So many designers have a bit of an
attitude about teen stars. Gia was willing to do things that she
knew Britney would like, not just what she thought Britney should
wear. Britney loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventola pulled an all-nighter to create the look and Fed X'd the
outfit to Spears the day of her tour's opening concert in Pompano
Beach, Fla. A headline in the next day's local newspaper,
positioned over a picture of Spears in the Ventola outfit, said it
all: ``She's Perfect!''
</P>
<P>
   With favorable costume reviews popping up all over the country,
Hill decided to run a story on Ventola in Teen People. Hirsh and
Ventola, who had just launched Gia V., suddenly found themselves
launching a junior line too, called G.I.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy,'' says Ventola. ``But we're pulling it together.
We're going to have denim splattered with a paint effect, fake
leather pants, tops with cut-outs, reversible denim jackets, and
denim with a leather finish. Everything will be available by
Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   As if that isn't enough work, Ventola designed some bathing
suits in her spare time that Sports Illustrated has since borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used a lot of metallics,'' says the designer, who typically
works 15 hours a day. ``I placed sheer overlays over hologram
fabric. It looks cool, psychedelic. The halter tops have velcro in
the back and everything is reversible.'' The bathing suit line,
called Gia-Marina, will be available in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hirsh agrees her infant company is locked in whirlwind mode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having babies. Enough! OK?'' she laughs. But she
knows in fashion, it's important to produce when you're hot.
</P>
<P>
   Says Ventola, ``It's a little overwhelming but it keeps me
creative. Maybe I'm sounding too blunt, but I think I have what it
takes.''

YOU CAN REPLACE THE SILL, NOT THE WHOLE WINDOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite years of recycling materials _ metal, glass, plastic _
and even longer preaching the gospel of renovating and restoring
old houses, it's still a throw-away society.
</P>
<P>
   We are hounded on all sides, and at all times of day, it seems,
that if our siding is old, it's no good and should be replaced,
with vinyl, of course.
</P>
<P>
   By another babbling salesman, we are told that if our windows
are old, or wood, or weight-balanced, they are no good and should
be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The beat goes on, and unfortunately, we believe some of this
palaver, and spend thousands of dollars getting our perfectly good
house parts replaced by things that are not necessarily better, nor
even as good, as the originals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Save a buck, lots of them
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hereby hangs this tale: A reader called the handyman to tell him
that some of his outdoor windowsills have rotted out and to ask,
``Do I have to replace the windows?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a wise man who calls the handyman instead of a window
salesman, because the handyman told him that no, he does not have
to replace the windows, just the sills, and he can do it himself,
and in the process save maybe $200 to $500, the cost of one new
window.
</P>
<P>
   Most windowsills decay because they are set up with an outside
aluminum storm window, the old-fashioned way, but not necessarily
the wrong way. What happens is that when the storm window is raised
and the screen lowered for summer, rain water gets between the main
window and the storm window. If there are no weep holes at the
bottom sill of the storm window, to allow water to flow out, the
water just stays and stays, rotting the wood.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to do in a case like that is to make sure the
weep holes in that storm-window frame are open; if there are none,
drill two 1/8-inch holes in the bottom frame, four inches in from
each side.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fill or replace
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK, now for the decay. There are several ways to fix it. The
easiest way is to dig out the decayed area to sound wood, apply
bleach to kill any fungi that caused the decay in the first place,
rinse thoroughly, let dry, and appy an epoxy wood rot filler. This
material is sold in hardware and building stores; Minwax is the
latest company to make it. The material is hard, sticks well to
sound wood, and can be sanded smooth and painted.
</P>
<P>
   If the repair is kept well-primed and painted or stained, and
water is not allowed to stand on it, it, like the sill itself, will
last for another 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Another way to fix a decayed sill is to cut out the decayed part
and screw on a new wood piece. When you do that, be sure to caulk
the joint so water will not get between the new piece and the old.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if the sill is simply too far gone, you can replace it,
but not the whole window, for goodness sake.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lot of fussy work
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't think it will be easy, because it isn't. Well, it is not
difficult, just fussy and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   First, remove the storm window, it unscrews easily, but may
require prying off because it was caulked when it was installed.
After your work is done, you can put the storm back in place, using
the same screws and screw holes.
</P>
<P>
   OK, raise the lower sash, then, indoors, remove the inside sill.
You may have to remove the inside casing to do this, but it cannot
be helped. Nothing else has to be removed. Save all these parts
because you can put them back when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
   Still with us? Now you can cut out the old sill. Cut it right
across the middle, so you can pry out each piece, with one or two
large pry bars. This is the hardest part, because the sill is
nailed to the vertical jamb from the bottom up, so you cannot get
to the nails. Sometimes you can just pry the whole mess out, but
other times you can slip a hacksaw blade between jamb and sill and
cut the nails. It's tedious but possible, and it will allow
quicker, easier removal of the sill.
</P>
<P>
   With the sill out, cut off any nails left dangling.
</P>
<P>
   Save the sill to use as a template to cut the new one to fit.
You can buy such sills at lumber stores and chain building stores.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with the new sill is that it may be thinner than the
old. You can make up for this thinner replacement by putting a thin
board on top of the rough opening that you exposed when you removed
the sill.
</P>
<P>
   Slip in the new sill; its top will slope properly to allow rain
runoff. And, make sure the top surface of the sill sits flush with
the jamb. Do not caulk this joint; uncaulked, it will allow any
water that gets to that joint to flow through it and eventually
dissipate and evaporate. Caulking such a joint may trap moisture
behind it, causing further decay.
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to nail the sill to the jamb; you cannot
anyway. Simply nail the sill to the rough opening.
</P>
<P>
   Now, put the inside sill and inside casing back in place, put
back the storm window, prime and paint, and you are ready, as I
said before, for another 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   This type of work is easiest with the old-fashioned windows. The
new ones are more tightly constructed, even with glue, making
replacement much fussier. But one benefit is that if such a window
is less than 20 years old, you might get the manufacturer to give
you a new one.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Split threshold, too
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another decay problem: the outside threshold
of a door.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it is not usually decay that is the problem, but a
split. The split usually occurs when the overhang of the threshold
is more than 1 1/2 inches; when weight is put on it it will split,
eventually. Usually there is a trim board under the overhang,
reducing that overhang to an inch or less.
</P>
<P>
   To fix the split, fill the joint with construction adhesive and
press the pieces back tightly, clamping them overnight. Or, tighten
the two pieces together with large stainless steel or solid brass
screws.
</P>
<P>
   If you cannot reduce that overly-wide overhang, you can drill
holes in the edge of the threshold and insert large stainless steel
or galvanized bolts. This will reinforce the threshold, resisting
movement when it is stepped on.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a way without replacing the whole shebang.

PAINTERS LEFT A STICKY MESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. When the painters did the interior of my house, they painted
boiled linseed oil on several oiled finishes. Trouble is, the oil
was sticky, and still is. How can I get it to dry?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD BURNS, Hudson, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oil will stay sticky if a lot is allowed to sit on a surface.
The painters did you no favors; they also should have known better.
The only cure is to remove the oil with chemical paint remover (it
will act very fast), then wash with paint thinner. To redo the
finish, which will be bereft of oil, you can simply apply more
boiled linseed oil, but, after letting it sit for 15 minutes, rub
it with your hands and then wipe it all off with a dry cloth.
Dispose of oily cloths safely by burning them; left lying around,
they can spontaneously combust. The nice thing about an oiled
finish is that oil can be applied, rubbed, and removed at any time
you feel like it. But it always has to be wiped dry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am buying a 20-year-old antique reproduction house in
Hopkinton. There are a lot of exposed beams that have been stained,
and wide, pine floorboards. Nothing has been cleaned in 20 years.
How can I clean those beams and floors?
</P>
<P>
   JODY YOCHER, Marlborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Give the beams a lick and a promise by feather dusting; they
need no more cleaning than that. And they need no more finishing,
either. There is no reason on earth to finish them.
</P>
<P>
   As for the floors, let's hope they have been varnished. If so,
dry mopping or vacuuming is enough cleaning needed. Or, in an
extreme case, clean the floors with paint thinner, then polish with
a dry cloth to restore gloss. Or, clean the floors with Spic and
Span and water, but go easy with water on a wood floor. This
solution will also dull the finish, which can be restored, as
above, by polishing with a dry cloth.
</P>
<P>
   If the floors have not been varnished or finished in any way,
good luck to you. They cannot be cleaned except with paint thinner,
and at that, not very well. Ground-in dirt must be removed by
sanding the floors. And if you sand them, then for goodness sake,
have them varnished. Do not wax them.
</P>
<P>
   Unfinished floors may be authentic Colonial, which made sense in
1699, but they don't make sense in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The deck in my small condo rotted out fairly quickly. I have
heard of Trex as a substitute for a wood deck, commonly used in St.
Thomas. Would that be acceptable? Or could I use mahogany?
</P>
<P>
   SHEILA CLINTON, St. Thomas, V.I.
</P>
<P>
   A. Trex is relatively new, and therefore has no track record,
but the idea is good, mixing ground-up wood with reprocessed saran
and other polyethylene products. It is good for deck boards, not
structural parts, and will weather to a silver gray, although some
come in a brown color. I think it's worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   Mahogany boards are OK, too, because mahogany resists decay. But
the mahogany boards should be installed properly. Before putting on
the boards, place a 6-inch-wide strip of roofing felt along the
full length of each joist. Fold the edges down so they form a
watershed; when water falls on them, it will run down the edges and
harmlessly away. Now you can attach the mahogany boards, spacing
them 1/4 to 3/8 inch apart, to allow proper water drainage. This is
the old-fashioned way of building a deck, commonly done before the
invention of pressure-treated wood. It works.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is there something wrong with the flashing on my roof around
the chimney? When I am in the attic, I can see daylight through the
flashing by the chimney. There are no leaks, even when it rains,
but I was just wondering.
</P>
<P>
   PERRY WONG, West Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I guess it is a matter of: It's not broke, so you don't have
to fix it. But it is a bit discombobulating to see daylight through
your roof. Flashing around a chimney is often laid directly on top
of the roof shingles, and if it is not caulked or secured with
roofing cement and nails, it may lift a little to allow daylight to
enter the attic, but not to leak. It might leak in a heavy,
wind-blown rain, but until it does, I'd sit tight. You might get
the same answer from a roofer.
</P>
<P>
   If the roof is more than 25 to 30 years old and made of asphalt
shingles, consider a new roof, because you are due one. When you
have a new roof installed, the roofers can secure that flashing,
making you and the handyman feel better.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for an 18-foot-wide wood garage door to replace
one that did not stand up very well. The old door is flush, not
paneled, and I prefer a new one of the same style. The vendors seem
to be pushing steel doors, which might be OK except that I want to
paint the door to match the house, and some of the vendors have a
25-year-warrantee that would be negated if I painted. Any ideas?
</P>
<P>
   WAYNE HALL, Sudbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Not really, although if the old wood door did not stand up
that well, then a steel door is the way to go. As the vendors said,
steel is lighter than wood and a primed finish can be painted. If
you opt for the one with a 25-year warrantee (pretty good for a
painted surface), I would live with the color. At least it won't be
olive drab, ``shartroozy,'' or pink.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My 26-year-old Solarian no-wax floor is finally giving up the
ghost, and I am getting a new one. The installers plan to put down
3/8-inch plywood over the old sheet material. Is that acceptable?
</P>
<P>
   CARL BURGESS, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, and it will save money, too. The only thing you have to
be alert to is where the raised floor meets another room, through a
door or doorway. A threshold or aluminum bead will take care of the
differences at doorways. An aluminum bead also can be set where the
raised floor meets an exterior door, although if the raised floor
goes above the exterior threshold, it is not easy to make the
transition.
</P>
<P>
   And, in another 26 years you (or someone else) can take the
whole thing out and start all over again.
</P>

 &HT;    
 By JOHN LLOYD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In November last year, unnamed CIA officials told The New York
Times that in 1995 they had compiled a large dossier on Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister. They sent the
material to Vice President Al Gore, co-chairman of the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, in which much of the
government-to-government business between the two countries was
handled.
 &HT;    It came back, said the officials, with what was described as ``a
barnyard epithet'' scrawled on it. The lesson they reportedly took
away was that evidence of high-level corruption was not wanted.
 &HT;    Thus, when they established that a German businessman had been
asked for $1 million to see Chernomyrdin, they did not circulate
the report.
 &HT;    But Chernomyrdin was for years a key interlocutor with Gore, the
man who seeks to prolong Democratic rule in the White House.
Dismissed by Boris Yeltsin as prime minister in March 1998,
Chernomyrdin is back now as president of Gazprom, the energy
monopoly he created and partially privatized and whose huge
revenues, vast holdings and large exemptions from taxes make it a
state within the Russian state.
 &HT;    Gore was deeply involved in Russian policy through the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which dealt with economic, security
and scientific issues. He was a strong advocate of more aid and
assistance to Russia, harshly criticizing the World Bank and IMF's
reluctance to lend. He exhorted American business to invest in the
country and lauded Chernomyrdin, whose personal fortune, held
abroad, is estimated by Russian security sources in the billions of
dollars _ an allegation he denies.
 &HT;    When this checkered record is eventually held up to the light
during a presidential campaign, Gore will have much to answer for.
Already, these issues are boiling up in political circles. U.S.
politicians such as Curt Weldon, a Republican representative from
Pennsylvania, now barrage the administration with questions and
criticisms on their handling of Russia.
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state. Billions of dollars
of aid have poured into its reforms. Bitter struggles have been
waged between Russia's free-market radicals and their Communist or
nationalist foes, most significantly in 1993, when armed struggle
broke out between the Parliament and Yeltsin. Great privations have
been visited on the country in the name of necessary sacrifice.
Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better?
 &HT;    Russians, free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their
nation has shrunk _ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by
the people. The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of
the state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year of its
freedom, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it grew, at best, by less
than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially nonexistent in Soviet
times, is now officially 12 percent and may really be 25 percent.
Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed. ``There was a debate
about institutions and infrastructure back in 1990,'' says Joseph
Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, whose earlier work
on imperfect information and markets has put him in line for a
Nobel prize.
 &HT;    ``I remember talking to a conference in Prague in 1991 on the
theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards
themselves?') in a situation of rapid privatization. There were
already differences between us then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation following his success in
breaking Bolivia's 24,000 percent inflation rate. In Warsaw in
1989, he explained market economics to the Solidarity activists
about to be thrust into power. That December, the first
post-Communist government was quailing before price liberalization.
 &HT;    Late at night in the office of Poland's finance minister, Sachs
had got on the phone and harangued American officials until they
promised to nudge the IMF into providing $1 billion in support for
the Polish currency. His myth as the economic liberator was born,
and with it a mechanism known as ``shock therapy.''
 &HT;    This was shorthand for a raft of measures _ price
liberalization, budget stabilization, a slashing of subsidies _
undertaken more or less simultaneously to ``shock'' the economy
into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery. The young reformers in
Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs and his mechanism their way
forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who ad worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    Sachs, on a leave of absence from Harvard, had installed himself
and his team in the Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large part
of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had been
embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall. Both men
proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and impatiently,
and Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed the IMF and the
World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to government as acting prime minister. But he needed
much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any other
Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy; however,
the release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with its effect
of wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough
_ without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state,
was to observe later, any therapy. The shock was such that by April
1992 the slender parliamentary majority the government commanded
for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has characterized
Russian reform ever since _ a guerrilla struggle with a hostile,
often violently hostile, legislature. The reformers had hoped that
the West would back them as soon as they took office. But it did
not. This, for many insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in. When South Korea ran into
difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six months. And what
did go in were loans that now have to be paid back or export
credits tied to goods from the country giving the credits. The
intellectual effort was not inadequate; no people were better
placed than the reformers to make the changes. The problem was the
financial scale.''
 &HT;    Here, at the very beginning of reform, is an early charge that
we lost Russia _ and it is made by the economic radicals, East and
West. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision; Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed for
this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with him and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War. The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it
wasn't going to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was
the Russians themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do,
the absence of a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the 1993 battle with Parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the Parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    ``The IMF should have shown more guts in resisting political
pressure,'' one official said. ``The big mistake was not realizing
soon enough that the reformers lacked the levers of power to do
what they had agreed and to keep on lending. We should have been
tougher.''
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say that this is the Russia we
have lost _ lost through our own actions and mistakes. Lost because
we pursued agendas that were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost
because we encouraged and supported precisely those men in the
government dacha, who were hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    Some of the people who are making these charges want the
critique to be part of the election campaign of George W. Bush. It
is already becoming one of the most charged foreign-policy debates
in America.
 &HT;    The case that we lost Russia begins with America's insistence on
exporting the free market to Russia and takes in everything up to
the NATO bombing of Serbia, an act that seems to have completed
Russia's retreat from Washington. The claim that we have lost
Russia, in short, is a proxy for Clintonite failure to reshape
Russia as an idealized America.
 &HT;    In Russia, the charge is that the New Russian reformers, abetted
by the West, have destroyed the country's economy while enriching
themselves. Many of those who make these charges (and who would
like to see those they judge guilty locked up) will be candidates
for the Duma (parliamentary) elections in December.
 &HT;    And this critique may well be a major plank in the platform of
one or more contenders for Yeltsin's mantle in the presidential
elections next July. At the end of a century in which Russia has
been raped by Bolsheviks, the country now seems to have been raped
by capitalists. The stakes in this debate are very high.
 &HT;    The main foreign-policy adviser to George W. Bush, Condoleezza
Rice, former provost of Stanford University, is pressing to make
the charge that the Clinton-Gore administration lost Russia a major
part of the presidential campaign.
 &HT;    Rice, who will shape Bush's policy and probe Gore's weak spots,
poses a special danger for the Democrats _ she has been an expert
on Russia for decades. Rice admits to the difficulty of the
transition from Soviet communism, that the fault lies largely with
the Russians. She also acknowledges the hazards of retrospective
wisdom.
 &HT;    ``When all that's said,'' she says, ``you are left with a policy
that leaned very far toward accepting the mere rhetoric of reform.
It didn't recognize how mercurial Yeltsin is. It didn't react to
the fact that an awful lot of money has been siphoned off. This
gave a false sense of security to the Russians. They felt that no
matter what reforms they didn't do, they would get the IMF money.
No matter what behavior they showed, they would get friendship. ...
What we now face in international politics is a Russia more
dangerous than it has been, because it is coming apart. And so one
must ask, given what we tried to do and hoped for in 1991, What
went wrong? How could it have happened? What is our
responsibility?''
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us. The NATO action in
Kosovo has produced a bitter reaction, the more so for emphasizing
to the Russians their relative weakness.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies _ as Rice advises _ would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration.'' Its re-entry into
the world is indeed a vast endeavor, he says, but one to which we
are if not central, not marginal either.
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation. Russia never was ours to lose. It must find
itself; until then, we can do little more than watch, offering an
occasional bit of encouragement from the sidelines.

 By JOHN LLOYD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    In November last year, unnamed CIA officials told The New York
Times that in 1995 they had compiled a large dossier on Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin, then the Russian prime minister. They sent the
material to Vice President Al Gore, co-chairman of the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, in which much of the
government-to-government business between the two countries was
handled.
 &HT;    It came back, said the officials, with what was described as ``a
barnyard epithet'' scrawled on it. The lesson they reportedly took
away was that evidence of high-level corruption was not wanted.
 &HT;    Thus, when they established that a German businessman had been
asked for $1 million to see Chernomyrdin, they did not circulate
the report.
 &HT;    But Chernomyrdin was for years a key interlocutor with Gore, the
man who seeks to prolong Democratic rule in the White House.
Dismissed by Boris Yeltsin as prime minister in March 1998,
Chernomyrdin is back now as president of Gazprom, the energy
monopoly he created and partially privatized and whose huge
revenues, vast holdings and large exemptions from taxes make it a
state within the Russian state.
 &HT;    Gore was deeply involved in Russian policy through the
Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission, which dealt with economic, security
and scientific issues. He was a strong advocate of more aid and
assistance to Russia, harshly criticizing the World Bank and IMF's
reluctance to lend. He exhorted American business to invest in the
country and lauded Chernomyrdin, whose personal fortune, held
abroad, is estimated by Russian security sources in the billions of
dollars _ an allegation he denies.
 &HT;    When this checkered record is eventually held up to the light
during a presidential campaign, Gore will have much to answer for.
Already, these issues are boiling up in political circles. U.S.
politicians such as Curt Weldon, a Republican representative from
Pennsylvania, now barrage the administration with questions and
criticisms on their handling of Russia.
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state. Billions of dollars
of aid have poured into its reforms. Bitter struggles have been
waged between Russia's free-market radicals and their Communist or
nationalist foes, most significantly in 1993, when armed struggle
broke out between the Parliament and Yeltsin. Great privations have
been visited on the country in the name of necessary sacrifice.
Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better?
 &HT;    Russians, free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their
nation has shrunk _ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by
the people. The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of
the state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year of its
freedom, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it grew, at best, by less
than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially nonexistent in Soviet
times, is now officially 12 percent and may really be 25 percent.
Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed. ``There was a debate
about institutions and infrastructure back in 1990,'' says Joseph
Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, whose earlier work
on imperfect information and markets has put him in line for a
Nobel prize.
 &HT;    ``I remember talking to a conference in Prague in 1991 on the
theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards
themselves?') in a situation of rapid privatization. There were
already differences between us then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation following his success in
breaking Bolivia's 24,000 percent inflation rate. In Warsaw in
1989, he explained market economics to the Solidarity activists
about to be thrust into power. That December, the first
post-Communist government was quailing before price liberalization.

Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs and his mechanism their way

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    You almost have to feel sorry for Bob Woodward. Yes, he is a
best-selling millionaire author who has been deified by Robert
Redford and satirized by ``Dick'' on-screen, but even millionaire
authors sometimes must cry all the way to the bank.
 &HT;    With each passing year, Woodward gets less respect. The reviews
of his books have become more dismissive, with this summer's best
seller, ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,''
even coming in for harsh criticism on the op-ed page of his own
newspaper, The Washington Post.
 &HT;    Woodward's previous book, an account of the Dole-Clinton race
titled ``The Choice,'' was deconstructed by Joan Didion as
``political pornography'' in The New York Review of Books. Other
critics routinely argue that while Woodward's facts almost always
hold up, they are spun and slanted by his sources or distorted by
you-are-there re-creations of ``actual'' dialogue that is as human
as the audioanimatronic presidents at Disney World.
 &HT;    Woodward's most hyped recent revelations _ Hillary Clinton
communing with Eleanor Roosevelt, Bill Clinton's anguish over his
daughter reading the Starr report _ are hardly smoking guns to
rival those with which he and Carl Bernstein nailed Richard Nixon
back in the heady era of ``All the President's Men'' a
quarter-century ago.
 &HT;    Yet a strong case can be made for Woodward's value as a
chronicler of the capital, and his newest book may be essential as
we navigate the post-Clinton age. If ``Shadow'' adds little to our
knowledge of the five presidents it purports to investigate, it
can't be topped as a comprehensive, up-to-date, inside look at the
Washington establishment.
 &HT;    It reveals the mind-set of the highest caste of Beltway
insiders, Woodward himself among them, who are increasingly
determined to rebel against the occupant of the White House, no
matter who it is. However unintentionally on Woodward's part,
``Shadow'' is itself a smoking gun of sorts, Exhibit A of the
arrogance of this clique.
 &HT;    The legacy it truly reveals is not that of Watergate but of
Monicagate. Woodward has codified the Great Disconnect of '98, in
which those hermetically sealed in the Beltway bubble expressed
daily shock and bafflement that the great unwashed did not follow
their moral example and political prognostications by guillotining
a president who had soiled his office.
 &HT;    More ominously, Woodward shows us that 1998 is no aberration.
Clinton and Starr may soon leave town, but the insular
establishment they leave behind is still on the warpath. It's this
establishment, not Watergate, that casts a shadow over future
tenants of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as the new century arrives.
 &HT;    As long as there has been a Washington, there has been a degree
of disconnect. But the disconnect went off the charts last year,
when polls showed an unvarying chasm between Washington's and the
rest of the country's perception of the Lewinsky scandal. As the
gap refused to narrow, the insiders repeatedly scolded ``the
American people'' for having sold their souls to a booming Dow
Jones average.
 &HT;    By fall Sally Quinn, the city's hostess with the mostest, was
driven to write a 3,500-word ``cri de coeur'' in The Post's Style
section that, while meant as a circle-the-wagons defense of her
crowd and its higher wisdom, came across to many as an indictment
of the masses handed down by a late-20th-century Marie Antoinette.
 &HT;    ``Shadow'' reads like an unofficial post-impeachment sequel to
Quinn's manifesto. Though purporting to write in a
just-the-facts-ma'am deadpan, Woodward takes the same high moral
tone as Quinn did, but, most revealingly, applies it to every
president since Nixon. An accurate alternative title for the book,
and an apt summation of the current Beltway insider mind-set, might
be ``All the Presidents Stink.''
 &HT;    Woodward's official thesis, culled from what he calls
overwhelming evidence, is that the ``five presidents after Nixon
didn't understand'' the lessons of Watergate _ the prime lesson
being, in his view, that they must ``release the facts, whatever
they are, as early and completely as possible'' about any
``questionable activity,'' preferably (one assumes) to Woodward
himself. In other words, all five presidents are liars.
 &HT;    But another lesson of Watergate, his book makes clear, is that
the Nixon scandal, having knocked the presidency off its pedestal,
liberated Woodward and his fellow insiders, many of whom had looked
the other way at John Kennedy's misbehavior, to note and decry all
presidential sins, whether private or public, major or minor.
 &HT;    In ``Shadow,'' Woodward enumerates every ``questionable
activity'' he can find in or near the executive branch since
Nixon's resignation, yet makes scant distinctions among them, from
the lawbreaking of Iran-contra to the carousing of John Tower. In
his Puritanical scheme, one size of crime or misdemeanor fits all.
It's the same lack of proportionality in assigning moral weight to
sins that put non-Washingtonians at odds with the Beltway
establishment last year.
 &HT;    Consider Woodward's treatment of poor Gerald Ford. Ford is
chastised for bringing into the White House ``a Congressional
lifestyle, which often included alcohol at lunch.'' Woodward
uncovers one scandalous occasion in Denver when the president
``skipped several dozen pages of his remarks because he had what
his aides called a few 'marts,' for martinis, before speaking.''
 &HT;    You'd think that Ford's skipping several dozen pages of luncheon
remarks would be a blessing for those in attendance, or at least
something less than an indictable offense. But in ``Shadow,'' it's
another cue for Woodward to seize the moral high ground and condemn
a benighted president Who Did Not Escape the Shadow of Watergate.
 &HT;    Similarly, the Carter administration becomes an excuse for
Woodward to rehash ancient charges of cocaine possession against
the White House aide Hamilton Jordan. Though Jordan was ultimately
cleared, he was not ``totally innocent'' after all _ for he ``liked
to drink beer and loved chasing women'' and ``did go to places like
... Studio 54,'' where other patrons might have behaved naughtily,
thereby making Jordan ``a magnet for allegations.'' Jordan, it
seems, is guilty by association with nightspots.
 &HT;    Under Woodward's moral tutelage, Jordan recants his past in
``Shadow,'' belatedly seeing the errors of his partying ways of two
decades ago. But Jordan's real problem back then, Woodward suggests
without irony, may have been partying with noninsiders. ``Shadow''
reports that Jordan ``stiffed the Washington establishment and its
dinner-party circuit with particular relish'' _ apparently a
hanging offense.
 &HT;    The punishment, Woodward reports, was a long 1977 article in The
Washington Post Style section ``about the strain between the
Carterites and Washington.'' In it, Jordan was cited for making a
risque remark to the wife of the Egyptian ambassador at the rare
establishment dinner party he did attend.
 &HT;    Though Woodward's research now reveals that ``five others at the
table, including the ambassador's wife'' denied the account, he
puts the crude, musty anecdote back into circulation anyway, since
the Post story was confirmed by a bona fide Washington insider at
the table, the ABC newsman Sam Donaldson, and written (the reader
learns in a footnote some 450 pages later) by Sally Quinn. Two
insiders apparently trump five eyewitnesses at a D.C. crime scene,
even if the alleged victim is among the majority pronouncing the
defendant innocent.
 &HT;    Woodward's treatment of George Bush is haughtier still. When the
former president writes a letter declining to give an interview for
``Shadow,'' Woodward responds with an attack more sustained, severe
and personal than any prompted by the substantive failings of the
Bush presidency _ condemning Bush for having ``never seemed to
reach a stage of peace, relaxation or happiness'' either when in
office or in ``the years afterward.''
 &HT;    Even if this is true, so what? It's a matter for a psychiatrist,
not a journalist. The real Bush scandal was his refusal to ratify
Woodward's self-importance.
 &HT;    Even as Woodward condescends to presidents, he has little but
praise for Washington insiders, many of them wealthy white lawyers
and often, it seems, his sources. Joseph Califano is ``a cool
Washington operator.'' Michael Deaver is ``a man of natural
kindness and good will.'' Lloyd Cutler is ``perhaps the most senior
and experienced fixture of the Washington legal establishment,''
while William Hundley is merely ``one of the most experienced
figures in the Washington legal establishment'' and Plato Cacheris
``the ultimate good old boy of the Washington legal fraternity.''
Jacob Stein is ``one of the lions of the Washington legal
establishment.''
 &HT;    Even David Kendall, not a Woodward favorite, is gratuitously
praised for his anomalous (by Washington-insider standards)
``genuine interest in culture, music and art.'' Abner Mikva, Gerald
Rafshoon, Bryce Harlow, Bob Bennett and the rest are all smarter
than the presidents they advised. They saw the disastrous scandals
coming (and knew just how to avert them) long before the clueless
chief executive of the moment wised up, invariably too late to
avoid being fitted for either a journalist's or an independent
counsel's noose.
 &HT;    From ``Shadow,'' it's evident that the country would be far
better off if it were run by these insiders directly from the Palm
_ as long as they don't have too many ``marts'' _ without the
intrusions of presidents, those bozo middlemen who gum up the
establishment's affairs. No post-Nixon president is worthy of the
job _ and most pre-Nixon presidents wouldn't measure up to
Woodward's absolute lie-free, alcohol-free, womanizing-free
standard either.
 &HT;    While Woodward's point of view may sound smug or elitist, the
Beltway establishment sees itself as patriotic, pious and selfless.
In an aside in ``Shadow,'' Woodward sermonizes that the
octogenarian Gerald Ford spends so much time on private jets and
playing golf that he has become woefully out of touch with
``millions in poverty, children hungry, the wrenching despair and
horror of life for many.'' (Woodward, apparently, is in touch with
these impoverished millions, though as yet his only non-Washington
book was about John Belushi, who flamed out amid the wrenching
despair of West Hollywood.)
 &HT;    Woodward might argue that the proof of his ``objectivity'' is
that he is equally contemptuous of presidents whether liberal or
conservative, Democratic or Republican. He's simply practicing
let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may investigative journalism and
exposing wrongdoing to light. But that's not quite the case
anymore.
 &HT;    Woodward has come a long way from Watergate, when he and
Bernstein were Washington outsiders who would fearlessly follow a
lead wherever it took them in the corridors of power. In
``Shadow,'' no previously unreported scandal of any weight is
exposed.
 &HT;    Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek correspondent and author of
``Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story,'' is who Woodward used to
be. A reading of his book in tandem with Woodward's reveals the
difference between an investigative reporter and an insider
protecting the Washington establishment. Isikoff produced many of
the bigger Monicagate revelations, and he challenges authority,
including The Washington Post, where he so annoyed his editors (as
Woodward and Bernstein once did) that they were glad to see him
jump ship to Newsweek.
 &HT;    Isikoff is also far more scrupulous about identifying sources
than Woodward is, and he at least asks himself circumspect
journalistic questions that no longer seem on Woodward's radar
screen (as they were during Watergate), such as ``What happens when
you become beholden to sources with an agenda?'' (The answer is
demonstrated by how ``Shadow'' burnishes Mike McCurry and others
seen more objectively in ``Uncovering Clinton.'')
 &HT;    When the Washington dinner-party values of a society gossip
columnist become interchangeable with those of political
journalism, political journalism can become a trivial and at times
toxic culture of cynicism and sycophancy. While there have always
been notable snobs in the higher reaches of the Washington media,
usually they were pundits, not self-proclaimed objective reporters
dealing in ``facts.''
 &HT;    The old rules of the game, already blurred, may have been
abandoned for keeps during the second term of the Clinton
administration, when there were more Washington reporters like
Woodward obscuring the line between reporting and punditry than
ever before _ starting with Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, who are
billed by ABC News as White House and congressional correspondents,
not as pundits.
 &HT;    There were also more Beltway insiders visible to the public than
ever before. This explosion of insiderdom had less to do with the
Clinton scandals than with the rapid expansion of the mass media at
the end of the 20th century, and their seemingly irresistible pull
for a Washington establishment that has thrown open its salon doors
to embrace the narcissistic rewards of celebrityhood.
 &HT;    In his promotional tour for ``Shadow,'' Woodward made it clear
that his crowd is by no means chastened by the Great Disconnect of
'98. In interviews with Larry King and Tim Russert, he has put the
next invading governor, George W. Bush, on notice that his refusal
to answer questions about any past misbehavior ``just doesn't
fly.'' Any hidden fact _ what if Bush has covered up a past of
drinking, drugs and making jokes about ambassador's wives? _ may
inspire a new scandal that will reveal the bad character of a
possible president.
 &HT;    If Bush and his rivals don't ``put out the truth,'' Woodward
warns, he just may have to ``put out a new volume of this book _
'Six presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,' or 'Seven presidents
and the Legacy of Watergate.'''
 &HT;    It's too early to tell if Al Gore, a Washington insider by
birth, whose father never dissed Woodward, will get this same
treatment, but either way the Disconnect isn't evaporating in
election year 2000. The struggle between Clinton and the capital's
establishment, explosive and finite as it seems, may in retrospect
have only been a particularly raucous battle in a protracted and
bitter war.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    You almost have to feel sorry for Bob Woodward. Yes, he is a
best-selling millionaire author who has been deified by Robert
Redford and satirized by ``Dick'' on-screen, but even millionaire
authors sometimes must cry all the way to the bank.
 &HT;    With each passing year, Woodward gets less respect. The reviews
of his books have become more dismissive, with this summer's best

 By NINA MUNK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It's a hot day in Palm Beach. A dark car with tinted windows
stops at a polished gate, and the driver leans toward the intercom:
``Mr. Despont has arrived,'' he announces. The gate slides open;
our car slowly moves up a long driveway made of 500,000 hand-set
pebbles.
 &HT;    It took a crew of eight men two and a half months to set those
pebbles. It took even longer for the pebbles to be gathered from a
beach along the Pacific coast of Mexico. The pebbles were then
sorted and bagged and trucked here.
 &HT;    Chosen because their natural color and texture compliment the
princely home we are approaching, the 500,000 pebbles were to be no
smaller in diameter than two inches, no bigger than four inches _
this by edict of the man who designed the driveway and accompanying
mansion, Thierry Despont.
 &HT;    As an immense limestone palace comes into view, Despont,
architect and raconteur extraordinaire, turns to me and says,
``Once you arrive here you step into your own world.''
 &HT;    Actually, the 21,000-square-foot limestone Palm Beach mansion is
meant to be the world of Sidney Kimmel, a man worth around $1
billion, take or leave a few tens of millions. Kimmel founded and
controls Jones Apparel Group, which, among other things, owns the
Nine West chain of shoe stores, the Todd Oldham trademark and the
license for Polo Jeans.
 &HT;    At the moment Kimmel is not home, or rather he is at one of his
other homes. Which is fine; there is only one person to lead you
through the place, and that person is Despont.
 &HT;    Despont's list of clients reads like the Forbes 400 list. After
all, other architects have rich clients too _ architects such as
Richard Meier and Robert A.M. Stern and Frank O. Gehry. But Despont
is not like other architects _ a point made by both detractors and
admirers.
 &HT;    ``Thierry designs houses that are an hommage to the client,''
says Martha Stewart, who seems awed by her friend Despont. ``To
some degree, Peter Marino does this too. Mark Hampton did it,
somewhat. But this guy does it like no one else. He's really
designing for a king.''
 &HT;    Fortunately for Despont, 51, there's no shortage today of
recently crowned kings. Bill Gates, for example, the co-founder of
Microsoft (net worth, about $95 billion); Millard (Mickey) Drexler,
CEO of Gap Inc. (net worth, $900 million); Leslie Wexner, founder
of the Limited (net worth, $2.8 billion); Calvin Klein, celebrity
fashion designer; Terry Semel, outgoing co-chairman of Warner
Brothers; Conrad Black, CEO of Hollinger, owner of The Chicago
Sun-Times, The Jerusalem Post and The London Daily Telegraph; Peter
Morton, founder of the Hard Rock Cafe. Every one of these men is a
Despont client.
 &HT;    Other big-name architects have developed styles that are easy to
recognize. Despont, on the other hand, has no discernible style. He
builds neo-Gothic manors and wood-shingle beach houses, Georgian
mansions and limestone villas _ whatever the barons and titans of
late-20th-century America fancy. What Despont is known for is
creating follies, fin-de-siecle exercises in excess, houses blown
up to outrageous proportions _ they sprawl from 20,000 to 60,000
square feet and cost perhaps $20 million to $50 million.
 &HT;    Architects are often paid 10 percent of a project's cost. Though
Despont receives a flat fee agreed on before a project begins, his
take is said to be higher _ say $4 million or $5 million on a $35
million project. ``I do not,'' he says proudly, with a French
accent that seems unaffected by 20 years in America, ''design
shelter.''
 &HT;    Like the Newport mansions built for Cornelius Vanderbilt and
Jacob Astor at the turn of the last century, Despont's homes
address a desire for permanence and recognition among those who
have just arrived _ that is to say, among the newly rich. These
houses are not simply status symbols, signs of conspicuous
consumption; they are bids for immortality, lies against time.
 &HT;    A canny therapist, Despont plays to the culture of narcissism.
When he insists that a house should not reflect its architect, he
is really saying that a house should reflect and flatter its
owners, as well-lighted mirrors do.
 &HT;    ``To be successful at my job, one must be very good at
understanding not only a client's needs, but also a client's dreams
and memories,'' he explained to me. ``One must know where the
client comes from and what they desire. Part of the craft is
learning to read people, to see things they are sure about, the
things they are unsure about; the things they don't convey
verbally, but express through their surroundings.''
 &HT;    Before starting a project, Despont visits his client's home,
meets the children, looks through the photo albums. All the while
he is taking mental notes, weighing the matter: Do they ski in
Aspen or in Gstaad? Do they collect Fernand Leger or Jasper Johns?
 &HT;    The architect Richard Hayden, of the big Manhattan firm Swanke
Hayden Connell, is one of Despont's dear friends. When asked to
name Despont's single greatest talent, Hayden replies without
hesitation, ``Thierry is one of the greatest storytellers I've ever
met.''
 &HT;    A Despont house is the story of its owner's life, real or
imagined. Black, the publishing baron for whom Despont built a
neo-Georgian mansion in Toronto, told me: ``Without being intrusive
or indiscreet, he makes an effort to understand the personality of
the client _ to make sure that whatever he designs for them is
distinctly adapted for them.''
 &HT;    Some of Despont's clients are clear about what they want from
their architect. Others haven't a clue; they expect Despont to
guide them. ``I said, 'I see a house centered on an atrium,'''
Kimmel recalled recently. ``'The only other request I have is a
dumbwaiter in my bedroom and a balcony where I can sunbathe in
privacy.''' Despont and his staff of 40 took it from there.
 &HT;    Unlike most architecture firms, the Office of Thierry W. Despont
Ltd. offers a full range of client services including the sort of
esthetic hand-holding commonly associated with interior decorators.
For Kimmel's limestone villa in Palm Beach, Despont and his staff
supervised construction, designed most of the furniture and bought
the china (four complete sets), glassware and cutlery.
 &HT;    They chose the linens, stocked the bars (indoor and outdoor),
created the gardens, had a security system installed, supplied fine
English soap for the bathrooms and even recruited the household's
major-domo _ a handsome, efficient steward from South Africa named
Gordon, whose many skills include the ability to make a delicious
cheesecake.
 &HT;    Time after time, the upholstered love seats in Kimmel's home
theater were adjusted _ a half-inch here and there _ until at last
they accommodated their owner's ample frame. Just before Kimmel
moved in, a Palm Beach florist was summoned by Despont, who told
him which vase, which flowers went where. Finally, the major-domo
received detailed manuals that anticipated household disasters: For
example, a falling coconut might chip the limestone wall.
 &HT;    In architectural circles there's a story about Despont: that he
won the contract to design Gates' home by teaching the billionaire
how to use a fish knife. The story is almost certainly apocryphal.
It does, however, suggest how Despont is perceived by many of his
peers _ not as an artist, but as a tutor to wealthy philistines. To
such observers, Despont's homes are vulgar anachronisms, out of
place, out of time, out of scale.
 &HT;    Two years ago, when the new Getty Museum, in Los Angeles, opened
to the public, critics were horrified by the marriage of Richard
Meier's stark modernism and Despont's bloated interiors. Robert
Hughes pronounced Despont's period rooms ``a flop.'' ``They are
pure Vegas kitsch,'' added Jed Perl in The New Republic.
 &HT;    ``I am not interested in debate,'' Despont says with disdain,
waving away the architectural elite. True, he is not one of the
world's great architects, but he also does not pretend to be.
Rather than appear in Architectural Record, his homes are profiled
by W and by Harper's Bazaar. ``There is much talent among
architects,'' he notes. ``But there is not always the discipline or
the business sense needed to run a successful practice.''
 &HT;    In the early 1980s, Despont built for Black a Georgian mansion
in Toronto, with a circular, two-story, 26-foot-high domed library
inspired by Palladio's Villa Rotonda. Black granted Despont access
to his social circle, seating him next to Princess Diana at one
party, and inviting him to the annual Hollinger dinners, where the
rich and powerful gather.
 &HT;    Adept at using a fish knife, Despont had no trouble fitting in.
Or spotting an untapped market. ``I looked around and said, Where
are the residential firms? Yes, Richard Meier was doing a few
houses. There was Bob Stern. But there was almost no firm dedicated
to residential projects,'' Despont recalls. ``It doesn't take a
rocket scientist to read the Forbes 400 list and to realize that
there are at least 400 people in America who can afford such
homes.''
 &HT;    Before long, Despont's list of clients (or patrons, as he likes
to call them) included John and Susan Gutfreund, Oscar de la Renta,
Calvin and Kelly Klein and so on.
 &HT;    Then came the project completed in 1992 for Leslie Wexner,
founder of the Limited (which owns or has spun off Henri Bendel,
Express, Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch and Victoria's Secret). For Wexner,
Despont constructed a 60,112-square-foot manse (three-quarters the
size of the White House) on 340 goodly acres three hours from
Cleveland.
 &HT;    One remarkable feature of the 50-room manor is the ballroom
floor, part of which, like a mammoth dumbwaiter, can be lowered to
the cellar, where servants may set the dining table before it's
raised into place.
 &HT;    This beautiful, absurd production marked the beginning of
Despont's current reign. And these days money alone will not buy
you access to him _ he can pick and choose his clients.
 &HT;    Recently, a very successful San Francisco financier considered
hiring Despont: ``I called Thierry and, in that French accent of
his, he says, 'Tell me, do you want to build an impooortante
house?' I understood right away that 'impooortante' was a proxy for
expensive. So I said, 'I don't know.' Then he asks me, 'What do you
dooo for a living?' And I thought, Wait a second, I'm thinking of
hiring him and he's interviewing me?'' Needless to say, they did
not work together.
 &HT;    ``With experience,'' Despont says, ``you can read if people are
going to be exciting and challenging and fun to work with. And the
ones who are not, I do not want to do a house with those people.''
Such haughtiness does not seem to harm Despont's business. On the
contrary, it appears to make him more desirable.
 &HT;    ``It's so unfair,'' cries an architect at one big New York firm.
``He's French, so, naturally, to these people, he's seductive.''
Another peer puts it more sharply. ``He's perfect for people who
have an inferiority complex and need to be acculturated,'' says
this New York architect _ who then proceeds to repeat to me the
myth of Gates and the fish knife.
 &HT;    ``I like to think I have reinvented the Palm Beach house,''
Despont announces, as we walk through the double entrance doors to
Kimmel's limestone palace. It's the comment of a man who is
thinking beyond the criticisms of the moment and dreaming, like his
clients, of immortality.
 &HT;    During the four years it took Despont to build the Palm Beach
mansion, Kimmel had his doubts. He worried that the house would be
too ostentatious. A man who rose from modest means, Kimmel has
never felt comfortable displaying his wealth. To quote Despont,
``He said, 'It's OK, Thierry, we'll finish it, then I'll sell it
and we'll start over.'''
 &HT;    In truth, selling the home would not be easy. The Palm Beach
Appraisal Department has placed a value of $20 million on Kimmel's
house, probably a little more than half of what was actually spent.
The land alone is worth $10 million.
 &HT;    ``We assess at market value,'' explains John Fable, a longtime
appraiser who works only oceanfront property. ``Nobody's going to
pay what he put into it because most of it isn't what anyone else
would want. It's a showplace.''
 &HT;    So far, only one of Despont's properties, a country manor built
in the early 1990s for the Canadian department-store heir George
Eaton, has been put on the market. According to the listing agent,
at $12 million, the 25,000-square-foot house is a steal; it could
never be duplicated for that price. Yet after seven months on the
market, it hasn't sold.
 &HT;    Despont wrinkles his nose at my vulgar questions about resale
value. ``My houses are not investments,'' he says, as if money was
somehow beneath him. ``They are investments in joie de vivre.''
 &HT;    Making our way carefully across the limestone floor of Kimmel's
palace, we enter the atrium, a vertiginous space 26 feet high. On
one side is the ocean; on the other side, a long pool is lined with
exquisite fragments of blue Murano glass. Looking out to the sea,
one is enchanted by the blue pool, the sculpture by Henry Moore,
the formal gardens and playing fountain.
 &HT;    On a beautiful evening last November, Despont invited Kimmel to
view the house, which had just been completed. Upon his arrival, a
butler, holding a simple sterling salver, offered him a flute of
Dom Perignon.
 &HT;    ``I was in shock,'' Kimmel recalls. ``It came out so much better
than I could ever have dreamed. I knew it would be good. I just
didn't know how good.''
 &HT;    He had never dared to imagine that such an edifice might be his.
That night, walking across the limestone floor into the atrium,
gazing out toward the ocean at sunset, Kimmel had tears in his
eyes. ``I'm the son of a cabdriver, a boy from the slums of
Philadelphia,'' he said. ``How did I get here?''

<P>
   In the world of automobiles and aficionados, there is a time for
fine-tuning, careful waxing, and detailing. And then there is a
time to clean the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we clean the trunk after our first four months on the
road. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --I just spent a long weekend in my first hybrid car, the Toyota
Prius. It had far more power than I expected, and watching the car,
via in-dash screen, constantly swap and share between gasoline and
battery power was truly a marvel. I was struck by how many folks,
particularly young people, knew what the car was everywhere I went.
I'll do more on hybrids a little farther down the road. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Does it strike anyone else out there that while one big trend
in the auto industry today is to fill many niches with many cars, a
parallel development is the quest for the ``Swiss Army knife'' of
cars _ that vehicle that is all things to everybody? BMW has made a
stab at it with its X5, an SUV that was developed on sports-car
tracks. Now I read that Porsche and Volkswagen have SUVs on the
board, and we can be sure these will both be performance-based cars
_ and comfortable and quiet, too. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Judging from reader interest, one of the most highly
anticipated cars coming our way will be the Honda S2000, the hot
little sports convertible that has been likened to a motorcycle,
with a redline of 8,900.
</P>
<P>
   --In the comeback department, there are reports that Karmann
Ghia may be on its way back, planting its body on the platform of
the front-wheel-drive New Beetle. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of the New Beetle: A guy at Volkswagen tells me
that within a couple of years we'll likely see a V-6,
all-wheel-drive, 200-plus-horsepower version. Enough to blow that
stupid daisy right out of the vase on the dash. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --There is an interesting development, in the day of run-flat
tires, over at Uniroyal, the tire people. Instead of worrying about
a tire that will run even while flat, they've come up with a tire _
the Tiger Paw with Nail Guard _ that resists small punctures. How'd
they do it? They put a sticky substance on the inside of the tire
that surrounds whatever small object pokes through _ a nail for
instance _ and keeps air from getting out. And if the offending
object pokes through and withdraws, the goop dribbles in to seal
the hole. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of hot convertible sports cars, I can't wait for
the next James Bond flick. Our agent will be driving the new BMW Z8
_ 0-60 in under five seconds, thrown there by a 400-horsepower
V-8. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Trends. You have to watch for them. One trend among pickup
trucks these days, of course, is fitting more people _ as in whole
families _ into them. Hence, the boom in four-door pickups. In some
cases, in order to put big cabs on pickups, it often means going
with a smaller bed in back. And that leads us to another trend:
extending the beds. Best idea along these lines I've seen is a rig
called the Bed X-Tender by a company named Plastech. It's a
lightweight, resin-based ``cage'' that encases the rear of the bed
after you drop the tailgate _ giving you another foot-and-a-half of
useable space. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Toyota RAV-4s and Honda CR-Vs are dominant in the small SUV
market, but reports are that Ford may be ready to jump in with a
small Sportute called the Escape. It may come as soon as 2001, and
it may cost as little as the low 20s. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --It had to be a bad day out there in Auburn Hills, Mich., when
Daimler-Chrysler had to announce the recall of 2.1 million minivans
not for one, not for two, but for three reasons. A total of 1.4
million 1991-93 Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Caravan, and
Plymouth Voyagers are being recalled because bolts on the liftgate
can loosen and the hatch then drops onto whomever has just opened
it. The same cars also need their wipers fixed because at least 111
drivers reported they simply stopped working in the middle of
rainstorms. And with water comes fire _ so 743,000 of the three
minivans from 1996 are being recalled because of lock-nut problems
on the fuel pump. Six fires so far. No injuries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --As if getting into the SUV market is not enough for the folks
at Volkswagen _ though I am starting to wonder just how many models
one company can crank out fresh at one time _ they are also said to
be considering producing a pickup truck. If they build one for
North America, let's hope they learn from Toyota's lessons with the
6-cylinder T100. Go Tundra-like and give us a V-8 from the start. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Ford Motor Co. says it is onto something with one option from
the 1999 model year: accelerator and brake pedals that can be
adjusted for shorter drivers. If you're short and have to push the
seat all the way forward _ and then sit on the front edge of the
seat itself _ this puts you in a most unsafe position: right up
against the steering column. With the new pedals, that's no longer
necessary. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --In the movie ``The Graduate,'' plastic was touted as the
product and career of the future. Well, the future finally seems to
be here. We're seeing more and more plastics in cars and trucks _
and why not? Cadillac likes the idea, and Automotive News reports
the company is looking for bids for plastic panels for its Evoq
luxury sports car. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --More from those folks at Volkswagen. Hey, a V-8 truck should
be no problem since they're already planning a luxury sedan with _
count 'em _ 12 cylinders. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Trying to get away from the confusion over GMC and Chevrolet
SUVs both tagged Suburban, GMC has renamed its rig. From now on, it
will be called the Yukon XL. If the latter half of that tag is a
reference to size, does that mean Ford should have called its new
big rig the Excursion XXXL? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, in the what's-a-human-life-worth? department,
this from an actuary, skydiver, and author of a study called ``How
Smart is Your Parachute: The Risks and Rewards of Hi-Tech Life
Insurance,'' which first appeared in a magazine called
Contingencies, published by the American Academy of Actuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Writes Gerry Smedinghoff, ``A total of $1.7 million in economic
resources are spent on air bags for each life saved. Seat belts are
11 times more cost effective at only $150,000 per life saved.''

</P>
<P>
   That's a chiasmus, pronounced ky-AZ-mus. Dr. Mardy Grothe is
trying to make chiasmus a household word, and he may succeed. As
Grothe points out, 20 years ago who knew what an oxymoron was?
These days a working knowledge of oxymorons (or oxymora) is what
you might call a mandatory option for anyone with an interest in
language.
</P>
<P>
   A chiasmus is a reversal of words, or phrases, or letters, or
sounds, or even numbers. Here's one from Mae West, who has left us
a number of memorable chiastic observations, ``It's not the men in
my life, it's the life in my men.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 8 years Grothe, a Burlington, Mass. psychologist,
has collected more than eight thousand examples of chiasmus. (One
could say chiasmi, although Grothe wouldn't, because he thinks the
plural form of the word is pretentious.) He has included several
hundred examples in a book, ``Never let a fool kiss you or a kiss
fool you,'' (Viking) a chiasmus he borrowed from comedian Joey
Adams.
</P>
<P>
   Why chiasmus? ``One of the reasons I'm so nuts about them is the
way they can encapsulate a ton of wisdom in very few words,'' said
Grothe from Green Bay, Wis., where he was conducting a seminar.
``Think of the Italian proverb, `Love makes time pass, time makes
love pass'.''
</P>
<P>
   Grothe came upon chiasmus by accident, while looking up the word
`circumlocution' in the dictionary. Then he began noticing examples
of chiasmus. First Nietzsche: ``. . . man one of God's blunders, or
is God one of man's blunders?'' Then Samuel Johnson: ``The two most
engaging powers of an author are to make new things familiar, and
familiar things new.''
</P>
<P>
   Researching chiasmus, he learned that it occurs in ancient
Sanskrit, Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Hebrew, and Chinese texts. The
Bible is full of chiasmus, Grothe said. Some biblical scholars
think it might have been a mnemonic device when stories were passed
orally. These days chiasmi are passed on the Internet. Grothe has a
website, www.chiasmus.com, ``the only site on the Web devoted to
bringing quotations into your life and life into your quotations.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiasmus has an infinity of faces. It may be witty, like this
quotation about Henry James, attributed to Mrs. Henry Adams: `It's
not that he `bites off more than he can chew,' but that he chews
more than he bites off.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiasmus may be wise, as in this, from Mark Twain, ``It is
better to deserve honors and not have them than to have them and
not deserve them.''
</P>
<P>
   And chiasmus can be pompous and boring, maybe especially when
it's meant to be instructive, like the old cliche made famous by
Joseph P. Kennedy /when he told reported he drilled the maxim into
his sons: ``When the going gets tough, the tough get going.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why President John F. Kennedy was something of a
chiasmaniac. He used the device ofen, to great effect. His most
famous chiasmatic moment occurred in his inaugural address: ``And
so my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you,
but what you can do for your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Grothe has a chapter on implied chiasmus, a term he invented.
It's an abbreviated form that plays on a well-known saying. Kermit
the Frog observing, ``Time's fun when you're having flies.'' Or
Oscar Wilde's witticism, ``Work is the curse of the drinking
classes.'' And Mae West, again, ``A hard man is good to find.''

   Iwent to the Farmers' Market last Saturday. I drove to our local
middle school, and there, in a grassy area in front of the playing
fields, was a scene out of the 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of healthy and pesticide-free produce, grown
locally and picked that morning in Amesbury, or Dracut, or
Tyngsborough. Ripe, red tomatoes and shiny, green zucchini were
stacked in their baskets. Leafy celery and ruffled heads of lettuce
lay beside silky ears of corn and dark purple eggplants. There were
fuzzy peaches, soft to the touch, and mottled cantaloupes, ready
for the kitchen knife. The garlic still had dirt clinging to its
paperlike shell, and masses of basil sent a delicious aroma into
the warm morning air.
</P>
<P>
   Everything was warm from the sun and ready to eat. The fruit
yielded beneath your fingertips. Each vegetable had the scent of
earth and sun and water, as if nature had made her crops this
sensual for the sole purpose of stimulating the human palate. The
food seemed to vibrate with promises of fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the produce, there were other treats. One stall sold
homemade soaps, another homemade fruit pies and individual plum
crisps. There was a stand that featured herbs for your garden and
edible plants, like marigolds, nasturtium and violas, to add to
salads. There was even catnip to bring home to your cat. You could
pick up fresh-pressed cider, flavored vinegars, fruit preserves,
hand-dipped candles, and honey, fashioned out of local flowers by
our own Marblehead honeybees. If you were hungry, you could nibble
on loaves of fresh-baked organic breads, then slake your thirst
with a fruit smoothie or a glass of cranberry lavender lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   I felt like I was in heaven, and I haven't even gotten to the
best part yet, the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I visit our Farmers' Market, I'm always reminded of how
very pleasant grocery shopping must have been years ago. Before the
introduction of supermarkets, marketplaces were the hub of the
universe, the best spot to meet friends and catch up on local news,
the perfect place to swap recipes and share concerns. Connecting
with a friend is almost impossible when the kid in your shopping
cart is whining for sugar cereal, but if your child is fully
occupied by the entertainers in the center of the market, who this
week happened to be a puppeteer, a folk singer, and a balloon
trickster, conversations blossom. I was delighted to see how many
families rolled up in bicycle caravans or walked the distance from
home, pushing strollers.
</P>
<P>
   No one was in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   There were folks near an awning, discussing the need to convert
the local coal-fired power plant to gas, signing petitions for the
governor, looking at information spread on a table by members of
Marblehead's Environmental Coalition. There were women near the
basil, swapping tips about how to make a pesto that would keep
fresh in the refrigerator for weeks. Others gathered around a local
chef demonstrating how to grill peaches in honey syrup. In a
half-hour I came across acquaintances I hadn't seen for ages,
colleagues I needed to confer with, and friends I was eager to see
again.
</P>
<P>
   I hated to leave.
</P>
<P>
   I was struck by how wholesome the environment was. There was no
candy or gum by the cashier to tempt young children whose diets
already had too much sugar in them. There were no emaciated models
on magazine covers ready to ambush overweight _ read size 10 _
shoppers by the checkout counter. I wasn't shivering from air
conditioning or trying to avoid rock-hard melons that always rot
before they get ripe. I didn't have to dodge my way through the
minefield of pesticide residues, genetic engineering, or flavorless
foods bred to travel well. The pleasure I felt at the Farmers'
Market was in stark contrast to the feeling of alienation I
experience zipping up and down chilly aisles of packaged foods.
</P>
<P>
   When Rosie, our friend from Mexico, was here visiting, I proudly
took her to a megasupermarket. As she had never traveled far from
her small hometown, I expected her to be impressed by all there was
to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place, it is very sad to me,'' she said, to my surprise.
``There is no real food here.''
</P>
<P>
   I know what she meant.
</P>

RAGE CRACKLES IN   POST-YUGOSLAV POWDER KEG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Admirably made but too grim to wholeheartedly
recommend, ``Cabaret Balkan'' is another in a long line of films
from the wreckage of Yugoslavia that try to artfully interpret the
political agony over there.
</P>
<P>
   Previously titled ``The Powder Keg,'' ``Balkan'' is certainly
theatrical enough to justify its new name, all the way down to
featuring a sardonic master-of-ceremonies character. The narrative
strategy is that Central European favorite, a roundelay. Only
instead of the usual romantic handoffs associated with the form,
this one is a circle of cruelty set in 1995 Belgrade. We follow a
variety of individuals through one long, ever-darkening night as
they threaten, browbeat, whine at and otherwise torment one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Dejan Dukovski's play, ``Bure Baruta,'' and directed
fluidly and unflinchingly by Goran Paskaljevic, the film presents a
crackling kaleidoscope of rage. Seems apt, and it's never presented
less than intelligently. Still, the whole depressing thing leaves
you wondering if, perhaps, it might have been more artistically
audacious to show a semblance of dignity or compassion surviving
amid the over-obvious hostility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone with any brains has left,'' an angry, chain-smoking
taxi driver (Nebojsa Glogovac) rants to a fare (Miki Manojlovic)
who indeed had brains but, for personal reasons we learn later, has
come back. ``Everything here kills.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, at the very least, brutalizes. A refugee kid's fender-bender
with an older man's prized Volkswagen leads to violence. Two
lifelong boxing buddies' confessions of intimate betrayals lead to
violence. A young bully terrorizes passengers on a bus with, that's
right, the threat of violence ...
</P>
<P>
   The film moves from character to character, vignette to
vignette, then rebounds on itself and on some people we've
previously met. Everybody has some kind of ax to grind, and women _
probably because they're easier targets _ get extra grief. You
could say this reflects the internecine animosity that's plagued
the Balkans for centuries. You could also say that films like
``Before the Rain'' have already worked out the same idea more
imaginatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cabaret Balkan'' has won scads of film festival awards, and if
that encourages Serbian filmmakers to critically analyze their
dysfunctional society, terrific. The irrationality and hate that
disrupts life in that part of Europe is an important subject,
eminently worthy of extended examination and artistic
interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us lucky enough to live in more cordial environments
should be grateful that ``Cabaret Balkan'' is as bad a taste of
that world as we'll likely be exposed to. Avoiding exposure to even
that small, safe package of anguish is perfectly understandable,
too. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The film: &LR;  ``Cabaret Balkan'' (R; violence, language, drug use,
nudity). &UR;  &QL; 
The stars: &LR;  Nebojsa Glogovac, Miki Manojlovic, Lazar Ristovski,
Mirjana Jokovic, Nebojsa Milovanovic. &UR;  &QL; 
Behind the scenes: &LR;  Directed by Goran Paskaljevic. Written by
Paskaljevic, Dejan Dukovski, Filip David and Zoran Andric, based on
Dukovski's play ``Bure Baruta.'' Produced by Paskaljevic and
Antoine de Clermont-Tonnerre. Released by Paramount Classics. &UR;  &QL; 
Running time: &LR;  One hour, 40 minutes. &UR;  &QL; 
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars &QL;

SWIFT ASSUMES A HIGHER PROFILE IN ROCKY PERIOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Another day, another media mob scene outside Governor
Paul Cellucci's office. And once again, Lieutenant Governor Jane
Swift was by Cellucci's side, smiling confidently before the
tangled microphones and glaring camera lights.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked about the effect of so much media scrutiny
on an administration reeling from a series of damaging headlines,
Swift was cheerily unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm using more lip liner these days,'' Swift cracked.
</P>
<P>
   But by all accounts Swift's role during a difficult period for
the administration has been more than cosmetic. Cellucci's allies
clearly have been happy with the image of a powerful woman by his
side at a time when men in state government seem to be behaving
badly. Yet they also say that Swift has been instrumental in
helping Cellucci steer the administration through difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   Swift, for instance, was a vacationing Cellucci's main contact
in Boston as the first real crisis of his administration unfolded
last week. She briefed Cellucci in Florida after Peter Blute,
executive director of the Massachusetts Port Authority, was found
to have chartered a party cruise on the state's tab.
</P>
<P>
   When Cellucci and Swift decided Blute must resign, it was Swift
who publicly delivered the news. Typically seen standing silently
by the governor's side, Swift had the public stage to herself. And
if Cellucci's absence was a potential embarassment, Swift's
resulting visibility was more than worth it, said some in the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a fortunate coincidence that the female
lieutenant governor was the public face on this crisis, given that
the crisis involved ill-behaving white middle-age men,'' said a
source close to Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when asked why he had decided not to return early from
his vacation, Cellucci said he felt his office was in good hands.
``Jane Swift was handling things very well here,'' he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Administration insiders say Cellucci and Swift have had a close
partnership since he chose her to be his running mate last year.
But until now Swift's influence had not been publicly visibile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because a number of these things were focused on the
governor's office, people got to see Jane Swift up close,'' said
the Senate minority leader, Brian P. Lees of East Longmeadow, who
served with Swift in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lees said he particularly was struck by Swift's composure under
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways they hadn't seen her in anything but a press
conference, or rolling out (the administration's) agenda,'' Lees
said. ``When you've got to react, that's when you see what the
mettle of someone really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Bill Weld was careful to give praise and credit to his
lieutenant governor, Cellucci, now Cellucci makes a clear effort to
promote Swift's role. In his recent vows to crack down on ethical
lapses in his administration, for instance, Cellucci repeatedly has
promised that ``Jane Swift and I will not tolerate'' the misuse of
public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't surprise me that she really started to publicly
emerge over the last couple of weeks,'' said state Senator Richard
R. Tisei, a Republican of Wakefield. ``But she's had immense
influence in every decision they've made since she became
lieutenant governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say the crisis may not be over, as questions have been
raised about other administration figures _ Economic Development
director Carolyn Boviard, Board of Higher Education chairman
Stephen Tocco, and Thomas Rogers, inspections chief for the
Department of Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Swift seems to be keeping her cool, if sometimes arch,
manner. In what aides called a reflection of her often tough and
demanding demeanor behind closed doors, she hasn't been shy about
showing candor in front of the press.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked her and Cellucci whether they wanted to
know for sure if Boviard had been having an affair, Swift tartly
replied, ``Not as much as you guys, apparently.''

DUDLEY DO-RIGHT IS, WELL, A DUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _``Dudley Do-Right'' was not done right.
</P>
<P>
   Practically mirthless _ even on the minimal terms of movies
designed to amuse the most undemanding 5-year-old _ it's an
unengaged, live-action remake of Jay Ward's least-inspired animated
series.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the old TV cartoon was ``Seinfeld'' quality compared to
this labored farce.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser, who did pretty well in another Ward-inspired kid
comedy, ``George of the Jungle,'' a few years back, should have
been able to work some of his natural Canadian doofishness into a
winning Dudley. But as in the recent ``Blast From the Past,'' he's
undone by director Hugh Wilson's clumsy script, only much more so.
Wilson's idea of funny Mountie schtick involves falling out of
falling chairs, getting hit in the head by loose floorboards and
riding horses backward.
</P>
<P>
   We're not even talking variations on these ancient slapstick
chestnuts; just repetitions of the same dumb gags over and over and
over again.
</P>
<P>
   Set somewhere in the contemporary Canadian Northwest _ although
Snidley Whiplash, played broader than a range of Rockies by the
usually reliable Alfred Molina, still wears the black stovepipe and
handlebar moustache of a Victorian villain _ the story has
something to do with a fake gold rush that, of course, leads to an
influx of greedy Americans.
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of Snidley's insidious plan to make a killing
selling souvenirs and destroy dim Dudley's crime-fighting career.
The prospecting tourists' dollars make Whiplash a hero to the
cash-hungry Ottawa government, while straight-arrow Dudley has to
learn how to, well, do wrong in order to beat the bad guy at his
own game.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica Parker (cable's ``Sex and the City'') plays Nell
Fenwick, who's been reimagined from a traditional
damsel-in-distress into a kind of lighthearted gold digger, happy
to shift her affections from Dudley to Snidley and back again,
depending on which guy seems to be winning. Eric Idle, still as far
away from the Monty Python glory days as he was in ``An Alan
Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn,'' plays an alcoholic miner who
becomes Dudley's spiritual guide to the slightly dark side.
</P>
<P>
   True to the original, the horse, Horse, remains smarter than any
of the people. He blows raspberries at the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this should've been funny. But the timing is so off and
the presentation so unimaginative that none of it connects. Kids
did seem to start laughing once somebody got hit in the crotch, but
that was already halfway into this short-yet-interminable comedy's
running time. Too late. And do we even need to mention, too little?
</P>
<P>
   Local Indians who sound like they're from Brooklyn get a few
laughs out of a ``Riverdance''-style production number. Other than
that, the uniforms are spiffy. I can only advise you to save your
money for next year's ``Rocky and Bullwinkle'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, a new, animated ``Fractured Fairy Tale''
comes with ``Dudley.'' It involves a conniving fox (called Phox), a
village idiot and a treasure chest. Though written by Ward
collaborator Bill Scott, it's not up to the '60s moose-and-squirrel
show's standards of wit and wordplay, either. It is, however,
incalculably funnier than the movie it precedes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;

WEB-BASED CALENDARS OFFER FREEDOM, WITH RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; I was planning my vacation to Silicon Valley _ where every
billboard along the highway advertises another dot-com company _
and I thought it might be fun to have dinner with my old friend
David. So I called him up and we set a time and place.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later I discovered I had e-mail from David _ or
rather, from David's Calendar. It was a bright blue-and-white
invitation, telling me that my appointment with David had been
confirmed. Near the top was a little button with the words ``add to
my calendar.'' And at the bottom was an advertisement for Yahoo
Calendar: ``Do You Yahoo?''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Calendar is a free Web-based scheduling system. It's
designed to replace both those old-style paper-and-ink appointment
books and calendar programs such as Microsoft's Outlook Express
that run on PCs. To view your calendar, you just point your browser
at http://calendar.yahoo.com/ and type in your Yahoo username and
password. (If you don't have an account, Yahoo will create one for
you.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you are there, you can type in your appointments and
meetings. Once you have set it up, you can view your daily, weekly,
or monthly calendar just like a day timer. Yahoo can automatically
send you e-mail before your appointments. And, as I discovered, it
can notify your friends of an impending rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its calendar, Yahoo also has a Web-based address book.
In fact, the two work together: It's easy to schedule an
appointment with somebody in your address book. And both of these
services operate with Yahoo Mail, the company's Web-based e-mail
system.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Calendar is just one of several Web-based personal
information services springing up on the Internet. Another one is
AnyDay.com. Within a few months you're likely to find calendar and
address book services at your favorite Internet portal, including
Excite, AltaVista, and others. Best of all, they are all free, paid
for by advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of these Web-based services is that they are
everywhere the Web is. No matter where you are, if you can access
the Net, you can see your calendar. If you don't live the tethered
life, you can print out your calendar and carry it with you. And
most of them can synchronize with palm-top organizers such as the
3Com Palm Pilot and machines based on Microsoft's Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that these services store all of your personal
information somewhere else can be a potential problem as well. You
don't control your data: The calendar provider does. And these
companies can do whatever they want with your information.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, few on-line calendar companies are doing much to mine
the personal information stored on their computers. When you
register for Yahoo Calendar, the company asks for your real name,
your age, sex, marital status, occupation, and interests. Yahoo
runs fancy statistics on this information and gives the summary
results to advertisers _ the people who are picking up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Right now advertisers might be satisfied knowing some percentage
of Yahoo's users are unmarried geeks in their 30s. But who knows
what will happen in the future. Someday you might schedule dinner
at Bob's Pizza and, a few minutes later, get a coupon suggesting
you change your plans and eat at Joe's.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yahoo and the other calendar companies all have
privacy policies that promise to keep your personal information
private _ well, more or less. If you actually read these policies
you'll find they are filled with wishy-washy words and, in any
case, are subject to change at any time. No law protects your
personal information stored on these services. And, to date,
on-line companies have a pretty poor record when it comes to
protecting private information _ especially in the face of a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, Yahoo was sued by Raytheon,
which wanted the names of people who had been participating in a
Yahoo chat group. Yahoo caved in and coughed up the names, after
which the suit was dropped. There is a lesson here: When you store
your information on another company's computers, you are trusting
that company's legal department to defend your privacy. The problem
for Web users is that Yahoo's legal department works for Yahoo, not
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Put your data into Yahoo Calendar and you are also trusting the
company will weed out any rogue employees who might violate the
company's privacy policy and sell your information. And the threat
of rogue employees is very real. Over the past decade the Internal
Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration, and even MCI
have had problems with employees selling personal information. It
is unreasonable to assume that companies such as Yahoo and AnyDay
will be free from similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is encryption, or rather, the lack thereof. None
of these on-line services uses encryption to scramble the data sent
over the Internet. This means your password can easily be sniffed
by a hacker, who might then go into your calendar and change your
information.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I suspect more and more people will minimize the
potential for abuse and start keeping their calendar on the Web. I
would like to use these services myself. Sadly, I'm just not that
trusting.

 MAC'S iBOOK CAUGHT IN A BATTLE OF THE SEXES  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The new curvy, colorful Apple laptop has ignited
a brushfire in the battle of the sexes, with an on-line male
columnist calling it ``girly'' and female scribes returning fire
with depth charges of chauvinistic piggery.
</P>
<P>
   It's a controversy that, at its heart, touches on the rocky
reaction of the male-dominated tech world to the invasion of, well,
the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking off the dispute: John C. Dvorak, the acerbic technology
pundit for PC Magazine, who declared earlier this month that the
iBook, the portable version of Apple's best-selling iMac computer,
was a ``girly machine.''
</P>
<P>
   In his on-line article entitled ``The iBook Disaster,'' Dvorak
wrote: ``You expect to see lipstick, rouge and a tray of eye shadow
inside when you open it up. ... No male in his right mind will be
seen in public with this notebook.''
</P>
<P>
   This tirade inspired a counter-rant from Janelle Brown in Salon,
the San Francisco-based Internet magazine. In ``The Barbie
Fixation,'' Brown argued that Dvorak's declaration was ``chock-full
of sexist stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the assumption that girls don't really use computers
and that, therefore, all computers should be designed to appeal to
men first and foremost,'' she wrote. ``Then there's the notion that
`girl' equals makeup and Barbie. And finally, we're reminded that
no man would want to be associated with anything `girly' _ just to
carry around an object that some might find effeminate is an
`embarrassment.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dvorak has been hit with a blizzard of electronic mail, which
can best be summed up by one message: ``You're a sexist pig.''
</P>
<P>
   An on-line query following the column _ ``Would real men carry
an iBook?'' _ drew 280,000 responses, a record for Ziff-Davis,
publisher of Dvorak's column. A slim majority (53 percent to 46
percent) answered no _ a real man would not.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Apple is declining to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Slated to go on sale next month at a list price of $1,599, the
iBook is the second round in Apple's amazing consumer comeback
after the hit performance of its all-in-one iMac, credited with
making the once-ailing Cupertino computer maker a force again in
home computing.
</P>
<P>
   The iMac has been repeatedly hailed for its cutting-edge design,
which features a translucent skin and an array of candy-like
colors, including hues labeled tangerine and blueberry.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of its debut, no one raised the question of sex in
regard to its stylish looks. Other manufacturers have rushed to
make speakers, printers, mice and other accessories that continue
the whimsical iMac theme.
</P>
<P>
   But Dvorak's comments and the voluminous response to the on-line
query seem to indicate that the criteria for what some men are
willing to put on their desks and what they will tote in public
places are substantially different.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers, spurred by the iMac, have pushed the desktop
computer into new shapes and colors. Some manufacturers, like
Irvine-based eMachines, have been sued by Apple for making machines
that mirror the iMac's swoopy, bejeweled appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Until the iBook came on the scene, laptops have, for the most
part, hung on to their black, gray, boxy image _ the better,
apparently, to convey the machine's power and maybe a bit of
machine machismo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laptops are the last bastion of old computer design,'' said
Lowell Goss, creative director at Sunnyvale-based Frogdesign Inc.,
which has created sleek new exteriors for Packard Bell, NEC, Acer,
Micron and others. ``It's men designing computers for men with all
... hard edges and dark colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Now technology observers say the iBook heralds a changing role
in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use computers for everything from our art to our shopping
to our recreation,'' said Aliza Sherman, president of the New
York-based Cybergrrls Inc. a female-oriented Internet company. ``So
it's natural that we'd want machines that are more stylish, that
reflect more of an everyday lifestyle _ not just some hard office
work ethic.''
</P>
<P>
   That technological lifestyle, say experts, has given rise to the
softer, more colorful, even unisex, designs like the iBook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the Gap's pocket T-shirts and khakis,'' Goss said.
``It's unisex. It's design that's interesting to people, not just
to a specific sex.''

_SOME BRISK WALKING DOES A HEART GOOD  
 _HERE'S SOME HELP FOR HEART PATIENTS  
 _ASTHMA MEDICINES CAN DISRUPT ROUTINES  
 _WASHING HANDS CUTS CHILDRENS' SICK DAYS 
</HEADLINE>

 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
 
 Some brisk walking does a heart good  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brisk walking for as little as three hours a week can slash a
woman's heart attack risk by one-third, and moving up to five hours
a week cuts the risk by half, says a report from the Boston-based
Nurses' Health Study.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found that brisk walking (at least 3 miles per
hour) was as effective as 1 1/2 hours a week of aerobics, jogging,
or other vigorous exercise in cutting heart attack risk.
</P>
<P>
   Because heart attacks strike 439,000 US women a year, getting
sedentary women to do three hours of brisk walking a week could
improve public health, said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, professor of
medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and lead author of the
report in the current New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Manson said the findings in 72,488 women who were followed for
eight years represent the first large-scale study of the effects of
moderate exercise on heart disease risk among women. Studies
largely conducted among men have led to a US government
recommendation that everyone should do 30 minutes of moderately
intense activity _ brisk walking qualifies _ on most or all days of
the week to reduce the risk not only of heart attacks, but
diabetes, some forms of cancer, stroke, and osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Here's some help for heart patients
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although deaths from heart attacks have dropped sharply with
improved medical care, there continues to be a 60 to 80 percent
death rate among heart attack patients who develop cardiogenic
shock, when blood pressure drops and the heart beats weakly.
</P>
<P>
   One strategy aimed at reducing the toll is to perform emergency
coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty on such patients, with the
goal of opening blocked blood vessels and saving oxygen-starved
areas of heart muscle. A report in the New England Journal of
Medicine suggests that it does help, but not as significantly as
had been hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at 30 medical centers randomly chose heart attack
patients in cardiogenic shock for emergency surgery or standard
medical treatment. Thirty days later, there was little difference
in survival, but by six months there was modest advantage for those
who got the urgent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of the authors, led by Dr. Judith S. Hochman of
St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, is that emergency
surgery to open blood vessels ``should be strongly considered'' for
patients who develop cardiogenic shock.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Asthma medicines can disrupt routines
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although today's asthma drugs can usually control wheezing and
other symptoms of the widespread disease, they often have
troublesome side effects, including shakiness and jitteriness and
insomnia, especially in children.
</P>
<P>
   A survey finds that more than 60 percent of asthma patients
experience side effects, and up to one-third of adults and
one-quarter of children skip doses or use less medicine than
prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``While asthma medications offer relief when used, their effects
can disrupt the routine of the entire family,'' said Nancy Sander,
president of the Allergy and Asthma Network/Mothers of Asthmatics
Inc., whose membership was questioned for the survey. The article
said the findings highlight the need for new and better asthma
drugs, some of which are reaching the market or are in development.
</P>
<P>
   The results have been published in this month's issue of the
Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Washing hands cuts childrens' sick days
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Elementary schoolchildren who used a hand sanitizing product had
20 percent fewer sick days than those who didn't, according to a
study of about 6,000 children in four states.
</P>
<P>
   Hand washing prevents the spread of infections by killing germs
on the hands, but doing this many times a day is not practical. In
the study, sponsored by the makers of Purell, an alcohol-based
sanitizing product that requires no towels, the children were
instructed to use Purell several times a day.
</P>
<P>
   An official of the National Association of School Nurses said
the results ``are very promising'' for nurses, parents, teachers,
and students across the country.

ULTIMA INDULGES THE YEN FOR PRIME UNREAL ESTATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (itals)For sale: One dream tower, prime location. Comes with
pentagram, loom, spinning wheel, forge, anvil, and water trough.
Current bid, $1,009.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tower for sale on eBay would be a bargain by anyone's
estimation, except for the tiny little fact that it doesn't
actually exist. It's unreal estate, virtual property, a possession
acquired in the fantasy role-playing game, Ultima Online. As of
Aug. 19, there were 300 lots featuring Ultima property for sale on
the popular auction site, with bids ranging from $5 to an
astonishing $10,100.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing all that jaw-dropping about people paying to
play; folks routinely drop a sizeable chunk of change to walk the
links or to pull the bar at the slot machines. But the odd thing
here is that folks are dishing out cold cash to buy status and
power in a virtual world. Forget the down payment on the real
house: They want to occupy luxurious digs in a universe where they
pretend to be warriors and warlocks.
</P>
<P>
   In the best-selling Internet game, players assume characters who
hone professional skills to accumulate gold, acquire property, do a
little swashbuckling, and slay a monster or two. The game has more
than 130,000 active players, and the housing situation is getting
tight in Ultima fantasyland. Players have turned to eBay to buy and
sell towers, houses, and other virtual possessions; some portfolios
have traded for as much as $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a long cultural history of people paying to support an
obsession,'' says Jason Bell, producer of Ultima Online, which was
created by Origin Systems in Austin, Texas. ``The game is immensely
social, and it works the way real society does. You increase your
skills to buy a bigger house. It's not about being a winner; it's
about power and status.''
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of people trading in this unreal estate
market: folks who love the idea of the game but pay someone else to
do the hard work, and folks who don't mind doing the work and are
eager to trade it for someone else's money. Andrew Varga, for one,
loves to play; he just needs money to pay for his books when he
returns to the University of Guelph in Ontario this fall. The
Toronto native is currently selling two lots on eBay: He's offering
1 million units of gold (Ultima currency) for $400, and he's
selling a house full of stuff for $250.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured, `Why not?' '' says Varga. ``I stockpiled these
things, and I need money for college. I don't see anything wrong
with making a profit. I like the game, but the only reason I'm
doing this is to make money. I think it's pretty hilarious.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't the point of playing the game actually earning the
goods yourself? Isn't the act of playing supposed to be the fun
part? What's going on here? We live in a society in which we pay
others to make us thin, young, sexy, and healthy. Now it seems we
are also paying others to help us have good, old-fashioned (albeit
virtual) fun. And the phenomenon isn't limited to Ultima Online;
three speculators on eBay are selling portfolios on the Hollywood
Stock Exchange, a virtual market based on the ups and downs of the
film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the beginning of a virtual economy? We turned to Robert
Reich, former secretary of labor, to answer that one. ``This move
from an economy of three-dimensional objects to an economy of
intangible things is not surprising,'' he says during an interview
from his home on Cape Cod. ``But there is something else going on
as well. Some people are extremely rich, and they are willing to
spend their money on psychological or psychic thrills and comforts
which seem exceedingly frivolous to the rest of us who don't have
that kind of money. We are living in a new gilded age.''
</P>
<P>
   One man's obsession is another man's profit. Ultima players are
not only selling possessions; they're also hawking the skills
they've spent hours building in the game, which is an on-line
variation of Dungeons and Dragons. The more time you spend playing,
the more skills you gain. One sale on eBay featured the following
skills: tinkering and tailoring, stealthing and stealing, alchemy
and anatomy, poisoning and healing. The bidding had already reached
$1,750, and who knows? By the time the auction closes, maybe the
seller will sweeten the deal by throwing in a virtual bridge.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How do you determine value in the gilded age of Internet
auctions? Cyber artist Jeff Gates asked that question this summer
when he posted an unusual offering on eBay. ``Information is the
commodity of the new millennium,'' he wrote. ``What's stopping us
from selling our own information? And to the highest bidder! My
demographics are for sale! Find out what makes this almost
middle-age artist and bureaucrat tick!''
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who heads the new media initiative at the National Museum
of American Art at the Smithsonian, views his eBay experiment as a
kind of performance art. ``As an artist, I'm interested in the
value of art, and I also wanted to talk about the notion of
privacy,'' he says. Alas, his auction attracted plenty of
attention, but no one was interested in paying for his statistics.
Not to worry: He's going to print out his original auction page and
turn it into a fine art print. And then he'll try to sell that. You
never know: It might be the perfect thing to hang over the spinning
wheel in the virtual tower.

FOR D.C. MILLENNIUM, HOLLYWOOD PLANS AN EARLY DAWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Picture this: At the midnight moment of the new
millennium, the dark Washington sky may light up with a new dawn,
as hundreds of thousands of visitors gaze in awe at the
supernatural event.
</P>
<P>
   And who better to manipulate reality for entertainment purposes
than Hollywood, which is producing the extravaganza for the White
House-sponsored celebration?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an all-star lineup,'' said Paul McCarthy, executive
director of what is being called America's Millennium. ``No one
else has anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, a transplanted Bostonian, was recently tapped to
coordinate the event. As holder of what he calls ``the best job in
the world,'' McCarthy has the culture-lover's fantasy task of
lining up major talent from the worlds of music, art, science, and
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Local talent already has been snapped up, with former Boston
Pops director John Williams and Concord historian Doris Kearns
Goodwin at work on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the New Year's Eve event will be a film by Steven
Spielberg recounting the last thousand years in a tightly edited 17
minutes. President Clinton will narrate the film, and Kearns will
assist in its research.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Jones, who produced ``We are the World'' and other
popular songs and events, is also producing the Washington
celebration. A light and laser show is planned, including the
possibility of the simulated dawn. The Supremes and The Grateful
Dead will perform during the three days of festivities, McCarthy
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy Center's George Stevens is producing the event with
Jones, and Williams is writing the score for the Spielberg film.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration, billed as a ``family event,'' will go from Dec.
31 through Jan. 2. All three days, educational events on the
National Mall will include performances and talks by artists,
writers, sports stars, and others, McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Smithsonian Institution museums and five outdoor pavilions
will each host four different shows a day, directed mostly at
children. The National Air and Space Museum, for example, will
feature appearances by astronauts, McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the celebration is on National Park Service property,
there will be a strict no-alcohol policy. ``It's a reflective
time,'' McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy insisted that America's Millennium is not trying to
compete with the drop of the ball in New York's Times Square, long
the most visible of New Year's Eve celebrations. New York's rowdy,
alcohol-enhanced street party is ``a totally different event'' that
``appeals to a different audience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other New Year's hawkers are not so diplomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, it was 10 degreees with wind chill in Times Square.
In Egypt, they were hitting golf balls and snorkeling in the Red
Sea,'' says a promotional Web site of The Millennium Society, a
self-described charity helping organize a New Year's event at the
Great Pyramids. ``Where would you rather be?''
</P>
<P>
   It may not be easy to compete with one of the Eight Wonders of
World, either. Egypt is planning to re-cap the Great Pyramid of
Cheops with a gold-plated tip, replacing one made of solid gold
that has suffered from erosion and chipping from gold thieves.
</P>
<P>
   Revelers in tuxedos and ballgowns will travel by camel to a
sandy viewing area to watch as the tip is unveiled and lit up at
midnight, said Abdul El Abyad, spokesman at the Egyptian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration ``is already booked, and we'll have a lot of New
Age people,'' Abyad said.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who insist on being first-of-the-millennium,
Singapore is planning an Antarctica expedition. Teams will travel
to the South Pole and climb Antarctica's highest peak, reaching the
top, it is hoped, on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The region of Southland, New Zealand, just minutes away from the
International Dateline, is encouraging couples to get married there
and have a chance at being the first to wed in the third
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Washington, fears about the Year 2000 computer bug are a
consideration for the celebration, the New Year's organizers say,
since it wouldn't do to have the entire light-and-movie show shut
off at midnight because of a glitch.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the celebration organizers have it all under
control, having met early with the local electric company to be
sure it is Y2K-compatible. It is, McCarhty said.
</P>
<P>
   But just to be extra sure, the event will be powered by
generators. ``A lot of what's happening out there, with the Y2K
paranoia, is unfounded,'' McCarthy said.

BEWARE MEN WITH BLACK BAGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon, every well-dressed hoodlum may be carrying a laptop
computer. It may be the only way to keep their criminal enterprises
safe from the scrutiny of Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   By now you've heard that the Clinton admininstration wants
Congress to grant federal law enforcement agents the power to break
into the homes and businesses of criminal suspects and plant
digital bugs in their computers. These devices would bypass
encryption programs that can be used to scramble data. As a result
of such ``black-bag jobs,'' the Feds would be able to acquire all
manner of useful evidence that is presently beyond their reach.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-industry officials, members of Congress, and Internet
activists have denounced the idea. With good reason, they fret
about privacy, free speech, unreasonable searches and seizures, and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   My doubts were of a more technical nature. Can you really bug
somebody's computer without the user noticing? I mean, a room can't
tell you it's been bugged, but a computer will tell you quite a lot
about what it's doing, if you run the right kind of diagnostic
software.
</P>
<P>
   Say the government wants to read my encrypted e-mails. John
McCown, technical director for network security at ICSA Inc. in
Reston, Va., says agents could subtly alter my encryption software
to make messages much easier to crack. Suddenly, secret messages
become easy prey.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but to do that, the spies would have to change at least one
file on my computer. Couldn't I just run a search to see if any
files have been modified? You can do that with the Find feature in
Windows 95, and there are more sophisticated programs that will
check every sector of the disk for alterations. Run such a check
every day and I'm safe, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, says Bruce Schneier, inventor of the Blowfish encryption
algorithm and president of Counterpane Systems, a computer security
firm in Minneapolis. If the FBI got hold of your computer, they
could rig it so that none of these tests would work any more.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, snoops could alter the operating system so that it
no longer displays evidence of a tampered file. And if you try to
load a specialized disk-checking program, the tampered computer
could be set up to load its own phony version of the software
instead _ a version that would tell you all is well. Because the
computer's been compromised, you can't rely on any test results.
``The thing being modified can't check itself,'' Schneier said.
</P>
<P>
   The cops might not even need to enter your home. Richard Smith,
security expert and president of Phar Lap Software in Cambridge,
says some Internet software contains security holes that'll let
skilled programmers install software on distant computers, without
the user knowing. ``The feds can try that first,'' says Smith,
``and then in a couple of days, if that doesn't work, try a
break-in.''
</P>
<P>
   And as long as the federal agents are in your house, why should
they stop at altering your software? They've got the entire
computer to play with. ``You could insert devices that would attach
to the motherboard, that the software wouldn't even see,'' says
Phil Zimmermann, inventor of the legendary Pretty Good Privacy
encryption program.
</P>
<P>
   A spy could insert a gadget that would keep a record of every
button you push on the keyboard. The data could be transmitted over
a wiretap, or squirted over the Internet the next time you log on.
Or the device could simply record your typing for later retrieval
by the black-bag squad. ``It would work all too well,'' says
Zimmermann.
</P>
<P>
   There is an upside to all this. The Clinton administration has
previously sought to stop everybody from using high-quality
encryption software. At least the new plan targets suspected
criminals, and in theory leaves the rest of us alone. Federal
judges would have to sign off on the break-ins, just as they do
with phone wiretaps. The feds seem to have been fairly responsible
in their use of phone-tapping, so there's reason to hope that
they'd show the same restraint with our computers.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, you might want to start using a ThinkPad or
PowerBook as the nerve center of your criminal empire. Carry it
with you when you leave the house, to frustrate visitors wearing
gloves and black sneakers. And remember what they used to say at
Apple Computer Inc.: Never trust a computer you can't lift.

CLEARING THE WAY FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANESBOROUGH, Mass. _ This fall, as the leafy countryside goes
flush with orange and crimson, a mighty tree-cutting machine will
set to work in the Berkshires, chewing through 26 acres of young
birch and aspen halfway up Mt. Greylock.
</P>
<P>
   The Brontosaurus, as the yellow machine is called, will leave
behind it a sea of twigs and sad-looking stumps. But it will not be
here to do the bidding of developers or timber lords. It will be on
a mission to protect rare birds, butterflies, and other native
species by recreating the meadowlands that once rolled over the
Massachusetts landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after more than a generation of ``save the trees''
campaigns, state scientists say, the program is bound to be a hard
sell. While state officials are launching a campaign to explain the
program, the sight of a machine gobbling up trees as tall as 30
feet and the messy-looking aftermath can jar hikers, birders, and
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very emotional attachment to trees. As soon as one
comes down, people have a real negative reaction,'' said John
Scanlon, a Division of Fisheries &AMP; Wildlife biologist. ``But we are
losing too much meadowland.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's vanishing meadows are vital to some threatened
species, and some that are on the state endangered list. Declining
animal or plant species, from the mourning warbler to a small wild
iris, could become even more rare without the meadows.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the state is a victim of its own success. For
decades it has pushed to reforest, and now, in some places, there
are too many trees and not enough open space.
</P>
<P>
   The state ultimately wants to see a Massachusetts landscape that
is 10 percent meadowland. Now, state lands in the Berkshires and
elsewhere hover at around 8 percent. On private lands the
percentage is much less, and the state is also now offering to help
landowners pay for reclaiming old meadows.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be the first time the state has cleared land for
environmental reasons. The machine has already been to work on the
Crane Wildlife Management area in Falmouth, clearing 94 acres of
pitch pine and red cedar to reclaim grassland. Workers have also
set fire to pine and spruce trees on Martha's Vineyard. The cutting
is going on in other parts of the state and officials want to
reclaim and maintain more meadows in the Berkshires and Central
Massachusetts if funding comes through with the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   While the machine cleared a few 40-acre swaths in the Berkshires
two years ago, most of the work has been done in more hidden places
like the Moran Wildlife Management Area in Windsor. It will make a
much more public entrance on Greylock's popular Jones' Nose, where
it will turn a young forest of abandoned apple, pear, and potato
farmland into home for fritillary butterflies and field sparrows.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the clear-cutting that has so upset environmentalists
in other parts of the country, the Brontosaurus does not cut every
single tree in its path. Biologists carefully spare some fruit- or
nut-bearing trees that might attract certain bird and animal
species. They also leave untouched some dead trees that contain
cavities where woodpeckers might nest or porcupines might den.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cut-everything'' mentality, said Tony Gola, a state
biologist who helps manage the Moran wildlife area, where the
Brontosaurus cut down an overgrown Christmas tree farm to make room
for blueberries and poverty grass.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Massachusetts' landscape has always been sculpted, first
by nature, then by man. In pre-settlement times, fires, disease and
weather would clear land, leading to a natural patchwork of
meadows, young forests, and old forests, each host to its own web
of life, its own insects, animals, birds and plants.
</P>
<P>
   Then the European settlers arrived. Red oak, white pine, and
hemlock were the first trees to be harvested for houses, furniture
and fuel. By the early 1800s, only 20 percent of land in
Massachusetts remained forested. By the late 1880s, with promises
of more fertile land out west, many farmers gave up on rocky
Massachusetts fields. A new forest of white pine and gray birch
took hold on those abandoned fields, but that too was harvested by
the early 1900s when Massachusetts began manufacturing shipping
containers.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, conservation efforts began in earnest, aided in part
by the Depression, which slowed timber production. But many of the
trees began growing at around the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have this very peculiar forest landscape because it's
rebounding from this big strange mass of agriculture disturbance,''
said David Kittredge, forest policy analyst at the Harvard Forest
in Harvard. ``We need to reshuffle the deck artificially to help
get the forest diversity species need.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials acknowledge that the idea of meadow creation
remains somewhat untested. They can fell the trees, but cannot be
sure whether enough birds like the Northern harrier will then take
advantage of the space to climb off the state endangered species
list. Officials will be monitoring the effects for at least the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   And although many hikers near Mt. Greylock last week said they
didn't want to see ``pristine'' trees cut, environmental officials
say that humans' touch has already made an indelible impression on
much of the nation's landscape. It is time, they say, to accept
this and act.
</P>
<P>
   Nature can no longer take its course, said Bill Rivers, a
forestry supervisor for the state Department of Environment
Management, in a state with 6 million people and with land that has
``felt the hand of man three or four times.''

SAN FRANCISCO SURVEY SAYS SMALL BUSINESS UNPREPARED FOR Y2K 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than one-third of small businesses in San
Francisco don't believe the much-hyped millennium bug will affect
them and are not preparing for Y2K, according to a survey by the
Mayor's Office of Small Business Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, 60 percent of 201 small-business owners in the city
surveyed were only vaguely familiar with or have no knowledge of
the issue, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have a problem,'' Mayor Willie Brown said Wednesday at
Club-i, an Internet cafe in the South of Market District.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem stems from the way computers recognize dates.
Many of them were not programmed to recognize dates beyond 1999
because only the final two digits were used to delineate years.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, when a computer's calendar rolls over from 99 to 00,
the machines may recognize the new date as 1900 rather than 2000,
causing some machines to malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that while the city government was moving toward
Y2K compliance, ``we are more concerned with the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was sponsored in part by the Microsoft Corp., the
Redmond, Wash.-based software giant, and CNET, the San
Francisco-based television and Internet company.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mark Leno, who helped produce the survey, said he was
unconcerned about having the study paid for by corporations that
could possibly benefit from Y2K panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always looking for more of these corporate sponsors,''
said Leno, although he later admitted there could be a conflict
with such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the survey, businesses with fewer than five
employees are least likely to know what Y2K is.
</P>
<P>
   Barely five months before the new year, slightly more than one
in three small businesses (36 percent) had no plans to become
compatible with the 2000 date change.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of business owners surveyed believed Y2K will
have no effect on their dealings with other businesses, clients or
customers, a finding the report labeled astonishing.

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ The protest camp perches on a rocky
hilltop next to the bullet-riddled hulk of an old tank. A Puerto
Rican flag snaps in the stiff August breeze, while far below waves
dapple the azure Caribbean in a panorama that tourists would gladly
pay to enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no tourists on this remote tip of Vieques, a small
island off Puerto Rico's eastern coast. The protestors here are
illegally occupying a U.S. Navy bombing range, determined to end
the decades of military activity they say has brought environmental
destruction and hampered economic development on their 20-mile-long
island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here because this is a form of oppression,'' said Pedro
Zenon, 21, a student who has camped on the remote target zone for
more than 100 days. ``We are tired of the Navy bossing us around.
It's time for all of our island to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides anxiously await the recommendation of a
Clinton-appointed panel probing use of the bombing range --
although there have been indications in recent days that the
report, which is due Tuesday(Aug. 31), may be delayed until at
least mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the battle over the Navy's 60-year presence on
Vieques, which the Navy considers essential for combat training,
has become a sore spot in the often-touchy field of U.S.-Puerto
Rico relations. In a rare show of unity, the island's normally
fractious political parties _ who argue endlessly over the
perennial question of statehood _ have joined hands in a call for
the Navy to leave Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Navy lives by an outdated philosophy,'' said Ruben
Berrios, a member of the Puerto Rican Senate and head of the
Independence Party, who also has logged more than 100 days in the
protest camp. ``They are still living in the image of (Gen.
Douglas) MacArthur the conqueror walking through the waves. That no
longer applies. We are fighting for the right to command our own
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue has dominated newspaper headlines in Puerto Rico all
summer, ever since a native-born security guard was killed by a
wayward bomb on Vieques in April. Protests in the capital of San
Juan have swelled with thousands of marchers.
</P>
<P>
   The tumult has crossed the Atlantic, too, stirring awareness in
the vibrant Puerto Rican communities in Florida, New York and New
Jersey. A large protest is planned in New York City next month, and
civil rights icon Jesse Jackson has joined the cause, recently
visiting Vieques to pledge support.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has even appeared on the radar screen of U.S.
presidential candidates, with former senator and Democratic hopeful
Bill Bradley calling the Navy's activities ``unacceptable'' during
a recent visit to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic frontrunner, also has
weighed in on the issue. He has appealed to President Bill Clinton
to look for alternatives that might end the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton _ perhaps mindful of the large Puerto Rican vote in New
York, where his wife is a likely U.S. Senate candidate _ has
already appointed a commission to investigate. The panel listened
to several days of angry testimony in visits to Puerto Rico and
Vieques, but, perhaps indicative of the situation's sensitivity,
may delay its recommendations well into next month.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy, meanwhile, has responded to the growing protests by
insisting the bombing range on Vieques is unique and irreplaceable,
the only spot in the Atlantic basin where it can conduct full-scale
war games complete with submarines, aircraft carriers, battleships,
landing craft and air power. Even U.S. NATO allies use the practice
range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just bombing for the sake of bombing,'' said Navy
spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Bob Garcia. ``We're asking our young men and
women to do very risky jobs, and we need to train them like they
are going to actually fight. Vieques is unique because it's the
only place in the U.S. that we can bring all of the elements of an
integrated battle group together for that training.''
</P>
<P>
   All war-making practice on the island has been suspended since
the security guard was killed, although the Navy is clearly eager
to resume its exercises.
</P>
<P>
   But the protestors are just as adamant. Puerto Rico's Attorney
General, Jose Fuentes Agostini, has hired the Atlanta law firm of
King and Spalding to prepare a lawsuit to block any efforts to
resume the bombing. The suit would be filed should the Clinton
commission recommend re-opening the Vieques range.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico was a much different place in the early 1940s when
the Navy opened its bombing range. After coming under U.S. control
in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the island remained
poverty-stricken for decades, with little political clout in the
U.S., even though its residents were considered American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   In the crisis-wracked early days of World War II, there was
little protest when the Navy condemned 22,000 of Vieques' 33,000
acres, moving small farmers and sugar cane workers off their land
to the island's center.
</P>
<P>
   But there was resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took my grandfather's land and house and paid him $30,''
said Rabames Trinidad, 46, a lifelong resident. ``They came through
with front-end loaders and took it all, scooping up his house and
dumping it on a little cleared spot where he was supposed to move.
He was never the same after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents soon grew accustomed to the sound of Navy planes
droning overhead, followed by the whump of exploding ordnance.
Houses shook and dust from the bombing sometimes filled the skies.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say many residents left, looking for work on Puerto Rico
or in the nearby Virgin Islands. But there were new Navy jobs for
locals as security guards, and there were new island residents _
lots of sailors _ who patronized local bars and restaurants,
creating new economic opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   With these opportunities, however, also came new tensions.
</P>
<P>
   Locals say the sailors sometimes ran wild on leave, carousing,
engaging in drunken brawls, even molesting island women. Although
the Navy long ago moved all but 25 of its personnel off the island,
the resentments still simmer. Even today, signs are posted on the
outskirts of the village of Esperanza, warning the military that
the area is off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the bombing,'' said Trinidad, recalling the
history of tension. ``It's all of this in the past, which we cannot
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Vieques isn't the U.S. military's only possession in Puerto
Rico: the island is also home to Roosevelt Roads Naval Station; the
Army's Fort Buchanan; a Naval security group; a Coast Guard air
station; and two Puerto Rican National Guard facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But while the rest of Puerto Rico has achieved a modest
prosperity in the past three decades, Vieques and its 9,300
residents are struggling to evolve into something more than a
military target range. While their 3.8 million neighbors on the
main island of Puerto Rico have attracted manufacturing firms and
built a bustling tourism industry, Vieques resembles the Caribbean
of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Small farms dot the island's central uplands, livestock
occasionally wandering into the narrow, winding roads. Fisherman
venture out daily from Esperanza, riding the choppy waves in
brightly-colored boats to dive or line-fish for grouper, snapper
and dolphin.
</P>
<P>
   Per-capita income is only $3,000 a year, less than half the
figure for the rest of Puerto Rico, and unemployment is nearly 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small but growing tourism industry, with several
guesthouses catering to tourists looking for an alternative to San
Juan's dizzy casinos and discos. A small General Electric plant
employs a few dozen workers, while a government-sponsored resort is
rising on the island's west side.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders want more, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that beach,'' said Jorge Adams, 44, a fisherman and
lifeguard, who recently chauffeured a visitor by boat around part
of the island. ``What big hotel chain wouldn't like to build there?
How many jobs would we have from that? But who wants to come here
and listen to bombs exploding?''
</P>
<P>
   But just getting the Navy to shut down the bombing range and
leave Vieques isn't the islanders' only concern. They also want the
sailors to clean up the environmental damage caused by the bombing
and to help jump-start the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental damage is clear _ years of bombing have
devastated the 900-acre target area. Shrapnel, debris, shell
casings and bomb parts litter the landscape, along with the rusty
remains of vehicles used as targets. There are likely unexploded
bombs, along with what the Navy admits is a small number of
armor-piercing bullets tipped with spent uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen claim the bombing has devastated their livelihood,
damaging the coral reefs that harbor fish and help spawn the marine
food-chain.
</P>
<P>
   There is an even more troubling claim.
</P>
<P>
   Vieques is saddled with Puerto Rico's highest rate of cancer _
27 percent greater than any other Puerto Rican town, according to
government statistics. Residents blame the bombing, and want
reparations for the illnesses. The U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances
and Disease Registry is looking into the allegations, although its
report may take many months to compile.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Vieques' residents wait patiently, enjoying the
temporary bombing halt, hoping it soon will be made permanent. If
the Navy refuses to leave, they vow the protest camps on the
bombing range _ already in place for more than three months _ will
grow. Any attempts to remove the protesters by force will only
bring more Navy opponents, they promise, along with a new round of
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has the last word,'' said fisherman Jose Anibal
Guerra, 54. ``I think he is going to tell them they have to go. If
he lets them stay, there will be more protests and fights. The Navy
has to leave Vieques. They have become our enemy.''

R.E.M. BACK ON THE ROAD WITH NEW CROP OF SUPPORT MUSICIANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With drummer Bill Berry now retired to his farm in Georgia, the
remaining core members of R.E.M. _ Peter Buck, Michael Stipe and
Mike Mills _ are back on the road with a new crop of support
musicians.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Berry on drums for the alternative-rock supergroup's
first U.S. tour since 1995 is Joey Waronker, a veteran of Beck's
band who played on R.E.M.'s current album, ``Up.''
</P>
<P>
   Filling in on keyboards, guitar and bass are Seattle musicians
Scott McCaughey of the Young Fresh Fellows and the Minus 5 and Ken
Stringfellow of the Posies. McCaughey is a veteran of past R.E.M.
tours.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we play together, it feels like a real band,'' Buck said
in a phone interview from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't feel like three guys and three session musicians.
That's probably because all three of these musicians have played in
real bands for years, as opposed to being studio cats.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck admitted the current lineup feels a little different from
the ``four-cornered powerhouse'' that for 17 years included Berry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like a different band. And that's really good in a
lot of ways,'' he said. ``For me, it's invigorating.''
</P>
<P>
   When the band's current album, ``Up,'' was released last fall,
Buck, Stipe and Mills decided not to tour until they had finished
other projects and fully adjusted to the departure of Berry, who
had also served as background singer, songwriter and occasional
bassist.
</P>
<P>
   Berry suffered a life-threatening fever in Germany in 1989 and a
brain hemorrhage in Switzerland in 1995. And unlike the others in
the band, he wasn't fond of touring.
</P>
<P>
   Before the start of the current tour, Buck, Stipe and Mills had
dinner with their former drummer at his Georgia farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to stress to everyone that he's really happy and
that he's not going on tour,'' Buck said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell that he's a little bit sad that it's all taking
place without him, but that was his choice. If he was going on tour
he'd be so flipped out.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest string of concert dates started in Lisbon, Portugal,
in late June. The U.S. leg, which began earlier this month in Los
Angeles, includes several shows this weekend in Atlanta, as well as
a concert Thursday night at 7 at Seattle's Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges the band faced in launching its
current tour was adapting the songs from ``Up'' to a live show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was challenging because the whole album features drum
machines and like 300 overdubs,'' Buck said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've managed to sort of simulate the sound of the record,
while making it more of a band experience. So some of the songs
that rock, kind of rock a little bit more. And the quiet songs are
maybe a bit more spare and introspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Each show includes at least 22 songs spanning the group's
career, which began in 1980 in the university town of Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a fair amount of stuff from our entire history as
a band,'' Buck said. ``There are good songs on each record and
there are songs that I don't ever want to hear again.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent show at the Greek Theater in Hollywood, R.E.M.'s set
included ``Crush With Eyeliner'' (from the album ``Monster''),
``Losing My Religion'' (from ``Out of Time''), ``It's the End of
the World As We Know It'' (from ``Document'') and ``Man on the
Moon'' (from ``Automatic for the People'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Man on the Moon,'' the group's catchy hit about the late
actor-comedian Andy Kaufman, is the title of an upcoming Jim Carrey
movie about Kaufman directed by Milos Forman.
</P>
<P>
   At the Greek Theater, Stipe dedicated the song to ``my friend
Milos.'' The group has also been playing ``Great Beyond,'' a new
song it wrote for the soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   When the tour wraps up in September, Buck will return home to
Seattle, where he lives with his wife and two young daughters. He
plans to work on another album for Tuatara, his side band, as well
as the next album for R.E.M.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been writing a lot of stuff for a new R.E.M. album,'' he
said. ``I've also demo'd about 10 songs and I've got another 10 or
15 that we're going to try to work on.
</P>
<P>
   ``So maybe we'll do a week of rehearsals in the fall and start
work in late winter or early spring on a new album.''
</P>
<P>
   After two decades as a member of R.E.M., Buck isn't sure what
the future will bring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got dates in my head when I figure I won't be in a rock
band anymore,'' he said. ``I don't want to be playing state fairs,
playing 25-year-old songs just because I need the applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if we make great records and we can still go out and play
wherever, maybe little theaters, I think that'd be great.''
</P>
<P>
   In concert, the band has been promoting its Web site _
www.remhq.com _ and making fun of its image as 40-ish rockers out
of touch with current music trends.
</P>
<P>
   But reviews of R.E.M.'s latest shows have been generally
positive, citing the band's renewed energy and enthusiasm for its
vast repertoire of uncompromising, lyrically brilliant songs.
</P>
<P>
   Buck finds the current emphasis in popular music on vocal
harmonies, choreography and big stage productions less than
inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved rock 'n' roll as a kid,'' Buck said. ``When a rock
band or a soul group would show up on `The Ed Sullivan Show,' it
would be like a breath of fresh air from the June Taylor Dancers
and the Broadway medleys and the lovable entertainer in the tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now we're at that point again. Every rapper has 40 people
in the band behind him. And the boy bands are so choreographed and
all the songs are written by other people. There doesn't seem to be
much of a stake in self-expression.''

`BETTER THAN CHOCOLATE' JUST A LITTLE TOO PRETTY TO FEEL TRUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the film ``Shakespeare In Love,'' Queen Elizabeth quips,
``They make (plays) either pretty, comical or about lust. But they
cannot make them true.'' Just when gay-themed films such as ``Edge
of Seventeen,'' ``Get Real'' and ``Trick'' take a step forward,
along comes a comedy from Canada that pushes things back a notch.
Sure, ``Better Than Chocolate'' winds ups on a positive note _
there are thankfully no suicides or murders _ but it's just a
little too pretty, comical and about lust to feel true.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just my own bias, but there's nothing more than that
first flush of sex that really propels this flat fairy tale
relationship comedy. The characterizations are caricatures and a
message about censorship is introduced but never developed _
eventually melting into mushy drivel.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would be nice to think real life is like this rosy-hued
glimpse at lesbian love and perfect parental approval. Why even the
violent punks who ultimately present a menace to the women in the
story seem like guys with whom you might be able to negotiate.
There's little to distinguish it from a hundred tepid formulaic
romances that have recently splattered the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   In director Anne Wheeler's (``The Sleep Room,'' ``The War
Between Us'') star-crossed romance, Maggie (Karen Dwyer) is 19 and
a lesbian. She's quit law school because she wants to write. She
has a job at a gay bookstore and frequently performs songs and
poems at a club called the ``Cat's Ass.'' She meets Kim (Christina
Cox), a young drifter and artist, and the pair fall head over heels
in lust.
</P>
<P>
   Only problem is Maggie's mom, Lila (Wendy Crewson), and her
little brother have decided to move in after yet another of mom's
messed-up marriages fail. Maggie hasn't come out yet and her
family's arrival sparks a roundelay of comic turns that result in a
little sexual rearrangement for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   There are the requisite supporting characters _ uptight lesbian
pal, transgendered singer, bisexual predator _ and by the end,
everyone has miraculously found love or the possibility of it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an attractive cast and an accomplished visual look, the
film is a structural mess. And there is a scene with mom and a sex
toy that is supposed to be empowering, but which drones on so long
it ultimately is only embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, ``mom'' is played by the terrific Wendy Crewson
(the ``first lady'' in ``Air Force One'') and she's endearing, down
to earth and the film's only complex character. But if you're
really hankering to see a great Canadian film about ``coming out,''
I'd recommend Patricia Rozema's ``When Night Is Falling,'' with its
more eloquently developed gay themes.
</P>
<P>
   Better Than Chocolate. Directed by Anne Wheeler. Written by
Peggy Thompson. Cast: Wendy Crewson, Karen Dwyer, Christina Cox,
Anne-Marie MacDonald, Peter Outerbridge. Trimark. 103 minutes.
Rated R for nudity, sexual content, language.

<P>
   WACO _ WASHINGTON _ The FBI document confirming that pyrotechnic
gas canisters were used at the Branch Davidian siege near Waco was
not prepared until 1996, after Attorney General Janet Reno had told
Congress she had no knowledge of their use there, an FBI spokesman
said Thursday. The statement comes amid calls for new congressional
hearings into the truthfulness of officials' statements about the
siege. Also Thursday, Reno said she was ``very, very frustrated''
about reports of government use of devices and pledged to ``get to
the bottom'' of the question. (Nesmith and Dart, Cox News Service).

   CENSUS-CHILDREN _ WASHINGTON _ School-age children were severely
undercounted in the 1990 census, and a similar failure in 2000
would mean that children would not receive billions of dollars in

Thursday. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 22.

<P>
   TAFT-BLACKS _ When black legislators criticized Gov. Bob Taft
last March for appointing few blacks to Cabinet and top staff
positions, Taft aides said the governor would continue to ``cast a
wide net'' looking for the best candidates. Five months later,
Taft's net remains filled mainly with white men. Of 251
appointments to his Cabinet, boards, commissions, judgeships and
other posts, Taft has appointed just 27 racial minorities,
including 21 blacks, according to records from the governor's
office. And only about one in four of Taft's appointees have been
women. ``I think it's an extremely poor start,'' said state Rep.
Ray Miller, D Columbus, first vice president of the Ohio
Legislative Black Caucus. ``I won't use the word pathetic. It's an
extremely poor start.'' (Wagner/Hershey, Dayton Daily News).

</P>
<P>
   CANES _ Forecasters say Hurricane Dennis is still a threat to
Georgia and the Carolinas, but it could miss the East Coast
entirely. Director Jerry Jarrell of the National Hurricane Center
says it's too early to say if a weather system coming across the
country will push Dennis out to sea. The hurricane, still with
maximum 75 mph winds, is moving toward the west-northwest at about
seven miles per hour. Hurricane warnings are being shifted to the
central and northwestern Bahamas. Florida is close to being out of
the woods but Floridians should still keep an eye on Dennis.
Tropical Storm Emily could eventually pose a greater threat to the

1997 brutalization of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima and the

million stadium project, which included redevelopment of an
industrial area in East Nashville, was finished two months ahead of

its Head Start day care program for migrant workers' children.
Ellison was stunned by his neighbors' angry response. Residents
staged a march against the facility. A few days later, Ellison
began receiving threatening letters and harassing phone calls.
Then, last month, his hay barn was set on fire. The FBI is
investigating. Some locals say it's unfair that immigrant children
would be given education privileges their own kids don't have and
speculation is rampant that Ellison may have burned his own barn to
make the town look bad. A look at the divided town. (Scruggs,

`DUDLEY DO-RIGHT' MOVIE IS ONE BIG DUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those of us weaned on the TV cartoon ``The Bullwinkle
Show,'' which ran from 1961-64 on NBC, this live-action big screen
version of the misadventures of accident-prone Canadian Mountie
Dudley Do-Right, is well, a big dud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' certainly labors to appeal to a more
sophisticated adult sensibility in an effort to please older as
well as younger audiences, but the cartoon series was far more
clever and really did pique young and old alike. Writer and
director Hugh Wilson says he wanted to update the film's characters
_ Dudley's (Brendan Fraser) true love, Nell Fenwick (Sarah Jessica
Parker), is tired of Dudley's do-right ways and finds herself
attracted to the dark and odious Snidely K. Whiplash (Alfred
Molina).
</P>
<P>
   It also pokes fun at such ``new'' institutions as dinner theater
and the popular Irish dance troupe, Riverdance. But the film is so
erratically written and directed and the acting so amateurish that
the attempts at current satire are dreadfully misgauged.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson may have hoped to achieve camp or cult status with this
awful reinterpretation of the adventures of Dudley, Nell, and their
childhood adversary Whiplash, but his script is tepid and even
resorts to a horse cutting wind for a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Dudley is stripped of his uniform because he's failed to see
that Snidely has devised a scheme to take over the town by faking a
gold rush. Dudley's peaceful province, Semi-Happy Valley, is

to move north in search of wealth, though all the supposed gold is

   It's up to Dudley to prevent a calamity and to regain Nell's

   Sure, Fraser scored points in his last joint outing with Wilson.
``Blast From The Past'' let the actor show off a little bit and to
engage in some music/dance prowess. But in ``Dudley Do-Right,''
he's embarrassingly out of step. It's glaringly obvious after
``George of the Jungle'' swung Fraser into the movie big leagues,
he hoped to score again by playing another dim-witted but honorable
animated hero.

<P>
   Films like this make us wonder why, for all the exalted
new-fangled, high-tech computer graphics and abilities, movies for
kids continue to yank from the past and in the process do a
disservice to it. After ``Dudley Do-Right ended, one young boy was
even heard to grumble, ``That was really stupid.''

 &HT;    Superstars don't faze Rockies` new reliever
 &HT;    By Andy Clendennen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER_ Mike Porzio didn't allow himself to be afraid.
</P>
<P>
   Although Porzio stands 6 feet, 3 inches and weighs more than 200
pounds, he knew if he looked to his right he would see a truly
awesome sight, one that would inevitably come into his field of
vision.
</P>
<P>
   But he wanted to delay that moment as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   As long as St. Louis Cardinals hulking slugger Mark McGwire
fiercely swished his bat in the on-deck circle, Porzio was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what, I knew he was coming up but I didn't really
take a good look at him,'' Porzio later admitted of that late July
meeting . ``I didn't want his size to throw me off.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon enough McGwire took his place in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   Porzio, the latest pitcher the Colorado Rockies have trucked up
the road from Colorado Springs, wasn't too nervous. After all, he
had a plan.
</P>
<P>
   And it worked.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie left-hander struck out McGwire with an 86 mph
fastball, leaving the home run king muttering and shaking his head
as he walked back to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how I wanted to pitch him and (catcher Kirt) Manwaring
had the same idea and it worked out well,'' Porzio said. ``He
called the pitches and I hit my spots and we tied him up.
Fortunately we got him right there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a thrill for me. He's a well-known hitter and
well-respected for a lot of reasons; the guy can hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In four innings over his first five games, since he was called
up July 9, Porzio has allowed just one hit and two walks. He has
retired 12 of the 16 batters to face him, with one reaching on an
error. Overall, he has 6 strikeouts in 9 and a third innings.
</P>
<P>
   His performance so far has been decidedly un-Rockies like to be
sure, but he said his success comes from staying within himself and
not trying to be like any other pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I was a little kid I always wanted to play in
the big leagues,'' Porzio said. ``When I got here I was going to
make sure that I enjoyed every minute, so I'm having a great time
up here. I'm going in there just being me. I thought that's what
got me here and I hope that's what's going to keep me here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not putting any added pressure like trying to throw a
fastball like (Rockies pitcher) Mike DeJean or things like that,
I'm just being me and so far it's working out.''
</P>
<P>
   Porzio came to the Rockies July 30 of last year, when Colorado
sent Greg Colbrunn to the Atlanta Braves. What has helped him make
the transition from the minor leagues _ where he was 5-1 with 33
strikeouts in 42 innings this year _ to the major leagues, was the
fact that he played in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did that help him adjust to the altitude and prepare
him for pitching in Coors Field, but it also helped him convert
from starting to relieving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've relieved in the past, but I always kind of considered
myself a starter,'' Porzio said. ``This year I finally started
considering myself a reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different because you have to come in and throw strikes,
but you just can't serve it over the plate. You have to come in
right off the bat and you need some good stuff to come out of the
bullpen. That's really the difference ? not that starters don't
have real good stuff, but the starters are out there trying to get
quick outs, where as a reliever, you want the strikeouts sometimes,
not the groundout.''
</P>
<P>
   The first major league hitter Porzio retired was Anaheim Angels
first baseman Mo Vaughn. He faced McGwire July 24. And although
McGwire flailed at an 86 mph heater, Porzio was quick to note that
he can throw harder than that when the situation warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I want to, I can get it into the 90s,'' he said. ``Usually
out of the bullpen I'm in the 90s, but here it's more important you
have good location than high velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I feel like my location is on, I'll put a little more on
it. But these guys can hit 95 mph fastballs every time, so it's
more important that you put it where you need to and stay ahead in
the count.''
</P>
<P>
   While Porzio has pitched very effectively so far, he is quick to
credit Rockies manager Jim Leyland for his success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's helped me by putting me in situations where I can
succeed,'' Porzio said. ``If there's two outs and I only need to
get one, or he'll give me a shot at a lefty and then bring in
(Curtis) Leskanic or DeJean or Jerry (Dipoto) to get a righty. I
don't really have to worry about getting everybody out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives me the ball, I get that guy out. If he doesn't come
out to get me, then I know I'll get the next guy, so I just take it
batter by batter. So far I'm keeping my focus kind of limited on
the task at hand. I don't look ahead, I'm just here for today and
try and do the job for today.''

BUSH HAS BEEN STEADILY TOUGH ON DRUG USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ GOP presidential candidate George W. Bush doesn't
want to reveal any history he might have with cocaine, but as Texas
governor he has not been reluctant to talk tough about hard drugs
and stiffen the penalties for those who break drug laws.
</P>
<P>
   Elected on a law-and-order platform in 1994, Bush has signed
laws that make it more likely that people convicted of possessing
small amounts of cocaine will go to jail, drug felons won't be
paroled, and drug dealers who sell to children or can be linked to
drug-related deaths will receive longer sentences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incarceration is rehabilitation,'' Bush said during his first
gubernatorial campaign, and some critics in the field of criminal
justice believe the governor has taken his own words to an extreme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush has taken a zero-tolerance approach to drugs in
the state of Texas,'' said Danny Easterling, a Houston lawyer who
heads the 400-member Harris County Criminal Defense Lawyers
Association. ``He has a `lock 'em up' mentality, as opposed to a
give-them-treatment mentality, that is very unfortunate. When you
apply that to cocaine possession, it has a lot of people's blood
boiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's overall approach to criminals, and particularly to
first-time drug felons, causes Texans like Easterling to question
Bush's much touted ``compassionate conservatism.'' Harvard law
professor Alan Dershowitz accuses Bush of ``rampant hypocrisy'' for
contemplating cutting welfare benefits to poor people who have
abused drugs if, as a presidential candidate, he won't flatly deny
that he ever used hard drugs himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been dogged by the media to respond to unsubstantiated
rumors that he has used cocaine, which is a felony in Texas.
Initially, Bush cited his zone of privacy and refused to answer the
question. Last week, when asked if he could pass an FBI background
check for drugs, the governor indicated he had been drug-free for
at least 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the governor's eight rivals for the GOP nomination has
denied ever using illegal drugs. Some of them have suggested that
Bush's credibility on law enforcement issues hinges on giving a
direct answer to the drug question.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush's campaign message is that young people should
stay away from illegal drugs, and as governor Bush has put more
resources into preventing drug use than in treating drug addiction.
The candidate also has said that those who experiment with drugs
should learn from their mistakes and be forgiven, an attitude that
seems at odds with some of his punitive policies back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor wants to make sure that when you commit a crime,
there is going to be a punishment, and it will be swift and sure,''
said Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for the Bush campaign. ``It is his
responsibility to enforce the law.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texas law that Bush signed in 1997 mandates that judges
sentence first-time felons convicted of possessing a gram or less
of cocaine to a minimum of 180 days and a maximum of two years in a
state jail. Under Bush's predecessor, Governor Ann Richards, such
first-time offenders received automatic probation with drug
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Fabelo, director of the Texas Criminal Justice Policy
Council, said that in 1998, some 4,000 of the felons in state jails
were drug offenders, and approximately 2,800 of them had been
incarcerated for possession of a gram or less of cocaine or heroin.
Still, more than 80 percent of the drug felons who could have been
sent to state jail had received probation instead, Fabelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Easterling said that ``a lot of people are going to jail instead
of receiving probation and rehabilitation'' for being found guilty
of possessing cocaine in amounts that suggest personal use, not
drug dealing. The majority of those being jailed, he said, are
minorities and the poor, who can't afford private attorneys and
don't get into treatment programs before their cases come to trial.
``They are under a lot of pressure to plead guilty and move on,''
Easterling said.
</P>
<P>
   Fabelo confirmed that 58 percent of the drug felons in state
jails are black, 17 percent are Hispanic, and 23 percent are white.
State jails in Texas house only nonviolent felons.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas prison population _ as opposed its state jail
population _ has tripled during the Bush administration to 149,000,
making Texas second only to Louisiana in having the highest ratio
of inmates, with more than 700 per 100,000 people. A $2 billion
prison-building program started by Richards created so many prison
beds that Bush has been able to enhance his crime-fighter image by
backing tougher criminal sentencing and cracking down on parole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the parole board appointed by Richards granted parole
to 79 percent of the eligible inmates. This year, under a
Bush-appointed parole board, the rate has fallen to an all-time low
of 16 percent. The parole rate for drug offenders in prison is
about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big old revolving door has shut,'' said Glen Castlebury, a
spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. ``Our
parole board has flat out quit paroling people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Habern, a criminal defense lawyer in Riverside, Texas, who
specializes in parole, says the parole rate proves that Bush is
conservative, but not compassionate. ``There is no justification
for such an extreme reduction in parole, or for the damage . . . on
those who aren't released,'' Habern said. ``Bush is not tough on
crime, he is dictatorial on crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Florence Shapiro, a Republican state senator from Plano, Texas,
and a champion of antidrug legislation, says Bush is being unfairly
branded as a zealot on drug laws when they have been just a small
piece of a larger crime-control package he has put forward as
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believes in law and order, and he is committed to making
the streets safe, but the governor did not isolate drugs as his
issue, or stand up and say, `This is what I stand for,' '' said
Shapiro, noting that Bush's greatest influence has been on
overhauling the state's juvenile justice system, which, she said,
``had been coddling bad boys for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed two drug bills that Shapiro wrote: One toughens the
penalties on felons convicted of dealing drugs within 1,000 feet of
a school. A second lengthens the prison term for dealers who sell
drugs to someone who dies of an overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Critics accuse Bush of slashing substance-abuse treatment
programs in Texas prisons. But authorities in the state say the
14,000 treatment beds proposed by the Richards administration in
1991 never materialized because the corrections department could
not demonstrate the need, not because Bush opposed rehabilitation.
``It has been proven that 5,800 beds was and is the correct number,
and that Texas is doing the optimum with what we all want done,''
Fabelo said.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan Reynolds, director of criminal justice studies for
the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, a
conservative think tank, says Bush faces a personal dilemma with
his antidrug record and the cocaine rumors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's message has been, `Be tough on crime, punishment works,
and people need to take responsibility for their own actions,' ''
Reynolds said. ``I don't think it works when that man, who wants to
be the chief law enforcement officer of the nation, looks like he
is hiding a felony crime. What about equal justice for all?''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: AMA's right to lean left on health plan
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Generation Ex-ers who remember the olden times B.MTV. (Before
MTV) can only stare dumbfounded at the sight of the American
Medical Association throwing in with a Democratic-led plan for
federal regulation of the practice of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when the AMA, socially inert and politically stodgy,
was one of the informal mainstays of the Republican Party and was
cocked to explode like a cheap pistol with charges of ``socialized
medicine'' at almost any effort to legislate medical coverage
beyond the commodity model.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed. The AMA, all on its own, has developed a bit
of a social conscience. The GOP has hied itself off so far to the
right it has estranged many mainstream organizations. (It is on the
outs with the American Bar Association, too, over several matters.)
</P>
<P>
   And, crucially, the choice for physicians is no longer between
government interference and retail medicine but between
insurance-company interference and federal protection.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors are going for the protection, to their own and the
public's benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Health maintenance organizations are not, generically, ogres.
They have produced a major upgrade in preventative medicine. The
best are unfairly tarred by the missteps of the worst.
</P>
<P>
   But even in the best there is tension between their good-health
mission and their charge to hold down employer health-plan costs
and to succor insurance profits. Experience has pinpointed problems
only legislation can fix.
</P>
<P>
   The supposed repairs passed by Senate Republicans were a sham,
covering a fraction of HMO patients and sloughing off essential
patient protections. One House plan _ mainly Democratic but with
bipartisan sponsorship _ is more like it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would assure HMO patients access to emergency room care
and to specialists, permit referrals outside the HMO, allow
patients to choose gynecologists or pediatricians as primary-care
physicians and to sue HMOs for, in effect, malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   These are common-sense proposals, likely to pass unless the
House Republican leadership uses a procedural shell game to limit
the vote to a reworked GOP proposal that goes beyond the Senate's
empty gestures but still protects insurers more than the insured.
</P>
<P>
   It may turn out that the biggest boost to the eventual creation
here of the universal health coverage most developed societies
provide was the defeat of President Clinton's plan. HMO problems
that would have cropped up in any event would have been used to
discredit any federal plan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though piecemeal and inefficiently, legislation with broad
public support is plugging health-care defaults and even extending
coverage at the margins. (To poor children, workers who change jobs
and so on.)

<P>
   We're sneaking up on a national health care system in small
steps. But keep it to yourself. We wouldn't want to scare Harry and
Louise, the distraught insurance industry fronts who worried the
Clinton plan to death in TV commercials.

AFTER FOUR MONTHS ON THE ROAD, A WELCOME PIT STOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the world of automobiles and aficionados, there is a time for
fine-tuning, careful waxing, and detailing. And then there is a
time to clean the trunk.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we clean the trunk after our first four months on the
road. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --I just spent a long weekend in my first hybrid car, the Toyota
Prius. It had far more power than I expected, and watching the car,
via in-dash screen, constantly swap and share between gasoline and
battery power was truly a marvel. I was struck by how many folks,
particularly young people, knew what the car was everywhere I went.
I'll do more on hybrids a little farther down the road. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Does it strike anyone else out there that while one big trend
in the auto industry today is to fill many niches with many cars, a
parallel development is the quest for the ``Swiss Army knife'' of
cars _ that vehicle that is all things to everybody? BMW has made a
stab at it with its X5, an SUV that was developed on sports-car
tracks. Now I read that Porsche and Volkswagen have SUVs on the
board, and we can be sure these will both be performance-based cars
_ and comfortable and quiet, too. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Judging from reader interest, one of the most highly
anticipated cars coming our way will be the Honda S2000, the hot
little sports convertible that has been likened to a motorcycle,
with a redline of 8,900.
</P>
<P>
   --In the comeback department, there are reports that Karmann
Ghia may be on its way back, planting its body on the platform of
the front-wheel-drive New Beetle. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of the New Beetle: A guy at Volkswagen tells me
that within a couple of years we'll likely see a V-6,
all-wheel-drive, 200-plus-horsepower version. Enough to blow that
stupid daisy right out of the vase on the dash. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --There is an interesting development, in the day of run-flat
tires, over at Uniroyal, the tire people. Instead of worrying about
a tire that will run even while flat, they've come up with a tire _
the Tiger Paw with Nail Guard _ that resists small punctures. How'd
they do it? They put a sticky substance on the inside of the tire
that surrounds whatever small object pokes through _ a nail for
instance _ and keeps air from getting out. And if the offending
object pokes through and withdraws, the goop dribbles in to seal
the hole. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of hot convertible sports cars, I can't wait for
the next James Bond flick. Our agent will be driving the new BMW Z8
_ 0-60 in under five seconds, thrown there by a 400-horsepower
V-8. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Trends. You have to watch for them. One trend among pickup
trucks these days, of course, is fitting more people _ as in whole
families _ into them. Hence, the boom in four-door pickups. In some
cases, in order to put big cabs on pickups, it often means going
with a smaller bed in back. And that leads us to another trend:
extending the beds. Best idea along these lines I've seen is a rig
called the Bed X-Tender by a company named Plastech. It's a
lightweight, resin-based ``cage'' that encases the rear of the bed
after you drop the tailgate _ giving you another foot-and-a-half of
useable space. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Toyota RAV-4s and Honda CR-Vs are dominant in the small SUV
market, but reports are that Ford may be ready to jump in with a
small Sportute called the Escape. It may come as soon as 2001, and
it may cost as little as the low 20s. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --It had to be a bad day out there in Auburn Hills, Mich., when
Daimler-Chrysler had to announce the recall of 2.1 million minivans
not for one, not for two, but for three reasons. A total of 1.4
million 1991-93 Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Caravan, and
Plymouth Voyagers are being recalled because bolts on the liftgate
can loosen and the hatch then drops onto whomever has just opened
it. The same cars also need their wipers fixed because at least 111
drivers reported they simply stopped working in the middle of
rainstorms. And with water comes fire _ so 743,000 of the three
minivans from 1996 are being recalled because of lock-nut problems
on the fuel pump. Six fires so far. No injuries. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --As if getting into the SUV market is not enough for the folks
at Volkswagen _ though I am starting to wonder just how many models
one company can crank out fresh at one time _ they are also said to
be considering producing a pickup truck. If they build one for
North America, let's hope they learn from Toyota's lessons with the
6-cylinder T100. Go Tundra-like and give us a V-8 from the start. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Ford Motor Co. says it is onto something with one option from
the 1999 model year: accelerator and brake pedals that can be
adjusted for shorter drivers. If you're short and have to push the
seat all the way forward _ and then sit on the front edge of the
seat itself _ this puts you in a most unsafe position: right up
against the steering column. With the new pedals, that's no longer
necessary. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --In the movie ``The Graduate,'' plastic was touted as the
product and career of the future. Well, the future finally seems to
be here. We're seeing more and more plastics in cars and trucks _
and why not? Cadillac likes the idea, and Automotive News reports
the company is looking for bids for plastic panels for its Evoq
luxury sports car. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --More from those folks at Volkswagen. Hey, a V-8 truck should
be no problem since they're already planning a luxury sedan with _
count 'em _ 12 cylinders. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Trying to get away from the confusion over GMC and Chevrolet
SUVs both tagged Suburban, GMC has renamed its rig. From now on, it
will be called the Yukon XL. If the latter half of that tag is a
reference to size, does that mean Ford should have called its new
big rig the Excursion XXXL? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, in the what's-a-human-life-worth? department,
this from an actuary, skydiver, and author of a study called ``How
Smart is Your Parachute: The Risks and Rewards of Hi-Tech Life
Insurance,'' which first appeared in a magazine called
Contingencies, published by the American Academy of Actuaries.
</P>
<P>
   Writes Gerry Smedinghoff, ``A total of $1.7 million in economic
resources are spent on air bags for each life saved. Seat belts are
11 times more cost effective at only $150,000 per life saved.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in the world of actuaries.

THE NEW NISSAN MAXIMA: $21,000 CARS DO NOT SOUND LIKE THIS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Through several generations of cars and trucks, Nissan developed
a loyal following and a reputation for reliable cars that seemed
designed to match whatever Toyota had up its sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Brand loyalty and good financial times followed _ for a while.
Now, in times of tangled finances and a product line that went
stale, Nissan is pushing for a comeback. And with its sights set on
young drivers and families, it has produced the Xterra SUV, the
Frontier Crew Cab pickup truck, and let out word that the Z sports
car will be returning.
</P>
<P>
   But the staple of the Nissan fleet has long been the Maxima, and
back in 1984 when it was given a V-6 engine, it was a leader among
peppy sports sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the 2000 Maxima, and it is more powerful, bigger, and
better handling than any of its predecessors. And with a base price
of just $21,049 for the GXE, it is a wonderful bargain considering
that, performance and comfort-wise, it is in a league with cars
that cost a third to nearly twice as much more. Even the
top-of-the-line GLE is priced at $26,249, still well below many
comparable cars.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has taken a 3.0-liter DOHC, 24-valve V-6 and cranked out
222 horsepower. That's more horses than corraled by the 1999 Toyota
Camry, the V-6 Accord, or the Lexus ES 300.
</P>
<P>
   The secret? New intake and exhaust manifolds, a variable
induction system for air intake control, equal length exhaust pipes
coupled with a muffler off the high-performance Skyline GT-R (a
muffler flap valve opens at 2,000-2,400 rpms and cuts exhaust
system back pressure), and platinum-tipped spark plugs good for
100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   All this gives you 32 more horsepower than the last Maxima, and
it delivers the power with a wonderful guttural rumble that the
Nissan folks say surprised even them. Cars that cost $21,000 do not
sound like this.
</P>
<P>
   Available in five-speed manual or 4-speed automatic, this
base-model Nissan GXE (automatic transmission) cruised easily at 75
miles per hour while turning only 2,600 rpms. This was while
delivering about 25 miles per gallon in a week of testing.
</P>
<P>
   It often happens that when a manufacturer wants a car to appeal
to those who appreciate power, they bring on the power but lose
something in handling _ all part of keeping the cost down. Not so
with the Maxima. This is a balanced car that handles its boosted
power well. Got a peppy little Golf that wants to play tag with you
as you come off an entrance ramp and onto the highway? You'll leave
the Golf driver wondering how this snub-tailed car left him in the
dust of a decreasing radius turn.
</P>
<P>
   To handle the power, Nissan has beefed up stabilizer/antiroll
bars front and rear, with coil springs up front and a multilink
rear suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The Maxima tracks well in corners, snaps lane to lane on the
highway, and its braking, using 4-wheel disc brakes and ABS, makes
for straight and sure stops.
</P>
<P>
   Afraid that you might get too playful with the Maxima, Nissan
has installed an electronic shutoff at the 7,100 redline.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fifth generation Maxima and the folks at Nissan
Design International, Inc., in La Jolla, Calif., have set out to
retain some of the old look of the Maxima _ the chopped rear end,
for instance _ while adding softer, more curved lines from the
front and up over the roof.
</P>
<P>
   Seat yourself behind the wheel, and you know Nissan has not
skimped inside, either. Just grab the steering wheel, notice the
dimpled grips right and left, and you know Nissan meant this car
for drivers, not just for travelers.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample legroom front and rear, and with its windshield
sweeping out and away from a broad dash, and its center-dash
control panels flowing down to the console, it has the look of the
new Mercedes S Class.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, at $60,000 less than the Mercedes, the Nissan is not
in that league. But it is in a league of its own for what it
delivers at this price. The seats are broad and firm, even in the
basic cloth models, and add to the big-car feel.
</P>
<P>
   The dark numerals of the gauges, set against an off-white
background, make them easy to read and give the car a certain retro
feel _ one I last noticed on the Chrysler 300M, another car I
liked.
</P>
<P>
   This base-model GXE comes with standard refined suspension, ABS,
keyless remote access, power windows, and locks. The test model had
a sliding glass sunroof and a comfort and convenience package
(including 16-inch alloy wheels, upgraded audio system, eight-way
power driver's seat) that added $2,068 to the price.
</P>
<P>
   When you review a car, it is important to ask just who might be
interested in it. In the case of the Maxima, I can see two key
groups for whom this is a fine buy: First, young drivers who want a
peppy car but just don't have the money for that BMW or Saab Turbo.
This is a great entry-level car while they wait for their next pay
raise in their new careers. Second, this is a good buy for drivers
who want comfort, reliability, and economy, coupled with a car that
has enough power to let them move nimbly along the highway as they
might in a more expensive sedan.

AUTHOR SAYS MATERIALISM, SEXISM PERVADE WEDDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL LOPEZ  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, N.Y. _ What author Jessica Mitford did in 1963 for
funerals by lifting the shroud of secrecy to inform consumers of
pricing and practices, Chrys Ingraham hopes to do for another
ritual: the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   In her new book, ``White Weddings'' (Routledge), Ingraham uses
the American wedding's greatest contradictions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Materialism, which has inflated the average wedding cost to
$19,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Alleged exploitation of offshore workers to produce gowns that
symbolize purity and promise.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sexism, even on the part of toy manufacturers that court girls
with fairy-tale romance to examine the complex social consequences
of the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly exploring the custom from a feminist viewpoint,
Ingraham's study maintains that the white wedding is a romantic
illusion, concealing the sexism and racism in our capitalistic
society. ``Is that what you planned for your wedding day?''
Ingraham asks.
</P>
<P>
   The book's subtitle, ``Romancing Heterosexuality in Popular
Culture,'' goes to the heart of the author's premise:
Heterosexuality is not a mere matter of natural occurrence, but an
institution that uses the romance of weddings to help reinforce
gender roles read male dominance as well as race and class
structure.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham, an associate professor of sociology at Russell Sage
College in Troy, knows her book released in prime wedding season
will challenge people's basic beliefs about marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already had a lot of people read the manuscript.
Everybody I asked to read it was married, so I really got a pretty
strong sense that it makes people uncomfortable, and it makes
people uncomfortable both because they feel they want this utopian
thing, and, they feel bad they've participated in something that's
hurt others.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham herself, when asked if she has ever been married, said
she has been in a couple of long-term committed relationships and
has helped raise a family. Then, she returns the question.
``Married? By whose standards?''
</P>
<P>
   How weddings, supposedly the happiest celebrations of love,
``hurt'' is a question that Ingraham began to address in earnest in
1992, when she learned that an astounding 13 television shows were
ending their seasons with weddings. When she turned to academia for
an explanation on such marital saturation, she found none. No one
had really studied weddings.
</P>
<P>
   To do it, Ingraham read 30 years' worth of Bride's magazine,
shopped for gowns, scoured bridal announcements and traced the
wedding ritual and its pairing with government.
</P>
<P>
   The white wedding is a fairly recent phenomenon, begun when
Queen Victoria chose white when she married in 1840; the British
monarch, too, popularized diamonds. What has evolved is a $32
billion industry, which revolves around romance, particularly as
marriage shifted from a 19th-century mandate for women, basically
seen as property, to the modern celebration of love.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with the wedding centerpiece the gown Ingraham on her
shopping expedition found the widespread, somewhat mystifying
practice by specialty shops of removing the labels from the
dresses. When Ingraham asked why, store owners uniformly admitted
they removed the tags to prevent comparison shopping. That practice
could be illegal if certain information is excluded. (According to
the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the textile law,
retailers may substitute their own tags for a manufacturer's, as
long as they retain certain required information, such as the
identity of one business in the gown's distribution, country of
origin, fiber content and care.)
</P>
<P>
   Too, 80 percent of those gowns are produced in foreign factories
where labor conditions don't match U.S. standards, she asserts.
Ingraham reiterates one particularly charged allegation that
13-year-old Guatemalans were making the gowns of one major
manufacturer. Neither the union that made the charge in 1997 nor
the manufacturer returned calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham was intrigued by what she didn't find in Bride's, the
largest of a plethora of bridal magazines. Since 1959, the magazine
has featured women of color on its cover just four times. In
general, black brides do not appear until at least halfway through
the issues of bridal magazines, she found.
</P>
<P>
   These periodicals, like dolls and toys, sell one predominant
bride icon: she is white, blond, blue-eyed and ``pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   By ignoring minorities, Ingraham argues in her book, the
exclusive marketing makes weddings truly white.
</P>
<P>
   Bride's editor in chief, Millie Martini Bratten, believes the
magazine is ``pretty broadly balanced,'' with regular articles on
ethnic weddings, from Native American to Japanese, as well as
beauty stories that consider the hair and skin types of many women.
She could not address Ingraham's observation on Bride's cover, or
percentages of women of color in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know how many times we do one thing over
another. We really direct editorial content and covers to appeal to
as broad an audience as possible, in every case.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratten, who has been with Bride's for 20 years, sees vast
changes in the wedding ceremony, driven by contemporary norms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Socially today, you don't have to be married to live together.
... If you choose to get married, it's a choice. How you choose to
get married is a choice. This is people following whatever their
particular dream is.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Bratten, a third of couples _ older, perhaps
already living together _ pay for their own weddings, a trend that
has spawned team planning by the couple, as well as Bride's
supplement, ``Grooms.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hear from people about their wedding is, they've found
their best friend, and I think that's very important and different
from when the bride left the care of her father for the care of the
husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, with stories on choosing a gown, reading contracts
and understanding the law, for instance, provides advice to couples
who may choose to lavishly marry in an Italian villa, or at city
hall, she said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The Association of Bridal Consultants does not describe a
homogeneous, all-dressed-in-white clientele, bent on the best.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Eileen Monaghan said the association's director
of diversity addresses a growing demand among people to imbue
ceremonies with their own culture and heritage. Wedding
professionals also cater to same-sex couples planning commitment
ceremonies. Consultants plan weddings for ``the whole spectrum,''
including clients who want small, meaningful ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In anyone's life, there are three rites of passage: birth,
death and marriage. Marriage is the only rite of passage that you
have any control over,'' which triggers the planning, she said. The
association states that the average wedding cost is $12,000, not
the $19,000 total quoted in magazines, which include about $3,000
worth of jewelry purchases in a nod to advertisers, Monaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   Grooms are increasingly part of that act. ``Ingraham's premise
is that the rite of passage is in male domination. Any consultant
now says grooms are more involved in the marriage than they ever
were,'' including paying the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's not just the father of the bride paying for someone
to take her away,'' Monaghan said.
</P>
<P>
   The wedding remains a state-sanctioned entree to privilege,
Ingraham maintains.
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state laws, upholding marriage as a ``cornerstone of
an organized society,'' open up a variety of benefits for married
couples, including health insurance, loans and Social Security
entitlements. Yet marriage does not offer the same incentive for
poorer people, whose chances of receiving child care, food stamps
and school meals diminish if they marry, the book asserts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the state involved in those things? Why is the state
deciding who gets what benefits based on (marriage),'' Ingraham
asks.
</P>
<P>
   The Disney-esque commercialism that fuels the wedding desire
(yes, Disney, with a sideline as wedding consultant, is the
frequent site of marriages) is a blinding force, even among
middle-class women who don't particularly need to marry, Ingraham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham wants, at the least, for people to question the
unquestioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I really want out of the book is (for people) to think in
a more democratic way.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing so might make better citizens of people now caught in a
narcissistic approach to their personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our desire to belong to something beautiful and warm and
cuddly and safe, we've lost sight of what it means to be part of a
community, and to make the whole community better. The industry has
played its part in that by elevating the couple as peak, as the
only thing to strive for and the only thing that's important.''

WARNING ABOUT SYPHILIS TRIGGERS ATTACKS ON GAY CHAT ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ILENE LELCHUK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An Internet chat room for gay men was bombarded
with hate mail following media reports that health officials have
traced a syphilis outbreak to people who met there.
</P>
<P>
   Users of the America Online chat room SFM4M _ San Francisco Men
4 Men _ who logged on Wednesday said they received anti-gay
messages filled with profanity and death threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I logged on at 7 a.m. and rather than have a nervous breakdown
I logged off,'' said Jay, who declined to give his full name
because he feared more harassment. Jay, a 34-year-old Web page
designer in San Francisco, said he forwarded the worst messages to
AOL officials.
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato, who was not aware of the on-screen
attacks, said AOL has a Community Action Team that can monitor
problems in chat rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any kind of personal or community-directed harassment would
violate AOL's terms of service,'' D'Amato said.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of anti-gay messages followed publicity surrounding
the San Francisco Health Department's attempt to track a disease
through cyberspace for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The department launched its computer-age campaign after a few
men tested positive for syphilis and told health officials that
they met their last partners in SFM4M.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department wanted to warn other chat room users about
the syphilis cases, but the participants are virtually anonymous
and known only by their screen personas. AOL, following its strict
privacy policy, declined to release names, phone numbers or
addresses without a court order.
</P>
<P>
   So health officials paired with PlanetOut, the largest online
service for gays, lesbians and bisexuals. PlanetOut has spent the
last three weeks in the chat room warning users about the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   And the campaign is working, said Jeffrey Klausner, director of
the Health Department's sexually transmitted diseases division. The
number of men who visit city clinics for testing has doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Eight men who met their recent sex partners in SFM4M tested
positive for syphilis. A ninth infected man said he met his
partners on an Internet relay chat room, or IRC.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the San Francisco men also reported that they tested
HIV positive, Klausner said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the number of cases is small so far, the implications
are big.
</P>
<P>
   Klausner said a syphilis outbreak could have a major impact on
San Francisco's gay community because the disease causes genital
sores, which increase the victim's likelihood of contracting and
spreading HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In the SFM4M chat room Wednesday, visitors discussed the Health
Department's campaign, the resulting publicity and the flood of
homophobic on-screen attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda sad that (the chat room) has that bad rep now and
(the publicity) really makes gay people look like dogs in heat,''
wrote one man who declined to identify himself.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rielly, founder of PlanetOut, said that he isn't surprised
by the anti-gay messages now hitting the chat room.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't buy into the argument that because (the public
health campaign) might shed an unfavorable light on the gay
community that you shouldn't talk about it all,'' Rielly said.
</P>
<P>
   Among Rielly's critics are David Pasquarelli of Act Up San
Francisco, whose group questions whether HIV causes AIDS. Act Up
placed an ad last week in the Bay Area Reporter warning that the
``syphilis scare is an anti-gay lie'' and that a handful of cases
doesn't constitute an outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their alarmism is demonizing gay sex . . . ultimately fueling
violence against gay men,'' Pasquarelli said.
</P>
<P>
   But Klausner defended his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the Health Department is to use information it has
to protect the health of the public,'' Klausner said. ``We weigh
very seriously the decisions to issue health alerts to medical
providers and to the community at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases of syphilis _ a bacterial infection easily treated with
antibiotics when detected early _ are at an all-time national low.
In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention targeted
the disease for elimination.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, 17 cases of recent infection were reported
during the first six months of 1999, compared to 25 cases reported
during the same period in 1998.

ROLLER COASTER PROBLEMS NOT THE FIRST, PARK EMPLOYEES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON and MATTHEW YI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALLEJO, Calif. _ Witnesses to the roller coaster accident that
left 28 riders stranded in midair at Six Flags Marine World said it
was not the first time that the ride, called the Boomerang, had
malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ride is known for getting stuck,'' said park employee
Naomi Uhuru, 16, who works on the rock climbing attraction next to
the Boomerang. ``You couldn't pay me to get on that after what I've
seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrus Jenkins, 36, who also works at an adjacent ride at the
Vallejo park, recalled an incident earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a problem with this ride two weeks ago, when
(passengers) got stuck at the end,'' Jenkins said. On that
occasion, riders could simply walk off, since there were stairs
next to where the cars stopped, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomerang came to an abrupt halt at about 3:45 p.m.
Wednesday, for reasons park officials said were not immediately
clear.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses and riders said the coaster initially was suspended at
its apex for several minutes, then, as it was slowly descending the
track, a cable snapped, releasing the train. It traveled through
one loop, then came to a stop in the second loop, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   As in the previous incidents involving the thrill ride, no one
was injured, although six riders were sent to hospitals for
observation for possible heat-related problems, a park spokesman
said. Temperatures neared 100 degrees during the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Rieger, an independent amusement park safety inspector based
in Nevada, said there have been a series of problems with Boomerang
roller coasters, one involving a New Jersey park accident two years
ago in which 24 people were injured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many Boomerangs are failing.''
</P>
<P>
   At Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, a roller coaster
manufactured by the same company that made the Boomerang, Vekoma
International of the Netherlands, has stalled at least twice since
April, stranding passengers, according to news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In Vallejo, Six Flags Marine World employees plucked riders from
the stranded cars _ which stopped about 75 feet in the air _ using
a crane equipped with a cherry picker. Vallejo Fire Department
personnel stood by.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly four hours to release everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Park workers delivered bottled water, wet towels and straw hats
to the trapped riders as the late afternoon sun blazed down on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Natanhna Morales, 12, a season pass holder, said she had been
disappointed on several recent visits to see the Boomerang shut.
</P>
<P>
   But she wishes it had been closed on Wednesday. Morales was on
the ride when it broke down. It was not the thrill she was looking
for.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend, she thought she was going to die. She was
screaming,'' Morales said. ``It was scary. I think they should
close that ride.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boomerang has carried 2 million passengers since it opened
at Six Flags Marine World in March 1998, park spokeswoman Kristi
Vonne said.
</P>
<P>
   It reaches heights of 125 feet and speeds of 48 mph. In the
ride, which lasts less than two minutes, thrill-seekers are pulled
backward up a steep incline, then released. The seven-car coaster
twists through three consecutive loops, stopping at the other end
before doing the whole thing in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials said the ride would be shut for inspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how this happened, but we're going to do a
thorough investigation,'' said park spokesman Jeff Jouett.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no fatalities at Marine World since the park
opened in Vallejo in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Two far more serious accidents killed amusement park visitors
earlier this week:
</P>
<P>
   _ On Sunday, Joshua Smurphat, 12, of Sunnyvale was killed when
he fell out of the Drop Zone ride at Paramount's Great America in
Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Long Island man, 20, died Tuesday while riding the Shockwave
stand-up roller coaster at Paramount's Kings Dominion park near
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic state Assemblyman Tom Torlakson, the author of a bill
requiring annual inspections of theme park rides in California,
said he was concerned about the incident in Vallejo. Torlakson
introduced his bill after the collapse of a waterslide at
Waterworld USA in Concord on June 2, 1997, that killed one
teen-ager and injured 32 from Napa High School.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections are now required only at moving carnivals, like
county fairs.

 MARK McMILLAN SHOWS SIZE DOESN'T COUNT IN CORNERBACKING  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mark McMillian, more than any athlete I've ever
met, taught me not to leap to conclusions. He was too small to play
in the NFL, and everyone knew that.
</P>
<P>
   But every week, he was out there, covering receivers a head
taller, yelling at players and coaches on the opposing sidelines,
defying expectations, flouting etiquette. Just as everyone
predicted, he would get beaten on plays, beaten badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you expect from a 5-foot, 7-inch cornerback?'' they'd
say, as if 6-footers never get beaten, too.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, though, they had to admit that the little guy
didn't back down. He didn't cave in after a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   He went right after the receivers again and made them pay for
beating him. He stuck to them like a mosquito at a summer picnic, a
complete annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is a San Francisco 49er, part of a corps of diminutive
cornerbacks. Darnell Walker, too, is small, easy to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   But their self-esteem is ample. They had to be confident to
stick in the NFL, more confident than the big guys. And at
cornerback, confidence is at least half the game.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the last couple of high-profile corners for the 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Woodson was a battered version of his Hall of Fame self in
1997. He didn't believe in his body then, and it showed in all of
the penalties he picked up. He tried some sly tricks to make up for
his loss of speed, and the referees caught him. And caught him. And
caught him.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Antonio Langham started off badly, possibly
burdened by the huge expectations that accompany big contracts. He
never recovered. Like McMillian, he got beaten.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike McMillian, he would get beaten again. Then again. By the
end, he looked absolutely lost and confused on the field. He looked
more overwhelmed than the little guys ever have.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the little guys are one of the Niners' big concerns. Do
they, plus second-year corner R.W. McQuarters, all shorter than
5-10, have any chance of preventing the aerial assaults perpetrated
on the 49ers last year?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, I'd like their chances better if they were taller,
named Aeneas Williams or Deion Sanders and, did I mention, taller?
But their salaries fit nicely under the cap, and for the
financially challenged Niners in the last offseason, the payroll
was where size mattered most.
</P>
<P>
   If Tim McDonald and Merton Hanks support them at safety, the
Niners' corners have a chance to undermine some profoundly low
expectations. Walker and McMillian have already built whole careers
out of doing exactly that. They don't belong in the NFL, but here
they are.
</P>
<P>
   McMillan has been doing it for seven years now. He started out
with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1992, a rookie afterthought who
wasn't really supposed to survive training camp. I remember him in
a Monday night game in 1994, when the Cowboys were crushing the
Eagles. Emmitt Smith had about eight big breakaway runs. Late in
the game, he had another, racing downfield, the end zone just
waiting for him.
</P>
<P>
   All of a sudden, out of nowhere, McMillian descended on him,
flying in like a mosquito, tackling like a grizzly bear. He brought
Smith down near the 5. As Smith picked himself off the ground, he
and McMillian exchanged words. It was easy to make assumptions.
McMillian was yammering, in his usual way, and Smith wasn't happy
about the trash talk.
</P>
<P>
   The game ended. I found McMillian in the locker room and asked
what had happened between him and Smith. The little guy smiled and
said: ``He told me it was a great play. He didn't think anyone
could catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought he might be joking, although he seemed serious. I
asked Smith later about the play. He said almost the same thing,
adding that he never expected a tiny cornerback to bring him down
alone.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the assumptions. What looked like trash talk wasn't.
What looked like a ridiculous mismatch wasn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   More important, what looked like somebody else's job wasn't,
either, at least not in McMillian's mind. It didn't matter that the
linebackers and defensive linemen or the safeties were supposed to
stop the running back. He didn't want his team to be embarrassed on
national television one more time.
</P>
<P>
   His tendency toward trash talk annoyed a lot of people, but off
the field, with the adrenaline ebbing, he unveils a gift for
story-telling. Reminiscing about his years as a troublemaking
adolescent, he once told of a teacher who made misbehaving students
stand in the corner with their arms straight out, pretending they
were airplanes. The more difficult the kid, the longer the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went coast to coast a lot,'' McMillian said.
</P>
<P>
   He was in the middle of a rugged period in his life, when he was
kicked in and out of three junior high schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever expected him to end up at the University of Alabama,
and certainly not in the NFL. That shows what expectations are
worth.

   GRANGER, Texas _ Ahhh, the lowly school locker: those metal
vaults that are holders of all things dear (like cosmetics and
Walkmans), a few things essential (like textbooks and notebooks)
and many things forgotten (like curdled milk and rotting athletic
shoes).
</P>
<P>
   Considered a rite of passage as students move from elementary to
middle and high schools, lockers are, at once, tether, beacon and
refuge for most high school students around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They are so much a part of the fabric of high school students'
lives that one parent complained all the way to Arkansas Gov. Mike
Huckabee last year when her son wasn't given a locker.
</P>
<P>
   They are the meccas where teen-age social rituals are played
out, from flirtatious embraces to the body-slamming hazings to
which freshmen are almost universally subjected.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, as the complexity of school problems has
escalated, school lockers also have become hiding places for
alcohol, drugs, cigarettes, written bomb threats, smoke bombs,
stolen merchandise and weapons. In Georgia, a teen-ager hid gloves
she allegedly planned to use in a plot to murder her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Enter James Bartosh, superintendent of the Granger schools,
about 50 miles northeast of Austin, Texas, who convinced his school
board a year ago to rip out all the lockers at Granger High School
and replace them with hallway space.
</P>
<P>
   He's not the first school administrator to embrace the concept
of lockerless schools, but he talks about the wisdom of making the
change with all the zeal of an evangelical preacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like to have no thefts, decrease your tardies by
two-thirds, have no lost-and-found, have quiet and clean hallways,
improve safety a hundredfold, have students turn their homework in
and have quiet hallways during class and during passing periods?''
Bartosh asks. ``If you could get all those things by doing one
thing, why would you not do that?''
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of lockers will accomplish that, he says, yet most
administrators are reluctant to take the step primarily because of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lockers have been ingrained into the secondary educational
process forever,'' he said. ``Your parents had them and maybe even
your grandparents.''
</P>
<P>
   Tana Loving, an honors senior and cheerleader at Granger, was
one of the outspoken critics last year. ``My dad graduated from
this school, and he thought it was kind of absurd,'' she said.
``When they first took the lockers away, I was quite upset.''
</P>
<P>
   Loving had stuffed her locker with her pompoms, her megaphone
and other paraphernalia, saying she had no idea where she would put
her ``stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Various teachers have accommodated students' needs, however,
letting them store their extracurricular items in their classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Loving concedes, ``it's not so bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartosh decided to try the concept last summer, after attending
a state principals meeting where administrators from a Victoria,
Texas, middle school talked about their success with sealing off
student lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria's Patti Welder Middle School is in its fourth year
without lockers, said principal Eloy Chapa, who admits to copying
the idea from Columbus Middle School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Lockers also have been removed from Terrell Middle School, an
alternative school in the Houston Independent School District. A
number of other Houston and suburban schools have bolted their
lockers shut. Austin High did this year. Jackson Middle School did
it three years ago. HISD officials say it's for safety purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But surprisingly, security was not the issue at Granger and
Welder, according to school officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our contraband problem was Dr Pepper _ you know what I mean _
soda pop, food stuff, candy, little snacks between classes, video
games, compact disc players _ that was our contraband,'' said
Bartosh, the Granger superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it for the school atmosphere and that is the hardest
thing to sell. It is so difficult to convince a school board, to
convince parents, to convince students that there is a better way
of going to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapa said that security, though, continues to be the issue for
many of the school administrators who call him. He said he has had
inquiries from schools in Cuero, Yorktown, Weslaco, San Benito and
Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there isn't more done to curtail some of the violence in
the schools, I think it's going to be a concept that continues to
grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of his middle school students, Chapa said it was the
weight of textbook-laden student backpacks that inspired the locker
shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   But Chapa and Bartosh say the school atmosphere _ the absence of
slamming, jamming, clanging locker doors every 50 or 90 minutes
between classes _ has improved tremendously.
</P>
<P>
   Noisy hallways were a problem even in a school as small as
Granger, which has about 250 students in grades 6-12.
</P>
<P>
   In Victoria, Chapa says visitors to his South Texas campus are
amazed at the serenity in the hallways even when his 1,100 students
are rushing between classes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other benefits, according to the administrators, is a
significant drop in the number of lost or damaged textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   That's because schools that ditch the lockers must provide a
classroom set of textbooks for students to use in school, in
addition to the books they use at home for homework.
</P>
<P>
   Bartosh remembers one school board member who immediately
recognized the benefit of tearing out the lockers: No more
late-night phone calls to the superintendent to open the school so
his child could retrieve a forgotten textbook.
</P>
<P>
   Providing textbooks for every student to take home can be an
additional financial burden on schools, Bartosh admitted. But he
figures that in the future, textbooks will go the way of chalk and
slate boards. The Internet and CD-ROMs will provide the learning
materials over laptops.
</P>
<P>
   In the year's time Granger has experimented with the concept,
Bartosh has confronted only one problem for which he has not had a
ready answer: The mother of nine who wanted to know just where she
was supposed to store the 40 to 50 textbooks her children would be
expected to keep at home all year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Blue-eyed ex-Mouseketeer Aguilera is the latest teen star to
land a No. 1 single; the infectious dance-pop smash ``Genie in the
Bottle'' has held the top spot on the nation's chart for more than
a month.
</P>
<P>
   But as this sassy self-titled debut suggests, Aguilera won't be
lip-synching alongside fellow ex-Mouseketeer and teen superpower
Britney Spears anytime soon. See, this kid can actually sing, a
talent that sets her apart in the overheated teen market. In fact,
pop's next female superstar boasts a soulful streak a mile wide and
the most assured sets of pipes possibly since Mariah Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in suburban Pittsburgh, Aguilara (who's
half-Ecuadorian and half-Irish) began belting out crowd-pleasing
show tunes, blues and r&AMP;b in her pleasingly honeyed alto early in
life. The album, which was released Tuesday, sparkles, from the
upbeat hit single to the guitar-driven fun of ``What a Girl Wants''
and the gospel-tinged ``So Emotional.'' Finally, here's a teen act
adults won't be embarrassed to admit they like all the way through.

   THE HIPPOS/``HEADS ARE GONNA ROLL'' (Interscope)
</P>
<P>
   On the indie ska compilation scene, Van Nuys' six-piece Hippos
have been a featured attraction for years. Using loud guitars,
vintage keyboards, a three-piece horn section and two harmony
singers, the band writes and plays lively, playful music that
appeals to kids across the country.
</P>
<P>
   For ``Heads Are Gonna Roll,'' the Hippos' second album and major
label debut, the band's pop instincts are allowed to roam while
standouts like the first single, ``Wasting My Life,'' along with
``Struggling'' and a nifty cover of the chestnut ``Always Something
There to Remind Me'' should keep the Hippos on stomping terms with
stages from coast to coast. 3 stars

   LINDA RONSTADT &AMP; EMMYLOU HARRIS/``WESTERN WALL: THE TUCSON
SESSIONS'' (Asylum)
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect meant to Dolly Parton, but jettisoning the third
wheel of their Trio supergroup has freed Harris and Ronstadt to
explore more adventurous notions of what Emmylou's mentor, Gram
Parsons, called cosmic American music.
</P>
<P>
   Ronstadt's voice is only slightly less powerful today than it
was at its ``Hasten Down the Wind'' peak. Wisely, she channels her
still abundant vocal energy into unique and subtle phrasings here.
Of course, that's always been the more ethereal Harris' forte, but
singing so much with the formidable Ronstadt forces her to be more
assertive than usual, with bracing results.
</P>
<P>
   As you'd expect, angelic harmonies abound on covers of Sinead
O'Connor's ``This Is to Mother You,'' Leonard Cohen's ``Sisters of
Mercy'' and Roseanne Cash's title song, while ``Raise the Dead'' is
yet another haunting Harris composition about departed music
greats.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect as all that sounds, though, it's the least-predictable
songs _ like the French-inflected war lament ``1917,'' and the
borderline goofy, sexily syncopated radio track ``Sweet Spot'' _
that make this Glyn Johns-produced album a vital work as well as a
gorgeous vocal showcase. 4 stars

</P>
<P>
   Multi-instrumentalist Bona's ``Scenes'' are storied remembrances
of growing up in Cameroon, West Africa, sung in the language of
Douala, his native tongue. While other musicians from Cameroon
favor a danceable, high-energy multi-guitar assault, Bona seems to
be striving for the soft-spoken adult-contemporary market with
lilting material and subtle jazz-tinged arrangements that sometimes
recall Sting. There's another connection, too _ Sting drummer Omar
Hakim helps out on a couple cuts, along with members of the New
York City Symphony and saxophonist Michael Brecker. 2 1/2 stars

   SYL JOHNSON/``TALKIN' BOUT CHICAGO!'' (Delmark)
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, one of the great Chicago r&AMP;b singers, cut some of his
best work in the '70s for Al Green producer Willie Mitchell's Hi
Records label. His songs have been covered by everyone from Jonny
Lang to Bonnie Raitt to Boz Scaggs.
</P>
<P>
   With a dozen new originals, a return to the '70s with a remake
of his Hi hit ``Diff'rent Strokes,'' and a tribute to blues great
Magic Sam, ``Talkin' Bout Chicago!'' offers state-of-the-art blues
and some of the most straight-ahead playing we've heard in a while.
Johnson really puts a song across, as evidenced by such winners as
the soul-drenched title track, penned for departed bluesman Junior
Wells. 3 stars

   In-demand harmony singer Larson died suddenly in December 1997
at age 45. Her Top 40 hits included a cover of Neil Young's ``Lotta
Love'' and a duet with Michael McDonald on ``Let Me Go, Love.''
Both songs are included in this recommended 16-track best-of, but
there are other more revealing highlights, such as Larson's cover
of Lowell George's ``Two Trains,'' a gorgeous reading of the Louvin
Brothers' ``Angels Rejoiced,'' and a 1978 live take of ``French
Waltz'' with all-star backing. 3 stars

   JOE SOUTH/``RETROSPECT: THE BEST OF JOE SOUTH'' (Koch)

<P>
   Those are Southern blue-eyed soul man South's guitar licks on
Bob Dylan's ``Blonde on Blonde'' as well as classic records by
Aretha Franklin, Wilson Pickett and others.
</P>
<P>
   As a solo act, his hits included the Grammy-winning soul classic
and universal plea for tolerance ``Games People Play,'' an instant
standout on this 16-track anthology. But there was more to South _
like the equally satisfying Southern r&AMP;b of ``Walk a Mile in My
Shoes,'' ``Don't It Make You Want to Go Home'' and ``Birds of a
Feather'' _ and ``Retrospect'' does a good job filling in the
picture. 3 stars

SHACK'S U.S. RELEASE COULD END DECADE OF ANONYMITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ It's a hot, sunny afternoon in Manhattan and in a
dimly lit hotel bar a waiter who suspiciously resembles a
``Jaws''-era Richard Dreyfuss brings Michael Head another round.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you're a UK resident or a dedicated follower of music
fashion, you probably don't know Head, leader of Shack, one of the
most acclaimed and least productive British acts of the '90s. The
quartet's dazzling new album, ``H.M.S. Fable,'' released Tuesday,
contains arguably the best set of songs from across the pond since
Oasis' ``Definitely Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   To say Shack has traveled a rocky road since their inception in
Liverpool a dozen years ago wouldn't start to describe what this
band has gone through.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point thinking about what could've and should've
been,'' Head, 36, says. ``There's no point thinking, `What if.'
Cause it all comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   Head is visiting New York for the first time to do promotional
duties for Shack's fourth album, ``H.M.S. Fable'' (London), a
shining 12-song set of urban folk songs that sometimes resembles
the Verve, other times the Byrds. Britain's New Musical Express
gave it nine out of 10, adding: ``It's so splendid it will make you
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the first Shack album to get a U.S. release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a bit of a tragedy if it just got lost,'' Head
admits. ``Anything could happen, but I just hope as many people
hear it as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Head and his partner in Shack, younger brother John, grew up in
Kensington, a failed '60s prefab housing experiment near
Liverpool's tough council estate of Toxteth, the scene of riots in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   Head remembers ``cardboard walls'' and gang wars there in the
early '70s. Eventually, the brothers picked up their dad's guitar,
inspired by Teardrop Explodes and Echo &AMP; the Bunnymen from
Liverpool's then-thriving post-punk scene.
</P>
<P>
   Then a friend introduced the 17-year-old to Los Angeles'
legendary '60s psychedelic folk band Love, led by imprisoned
singer-songwriter Arthur Lee, currently serving a nine-year prison
sentence for parole violations that included gun-possession
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and John would play this game as kids where if we heard a
record we liked, we'd give it points up to 10,'' Head recalled.
``When we heard Love, it was like 10-10-10. The songs are so
beautiful, and the chords are so accessible. As you're learning
them, you get into the beauty of it. They're my favorite band,
everything about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Head formed the Love Fountains in 1981, later renaming the band
the Pale Fountains. The strange blend of pastoral West Coast
psychedelia and bossa nova suffered from overproduction, and the
Fountains split in '86.
</P>
<P>
   Head started Shack the following year, and his folk-tinged
Merseybeat, which anticipated Britpop, was said to have inspired
the La's, Liverpool's other great lost band of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, Head was contacted by Arthur Lee's manager,
who said the onetime leader of Love needed a backup band for three
European dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He asked what Love songs we knew, and we said, `All of
them.''' Head said. ``He didn't believe us. We sent along some of
our stuff, and Arthur liked it, and there we were. People say when
you meet your heroes, it's disappointing. But Arthur was like
Arthur, only more again. I just totally loved him _ and he loved us
as well. It seemed the guy was reincarnated from out of medieval
England or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Shack's acclaimed ``Waterpistol'' album was released in 1995 on
a small German indie label, four years after it was completed and
following setbacks that included studio fires, lost masters and
label closures. The reviews were ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Head's appetite for self-destruction was taking
hold, including a nearly 10-year heroin habit. Echo &AMP; the Bunnymen
singer Ian McCulloch was already calling Shack ``the most
overlooked group in the history of Liverpool.''
</P>
<P>
   After an adventurously baroque 1997 album, ``The Magical World
of the Strands,'' recorded for a small French label, Head kicked
the drugs and Shack finally got down to business, spending two
years writing and recording ``H.M.S. Fable.''
</P>
<P>
   But even while rave reviews and acclaim for Shack's few live
gigs have been coming from all sides, Head remains in Liverpool
because of loyalty to his hometown, largely divorced from the
business of music.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be surprised what it's like there,'' he said. ``There's
not many clubs or venues. It's getting a little better because
there's been a recent influx of students, but Liverpool has done
nothing with its musical heritage. I mean, look, this is where the
Beatles started. Penny Lane in any other city would be an enormous
tourist attraction, right? In Liverpool, Penny Lane is the
plainest, most basic street you've ever seen in your life. It's a
mentality people have there. But it's where I've always lived.''
</P>
<P>
   While Head admits he hasn't the slightest idea how the business
operates in the U.S., he hopes the label scores some airplay for
``H.M.S. Fable,'' which includes such readily accessible material
as ``Comedy,'' ``Streets of Kenny,'' ``Captain's Table'' and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get great satisfaction when people come up to me and say, `I
stumbled across `Waterpistol,' and it totally blew me away,''' Head
says. ``I like it when people come across something by fluke. They
seem to cherish it more that way.'' &QL;

THE SEASON OF SNEEZING IS UPON US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Your lawn may be withering from the drought but
ragweed isn't. Despite the rain shortage in the Northeast, ragweed
is expected to be in full blossom by early September, with each
plant releasing up to 1 million pollen grains per day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ragweed is a very hearty weed,'' said Lawrence D. Syzdek, an
aerobiologist in Clifton Park. ``The highest ragweed numbers are
yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   For allergy sufferers, that means keeping a box of tissues
nearby for the next month to cope with the usual onslaught of
symptoms, from itchy eyes to runny noses.
</P>
<P>
   The hay fever season typically starts around Aug. 15-20, when
the ragweed plants start to blossom, usually in unmowed fields and
on roadsides. Traditionally, the week before Labor Day is the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be confused with goldenrod, ragweed is entirely green,
including the flower. The leaves have a characteristic dissected,
jagged edge. Besides avoiding the outdoors from 6 to 9 a.m.,
allergy sufferers should use the air conditioner at home and keep
their car windows rolled up when driving.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to minimize exposure to the aggravating pollen,
which prompts the immune systems to release histamines,
leukotrienes and other chemical substances.
</P>
<P>
   Those chemicals typically work to irritate and inflame the
linings of the nose, sinuses and eyes and create the symptoms
associated with allergies, including watery noses and eyes, a
scratchy throat, sneezing, wheezing and nasal and ear congestion.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst of cases, the problems can add up to a severe sinus
infection or trigger an asthma attack.
</P>
<P>
   While many over-the-counter antihistamines can offer some
relief, Dr. David Shulan of Certified Allergy Consultants in Albany
counsels his patients to use them cautiously because they cause
drowsiness. He cited a study showing that people given 50
milligrams of Benadryl, the equivalent of two pills, did worse on a
driving test than those legally drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Other options include prescription medicines and allergy shots.
The shots must often be performed over a period of up to five years
and can take six to 12 months before they start to work.
</P>
<P>
   While this year's ragweed season has gotten off to a strong
start, Syzdek doesn't expect it to add up to a record year. The
ragweed season usually ends by early October or by the first
killing frost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate in the Northeast that we have winter,'' he
said.

STUDIOS DON'T SAVE BEST FOR LAST

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Five major movies will be opening at a multiplex
near you this weekend, but don't feel bad if 1) you've never heard
of any of them, 2) you think you're familiar with one or two but
believe they came out last year, or 3) you don't care because
you're planning on seeing ``The Sixth Sense'' again.
</P>
<P>
   The last weekend of August and the following Labor Day weekend
are the dog days of summer, the time when movie studios dump films
they deem uncommercial, unwarranted, or just plain uninspired. Some
of these movies have been bumping around release schedules for the
better part of a year. Some, at one time, bore high expectations.
Others were bad ideas that a new studio regime inherited.
</P>
<P>
   None of them will likely catch on with audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the weekend where bad movies go to die,'' says one
studio distribution executive. ``If the product was any good, they
would have put it out earlier in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, late August and early September have never been a time
of abundance at America's movie theaters. The record opening for
the last weekend of August is 1996's ``The Crow 2: City of
Angels,'' which grossed $9.6 million in its first three days, a
figure a summer blockbuster like ``The Phantom Menace'' or
``Tarzan'' takes in on one good weekend day.
</P>
<P>
   ``By this point in the summer, frequent filmgoers feel like
they've already seen their quota of six to 10 movies,'' says David
Davis, a film analyst at Houlihan, Lokey, Howard and Zukin. ``Kids
are either back in school or getting ready to go back, families are
taking that last vacation. Nobody makes movies much of a
priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is bad news for the five films that open today. ``The 13th
Warrior,'' ``The Astronaut's Wife,'' ``Dudley Do-Right,'' ``A Dog
of Flanders'' and ``The Muse'' will all play in at least 1,000
theaters, but don't look for any of them to topple ``The Sixth
Sense'' from the top of the weekend box-office list.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Robert Bucksbaum, president of the marketing and
research firm Reelsource, says that only ``Astronaut's Wife'' and
``13th Warrior'' have a chance at cracking the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are already plenty of movies in the theaters,''
Bucksbaum says. ``The last thing we need are five more. There just
isn't room, particularly at this time of year.''
</P>
<P>
   Lest you feel like you're missing something _ and, believe us,
you're not _ we looked into the five movies opening at a time, for
want of a holiday designation, we'll call The Weekend of Sorrow.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't necessarily easy, considering that the studios
releasing the offending movies have been trying to keep the bad
buzz to a minimum by hiding their films. Not that we really mind.
This is a case where our loss is also our gain.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we found:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The 13th Warrior
</P>
<P>
   Original release date: April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   What the critics think: Dark. Dreary. Incomprehensible. But star
Antonio Banderas gets high marks for his makeup.
</P>
<P>
   The scoop: The movie is based on the Michael Crichton's take on
``Beowulf,'' following a group of eyeliner-wearing Vikings who
battle a horde of mysterious flesh-eaters.
</P>
<P>
   It was originally called ``Eaters of the Dead,'' until Disney
marketing executives toned it down to something a little more
palatable. (Remember ``Ravenous''? Didn't think so.)
</P>
<P>
   Disney ran a teaser trailer for the film two years ago but
pushed back the release date after disastrous test screenings.
Reshoots proved problematic because Banderas (don't worry, he's not
playing a Viking) was committed to directing a movie with wife
Melanie Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Crichton, to no one's surprise, clashed repeatedly with director
John McTiernan (``Die Hard''), who emphasized action set pieces at
the expense of the author's wordy musings. When McTiernan chafed
over studio interference, Crichton reportedly tried to step into
the director's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, everyone reconvened but to no effect. The movie is
still a bloody mess.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Not good. Disney, counting on Crichton's appeal and
Banderas' rising star, spent a lot of money on this movie (reports
vary wildly from $70 million to $125 million). It will probably
open here with a $6.5 million weekend, with fervent prayers that
international audiences can be fooled into helping recoup the
costs. A major disaster.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The Astronaut's Wife
</P>
<P>
   Original Release Date: November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   What the critics think: Unknown. New Line decided against
screening the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The scoop: Johnny Depp plays an astronaut who returns from a
space accident acting a little  &UR; !ital! &LR; strange. Charlize Theron
copes in the titular role, a part that seems eerily similar to her
character in ``The Devil's Advocate.'' (You know, wife married to
an ambitious guy, moves to New York with him, all hell breaks
loose.)
</P>
<P>
   This uninspired sci-fi flick went back for reshoots in late
February after test audiences complained about the ending. Guess
what? It still stinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ending is totally different,'' says someone who has seen
the movie. ``But it's not any better. It's not a bad movie, but
it's not good, either. And it really goes off track in those final
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: New Line has a history of working this fallow period
of the summer better than any other studio, having enjoyed success
with movies that appeal to young male audiences _ ``Mortal
Kombat,'' ``Spawn,'' ``Blade'' and the ``Crow'' sequel. ``The
Astronaut's Wife'' should take top honors among the newcomers,
albeit with a paltry $8 million in ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Dudley Do-Right
</P>
<P>
   Original release date: August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   What the critics think: Daily News film critic Bob Strauss gives
``Dudley Do-Right'' one star, calling it ``the worst movie I've
seen all year.''
</P>
<P>
   The scoop: Here's how bad movies get made. A group of young
producers brainstorm (and we use the term loosely) to come up with
a high-concept idea to pitch to studios. A girlfriend suggests,
``How 'bout a big-screen version of Dudley Do-Right? You know, that
cartoon Mountie guy?'' Rather than laughing it off and thinking
about ending the relationship, the producer jumps for joy,
realizing he has a movie dumb enough to sell to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ``Dudley Do-Right'' could have worked, given a
pitch-perfect treatment. After all, its star, the likable Brendan
Fraser, had a hit two summers ago with another recycled Jay Ward
cartoon, ``George of the Jungle.'' But lightning rarely strikes
twice in this town. Fraser should remember that when considering
whether to sign up for that ``Mummy'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Dismal. Kids have been known to sleep through the
movie's duller stretches. ``If you had a decent family film, you
wouldn't wait to release it when the kids are going back to
school,'' Reelsource's Bucksbaum says.
</P>
<P>
   You would if you were trying to quietly dump it. Look for it to
take in $2.5 million. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Muse
</P>
<P>
   Original release date: June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   What the critics think: Daily News film critic (and author of
this story) Glenn Whipp gives ``The Muse'' one star.
</P>
<P>
   The scoop: Independent October Films (now USA Films after Barry
Diller purchased the studio) thought they might have a sleeper on
their hands when filmmaker Albert Brooks persuaded Sharon Stone to
star in his latest effort. Of course, it has been years since Stone
(fully clothed) has had an impact with an audience, and Brooks'
movies have never gone beyond a cult following.
</P>
<P>
   This would-be comedy has Brooks playing a flagging Hollywood
screenwriter who hires a muse (Stone) to revive his flagging
career. Brooks' idiosyncratic movies have never tested particularly
well, but this one bottomed out at alarming depths.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences hated Brooks' whiny character, Stone's diva turn and
the movie's self-absorbed Hollywood navel-gazing. It's a small
wonder Paramount Pictures passed, and USA Films pushed it into this
low-profile slot.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: USA is taking the bold step of opening ``The Muse'' in
1,200 theaters, a surprisingly large number given the film's
art-house nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually with a movie like this, you open small and try to
build word-of-mouth,'' Bucksbaum says. ``This tells me that it has
probably tested so poorly that they're trying to get it out before
word-of-mouth kills it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it grosses $3 million. Probably less. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A Dog of Flanders
</P>
<P>
   Original release date: Warner Bros. never quite knew what to do
with this movie.
</P>
<P>
   What the critics think: Bland ``Oliver Twist'' tale that even
manages to neuter the dog's personality.
</P>
<P>
   The scoop: Based on a classic children's book, which, in and of
itself, is likely to doom the film in its theatrical release.
Culture critics love to bash studios for not making enough family
films. Problem is, when Hollywood does step up to the plate, these
same high-minded moral conservatives rarely support the movies they
say want to see. (See ``The Iron Giant.'' Really. Go see it.)
</P>
<P>
   Expect the same indifference to greet ``A Dog of Flanders,''
and, sadly, in this case, rightfully so.
</P>
<P>
   Forecast: Woof! Like with most other family-oriented movies,
audiences will wait for the video. &QL;

   SHOW-STOPPERS (New York) _ Show-stoppers are democracy in
action. They do not always reside in great shows, although few
great nights in the theater pass without at least one. They are
deeply intimate experiences, and yet they are forged by consensus.
It takes a conspiracy of sorts between the entertainer and the
entertained: no rousing number, no gorgeous soliloquy, no bravura
cameo qualifies without the audience's say-so. This is the glory of
live performance, that a catharsis can be so deeply absorbed that
spectators demand a timeout to express how they feel. By Peter

   APPLE-MONTREAL (Montreal) _ In Paris, the familiar eight-sided
red street signs say ``STOP.'' The Academie Francaise, guardian of
linguistic purity, utters not a peep of complaint. But in Montreal,
where these matters are deemed crucial to cultural identity, the
signs say ``ARRET.'' Eaton's department store, a Canadian tradition
for generations, is now just plain Eaton; the possessive ending was
amputated because the authorities ruled it too un-French. Twice in
the last two decades hard feelings have pushed Quebec close to
separation from Canada, with severe and lasting consequences for
Montreal, even if the city itself voted no. The issue still
percolates, never very far beneath the surface. But the visiting,
linguistically challenged American need not fear. Most of the
Montrealers one encounters speak excellent English, though they
delight in encountering an American with a smattering of French. By

E-MAIL PEN PALS FROM KOSOVO WAR MEET IN SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This was not your typical greeting at the gate
at San Francisco International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The hug shared Wednesday night between two teenagers brought an
end to months of anguish, painful disclosure and fear of death.
</P>
<P>
   Finnegan Hamill, 16, of Berkeley, Calif., was able at long last
to put his arms around his pen pal, Kujtesa Bejtullahu, a 16-
year-old Kosovo girl who flew into San Francisco Wednesday night
with three other Kosovo students.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a feeling all along that some way or another we would
get to meet, and now it's here,'' said Hamill, minutes after
hugging Bejtullahu as she arrived in San Francisco after 30 hours
of travel that brought her from her war-ravaged home country.
</P>
<P>
   For eight months, the two had corresponded via e-mail. The
exchanges between the teenagers, worlds apart in so many ways,
received widespread attention when they were aired on National
Public Radio and featured in a CNN program during the height of the
conflict over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Bejtullahu's letters to Hamill were full of graphic details and
disturbing thoughts about her first-hand view of atrocities
committed in her hometown of Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. They
described murders by Serbs, people forced to leave their homes and
continuous gunfighting in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Bejtullahu, an ethnic Albanian, expressed a constant fear of
being killed or expelled from her home by Serbs. When the
electricity was shut off, making it impossible for her to
correspond with Hamill for days at a time, Hamill would worry that
something had happened to her.
</P>
<P>
   Bejtullahu always managed to steer clear of danger and would
contact Hamill as soon as the electricity returned. She ultimately
survived the war and, in the process, became a youth activist. She
joined the PostPessimists, a group dedicated to ending tensions
among ethnic groups in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   With the war over, a Berkeley, Calif., church group that Hamill
belongs to pulled diplomatic strings to get student visas approved
for Bejtullahu and her traveling companions from PostPessimists so
they could come to the Bay Area and complete their high school
education.
</P>
<P>
   Bejtullahu, who with her hip clothes and funky shoes looks like
a typical teenager, couldn't be happier to have arrived Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty excited,'' said Bejtullahu, who appeared taken
aback with the throng of reporters and well-wishers surrounding her
as she got off her plane. ``I was hoping for this moment . . . I
didn't know much about this (the attention her plight had
received).''
</P>
<P>
   Hamill and Bejtullahu shyly dodged questions about what they had
expected of each other and what their first impressions were.
</P>
<P>
   Bejtullahu admitted to a fondness for red hair, Hamill's hair
color.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill, who admitted having butterflies, handed Bejtullahu a
bouquet of flowers. Still, he said, a romance was not the reason he
started corresponding with Bejtullahu and continued to write to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media is looking for a teen romance, but it's not,'' said
Hamill, a Berkeley High student. ``I know you would like it to be.
I'm just glad she's here.''
</P>
<P>
   The two began corresponding in January after a peace worker, who
had recently returned to Berkeley from Kosovo, talked to Hamill at
a church gathering and passed along Bejtullahu's e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   The isolated Bejtullahu found in Hamill a teenager she could
relate to, and they quickly became friends. She confessed all she
witnessed and her worst fears.
</P>
<P>
   The toughest times for Hamill were the times his e-mails went
unanswered. He worried about her safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbearable knowing that my friend is living through the
horror that I see on the news,'' Hamill said in interviews at the
time. ``Knowing there is nothing I can do about it is worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Bejtullahu and her family always managed to dodge trouble, and
the teenagers were finally able to share their feelings of relief
once the Kosovo conflict ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   Bejtullahu and her friends from PostPessimists learned last week
that their visas to the United States had been approved.
</P>
<P>
   Bejtullahu said first she planned to get acquainted with her
host family and Hamill. She also has to take a series of school
placement tests and work with the other three students she traveled
with to set up a PostPessimists group here. But a visit to the
Golden Gate Bridge is also at the top of her list of things she
wants to do.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley resident Gretchen Carlson, Bejtullahu's host mother,
said the efforts to get Bejtullahu and her friends to America were
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to get a kid out of a war zone,''
Carlson said. ``This is a major relief. We've had foreign students
before, and we loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   The First Congregational Church of Berkeley raised $25,000 to
sponsor the travel costs of the teens, but is seeking further
donations to help cover the costs of private school tuition,
clothing and health insurance. Checks can be made payable to FCCB
for Kosovo Students and mailed to the church at 2345 Channing Way,
Berkeley CA 94704.

`DUDLEY DO-RIGHT': MEET DUDLEY, BACKWARD MOUNTIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Based on the vintage Jay Ward animated series, ``Dudley
Do-Right'' attempts to be both zany entertainment for children and
nostalgic fun for those who grew up on this and other deft, snarky
Ward creations. (Rocky, Bullwinkle and George of the Jungle are
other well-loved Ward creations.) And it works pretty well, too.
Beyond the sure-fire goofy presence of Brendan Fraser and the comic
possibilities of a Canadian mountie who rides his horse backward,
this jokey romp written and directed by Hugh Wilson has an
appealing try-anything spirit. It's a movie that can start with
Fraser buttoned into his stiff red uniform and have him dancing
shirtless in a Las Vegas-style Indian act before its story is over.
</P>
<P>
   The basic elements here are Dudley, so doltish and upright that
he's capable of knocking himself flat by stepping on a loose floor
board; Snidely Whiplash, the mustachioed heavy who taunts Dudley by
calling him ``Mountie Boy'' and is played to a nasty fare-thee-well
by Alfred Molina, and Nell (Sarah Jessica Parker), who used to be
the passive type tied to the railroad tracks but is now a former
United States Ambassador to Guam. Both Dudley and Snidely crave
Nell's affections. And the movie is just nutty enough to involve
all three in an elaborate dance number to the tune of ``Did You
Ever Have To Make Up Your Mind?''
</P>
<P>
   Since anything is possible here, the film also includes Eric
Idle as a gold miner who winds up on the Regis and Kathie Lee Show
(they're here, too) and becomes renowned as ``a grown man with an
extensive Pokemon collection.'' And the film's Indians, the Kumquat
Nation (presided over amusingly by Alex Rocco), seem to come from
Canarsie. Also here is the kind of crisp narrator's voice that gave
the original cartoons such zest, as when he describes the Indians
in battle by saying: ``Not since their all-male revival of `Little
Women' had the Kumquats faced such hostile reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more along similar lines in a wildly changeable
film that somehow finds room for motorcycles and cell phones in the
midst of a mountie's story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' works well as family entertainment. Do note
that ``friggin''' now qualifies as a family-oriented word.
</P>
<P>
   On the same bill with this live-action cartoon is a new,
animated installment of the old Fractured Fairy Tales series titled
``The Phox, the Box and the Lox.'' It's likable just for having an
English setting called Pudding-on-the-Ritz.

`THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU': A PRETTY WOMAN, BUT THE WRONG ONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a measure of the star power of Julia Roberts that she
dominates the threadbare romantic comedy ``The Very Thought of
You'' without actually appearing in the movie or even being
mentioned in the screenplay. That's because Monica Potter, playing
a brash young woman from Minneapolis who flies to London with $35
in her pocket to start a new life, has been directed to ``be'' Ms.
Roberts in spirit, if not in body.
</P>
<P>
   Insofar as one actor can impersonate another without doing an
out-and-out caricature, Ms. Potter offers a reasonable facsimile of
Ms. Roberts' all-American princess with her mercurial blend of
pluck, pliability, defiance and sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a funny thing about star power. Screen magic ultimately
doesn't come from adopting an attitude or imitating mannerisms but
from a much deeper, more mysterious source. As Ms. Potter's
character, Martha, juggles three suitors who happen to be best
friends but don't realize until late in the game that they are
pursuing the same woman (nor does she realize at first that they
know one another), it is not unlike watching Jayne Mansfield or
Mamie Van Doren ``be'' Marilyn Monroe. Many of the details are
right, but they don't begin to generate the kind of radiance Monroe
emits from the moment she steps in front of a camera.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Very Thought of You,'' directed by Nick Hamm from a
screenplay by Peter Morgan, is one of those coyly edited movies
that fills in the mystifying gaps in its story by periodically
doubling back to repeat a scene with new crucial information added.
In its opening moments Laurence (Joseph Fiennes), the movie's
frantic narrator, bangs on the door of a neighbor (Ray Winstone),
whom he thinks is a psychiatrist, at 4:30 in the morning and pleads
for an emergency therapy session. The whys and wherefores only
become clear very late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the muddled story Laurence tells, it emerges that he and his
two best friends, Daniel (Tom Hollander) and Frank (Rufus Sewell),
by sheer happenstance met Martha at different junctures during her
flight from Minneapolis to London. Daniel, a blond, pouting
record-industry mogul accustomed to having any woman he wants,
becomes hopelessly smitten after Martha resists his lavish
blandishments. Frank, a struggling young actor whom Daniel treats
with disdain, woos Martha simply for one-upmanship. Laurence, who
instructs older women in the game of bridge, becomes his friends'
confidant and referee even though he, too, has met Martha and
fallen under her spell.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain its fizz, a comedy like ``The Very Thought of You''
requires the spicy contemporary equivalent of Noel Coward banter.
But if the story is a clever sitcomy contraption, the dialogue is
pedestrian. Among the contestants for Martha's love, the only
character with a distinctive personality is Hollander's vain,
petulant Daniel, whose ego is in need of puncturing. As the shy,
tongue-tied Laurence, who needs lessons in self-assertion, Fiennes
lacks the debonair twinkle and the comic timing of Hugh Grant, who
might have made the role come alive.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Potter's Martha, the character is a fabrication that
not even Ms. Roberts with all her wiles could have made believable.
Given a paucity of clever dialogue, she verges on being an
irritating. self-centered nag, not the all-American princess who
deserves the ``happily ever after'' ending signaled from the moment
she first appears on the screen.

`A DOG OF FLANDERS': A BOY. A DOG. YOU KNOW THE REST 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some sugarcoating is only to be expected in a family movie. But
when that film is clogged with sticky-sweet pieties cooed to
saucer-eyed tots, the product can be difficult to swallow.
Virtually every other sentence out of the mouths of the nice
grown-ups in ``A Dog of Flanders,'' the story of a boy, his dog and
his dream of being a great painter in early 19th-century Flanders,
is advice about following your dream, realizing that money doesn't
buy happiness and making sure that whatever you do in life is done
with ``heart.'' Uplifting sentiments, to be sure, but when they're
plied as relentlessly as they are here, they begin to create
blockage.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Dog of Flanders'' (this is the latest of several film
versions) is adapted from Ouida's classic children's tale. It tells
the story of Nello (Jesse James plays him as a 7-year-old and
Jeremy James Kissner as a more mature boy), an angelic child and
gifted artist who grows up in poverty with his kindly grandfather
(Jack Warden). One day the boy finds a fluffy canine that has been
nearly beaten to death and abandoned by his evil master. Taking the
dog home and nursing him back to health, Nello dubs him Patrasche,
after the middle name of his dead mother.
</P>
<P>
   Nello has a soul mate, and future sweetheart, in Aloise (Farren
Monet and Madyline Sweeten), a more comfortably situated,
blond-tressed little darling who lives nearby and whose father
worries that she might one day want to marry the impoverished
Nello. As the boy's talent begins to bloom, he is taken under the
wing of Michel La Grande (Jon Voight), a painter who, like Nello
and his late mother, worships the talent of Rubens.
</P>
<P>
   But Nello's happily-ever-after isn't easily attained. Falsely
accused of setting a fire, he becomes something of a town pariah
until one dark and snowy night; this is when Patrasche saves the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in Belgium, ``A Dog of Flanders'' is directed by Kevin
Brodie in a style that might charitably be called ``Christmas
pageant cute.'' Even Voight, one of our most reliable character
actors, is hopelessly wooden. Flailing around in this sea of sugary
bromides, he adopts an accent even more indeterminate than the one
he came up with for ``Anaconda.''

`THE 13TH WARRIOR': TEARING OFF A HEAD OR TWO? WHAT FUN! 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Grunt, Aargh. Aieeee! If the juiciest bouts of professional
wrestling on television leave you feeling unfulfilled and pining
for the primal howls of fight-to-the-death combat, ``The 13th
Warrior'' just might be the answer to your prayers. And unlike
professional wrestling, it is saturated in purgative gore.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, the movie gives you the delirious thrill of
ripping off your enemy's head and watching the blood gush by
providing a ringside seat. Sanctified by Jerry Goldsmith's pounding
score _ the symphonic equivalent of heavy metal _ such feats of
carnage seem almost heroic when carried out in a misty mountain
landscape redolent of pure myth (the movie was filmed in British
Columbia) by warriors who resemble the hair-band rock gladiators of
the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the roars and growls and surging fanfares, there's a
tale to be told, although I dare you to piece it together given the
monosyllabic screenplay, much of which is swallowed up by the
engulfing noise.
</P>
<P>
   The story, adapted from Michael Crichton's 1976 novel ``Eaters
of the Dead,'' is inspired by Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan's historical
account of his adventures in Central Asia in the 10th century.
</P>
<P>
   Exiled from Baghdad for a politically unwise sexual liaison,
Ahmed (Antonio Banderas), a poet, is appointed ambassador to a
distant northern land. His loyal manservant, Melchisidek (Omar
Sharif), accompanies him on his journey.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between the two actors is oddly resonant, since
the camera lingers over Banderas' sad, poetic (heavily outlined)
eyes the way it used to hover over Sharif's baby browns in his
``Dr. Zhivago'' days.
</P>
<P>
   While traveling by caravan they run into a band of Norse
warriors who describe a demon army that has been terrorizing their
homeland in nighttime raids. A friendly soothsayer warns that the
enemy can't be defeated unless the attacking force includes a
foreigner. Ahmed, who is effete and urbane compared with his rowdy
road mates, finds himself summarily drafted into the elite killing
squad.
</P>
<P>
   In these early scenes, the movie makes much of the fact that
Ahmed, who speaks English, can't understand the language of his
fellow warriors. But once he masters it, presto: everyone suddenly
speaks English, and Banderas, with his heavy Spanish accent,
becomes the movie's least articulate character.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the film consists of a series of ferocious
skirmishes with the enemy, an equestrian tribe who rides into
battle dressed as bears, carrying torches and who may or may not
have supernatural powers.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed, who becomes the chief strategist, figures out that these
human flesh-eaters dwell inside a cave. He arranges a raid in which
they hunt down the tribal matriarch, a Theda Bara look-alike, who
is a source of their power. From here on, the movie is a
slaughter-by-numbers swashbuckler whose climactic battle seems
almost perfunctory compared with what has come before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It is steeped in gore.

about contemporary life, Albert Brooks plays a Hollywood
screenwriter who has just been honored with a humanitarian award at
a black-tie ceremony. ``What's a humanitarian?'' his daughter asks
on the way home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's someone who's never won the Oscar,'' replies Brooks'
Steven Phillips. No one could accuse Brooks of not knowing his
well-worn, ever fruitful patch of satirical terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can he be accused of ducking the most daunting chimeras that
face baby boom America, since he has such perfect pitch when it
comes to deceptively innocent-looking crises. And so, having dealt
with the meddlesome media (``Real Life''), downward mobility
(``Lost in America''), nagging parents (``Mother'') and a legalese
approach to death itself (``Defending Your Life''), Brooks now
takes on the capriciousness of success in a world of show-business
ethics. Thanks to a delectable comic performance from Sharon Stone,
``The Muse'' gives that world exactly the kind of divinity it
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Brooks, Steven Phillips is a screenwriter losing his
edge. And as the film demonstrates in a string of irresistible
early sequences that define Hollywood's food chain, some signs of
slippage are too telltale to be ignored. Steven lunches at a studio
commissary with a hawk-eyed young executive (Mark Feuerstein, in a
brief but priceless embodiment of any writer's worst nightmare).
``Go! Take some time off!'' the executive condescendingly advises
Steven, just before he begins flattering the actor Lorenzo Lamas
for his brilliance with the written word.
</P>
<P>
   The executive then boasts about the location of his office
(``I'm where Lucille Ball used to be''), only to find Steven no
longer on his best behavior (``Too bad you're not where she is
now!'') Clearly Steven's career is on the brink. But soon afterward
he spots a mysterious visitor at the Bel-Air home of another, much
more stellar writer, Jack (Jeff Bridges, looking the part). Jack,
whose idea of a tennis game is one of the film's great little
throwaways, insists that Sarah (Ms. Stone) is the answer to
Steven's prayers.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of Hollywood jokes about screenwriters
receiving outside inspiration, like the old one about the writer
who's happy to let an elf do his work for him until the elf asks
for screen credit. But Brooks envisions something a little
different. This may be a movie in which Sarah has to tell the
audience what the word muse means (one of nine Greek sister
goddesses capable of inspiring art, poetry or science), but it has
no trouble showing the audience what makes Sarah tick. She's the
ultimate materialist who may or may not deliver creative help in
exchange for lavish blandishments. She's endlessly demanding, much
too carefree and apparently under no obligation to play fair.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to several heavenly cameo appearances by other
filmmakers, this muse comes too highly recommended to be ignored.
(``I'm working on a remake of `Raging Bull,'' but this time I'm
doing it with a real thin guy,'' confides Martin Scorsese while
under the influence of Sarah.) But she's impossible. She wants a
hotel suite on a high floor at the Four Seasons, and that's just
her opening gambit. How far will Steven go to keep her happy?
</P>
<P>
   Although Sarah is played dreamily by Ms. Stone, who wafts
through the film with an alarming mix of nymphlike abandon and
horse sense, ``The Muse'' does reach a philosophical dead end when
it comes to appeasing her. The stakes just rise and rise, and the
standoff doesn't even lose its innocence. As Steven explains to his
wife, Laura (Andie McDowell), who herself eventually falls under
Sarah's spell, he's not attracted to the muse ``because you could
never get aroused by someone who makes you do this many errands.''
The tension builds to a punch line of sorts, but it's not nearly as
interesting as the vision of ambition as a war of nerves that
follows no rules and may never end. Once again, Brooks, who wrote
the screenplay with his longtime collaborator, Monica Johnson,
manages to be funny and bleak with equal ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' looks a shade cheerier than it has any right to.
But as one of Brooks' most broadly entertaining films, it has
enough of a stellar twinkle to bring it a more general audience
than his work usually finds. An especially commercial touch is the
jaunty soundtrack by Elton John, whose orchestral music has the
right fairy tale air for this material. John also contributes a
catchy, earnest ballad about how helpful a muse can be. It's enough
to make you wonder whether he saw the same movie.

`STIFF UPPER LIPS': A MERCHANT-IVORY SENDUP FALLS FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the much-loved television series ``Upstairs
Downstairs'' enticed an American mass audience to inhabit
vicariously the decorous upper-class world of Edwardian England,
millions have embraced the dubious pleasures of couch-potato
snobbery.
</P>
<P>
   For those who became addicted to that series, ``Brideshead
Revisited'' and a subsequent stream of Merchant-Ivory films
delivered enough seductive fixes of Anglophilia to instill a mass
fantasy in the American imagination of English aristocrats as the
ne plus ultra of Western high society.
</P>
<P>
   The time for puncturing that nostalgic dream world has long been
overdue. And now, better late than never, comes ``Stiff Upper
Lips,'' a movie that sends up the Merchant-Ivory ethos in much the
same spirit that ``Airplane'' and ``The Naked Gun'' series have
spoofed Hollywood genres. If only it were funnier.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, a Merchant-Ivory sendup should be a piece of
cake. But as ``Stiff Upper Lips'' stumbles along, its humor is so
scattershot, its tone so wobbly and its casting so uneven that the
movie never coheres.
</P>
<P>
   Far too often it takes the low road with bathroom humor that
reminds you that yes, these genteel English sylphs had lusts and
bodily functions, too. A typical joke has the disgruntled but
oh-so-proper chief steward (named Hudson, of course) of a fancy
estate surreptitiously urinating in the soup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stiff Upper Lips,'' which is set in 1908, is divided into
chapters, each introduced by ridiculously ornate titles. The
opening scenes find the major characters gathered at Ivory Hall, an
English manor presided over by the stuffy Aunt Agnes (Prunella
Scales vaguely mimicking Joan Plowright), who is desperately
conniving to marry off her attractive niece Emily (Georgina Cates).
Leading the list of candidates is Cedric (Robert Portal), the
pompous bosom buddy of Emily's dimwitted brother Edward (Samuel
West).
</P>
<P>
   Absurdly stuffy and pretentious, Cedric, when talking about the
weather, likes to quote Homer, describing the ``rosy-fingered
dawn,'' and often converses in Latin. Emily, of course, can't stand
him.
</P>
<P>
   Her Mr. Right appears in the person of George (Sean Pertwee), a
working-class bloke who saves her from drowning one afternoon and
during the rescue gives her her first tantalizing glimpse of the
male anatomy. When Aunt Agnes goes searching for George in a local
pub called Scum of the Earth, she brings along a nude drawing of
George that Emily has sketched from memory.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody soon repairs to Italy (George is dragged along as a
servant), where Emily and Cedric have their moment of truth.
Stealing into Cedric's bedroom one night, Emily demands, ``I want
my sexual awakening, and I want it now.''
</P>
<P>
   When Cedric proves unresponsive, she bombards him with a list of
erotically provocative words of which only one, ``Eton,'' seems to
have an effect.
</P>
<P>
   Georgina eventually gets her awakening from George in a silly
chasing-each-other-through-the-groves sequence. But because of
their class difference, she decides that marriage is out of the
question. Meanwhile, Cedric and Edward admit they have ``strange
feelings'' for each other. Remaining true to their repressed
upper-class backgrounds, however, it takes the rest of the movie
for them to recognize exactly what those feelings are.
</P>
<P>
   The farther the film moves from England, the more ramshackle it
becomes, and once the travelers reach India, it pretty much falls
apart. The farcical jokes lampooning British imperialism are too
obvious and sloppily executed to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ustinov is wasted in the laugh-free role of Cedric's Uncle
Horace, their eccentric Indian host, who develops an improbable
passion for dear Aunt Agnes.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Stiff Under Lips,'' directed by Gary Sinyor, wanted to be a
lowdown farce, it should have gone much further. But perhaps the
only way a Merchant-Ivory spoof could have worked would have been
to take this high-toned genre on its own terms, exaggerate its
idiosyncrasies, puff up its Ralph Lauren imagery of ultimate good
breeding and be the snootiest movie ever made.
</P>

STEINBECK CENTER HONORS SALINAS' NATIVE SON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALINAS _ Since writers of fiction produce static words on a
page, then leave it to their readers' imagination to bring it all
to life, creating a museum to honor them can be a daunting
proposition.
</P>
<P>
   At Charles Dickens' former home on Doughty Street in London, for
example, visitors can look over an original, longhand manuscript of
``Nicholas Nickleby'' (written on the premises), a writing desk,
historical placards recounting his time there. Again, the
imagination is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Literary buffs generally don't have a quarrel with this, but the
trend in museums today can be described in one word: multimedia.
The rationale is to broaden appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas, which marked its
one-year anniversary in June, embodies the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists might recoil at the sensory assault it presents
_ video clips, sound bites, interactive exhibits _ but it
nonetheless succeeds as an impressive tribute to John Steinbeck,
one of America's most accomplished authors. If it reaches kids (and
adults) who might not be naturally drawn to his corner of the
public library, who can object?
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted it to be accessible to all audiences,'' said Amanda
Holder, spokeswoman for the museum. ``I wouldn't say MTV
generation, but we're all bombarded with stimuli. We didn't want it
to be staid, with just books in cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of tourist attractions, there had never been much to
recommend Salinas, the author's hometown and place of burial. But
this facility is changing that. It stands at the corner of Main and
Central, just off U.S. 101, and is convenient to tourists driving
to San Francisco or visiting Monterey (18 miles to the west on
Highway 68).
</P>
<P>
   The museum is surprisingly large for a place of tribute to an
author _ 37,000 square feet. It also packs quite a punch.
</P>
<P>
   Various exhibit rooms are devoted to specific works, with
Hollywood-like backdrops illustrating ``East of Eden,'' ``The
Grapes of Wrath'' and ``Of Mice and Men.'' Film adaptations of
Steinbeck novels are presented in video clips, featuring Henry
Fonda, James Dean and Nick Nolte.
</P>
<P>
   There is a corral for ``The Red Pony'' _ kids can climb aboard
the mannequin _ the boiler that housed Suzy in ``Sweet Thursday,''
even the actual wood-paneled camper truck in which Steinbeck roamed
America late in his life to write ``Travels With Charley.''
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of literary museums should take heart: There is also
plenty to read. Particularly fascinating are the stinging newspaper
critiques that met ``The Grapes of Wrath'' after its publication in
1939. The novel, which chronicled the bleak plight of Dust Bowl
migrants to California, was widely perceived as being just this
side of socialist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   The museum has proven to be enormously popular, drawing 120,000
visitors in its first year, Holder said.
</P>
<P>
   And here is a development that should cheer purists: The museum
store, Holder said, has sold more Steinbeck books than Barnes &AMP;
Noble and Amazon.com combined.
</P>
<P>
   Come for the bells and whistles ... leave with a book.
</P>
<P>
   The author would undoubtedly approve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; The National Steinbeck Center, at 1 Main St., Salinas, is
open from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except Thanksgiving, Christmas
and New Year's Day. Admission is $7 for adults, $6 for seniors (62
and up) and students with ID, $4 for children (ages 11-17).
Children 10 and under are free. Phone: (831) 796-3833. Web:

 &HT;    From a multiracial culture built amid vast contrasts emerges the
heart of the South American giant
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ A copper-colored woman with ruby-red
lips and slicked-back hair is sitting at Bar de Bofetada, a
sidewalk cafe near this spectacular city's most famous beach,
Ipanema. She is having a beer with a friend, puffing a cigarette
and fawning over her white poodle.
</P>
<P>
   The girl from Ipanema she is not. But in her little black dress
and pearl choker, our aging beauty seems the perfect metaphor for
Brazil: sexy and insouciant, flirtatious and friendly, a simmering
dish of indigenous, European and African flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Since at least 1836, when Charles Darwin described this land as
``one great, wild, untidy, luxuriant hothouse made by nature for
herself,'' Brazil has enjoyed a kind of mythic stature in the
world's imagination. And since 1963's ``The Girl From Ipanema,''
the bossa nova hit by celebrated Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos
Jobim, we've become even more enamored of the musicality and
sensuality of the Brazilian soul.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, travelers to this surreal landscape can see:
</P>
<P>
   Aphrodites and Adonises rising from the foam in just a whisper
of a swimsuit. Cross-dressing Carnival-goers dancing the samba like
peacocks at a disco. Afro-Brazilian women in flowing white skirts,
cooking bean cakes in hot oil and selling them on the streets of
Bahia. Primordial rain forests fluttering with iridescent
butterflies and birds of unspeakable charm. Muscle-bound capoeira
dancers turning cartwheels to the beat of the berimbau (a
rough-hewn stringed instrument attached to a gourd).
</P>
<P>
   But like Mexico or India, Brazil is a place that is festering
with poverty and inflation, violence and despair, a place where
crowded favelas (shantytowns) coexist with sprawling fadenzas
(plantation houses). And like the American South, it is a place
haunted by its past. Since its discovery by the Portuguese 500
years ago, Brazil has embraced and overthrown imperialism, slavery
and military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is a mixed blessing that what is bad news for the
Brazilian economy is usually good news for the U.S. tourist. Though
airfares to Brazil can be prohibitive, once you get here, the
strong dollar means that meals and accommodations are very
affordable, if not cheap.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent two-week journey to this teeming country of 170
million, which covers nearly half of South America and is roughly
the same size as the United States, I found most of the romantic
images we harbor about this tropical paradise to be very much
intact.
</P>
<P>
   But what I really wanted to find was the real Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Was it Rio's magnificent scalloped beaches, set against the
monumental granite peaks of Pao de Acucar (Sugar Loaf) and
Corcovado? Or was it the putti- and gold-encrusted splendor of Ouro
Preto in the central state of Minas Gerais, where an 18th-century
gold rush resulted in a breathtaking accumulation of Baroque
churches? Was it the city of Salvador in the northeastern state of
Bahia, with its African heritage, endless summers and beckoning
beaches? Or was it Sao Paulo, the world's third-largest city, a
megalopolis of 17 million that has been kissed with the Midas
touch? Or, most likely, was it something outside the reach of the
average tourist?
</P>
<P>
   With a sum total of two friends in this vast country, I visited
these four distinctive states, determined to find the answer.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful blur
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a dusky night in Rio. As the sun falls from a purple
sky, hang gliders are sailing like butterflies from the peaks of
Sao Conrado _ a jaggedy mountain on the outskirts of town. Inside
Villa Riso, a former coffee plantation, fragrant flowers are on the
table. A three-piece band is playing soothing jazz. And across the
room, women in colonial costumes stand over steaming tables where
our Sunday feijoada completa has been laid out. Feijoada, a stew of
black beans concocted by slaves and made from all the lesser cuts
of the pig, is the national dish.
</P>
<P>
   We fix our plates and sip our caipirinhas (the national drink, a
winning elixir of crushed limes, sugar and the sugar-cane liquor
known as cachaca). Savoring the authentic meal, one of my first in
Brazil, I turn to the person next to me and say: ``Now this is how
I pictured the real Brazil!''
</P>
<P>
   The comment falls with a thud. It is like taking a visitor to a
restored antebellum village and having him exclaim, ``Oh, so this
is the real South!''
</P>
<P>
   The real Brazil?
</P>
<P>
   The real Brazil was my friend Adilson, picking me up at the Rio
airport and saying that we must hide my bags in the trunk, lest we
get robbed while driving into the city.
</P>
<P>
   The real Brazil was ordering a banana-and-cheese sandwich and a
thick, purple pick-me-up made from guarana fruit at a walk-up juice
bar _ and joining the rest of the nation as it paused to watch
blond tennis star Gustavo Kuerten win the Italian Open on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The real Brazil was the screaming child with the orange-streaked
Medusa hair who begged a coin from me as I walked into the John
Portman-esque Metropolitan Cathedral in the urban sprawl of
downtown Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The real Brazil was Eliane, my hostess in Salvador, who works
three jobs so that she can afford an apartment with a maid and view
of the ocean (but no hot water). Sweet Eliane, who sent a taxi to
the Salvador airport to get me and invited me to stay in her home,
though my only credentials were an e-mail introduction from a
mutual friend.
</P>
<P>
   The real Brazil was stumbling out onto the streets of Ouro Preto
on a Saturday night to discover a multiracial crowd from the local
university, partying harmoniously and unself-consciously, a scene
you'd never see in Athens or Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The real Brazil was Dona Nair Galvao da Silva Moreira, who swept
me into her Sao Paulo kitchen for a Saturday meal with her four
children, five grandchildren, assorted in-laws and guests _ and put
out an amazing feast that included five desserts.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil: included five desserts.
</P>
<P>
   The real Brazil was when the check came for that marvelous
feijoada _ $26 each. ``That's not too bad,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us it is,'' said Adilson.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this is no financial or racial utopia. The economy
goes up and down like the tides. n though slavery wasn't
abolished until 1888, there is an atmosphere of racial tolerance
here that you won't find in the States.
</P>
<P>
   While Americans still have trouble accepting the Thomas
Jefferson-Sally Hemings affair, here miscegenation was part of the
natural order of things from the beginning. In Brazil, you will see
every conceivable mixture of race, every shade of hair and eyes,
every type of body and facial structure.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling
</P>
<P>
   of saudade
</P>
<P>
   Driving into Salvador from the airport, you pass through a kind
of magical threshold, a stretch of road covered entirely with a
canopy of feathery, wavy bamboo trees. There is an aspect of
spirituality about the state of Bahia that seems to seep in from
the Atlantic _ as if the African goddess of the sea, Iemanja, is
whispering in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a womb of Brazil, this it.
</P>
<P>
   After the Portuguese struck ground here in 1501, Salvador was
the nation's capital for more than 200 years. Over three centuries,
3.5 million slaves were brought to Bahia _ and to this day, any
Brazilian will tell you that Bahia, which is about 60 percent
black, is part of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. slaveholders tried to stamp out any vestiges of
African religion, Candomble was allowed to flourish here alongside
Catholicism. Crafty slaves _ matching their own deities with
similar Catholic icons _ could retain their Africanness even as
they converted to Christianity. If the slaves called Mary
``Iemanja'' and Jesus ``Oxala,'' then the Portuguese were simply
deaf to it all. The Candomble presence, and the African foodways,
have endured.
</P>
<P>
   I fell under a spell the moment I got here. Just the fact that I
had to go north to get to a warmer clime gave me a charge. Welcome
to South America, brother.
</P>
<P>
   There was even some strange, ethereal music dancing across the
air to greet me. It took me a day or two to realize that those
evocative chants were coming, not from sea nymphs, but tiny
speakers attached to propane-gas delivery trucks. The angelic voice
was slowly crooning the words: ``Shell gas ... Shell gas.'' I soon
discovered that most Brazilians, regardless of economic status, use
the detachable propane canisters to fuel their stoves. In Sao
Paulo, the gas trucks blast Beethoven's Ninth or the theme from
``Romeo and Juliet,'' while in Ouro Preto the drivers just ring a
little bell to win the customer's attention.
</P>
<P>
   My next few days in Salvador were spent checking out the
markets, food stands, churches, beaches and, particularly, the
Pelourhino, the recently restored colonial center on an acropolis
overlooking the bay. The Pelourhino is named after the public
whipping post (or pillory), used for slaves and criminals. Today it
is a festive neighborhood of Easter egg-colored stucco buildings
dating to the 16th century, Baroque churches and Bahian women in
white turbans, billowing skirts and lacy blouses.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Brazil's biggest music stars _ Joao Gilberto, Caetano
Veloso, Gilberto Gil and Maria Bethania _ hail from Bahia. In the
Pelourhino, I walked past the home of Olodum, the Afro-Brazilian
drum corps that has collaborated with Paul Simon, and Bale
Folclorico da Bahia, a dance ensemble that has performed in Atlanta
and at Spoleto in recent years. There's also a foundation dedicated
to Jorge Amado, Brazil's most popular novelist and a resident of
Bahia.
</P>
<P>
   Salvador is said to have at least 365 churches (Eliane tells me
it's because the vainglorious landowners would build a church every
time there was to be a family wedding). The most interesting ones
are Sao Francisco and the Church of the Third Order of Sao
Francisco, next door to each other in the Pelourhino, and Our Lady
of Bonfim, in the western suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Sao Francisco is a 17th-century Baroque monstrosity whose
interior is virtually drenched in gold-leaf carvings. But I was
even more enthralled when I rounded the corner and saw the Church
of the Third Order, with its wondrously carved facade of cherubs,
saints and rococo squiggles and flourishes. Its cloister is a
soothing outdoor gallery of pillars and arches, blue Portuguese
tiles and marble floors.
</P>
<P>
   The church of Bonfim is the apotheosis of the marriage of
Candomble and Catholicism. Be prepared for the onslaught of vendors
trying to tie good-luck ribbons _ lembrancas _ around your wrist.
If they do, you must make three wishes, and by the time the fetish
falls off, the spirits will have answered your requests _ or so
goes the belief.
</P>
<P>
   My wish is to get back to Bahia soon so that I may have another
acaraje _ the African pea cake that is fried in dende (palm) oil,
then stuffed with dried shrimp, vatapa (a complex spread of nuts,
coconut milk, shrimp and various spices) and served with salsa. You
can get these big boys all over town from Bahia women dressed in
traditional garb.
</P>
<P>
   In Bahia, I found the Brazil that I had been looking for. This
feeling of saudade (pronounced ``sow-DAH-jee'') _ the Brazilian
word for a mixture of yearning and happiness that cannot be
translated into any other languague _ appeared the day Eliane and I
stumbled upon a makeshift bar on a hill by the sea.
</P>
<P>
   We wanted a beer, so the owner of the concession stand scratched
up a couple of chairs and a wobbly table. There was music from a
car parked by the curb. The sun was setting. Young men were playing
soccer in the park below us. The owner of the hut offered us a shot
of cachaca infused with guarana. Across the bay was the sunny city
of Salvador da Baia de Todos os Santos (Saviour of the Bay of All
Saints) _ 500 years of history jutting outward into a bright blue
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is so Brazil,'' said Eliane. ``Sitting by the ocean,
watching soccer, having a beer and listening to music _ from a
car.'' She burst out laughing. And I knew the moment was real.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil: other droopy things.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best art collections in town is at Museu Chacara do
Ceu. Industrialist Raymundo Ottoni De Castro Maya's modern
travertine house is stocked with a first-rate collection of works
by Monet, Picasso, Matisse, Modigliani, Dali and others. Here, I
first encountered the paintings of Candido Portinari, a
20th-century Brazilian artist whose portraits blend cool European
gestures with the floral exuberance of his homeland. In an upstairs
gallery, be sure to pull out the print drawers stocked with
watercolors by Jean-Baptiste Debret (1768-1848), who captured the
opulence and oppression of colonial life in exquisite, sometimes
painful, detail. Outside, a hulking brick ruin has been stabilized
and equipped with stairs that take you up to a series of tiered
overlooks offering terrific views of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Corcovado. How funny to discover that there is a Carnival group
called Savaco de Cristo, or ``Christ's Underarm,'' an irreverent
homage to the massive statue of Christ that looms 2,400 feet above
the city. Just another example of how Brazilians have no problem
mixing the bawdy and the beatific. Whatever you think of the
statue, there's nothing like the view from the summit of Corcovado
on a clear day. Up here, you can almost hear Joao Gilberto crooning
Jobim's paean to this much-beloved mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown. It's an enervating experience to walk through this
maze of belching cars, opulent architecture and ultra-modern cubes.
Edgar da Fonseca's 1979 Catedral Metropolitana (Metropolitan
Cathedral) holds 15,000 people standing up and looks like a cross
between a Mayan temple and a John Portman. With its portly cuppola
and ornately carved friezes, the 90-year-old Teatro Municipal
echoes the Paris Opera. Right across the street is Museu Nacional
de Belas Artes, which has room after room of beautifully installed
Brazilian and European paintings, including a Portinari Virgin in
robes the color of hot burning embers. One of the city's prettiest
churches is Our Lady of Candelaria. With its sinuously carved
mahogany doors and delirious mixture of baroque and renaissance
styles, it's a dazzler.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants. Downtown, go to Confeitaria Colombo, a ravishingly
appointed art nouveau coffeehouse where you can have a tall glass
of dirty limeade (limonada suissa) and a sandwich or bon-bon. This
is the place to soak up old-world charm: silver sugar bowls the
size of breadboxes, mirrors on every surface and an oval,
stained-glass skylight that commands your eyes to look up to the
second-floor ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Tereza, Bar do Arnaudo is a small open-air tavern
serving some of the best Carioca dishes in the city _ steaming
bowls of cabrito (a stew of goat, tomatoes, onions and spices),
beans, rice.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't get to Bahia, Sire Mole &AMP; Cia, on Copacabana,
offers extraordinary moquecas (seafood stews), including the one I
had with the signature soft-shell crab. Also good were the
caipirinhas; the casquinhas de siri (baked, stuffed crab in a
scallop shell); and the quindim (a wonderfully eggy, bright-yellow
coconut macaroon).
</P>
<P>
   To sample Brazilian barbecue (churrasco), get thyself to O
Porcao in Ipanema, where waiters come to the table bearing skewers
of every conceivable type of pork, beef, chicken and sausage. To
begin, there are cafeteria-style tables laden with sushi, warm
seafood dishes and a salad bar that goes on and on, with everything
from hearts of palm to okra. If you are too busy stuffing your
face, there's a little cue card for the server that says ``nao''
(no) or ``sim'' (yes). By the way, ``porcao'' means ``big pig.''
(In the states, you can find O Porcao in Miami and New York.) For
feijoada _ the national dish of pork and black beans _ it's hard to
beat the one at Villa Riso, but it's available on Sundays only.
</P>
<P>
   Just leave some room for those butterflies to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Delta is offering round-trip fares to Rio de Janeiro _ with a
stopover in Sao Paulo _ for $949 (KPPAZ); there are currently no
restrictions. Avianca has nonstops to Rio from Miami for $459
(XSP30NR); coupled with the current best Atlanta-Miami fares of
$139, the total would be $597. To Salvador, Brazil, Delta's round
trip fare is $1,098, with a stopover in Sao Paulo.

 &HT;    O Rio de Janeiro, where the mountains kiss the sea
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By Wendell Brock
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ It's twilight, and I'm floating in a
tin can above a sea that shimmers like a sheet of crinkled Saran
Wrap. Below, cars speeding along the beach look like beads of light
being squeezed through a tube. Through the window, the moon is a
slice of cool watermelon. For the first time in my life, the
butterflies in my stomach are having fun.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in a cable car whirring up Sugar Loaf, the 1,295-foot-tall
oceanside granite behemoth that makes Atlanta's 825-foot Stone
Mountain seem as flat as a biscuit. If this city is one of the
urban wonders of the world _ 12 million people squeezed onto a
curvaceous strand of beach punctuated by mountains, palms and
skyscrapers _ then this is one of its most mind-bending views. I'd
seen it on numerous postcards and videos, but I had never seen it
like this.
</P>
<P>
   Lurching upward, ears pop, and knees wobble. But once I glimpse
Corcovado's statue of Christ the Redeemer, wrapped in a halo of
honey-hued light, once I see the harbor lights glowing like a
necklace draped across a queen's throat, I let go of the vertigo.
</P>
<P>
   From dawn to dusk, from midnight till morn, Rio is an
intoxicating swirl of jazz and cocktails, samba and soccer, rhythm
and romance. It mingles the film noir sheen of Miami, the rugged
beauty of San Francisco or Capetown and the gritty texture of
Buenos Aires or Los Angeles. As composer Antonio Carlos Jobim once
said, ruminating on the body politic: ``It is difficult to
distinguish where the feminine ends and nature begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting by the Copacabana Palace one night _ gazing up at a sky
the color of dusky plums, watching the pool's reflections dance
across the side of the big Hollywood-style hotel _ I sipped my
drink and decided that I had found the kind of hush-hush glamour
hole where a Garbo or Gatsby might take respite.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a grand hotel. The blond-leather cushions felt like
butter. The bottles of champagne _ even beer _ were always on ice.
And wait a minute: Did that guitar-strumming singer just do ``The
Girl From Ipanema''?
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't staying here, just soaking up some free atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   After spending a few days on Ipanema, I had moved up to
Copacabana beach, checking into the Ouro Verde Hotel, just a
five-minute stroll from the Palace and about half the price. I
loved the old-fashioned Ouro Verde, with its cool travertine walls,
its 15-story atrium and its commodious rooms with overstuffed
chairs and closets designed for ocean-going trunks. I loved its
impeccable, 24-hour room service and the little leather-and-wood
bar, where the bartender makes a perfect caipirinha (the national
drink of mulled limes, sugar and sugar-cane liquor) and puts out a
dish of nuts just for you.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder people get stuck on these beaches and never see
anything else. Even off-season, the trademark wavy-patterned tile
sidewalks are brimming with sun lovers, bodybuilders, beggars and
plain-old tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, I must admit that Ipanema, where the
much-loved singer Caetano Veloso and Oscar-nominated actress
Ferdanda Montenegro live, was something of a letdown. Sure, the
beaches _ and the bodies _ are lovely. But since I had envisioned a
South Beach-style scene with plenty of action right by the
Atlantic, I was disappointed to discover little more than beige
apartment buildings facing the water.
</P>
<P>
   But strolling inland, I found that certain frisson: cafes, bars,
hotels and shops of every caliber; juice bars with stacks of
pineapples, oranges, papayas, mangoes and fruits that I didn't even
know existed. (My favorite drink was the hortela, a frothy,
restorative pineapple-and-mint elixir.) You can also find plenty of
cheap luncheonettes, where you can order delicious fried codfish
balls (bolinhos de bacalhau), cheese rolls (pao de queijo) and
fried and baked pastries stuffed with meats and cheeses. With a
beer, these are wonderful noshes to take after a swim.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, every tourist is required to stop at Bar Garota
de Ipanema, where Antonio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes wrote
their immortal song in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ipanema and Copacabana have considerable charms, head a
bit farther south by bus or car and you'll find even more stunning
beaches and a certain measure of serenity at places like Sao
Conrado and Barra da Tijuca. At Sao Conrado, you may lie on the
sand and sip ice-cold coconut juice straight from the shell _ or
join the hang gliders at Gavea Stone. As my friends drove me
through this neighborhood one Sunday, we slowed down just long
enough for a hang-gliding instructor to call out to me in
Portuguese: ``Do you want to fly?''
</P>
<P>
   Next time.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I never found time to learn to samba, tour a
favela (the hillside shantytowns where the samba was born) or see
the kitschy Carmen Miranda museum. And yet my glass was always full
_ whether watching a street vendor fry churros (strips of dough
squeezed from a pastry tube) or watching a boy tote a bird cage
covered in floral wrapping paper to keep his feathered friend from
broiling. Yes, even when there is no Carnival, even when the samba
schools (the equivalent of New Orleans' Mardi Gras krewes) are not
palpitating with hip-swaying dancers and percussionists practicing
for the big day, Rio is a cosmopolitan jungle of restaurants and
jazz rooms, museums and tropical gardens. Here, then, are a few of
my favorite places:
</P>
<P>
   Botanical Garden. Imagine an Edward Scissorhands applying his
considerable talents to a Brazilian jungle and you get the idea of
this beautifully clipped garden. There's an entire boulevard of
towering royal palms, which look like ultraskinny straws topped
with pompoms. In one orchid house, where a sign tells you that
you're in a country with 2,300 species, blossoms hang like mobiles
and attach themselves to almost anything that stands still long
enough. In the carnivorous-plant conservatory, insects that stand
still long enough are swallowed by Godzilla-like Venus' flytraps or
long-necked pitcher plants covered with motley patterns of burgundy
and celery green. In this 34-acre park, there are faux Amazon
jungles, ponds with table-top-size lily pads and brick gazebos
covered entirely with fig vine.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Tereza. This neighborhood, high in the hills overlooking
downtown and the ocean, is Rio's equivalent to Atlanta's Inman
Park. In the 19th century, the gentility built rambling houses with
walled gardens and breezy porches. Though you can still take a
trolley up, it's probably safer to catch a taxi. Then, if it's
daylight, wander down the curving cobblestone streets, draped with
palms and bougainvillea and shot through with evocative views of
water and sky. Like almost everywhere in Brazil, every nook and
cranny is sprouting with ferns, orchids and other droopy things.

 &HT;    For those born to shop, Minnesota megamall is Valhalla
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ The first thing I hear are the shrieks from
the daredevils riding the Screaming Yellow Eagle, a large platform
that hurls riders above treetops and then dives back to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   But then the sound of a distant beat catches my ear, and for a
moment I fear I'm having a flashback _ the macarena.
</P>
<P>
   Hordes of people are circling a rotunda on three levels,
smacking noisy clackers and bumping their hips to the once-trendy
tune. They are wearing T-shirts with messages such as ``Go Fay Go''
and cheering as housekeepers from Super 8 Motels across the country
compete in timed bed-making relays.
</P>
<P>
   I turn away just in time to catch a glimpse of a bride and her
lilac-draped attendants descending on an escalator. I'm intrigued,
so I follow, only to do a double take. Is that ... Jesse Ventura?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the wrestler turned Minnesota governor is signing his
autobiography, ``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed,'' in front of Sears.
</P>
<P>
   This can only be the Mall of America: a 4.2 million-square-foot
faux city. Amenities such as a wedding chapel, amusement park,
health clinic and a university are mere supporting players, of
course, to the nearly 500 stores, with themes ranging from
refrigerator magnets to babushkas.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, a shopaholic's dream, surreal as it may seem at
times.
</P>
<P>
   If the notion of heading to Minnesota on a shopping vacation
sounds a little indulgent, well, there are deals that make it not
so easy to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines World Vacations offers special air-hotel
packages from Atlanta year-round _ many of the convenient lodgings
have free shuttles to the airport and the mall. From Atlanta,
two-night deals start from $327 per person until October, when the
price falls to $319.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd rather make your own arrangements, we've seen fares as
low as $80 round trip to Minneapolis, though usually they're in the
$200 to $250 range.
</P>
<P>
   For those born to shop, what's so bad about a little indulgence?

 &HT;    Pack comfy shoes for Mall of America
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Minn. _ Mall of America managers estimate that 42.5
million shoppers visit this mecca of merchandise yearly _ more than
Disney World, Graceland and the Grand Canyon combined. And nearly
40 percent travel more than 150 miles to get here.
</P>
<P>
   Folks like mother and daughter Lori and Megan Taylor of Tulsa,
Okla. ``I asked Megan what she wanted for her high school
graduation and she immediately said, `A trip to the Mall of
America,''' says Lori, during a recent visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Taylors are doing a four-day shopathon, which Lori deems
``one day too many.'' I find a weekend to be an ideal amount of
time. Arrive Friday evening in time for dinner and an initial
survey; leave late Sunday afternoon with bags stuffed with things
you never knew you couldn't live without.
</P>
<P>
   Like a moose-shaped cookie cutter. Or maybe some Scandinavian
clogs. Or, what the heck, a Jesse Ventura doll.
</P>
<P>
   But you will need a game plan (and at least one pair of really
comfortable shoes). If a shopper spends 10 minutes in every store,
it would take more than 86 hours to complete the visit.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip, I only have 14 hours. So my approach is to work a
wing at a time, cruising all floors, but passing by stores we have
in Atlanta, including Nordstrom, Sears and Macy's. Bloomingdale's
is the only anchor store I visit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night begins in Camp Snoopy, the amusement park encased
by the mall, complete with roller coaster, Ferris wheel and a log
ride. Traveling solo and short on time, I skip the thrill rides.
But I do find the General Store, on the south edge of the park, and
make my first purchase: big red Betty Crocker spoons. (Minneapolis
is Betty's home.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I tackle the south wing, leaving the remaining three
wings for the next day. I'm spending cautiously, though, not
wanting to let loose too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, my 12-hour odyssey begins when the doors open at 10
a.m. Within 55 minutes, I have several bags, enough to send me
searching for a locker. The best find of the morning blitz are
tennis-ball-size bath seltzers scented with vanilla and mint. (I
know I'll be grateful when I drop one of these into a hot bath when
I'm done playing consumer.)
</P>
<P>
   The seltzers are at Basin, a bath shop found only at the Mall of
America. It boasts buckets and bins filled with unusually scented
soaps, shampoo not in bottles but in bars, and even fresh asparagus
facials in the refrigerated case.
</P>
<P>
   It's my favorite of the eastside shops, though As Seen on T.V.
To You runs a close second. Here, you can get one of those super
slicer dicers or a Bacon Wave, just like you've seen on TV _ no
mail order required.
</P>
<P>
   By 12:45, I've conquered half of the north wing. The retro
platform sandals at Steve Madden Shoes are tempting. But my heels
hurt. So instead of trying on shoes, I head to the Twin City Grill
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The mahogany-paneled diner offers respite from the mall's
hyper-stimulation; the St. Paul chopped salad, with chicken, pasta,
bacon, tomato and blue cheese, is just the right refuel.
</P>
<P>
   Next: the west side.
</P>
<P>
   The Eddie Bauer Home Collection lures me in, and then I linger
awhile at Filene's Basement, where the thing I admire most is
Claire Grubbs' shopping bag on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Grubbs drove from Atkinson, N.H., to Ocala, Fla., to pick up her
sister, Louise Foley. Then they made their way to the Mall of
America (with stops at Graceland and Branson, Mo.).
</P>
<P>
   Though seasoned shoppers, they are in awe. ``I feel like we are
just walking around with our mouths hanging open,'' Foley says.
</P>
<P>
   I follow them to the food court for a break, where among the
options are two Minnesota delicacies _ fried cheese curds and pike
on a stick. The curds prove too greasy even for this Southern gal.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 p.m., I've conquered the grid, but at a price _ my feet are
aching, my knees protesting, my hips cracking. Behold, is that a
spa before my eyes?
</P>
<P>
   I rush into the Bodyline Mediterranean Spa and ask if I can get
a foot massage. It's booked. (Note to self: Call ahead next time.)
</P>
<P>
   But I do not pout long. Within moments, I spot Nail Trix. There,
I spend 30 glorious minutes getting a pedicure while reclining in a
massaging chair.
</P>
<P>
   From there, I blissfully stride through Bloomingdale's, then
relax with a glass of wine at the California Cafe's terrace
overlooking the amusement park. To cap off the ultimate Mall of
America day, I decide to catch a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, I wander toward my locker, taking in the neon lights
in Camp Snoopy and kicking through some confetti left from a Super
8 Motels bed-making championship earlier in the day. I recall how
Lori Taylor and I both dropped our shopping bags at the same moment
to cheer on a North Carolina bed-maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Americana,'' she said, ``through and through.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Information: The Mall of America Web site,

Vacations, ask a local travel agent or call 1-800-727-1111.
</P>
<P>
   FUN FACTS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  600,000 to 900,000 people visit the Mall of America each week,
depending on the season.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  258 Statues of Liberty or 67 Washington Monuments could fit
inside the mall.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than 1,500 couples have been married at the mall since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than 25 million rides were given at Camp Snoopy in its
first five years.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The mall is not heated _ the people, along with the miles of
lights, provide enough warmth to keep the complex toasty warm
during winter.

`SENIORS' FIND A CHALLENGE AT AIR FORCE BOOT CAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Troy Mclain doesn't have an AARP card, doesn't get
a Social Security check and doesn't qualify for senior citizen
discounts.
</P>
<P>
   But fellow recruits at Lackland Air Force Base call the
laid-back Alabama man ``Grandpa Troy'' anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The woman slowly crawling through a 50-yard swath of sand, a
mushroom cloud of dust exploding in her face, goes by the nickname
``Momma,'' and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   At 34, Helen Lane is almost old enough to be a mother to many of
her fellow recruits, many of them fresh out of high school. But she
concedes nothing to the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old is what you think it is,'' said Lane, who lives in Corpus
Christi with her husband, Melvin, and her 17-year-old daughter,
Shelonda. ``And in my mind, I'm not old.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes and no.
</P>
<P>
   As young recruits go, Lane and Mclain, 26, are getting up there.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force stops taking active-duty recruits at age 27. The
cutoff for being sworn into the Air Force Reserve and Air National
Guard, the services chosen by these two, is 35.
</P>
<P>
   Before the fiscal year ends Sept. 30, only a relative handful of
the 31,000 recruits to graduate from basic training at Lackland
will be 35. Most recruits are under 21. None of the 2,505
active-duty recruits training at Lackland in July were 34 years
old, and only 21 were a middle-aged 26.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard didn't provide an
age breakdown for the 393 weekend-warriors-in-training at the base
last month, but few were likely to be in their mid-30s.
</P>
<P>
   These older recruits are not desperate, down-on-their-luck duds
_ like Bill Murray's comic character in the movie ``Stripes'' _
``not by any means, especially today with the way the work force is
in the civilian world,'' said Master Sgt. Lori Mills, a drill
instructor at Lackland.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they all come here originally because they want to be
here,'' she smiled. ``I mean, it is volunteer.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane and Mclain, who graduated from basic training last week,
joined the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard, respectively.
They're praised by fellow recruits, among them John Gonzales, 18,
of San Antonio, who said, ``They're cool.''
</P>
<P>
   A father of three, Mclain was a full-time college student
working 60 to 70 hours a week for his father-in-law, who repairs
and sells wrecked cars in Prattville, Ala., just outside
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Since he didn't have time to study, he would record classroom
lectures, then listen to the tape later.
</P>
<P>
   Mclain hopes to follow in the footsteps of a cousin, a Guard
member and civil service worker who logs a four-day week.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, that professional shift in gears could yield at
least one extra perk beyond giving him more time at home with his
wife, Ashley, daughters Alexandra, 2, and Caden, 4, and his son,
Taylor, 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough working for a family. It's good and it's bad,''
Mclain said, explaining that he sees more independence in the new
life he's staking out in the Guard.
</P>
<P>
   An administrative assistant and sophomore law major at Park
College in Corpus Christi, Lane, too, had strong personal reasons
for joining the Air Force Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   She sees basic training and a stint in the Reserve as the first
step in a new life, one that will let her at last emerge from the
shadow cast by her husband, a career Navy man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've supported my husband throughout his career and now on to
a second career, and so now it's my turn to start my career,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He misses me, but he supports me and understands everything,''
Lane added. ``He's OK with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ties that bind recruits to far-off families, though, are a
concern.
</P>
<P>
   While older trainees do well in basic training, ``they can also
have more home-front issues,'' said Col. Stefan Eisen, commander of
the 737th Training Group at Lackland. But, he noted, older airmen
in training tend to be more mature than their younger counterparts
and are more likely to become leaders.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So it would seem for Mclain and Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Airman Basic Nicole Bourque, 24, of Providence, R.I., said Lane
is known for looking after other women in her dorm and, now and
then, braiding hair. Lane's best quality, she said, is ``her
patience and willingness to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Muiz, 18, of Eagle Pass, shares that sentiment. She
said Lane is a mom away from mom. ``Whenever I'm pretty stressed
out, I go to her,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a fatherly countenance, the soft-spoken Mclain leads
by example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when we're in our day room and people are talking
too much, he'll treat us like kids,'' Gonzales said. ``He'll go
outside and get a switch and come back.''
</P>
<P>
   A recruit leader, Mclain not only likes and understands his
drill instructors, but loves the service.
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud to serve,'' she said. ``I can't wait to put my
(dress) blues on.''

   &LR; IF YOU GO &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; GETTING THERE: By car from Los Angeles, Monterey is a 350-mile
drive via Highway 101, for which a traveler should allow seven
hours. Several airlines fly into Monterey. With a Saturday
stay-over, you can find a fare under $200; without it, the fare can
be more than double that. Another option is to fly into San Jose
(Southwest's fares from the L.A. area are routinely under $200),
rent a car and make the 78-mile drive south to Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   AQUARIUM: It lies at the south end of Cannery Row. During the
summer (May 31 to Sept. 6) and on all holidays, it is open 9:30
a.m. to 6 p.m. daily. The rest of the year, it is open from 10 a.m.
to 6 p.m.; closed Christmas. Admission is $15.95 for adults, $12.95
for seniors (ages 65 and up) and students, $6.95 for children (ages
3-12) and the disabled. ``Splash Zone,'' a kids-oriented area
featuring numerous hands-on exhibits, is scheduled to open April 8,
2000. Phone: (831) 648-4888. Web: www.mbayaq.org.
</P>
<P>
   LODGING: Inns of Monterey operates four small, tasteful hotels
in the area, with nightly rates generally ranging from $179 to $429
(continental breakfast included), with package stays available. The
oceanfront Spindrift Inn, situated in the heart of Cannery Row, was
found to be a delightful property, with fireplaces, featherbeds,
window seats _ and no extra charge for the ocean breezes that waft
through the rooms. Street-side rooms can be a bit noisy, however,
especially with dance clubs and nighttime construction projects
directly across the street, but the hotel staff promptly provided a
box fan to help muffle the intrusion. Information on all four
hotels: (800) 232-4141. Web: www.innsofmonterey.com.
</P>
<P>
   DINING: On the oceanfront at Cannery Row, Paradiso Trattoria
(654 Cannery Row) was a pleasant lunchtime option, serving up an
extensive array of seafood. A short distance away, in downtown
Monterey, excellent dinners were found at both Montrio (414 Calle
Principal) and Stokes Adobe (500 Hartnell St.). Tarpy's Roadhouse,
on the outskirts of Monterey (2999 Monterey-Salinas Highway),
combined some intrguing lunch choices with a comprehensive wine
list.
</P>
<P>
   INFORMATION: The Monterey County Visitors &AMP; Convention Bureau
will mail out a 120-page brochure that includes information on
attractions, lodging and dining. Phone: (831) 649-1770. Web:

</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Classical Rarities
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just that it's rare stuff, but the performances are
incredible,'' said Ernie Gilbert, president of Video Artists
International, a distributor of opera and classical music
programming in Pleasantville, N.Y. That's as it should be with the
renowned Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Fritz Reiner and George
Szell on the podium. What's new here is that Reiner, Szell and the
Chicago can now be seen and heard in full performances of
symphonies, not just excerpts, for the first time on video.
</P>
<P>
   With the orchestra's Rosenthal Archives and WGN Television in
Chicago, Gilbert has put together a series of programs broadcast by
WGN from 1953 to 1963. The first two tapes will be released next
week. On Volume 1 Reiner conducts Beethoven's Symphony No. 7, the
``Arrival of the Queen of Sheba'' from Handel's Oratorio
``Solomon'' and Beethoven's Egmont Overture, Opus 84. Volume 2,
with Szell conducting, includes Beethoven's Symphony No. 5,
Mussorgsky's Prelude to ``Khovanshchina'' and Berlioz's ``Roman
Carnival'' Overture.
</P>
<P>
   The Reiner program, from 1954, lasts 49 minutes on video, more
than long enough to encompass the complete Beethoven Seventh.
Previously on video there have been only clips of symphonies. The
Szell video is from 1961 and runs 46 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Next month the company plans to issue the next two volumes,
which feature Leopold Stokowski (no symphonies but Bach, Brahms and
Rimsky-Korsakov) and Pierre Monteux (Beethoven's Symphony No. 8).
The tapes are $24.95 each. Information: (800) 477-7146.
</P>
<P>
   All Disks on Deck
</P>
<P>
   DVD, growing impressively if not spectacularly, is about to
receive two strong shots of adrenaline. On Tuesday Paramount will
release ``Titanic,'' a year after the film's appearance on tape.
That's quite a lag time, to be sure, but in this case, distributors
say, the disk was delayed so as not to distract from cassette
sales. Now that it has finally made landfall, such a huge title is
expected to nudge more people into buying DVD players.
</P>
<P>
   And with those machines, beginning on Oct. 26, they will be able
to screen the first wave of big Disney animated titles to be issued
on disk. ``Pinocchio'' will lead off, with ``101 Dalmatians,''
``Hercules,'' ``Mulan,'' ``Lady and the Tramp,'' ``Peter Pan'' and
``Simba's Pride (Lion King II)'' scheduled in November, and ``The
Jungle Book'' and ``The Little Mermaid'' to come in December.
</P>
<P>
   Disney, of course, has put some of its live-action features on
DVD, but it has hesitated with its major animated films. In the
early going, DVD has primarily been the territory of technophiles,
who tend to be male and action-film oriented. Now, however, there
is evidence that the disk is spreading to the family market. (Read
small children.)
</P>
<P>
   Children and Disney animated films, watched endlessly, did much
to make the video sales market in the late 1980s and '90s. A
company statement notes that DVD could be in 15 million households,
via either set-top players or computers with DVD-ROM drives, by the
end of the year. Artwork will be on top of the disks to make sure
the littlest ones insert them correctly.
</P>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   Playing by Heart
</P>
<P>
   Willard Carroll's highly buffed soap opera lays out the lives
and loves of an assortment of attractive Angelenos. At the senior
end of the spectrum, Hannah (Gena Rowlands, with Sean Connery) is
in a delayed snit over a relationship her husband, Paul ( Connery),
had with another woman 25 years earlier. Then there is Meredith
(Gillian Anderson), who is having a hard time accepting Trent (Jon
Stewart), a logical match whom she finds too good to be true. And
there is the brash, aggressive Joan (Angelina Jolie), who is having
her ups and downs with the morose Keenan (Ryan Philippe). With
these and other entanglements, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times, a result is ``a likably sappy romantic comedy that suggests
Robert Altman's `Short Cuts' dipped in chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   _1999. Miramax. $104.16. 121 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Like It is
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin (Roger Daltrey), plays a well-groomed gay
recording-company mogul, but the real story involves Craig (Steve
Bell), a baby-faced bare-knuckles fighter from the streets of
Blackpool, England, and his casual lover, Matt (Ian Rose), a
worldly music promoter visiting from London. That pairing irritates
Paula (Dani Behr), who needs attention from Matt. Other pairings
ensue as Craig is pushed into an intoxicating world of cocaine and
expensive parties. `` Rose and Bell do fine jobs as the lovers, and
Ms. Behr is convincingly arrogant and needy'' (Anita Gates).
</P>
<P>
   _1998. First Run Features. $79.95. 90 minutes. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   Blood, Guts, Bullets and Octane
</P>
<P>
   Two motor-mouthed used-car salesmen (Joe Carnahan and Dan Leis)
are offered $250,000 if they will let a 1963 Pontiac simply sit on
their lot for 48 hours. Not too surprisingly, there are some bad
people involved, and blood is found dripping from the trunk, which
should discourage one salesman's plan to steal the vehicle and hold
it for a $500,000 ransom. Carnahan's film aspires to be a David
Mamet slice of lowlife with some Quentin Tarantino-like muscle
flexing, but ``it is all grindingly familiar and has been done by
others with more style and flexibility'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   _1998. Universal. $99.36. 87 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Office Space
</P>
<P>
   In his first live feature film, Mike Judge, the creator of
``Beavis and Butt-head,'' distills the pettiness of office life in
a sneakily savage portrait of a back-stabbing, passive-aggressive
middle-management despot named Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole). With
misery at its height, a rebellion breaks out when a programmer (Ron
Livingston) adopts a carefree attitude and starts showing up when
he wants and tipping over office furniture for a lark. In the end,
though, everything has the ``loose-jointed feel of a bunch of
sketches packed together into a narrative that doesn't gather much
momentum'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   _1999. Fox. $104.16. 100 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time, appeared on television or been on
videocassette in earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRABAND and THEY MADE ME A FUGITIVE. Two British films noirs
of the '40s, both available on tape for the first time, take their
cue from the shadowy world of the American genre. In Emeric
Pressburger and Michael Powell's acclaimed comedy thriller
``Contraband'' (1940, 88 minutes) a Danish sea captain (Conrad
Veidt) and a passenger (Valerie Hobson) are kidnapped by Nazi spies
and must negotiate London in blackout conditions. The film plays
very well today, thanks in no small part to the cinematography of
Freddie Young (``Lawrence of Arabia,'' ``Doctor Zhivago'').
</P>
<P>
   In postwar England crime is surging in Alberto Cavalcanti's dark
and violent ``They Made Me a Fugitive'' (1947, 96 minutes), with
Trevor Howard as a former serviceman who takes up black
marketeering. Kino. $24.95 each. Both films are in black and white.

ALBUM OF THE WEEK: `AS THE WORLD BURNS' BY THE ARSONISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARSONISTS: ``As the World Burns'' (Matador). ``When our worlds
collide, MCs will get fried,'' the Arsonists intone on this disk,
their long-playing debut, and it's clear to whom they're announcing
the apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream artists like Puff Daddy had better watch their
Armani-clad backs because the Arsonists, a five-man version of a
large and longstanding Brooklyn-based crew, are leading the
underground's battle for the soul of a genre old enough to need to
return to its roots.
</P>
<P>
   The rappers Q-Unique, Jise, Swel, D-Stroy and Freestyle all
declare proficiency in hip-hop's essential ``four elements'' _
rapping, break dancing, graffiti tagging and making music through
the art of the DJ.
</P>
<P>
   The Arsonists take turns producing the music on this disk, and
the group would benefit from one visionary DJ. Musical interest
builds on the menacing ``Live to Tell,'' the zany ``Pyromaniax''
and ``Lunchroom Take-Out,'' in which Swel and a guest, GR8 Scott,
jovially battle over a turntable that sounds like congas. But even
when the beats sink into the background, the energetic rapping
draws in listeners.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid-fire rhymes offer many jokes and references to decode.
On ``Frienemies'' (about untrustworthy allies) and ``D-Sturbed'' (a
rant by D-Stroy that recalls the hardcore classic
``Institutionalized'' by Suicidal Tendencies), the Arsonists go
beyond old-school hip-hop's usual inflated boasts.
</P>
<P>
   Even when just mightily shooting the breeze, these rappers offer
more imaginative twists than many chart-toppers manage in a career.
The cleverness quotient is so high it almost hurts. A little pain
is expected, though, from such serious self-styled warriors.

`NIGHTMARE TOWN': A COLLECTION OF SUBSTANDARD HAMMETT STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(lh) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 20 long-unavailable _ and for the most part, disappointing _
stories by Dashiell Hammett, the author's dark, unrelenting view of
society as a den of sin, inequity and corruption is hammered home
again and again. People aren't safe on the streets of Hammett's
cities, nor are they safe in their homes, where guns have a way of
going off and people end up dead or maimed or at the very least
stripped of their paltry illusions.
</P>
<P>
   There are corrupt cops, phony doctors and murderous civil
engineers in these stories. In fact, almost no one in this volume,
aside from Hammett's detective heroes, is who he seems to be:
Identity more often than not is a con for his characters, who
double- and triple-cross their colleagues with practiced
nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   In the title story, ``Nightmare Town,'' an entire community is
part of a Prohibition-era scam to manufacture illegal booze and
cash in on an insurance racket. ``The word went around that the new
town was a place where a crook would be safe so long as he did what
he was told,'' a character explains. ``The slums of all the cities
of America, and half of 'em out of it, emptied themselves here.
Every crook that was less than a step ahead of the police, and had
car fare here, came and got cover.''
</P>
<P>
   This bleak view of society, the biographer William F. Nolan
tells us in an introduction, dates to an incident in 1917 when the
young Hammett, working as a strikebreaker against the International
Workers of the World in Butte, Mont., was offered $5,000 to kill
union agitator Frank Little. ``After Hammett bitterly refused,''
Nolan writes, ``Little was lynched in a crime ascribed to
vigilantes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Hellman, Hammett's longtime companion, considered this a
turning point. She later observed, writes Nolan, that ``this must
have been, for Hammett, an abiding horror. I can date (his) belief
that he was living in a corrupt society from Little's murder.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, of course, this bleak outlook led Hammett to transform
the detective-story genre. In moving away from the genteel
tradition of the British ``puzzle mystery,'' Hammett created the
hard-boiled school of social realism _ a distinctively American
form that reflected the country's brash frontier ethos and the
author's darkly Hobbesian view. He also introduced detectives like
Sam Spade and the Continental Op, who are as tough and cynical as
their adversaries, men who ``go forward day after day through mud
and blood and death and deceit'' toward ``a dim goal, with nothing
to push or pull'' them toward it except their dogged dedication to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Although these stories work territory that will be familiar to
readers of Hammett's novels _ seven tales feature the Continental
Op, the hero of ``The Dain Curse'' and ``Red Harvest,'' and three
feature Sam Spade, the hero of ``The Maltese Falcon'' _ they do not
provide a terribly effective showcase for Hammett's talents, his
gift for immersing the reader in a Hopper-esque world painted with
harsh lights and stark shadows, a world made palpable through his
streetwise, tough-guy prose.
</P>
<P>
   In these stories, guns are still ``rods'' or ``gats,'' women are
``pretties'' and people still say things like ``I'm a gone baby
anyhow,'' but the language too often verges on self-parody. ``He
had the sensation of being caught in a monstrous net _ a net
without beginning or end, and whose meshes were slimy with blood,''
Hammett writes in one story. And in another, a character insists
that his client must be let out of jail: ``But another day of
imprisonment _ two days, or perhaps even two hours _ and she won't
need anybody to clear her. Death will have done it!''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the short-story form seems to inhibit Hammett, forcing
him to rely on formulaic structures and clumsy exposition. ``The
Man Who Killed Dan Odams'' is a Western with a predictable O.
Henry-esque ending: a fugitive seeks refuge in a remote shack that
turns out to belong to the widow of the man he killed. ``The
Second-Story Angel,'' which concerns a writer's encounter with a
female burglar, similarly pivots around a surprise revelation on
its final page.
</P>
<P>
   As for the detective stories, they consistently employ the same,
numbing framework: a crime or mystery is introduced (someone is
murdered, someone disappears or something is stolen); the detective
shows up, questions the various parties involved, and then comes up
with a solution or persuades one of the suspects to confess. There
is no room in these tales for philosophical asides _ like the
famous Flitcraft episode in ``The Maltese Falcon,'' which laid out
the author's vision of a precarious, random world _ and
insufficient space for Hammett to delineate his characters through
dialogue and dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the reader need only compare the stories in this volume
with the first-draft chapters of ``The Thin Man'' included at the
volume's end to see how the novel form liberated Hammett's
storytelling gifts: ``The Thin Man'' material (which would be
revised considerably before it was published as the novel featuring
Nick Charles) is suspenseful and acutely observed; in sharp
contrast to the stories, it never feels rushed or contrived.
</P>
<P>
   Because they all suffer from compression, because they all share
a similar structure, stories as disparate as ``House Dick'' (about
three dead men found in a hotel room), ``Zigzags of Treachery''
(about a duplicitous doctor and his double), ``The Assistant
Murderer'' (about a woman who is set up as a murderer by a pair of
grifters) and ``One Hour'' (about an apparent hit-and-run accident)
all end up feeling depressingly similar. At the same time, their
explanatory endings (reminiscent of the clunky conclusion to the
Hitchcock movie ``Psycho'') suggest that terrible crimes can always
be ``solved,'' that actions all have motivations, that loose ends
can eventually be tied up. Like the more traditional English
mysteries that Hammett disdained, these stories suggest a far less
threatening, far more rational world than Hammett delivered in his
finest work.

ANTIQUES: AN EARLY MASTER OF METAL REDISCOVERED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Ill., Ariz.)   (bl)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People in Camden, Maine, tout the town's sailboat-dotted harbor,
art galleries and seafood restaurants. But neither the Chamber of
Commerce nor the tourists have a clue that there is a modernist's
mecca among the grand old shingled summer cottages. Only
dyed-in-the-wool design aficionados know that Nicholas H. Brown and
his wife, Shaunna Welch Brown, have set up shop as private dealers
there.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 years, Brown has specialized in the furniture of
Warren McArthur, an American industrial design genius who lived
from 1885 to 1961. Unappreciated and unheralded until recently,
McArthur is now considered one of America's most original
designers.
</P>
<P>
   Trendy architects like Alan Wanzenberg and D.D. Allen specify
McArthur furniture for their clients' houses. Martha Stewart has
put his designs in her New York apartment, and the New York art
dealer Robert Miller furnished his former gallery with them.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the San Francisco collectors Michael and Gabrielle
Boyd lent some McArthur pieces to ``Sitting on the Edge,'' an
exhibition of their modern furniture collection at the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art. The Vitra Design Museum in Weil am
Rhein, Germany, has at least one piece; the Fisher Landau Center, a
private art center in Long Island City, Queens, New York City, has
165.
</P>
<P>
   The son of wealthy parents, McArthur grew up in Chicago when it
was a hotbed of innovation and progress. When he was 8, his father
commissioned a house from Frank Lloyd Wright. The father later
helped Wright get the job to design Midway Gardens, a country club.
</P>
<P>
   McArthur earned an engineering degree from Cornell in 1908. In
1914 he joined his brother Charles in the then tiny city of
Phoenix. His father gave each son a stake of $100,000 to get
started in business. They prospered, opening successful car and
truck dealerships from Arizona to Mexico. They founded Phoenix's
first radio station, the Arizona Club and the Arizona Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1923 the father asked the brothers to build him a vacation
house in Phoenix, with the help of a third son, Albert Chase
McArthur, an architect who had trained as a draftsman with Wright.
</P>
<P>
   The sons built the house, but nearly ran out of cash for the
project. To save money, Warren offered to design the furniture
himself and have it made locally.
</P>
<P>
   He created the furniture out of tubular metal; this was in 1924,
a year before Marcel Breuer, Le Corbusier or Mies van der Rohe
designed any tubular steel seating. Breuer's revolutionary Wassily
chair, named for its inspiration, the handlebars on the painter
Wassily Kandinsky's bike, was designed in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Boyd, a composer of music for films and television who
has more than 40 original McArthur pieces, explained how radical
McArthur's designs were.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general,'' he said, ``I'd say no pre-World War II American
modern designers were on par with the Europeans, except for
McArthur. McArthur is the total exception.''
</P>
<P>
   ``McArthur,'' said Brown, ``was an industrial designer with the
soul of an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   The dealer continued: ``He had his own sense of space and
proportions. The designs are not pedestrian in any sense. To give
his aluminum furniture cultural panache, he consciously compared it
to silver and had it polished to look like muted silver. It never
had the harshness of chrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brown said McArthur furniture was built ``a bit like an
Erector set,'' pointing out that inside the hollow anodized
aluminum tubes are slim steel rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``The furniture is lightweight but has incredible strength,''
she said. ``He patented the connectors'' _ his signature pieces,
the elegant ribbed or smooth aluminum rings.
</P>
<P>
   Brown added: ``What makes McArthur different from the
International School architects is that the process of assembly
dictates the ornamentation of the piece. A Breuer piece has
seamless construction, whereas in a McArthur chair the points of
construction are visually an important aspect of the design. The
joinery is an integral part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd, the collector, said: ``The pieces have clean lines and are
well thought out. There is a formal elegance to the material that's
unprecedented. There is a matter-of-fact, Emersonlike, platonic
American freedom to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1920s, Warren's brother Albert designed the 600-acre
Arizona Biltmore Hotel. He hired his old mentor, Wright, as a
consultant, and his input is evident in the hotel's textile block
construction. Again, Warren designed the furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Despite favorable reviews, the Arizona Biltmore failed when the
crash came in 1929. .
</P>
<P>
   Warren moved to Los Angeles and set up a furniture fabrication
company. Suddenly, aluminum was fashionable. The architect Paul
Williams commissioned him to design 30 pieces of aluminum furniture
for the Hollywood pool of members of the Cord family, the Indiana
car tycoons. Jack Warner put McArthur tubular furniture in his
house, as did Marlene Dietrich, Fredric March and Clark Gable,
Brown said. McArthur furniture was made for the architect Rudolf
Schindler's design of Sardi's restaurant in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the company went bankrupt in 1933, and McArthur
moved to New York, where he set up a sales office at 1 Park Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He became a hotshot city boy,'' Mrs. Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   He designed lightweight chairs for Sikorsky's flying boats,
lounge chairs for Union Pacific trains and all the furnishings for
the Cunard passenger waiting lounge on the piers of New York. He
was the epitome of the machine age designer.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II broke out, aluminum was classified as a
strategic commodity and outlawed for private use. But McArthur was
soon involved in the war effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1940 alone, he outfitted 40 vessels,'' Brown said. ``He
designed 500 models for aircraft seating. In fact, he probably did
at least 65 percent of all the aircraft seating for World War II,
for the Navy and also for the Army Air Corps, which later became
the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, things did not go so well, and he closed his
factory in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's taste changed, and he wasn't able to adapt to it,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Where to find McArthur pieces for sale today?
</P>
<P>
   The Browns have several works, including a scarce outdoor couch
with cotton lacing from the mid-1930s and several elegant study
desks from the rare-book room at the Library of the State of
Virginia, a major McArthur commission in the '30s. The couch is
$19,500, and each desk is $15,000. The Browns see customers by
appointment only; their telephone number is (207) 236-8492.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Parr, a New York antiques dealer at 532 W. 20th St., at
11th Avenue, has several McArthur pieces for sale, and Los Angeles
Modern Auctions is offering three significant McArthur examples in
its sale Oct. 24. Prices for McArthur furniture range from $1,000
for a side chair to $40,000 for an important couch.
</P>
<P>
   The American Federation of Arts plans a major traveling
exhibition of McArthur's works in 2001.

CANNERIES ARE LONG GONE, REPLACED BY LESS MESSY HUBBUB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
HAS ART 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; MONTEREY _ The pearl is still intact. John Steinbeck would be
pleased.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the famed American author characterized Monterey at
dawn in his 1945 classic ``Cannery Row.'' ``Early morning is a time
of magic,'' he wrote, ``when the Row seems to hang suspended out of
time in a silvery light. The corrugated iron of the canneries glows
with the pearly lucence of platinum or old pewter. ... It is a time
of great peace.''
</P>
<P>
   You can still find the pearl today. Now, as then, however, you
just have to get up real early.
</P>
<P>
   The hubbub of Steinbeck's day, generated by a mammoth canning
operation that nearly obliterated the sardine fishery along the
central California coast, has been replaced by a tourism enterprise
that is nearly as vast. Travelers can't seem to resist this
charming coastal village 120-some miles south of San Francisco, and
for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   It combines a cool, gentle climate with the wonders of a
protected bay that now teems with marine life. Along its shores,
photo ops _ worthy of postcards _ abound, Monterey's trademark
cypress trees and jumbles of offshore rocks accenting nearly every
vista. The understated architecture of downtown, which features
numerous adobe buildings dating to Mexican rule in the early 1800s,
complements the entire scene.
</P>
<P>
   As a direct result, shops sell &UR;  &LR; everything from shell necklaces
to fudge. Waterfront restaurants do brisk business. Rental outlets
hawk kayaks, surreys, in-line skates and scuba tanks. Tours of both
land and sea are kept busy. But somehow, none of this seems to
undermine the attractiveness of Monterey as a destination.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the early morning, before the hordes of visitors
descend, that you can really gain a measure and an appreciation of
the place _ and understand why it proved to be so beguiling to
Steinbeck.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the occasional delivery truck, the streets are
deserted. The water laps at the ruins of canning operations
abandoned 40 years ago. The air is filled with the screeching of
sea gulls (it almost sounds like laughter sometimes), mixed with
the barking of sea lions and the noisy cries of crows.
</P>
<P>
   Look out on just about any cluster of rocks offshore, and you're
sure to spy sea lions sprawled listlessly _ they're clearly not
morning types. Take a walk along the Coast Guard pier, and you
might see, as I did, a gull wrestling with a starfish it had
plucked from a submerged rock. Or an entire convention of pelicans
using the rocks at the end of the pier as their private base of
airborne operations. Or an otter suddenly appearing from the kelp
beds and chomping on breakfast as it glided through the water on
its back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A deserted time,'' Steinbeck wrote, ``a little era of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Monterey's appeal does not vanish with the sunrise, though.
</P>
<P>
   Savor it by renting a bike and riding along an abandoned rail
bed out toward the lighthouse on Point Pinos, or around the bend
and down to Asilomar Beach. Rent a kayak for a paddle-power trip
out onto the bay _ which is mercifully tranquil in summer. Take a
self-guided walking tour of the adobes downtown.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best _ and most obvious _ places to begin an
exploration of Monterey is at its aquarium, which is considered
without peer on this coast.
</P>
<P>
   It is housed on the grounds of the old Hovden Cannery. And
therein lies a terrific irony: An operation that once treated the
sea as a boundless supermarket, wresting as much commercial fish
product from it as humanly possible, has given way to an
institution that strives to protect the marine ecosystem and
educate visitors as to its fragility. A significant stretch of
these offshore waters, in fact, is a National Marine Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Best advice: After entering the main doors, pass by the gift
shop and an information desk, turn slightly right and cross the
hallway to the base of a stairway. Here, next to an enormous wall
of glass, is a sign announcing the times of the day's sea otter
feedings in this tank.
</P>
<P>
   It's an attraction not to be missed. A biologist stands on a
rocky ledge and tosses squid, clams and other morsels into the
water. The otters plunge into the depths to retrieve them, then
surface to spin onto their backs and chomp on them, cracking shells
with their strong front teeth, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise usually occurs three times a day (but only once in
the morning), and you'll want to plan your visit so as not to miss
it. Often, the biologist will join the crowd of visitors afterward
to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   It's one example of how visitor-friendly the aquarium is. In
most cases, the water in the tanks is eye-level to a 7-year-old, so
youngsters can simultaneously observe activity above and below the
surface. Also, volunteers in red jackets are positioned throughout
the facility, standing ready to field queries.

<P>
   ``That is a seven-gill shark,'' one said as one of the eerie
beasts glided by in a tank devoted to Monterey Bay. ``He always has
to swim to breathe. He can't lie on the bottom and pump water
through his gills the way those leopard sharks down there are doing
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers, many of them retirees, are put through intensive
11-week training courses. Once they're sent onto the floor, said
one, ``We're told that if we don't know the answer, say so; don't
make anything up.''
</P>
<P>
   There are many wondrous sights here. One of the most popular can
be found in the Outer Bay room, where luminescent jellyfish and sea
nettles move languorously through the water, using a method of
propulsion that can best be described as the opening and closing of
an umbrella without stays. Most observers seem mesmerized by the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Just opened this past spring is another exhibit area titled
``Mysteries of the Deep.'' It houses some truly bizarre creatures,
like the predatory tunicate, an organism that appears to be little
more than a gaping, translucent mouth. It lies still on the bottom,
the marine version of Venus' flytrap, until an unsuspecting critter
swims within range of its deadly maw.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the aquarium, an interactive kiddie area gives
little ones the opportunity to push a button and hear the
underwater whistles and moans of a humpback whale, or jerk on a
joystick to observe the feeding mechanism of a plastic sea urchin.
</P>
<P>
   In an auditorium, regularly scheduled shows feature a live feed
from the aquarium's submersible out in the bay. If the water's
clear, you're able to look over the shoulders of the biologists as
they work.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the aquarium is an enormously popular stop for
visitors to Monterey, and when they're finished examining the
various creatures of the deep, they pour out onto Cannery Row. The
Row stands ready for them.
</P>
<P>
   It's been thoroughly restored since its days of dilapidation in
the 1960s. During its commercial heyday, this was a hectic, noisy,
frightfully smelly place. Sardines were unloaded from fishing
boats, then beheaded, cleaned, stuffed into cans, doused with
tomato sauce or oil and steam-cooked through the tin.
</P>
<P>
   Covered walkways over the street linked the waterfront canning
operations with upslope warehouses. A railway ran alongside the
rear doors of the warehouses, and the canned sardines _ some
250,000 tons a year during the peak operations in the '30s and '40s
_ were loaded into boxcars for shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the stink of rotting fish is long gone, and fresh paint
covers buildings that were constructed in the style of the
canneries of old. This might be the only place in America, though,
where a massive restoration project created a demand for corrugated
tin.
</P>
<P>
   In some places, remnants of the former canning operations still
stand. Next to the waterfront Spindrift Inn, for example, are
crumbling concrete bins that were once used to store sardines fresh
from the catch.
</P>
<P>
   The establishments along the Row sell just about everything:
chocolates, socks, pizza by the slice, kites, cinnamon rolls,
sunglasses, seascape oil paintings, sweat shirts, Christmas
ornaments, ice cream, magnets, Thai food, jewelry, sea otter penny
souvenirs ... everything, it seems, but canned fish.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor has it that some local restaurants actually serve sardines
_ fresh ones, prepared as appetizers _ but concerted attempts to
find them were futile. At Stokes Adobe, one waiter said the fish,
once so plentiful in California's waters, only occasionally show up
in numbers sufficient to warrant their appearance in local
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Other seafood is in abundance in Monterey, however _ and isn't
it peculiar how you can work up such an appetite at an aquarium,
observing albacore circling in tanks, or crabs, clams and mussels
clinging to the bottom?
</P>
<P>
   One oceanfront dining option on Cannery Row, Paradiso Trattoria,
can be recommended. It's the kind of place where you can build an
entire lunch from the soup, salad, appetizer and oyster-bar menus:
steamed Castroville artichokes with parsley oil and garlic aioli,
New England-style clam chowder, shrimp cakes with sweet and sour
sauce, oysters on the half shell. And an extensive selection of
draft beer.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case in such locales, many waterfront dining
establishments, because they get steady streams of tourists and
don't have to concern themselves with repeat business, are not
exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, three excellent fine-dining options in Monterey
were encountered well inland. They were Montrio and Stokes Adobe in
the downtown district (the former is justifiably proud of items
from its rotisserie), and Tarpy's Roadhouse, a stately stone
edifice with a delightful patio dining area, situated just outside
town on the road to Salinas (Highway 68).

<P>
   &LR; Monterey offers many delights for the explorer.
</P>
<P>
   The Path of History self-guided walking tour follows a two-mile
route downtown and takes in important historic sites and gardens.
Free map/brochures can be picked up at several locations, including
the visitors' bureau desk at the Maritime Museum, 5 Custom House
Plaza. Phone: (831) 649-1770.
</P>
<P>
   In the days of Mexican rule, one-story structures were favored,
but that all changed when American consul Thomas O. Larkin began
building a home for himself in 1835. He threw up a second story,
with a veranda all the way around, and Monterey Colonial
architecture was born.
</P>
<P>
   The house, at the corner of Calle Principal and Jefferson, is
included on the walking tour. Its grounds also include a building
that served as the quarters of William Tecumseh Sherman on a visit
in the mid-19th century. It is devoid of exterior plaster, so every
detail of the intricate adobe construction is visible. Its walls
are two feet thick _ essential for cooling in the days before air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Also not to be missed are the gardens in the courtyard of the
Cooper-Molera Adobe complex (corner of Alvarado and Pearl).
</P>
<P>
   Lush gardens, in fact, are one of the unexpected highlights of
the walk. They are found at most homes and many businesses along
the route, and it's obvious great care goes into maintaining them.
There are bursts of roses, hydrangea, Matilija poppies and
agapanthus, as well as mature, gnarled olive and pepper trees that
enhance the sense of stepping back in time.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers that reside at the edge of the sea are another Monterey
feature. Tide pools can be found at San Carlos Beach, between the
Coast Guard Pier and Cannery Row, and, particularly if you have
youngsters along, this educational opportunity should not be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   At low tide, you can wade out among the rocks just offshore and
observe the life that thrives in the tide pools. There is an entire
colony of anemones here, some of them as big as salad plates. Yes,
they do look just like flowers, but many a tiny fish has made the
mistake of attempting to rest for a moment amid those soft petals,
only to sense their stickiness, too late, as the anemone folds
inward on its meal.
</P>
<P>
   Have your kids gently run a finger along the center of this
creature to trigger the effect.
</P>
<P>
   Another excellent way to explore Monterey and its neighboring
coastal communities is to rent a bike. Most of the peninsula is
flat, so you don't have to worry about any uphill surprises on the
ride back.
</P>
<P>
   The rail bed for the line that once served the canneries is now
concreted over, creating a wide pathway for bicyclists, walkers,
roller-skaters and people pushing strollers. It spans seven miles,
including a one-mile stretch south of Cannery Row through Pacific
Grove.
</P>
<P>
   Pause to enjoy the park at Lovers Point, then continue south
along Ocean View Boulevard and Sunset Drive (the latter has a
striped bike path in each direction) for spectacular views of this
serene stretch of coastline. At various points, wood benches have
been constructed, many beneath Monterey's trademark cypress trees,
for unhurried contemplation of the rocks, kelp beds and creatures
of the bay.
</P>
<P>
   On the ride back into town, it's natural to reflect on the
colorful characters Steinbeck portrayed in ``Cannery Row'' and its
sequel, ``Sweet Thursday'': Dora Flood, Doc, Lee Chong, Mack and
the boys. They moved on when Steinbeck's imagination did, along
with the immigrants and Depression-era drifters who once performed
the cold, wet, smelly work of canning fish before the operations
shut down for good.
</P>
<P>
   In their place are tourists from points just as far-flung,
speaking in many accents and languages as they peer at protected
marine life at the aquarium, pick through souvenirs on the Row and
leisurely enjoy the many charms of Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the visitors of today can't resist the pearl, either. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ If music be the food of love, ``The Donkey Show'' is
a bowl of jalapenos. This rollicking hour of sex, drugs and sweaty
gyrations marries the '70s disco craze to, of all things, the work
of William Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Its title could have been ``A Donna Summer Night's Dream.''
Shakespeare's lovers are lost here in cocaine-induced euphoria
rather than in an enchanted forest. Oberon is a sleazy club owner,
Tytania an exotic dancer, Puck a drug pusher on roller skates. They
converse in a kind of discospeak: the entire show is lip-synched to
25-year-old hits like ``I Love the Nightlife,'' ``Never Knew Love
Like This Before'' and ``Car Wash.''
</P>
<P>
   The enterprise might have been a garish mismatch, the equivalent
of a tuxedo worn with platform shoes. But wouldn't you know, ``The
Donkey Show'' is a lark, an exuberant and witty splicing of
disparate sources.
</P>
<P>
   Its creators, Diane Paulus and Randy Weiner, stage the show as
if it were a bacchanal, the sort of libido-driven drugfest one
associates with the heyday of Studio 54 and the coke-snorting '70s
and early '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The revels of this environmental production take place in an
honest-to-goodness club, El Flamingo, on West 21st Street between
10th and 11th avenues, where the experience is meant to mimic real
clubgoing.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket-holders line up outside the doors, waiting for the
bouncer Rico to wave them in; once inside, they go to the bar or
dance to the incessant throbbing of ``On the Radio.'' Slowly the
cast members, who have been mingling with the audience (the men
wear little more than spandex briefs), evolve into characters, and
we're gradually drawn into the whirlwind farce of Shakespeare's
confused lovers, Helena and Demetrius, Hermia and Lysander.
</P>
<P>
   Here they're called Helen and Dimitri, Mia and Sander, and the
romantic traumas that befall them in the disco _ presided over, of
course, by a platter-spinning DJ (Kevin Shand) _ are modeled on
those of ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   That all four parts are played by women, two of whom are
disguised by unconvincing mustaches, in no way alters the recipe
for comedy. Something vaguely androgynous has always attended this
romp in the woods, which ``The Donkey Show'' cheekily reaffirms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Midsummer'' has been retold a thousand ways; translating it
into discoese is not the foolhardy exercise one might expect. The
play, a catalog of the pitfalls associated with impetuous love, is
a series of disasters brought on by petty jealousies, intemperate
advances and superficial attractions _ the perfect material, it
turns out, for a '70s pop-song cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Paulus, director of last season's moving ``Running Man,''
and Weiner, who is credited with the ``conception'' of ``The Donkey
Show,'' do a terrific job of choosing well-known songs that match
the production's moods and intentions.
</P>
<P>
   When, for instance, a distraught lover is abandoned on the dance
floor, she sings, ``Don't Leave Me This Way.'' A moment of
anguished fury is underlined by ``Enough Is Enough.''
</P>
<P>
   And when one of the newly aroused paramours emerges from the
drug den that Puck (Roman Pietrs) operates out of a back room in
the club, he announces his newfound attraction with ``You Sexy
Thing.'' (Substituting angel dust for fairy dust is one of the
show's funnier ideas.)
</P>
<P>
   Audience members, most of whom stand on the dance floor (a
smaller number sit at tables) are herded expertly out of the way by
the actors, who prowl every available inch of El Flamingo. The
playing of each song brings cheers: they are so evocative of their
era you can practically feel the polyester chafing your skin.
</P>
<P>
   The actors are what you would call deeply committed to this
material, gallivanting without overdoing it. Maria Torres, the
choreographer, devises smart parodies of the hustle and other
period dances, which are athletically performed by, among others,
Tytania's buff fairies (played by Oscar Estevez, Luke Miller, Dan
Cryer and Quinn as a kind of a scantily clad backup group for a
Liza Minnelli special).
</P>
<P>
   Anna Wilson, as the siren-like Tytania, offers a performance of
bona fide poise, and Jordin Ruderman and Emily Hellstrom are well
matched in the low comedy roles of Vinnie One and Vinnie Two, who
take the place of Bottom and Shakespeare's other rude mechanicals
in the story. The four lovers, portrayed by Ms. Ruderman, Ms.
Hellstrom, Ms. Wilson and Rachel Benbow Murdy, are appealingly
clownish hams.
</P>
<P>
   The only aspect of ``The Donkey Show'' that doesn't quite gel is
the donkey: Weiner and Ms. Paulus do not make sense of the Vinnies'
transformation and so we never buy the seduction scene (although
the donkey pinata is a nice touch). Otherwise, it's a cool party.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Frank Wood was an unheralded journeyman actor _ I
once saw him in an experimental production of Chekhov's ``Three
Sisters'' set in, among other places, a Soviet gulag _ until Warren
Leight wrote him a scene that would raise him out of obscurity. It
comes in the second act of ``Side Man,'' the story of the
disintegration of a jazz player's family. The scene is so achingly
transfixing that it almost always ends with applause, a rare reward
during a straight play.
</P>
<P>
   Gene, Wood's character, is unwinding after playing at some bland
affair, when one of his jazz man buddies puts on the tape of a
plaintive solo by a long-dead trumpeter. The music curlicues in
exquisitely mournful riffs, but it is the way the music infects
Wood's countenance, the manner in which he suggests a physical
rapport with the trumpet's moans and whines and elongated sighs,
that gives the scene its intensity. He utters not a word; he just
sits there, listening. And yet his sensuous portrayal is anything
but passive. Suddenly you have a powerful insight into this vague,
distracted musician.
</P>
<P>
   I have watched the scene four times _ on the strength of it, I'm
convinced, Wood won a Tony Award in June _ and would gladly sit
through it four more. This is the nature of show-stopping moments:
We're made gluttons for the thrill. You can quibble over what
pushes your pinnacle button; the resulting bliss, though, is
unequivocal, akin to what is reflected onstage in Wood's face. You
want to plant flags on the peaks of these moments and to live close
to them for the rest of your life. In a way you do, because they
are like mnemonic viruses. In the theater lover's memory chip, they
spread their exhilaration wide.
</P>
<P>
   Show-stoppers are democracy in action. They do not always reside
in great shows, although few great nights in the theater pass
without at least one. They are deeply intimate experiences, and yet
they are forged by consensus. It takes a conspiracy of sorts
between the entertainer and the entertained: no rousing number, no
gorgeous soliloquy, no bravura cameo qualifies without the
audience's say-so. This is the glory of live performance, that a
catharsis can be so deeply absorbed that spectators demand a
timeout to express how they feel. You can fall in love with a
Scorsese film or a Rembrandt portrait, but it's a one-way
relationship. No aspect of the artwork will be altered, no matter
how hard you clap.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting that the rapturous interlude in ``Side Man''
happens in a scene with music; the musical, after all, is the
natural arena of the show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   You can quickly come up with half a dozen nominees or more for
the show-stoppers' hall of fame from the ranks of Broadway
musicals, some of them inextricably linked to a legendary
performance, others less so: Barbra Streisand's ``Don't Rain on My
Parade'' in ``Funny Girl,'' Ethel Merman's rendition of ``Rose's
Turn'' (``Gypsy''), ``The Rain in Spain'' (``My Fair Lady''), ``Sit
Down, You're Rocking the Boat'' (``Guys and Dolls''), Elaine
Stritch delivering ``The Ladies Who Lunch'' (``Company''), ``Gee,
Officer Krupke'' (``West Side Story'') and surely, Carol Channing,
serenaded and celebrated in the ``Hello, Dolly!'' production
number.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they express pain or pleasure, acidic cynicism or
unalloyed joy, they are all gratifying in the same way, satisfying
our need, in big finishes and emphatic statements for the grand
gesture. ``Don't tell me not to live!'' sings the Fanny Brice
character in ``Funny Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Drama has its version of the show-stopper, and though it has a
different impact, it can be just as carefully orchestrated as in a
musical. When Medea displays her murdered children, when Lear
staggers on with the lifeless Cordelia, when Biff Loman uncovers
the truth about his father, it is not the show that all but stops;
it is one's heart.
</P>
<P>
   A show-stopping moment can be manipulated, even if it can't
always be anticipated. In ``Side Man'' there is no doubt that the
decision by the director, Michael Mayer, to let the brilliant
trumpet solo run on for several minutes was crucial to Wood's
passionate response. And the lighting by Kenneth Posner adds yet
another dimension. He showers Wood in white light that gradually
intensifies, at once underlining Gene's love for the music and his
severe emotional isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Where do you go these days for the transcendent moment, the one
that brings down the house? Here is a brief run-down of productions
that try to provide them. In some cases they succeed admirably;
others fall short of show-stopping. These are in no way scientific
findings. By all means, add your own.
</P>
<P>
   `The Lion King'
</P>
<P>
   Don't come late or you'll miss the moment. It arrives at the top
of the show, in the ``Circle of Life'' number that culminates in
the christening of Simba, the cub and future king. The director
Julie Taymor, who won a Tony for her work, brings the jungle
menagerie to ebullient life. The entrance of each species _
giraffes loping in from the wings, an elephant up the aisle _ is a
mini-show-stopper. The awesome effects elicit tears.
</P>
<P>
   The only downside is placement. Nothing that follows in the
ensuing two and a half hours has anything close to the opening's
breathtaking scope. (Sure, ``Comedy Tonight'' opens ``A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum,'' but ``Everybody Ought to Have a
Maid'' is still to come.) This is a quibble more than a complaint;
``Circle of Life'' is the most beautiful opener and the best
evocation of musical pageantry onstage in New York.
</P>
<P>
   `Wit'
</P>
<P>
   Never before have audiences sobbed over readings of ``The
Runaway Bunny.'' In Margaret Edson's Pulitzer-winning play a dying
professor, shut off emotionally from her past, lies comatose in her
hospital bed as an older woman, her aging mentor, crawls under the
covers and begins to read to her from the classic children's story.
Real or imagined _ it's never quite clear which _ the scene
connects so elementally with the collective search for consolation
in a mother's arms that it verges on unbearable.
</P>
<P>
   `Rent'
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Larson belonged to a generation of young cerebral
composers who rejected the old show-biz formulas for the musical.
But he was canny about incorporating the most beneficial aspects of
those formulas in his work. Nothing of the conservatory is evident
in his superb score for this megasuccessful rock opera. There is
even a bona fide show-stopper in the scintillating Act II duet,
``Take Me or Leave Me.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Performed by the musical's lesbian couple, Joanne and Maureen,
``Take Me or Leave Me'' is a song in which lovers prove nothing
except that they get a sexual charge out of fighting. It is a
number about rivalry in the tradition, really, of Irving Berlin's
``Anything You Can Do'' in ``Annie Get Your Gun.'' The only
convention not observed, yet totally earned, is an encore.
</P>
<P>
   `Fosse'
</P>
<P>
   This Tony-winning retrospective of the choreography of Bob Fosse
is supposed to be a whole evening of show-stoppers. The dances
range from a desultory mounting of ``Mr. Bojangles'' from the 1978
``Dancin''' to a nifty arrangement of the ``Rich Man's Frug'' from
``Sweet Charity'' in 1966. But only one number, ``Steam Heat'' from
the 1954 ``Pajama Game,'' transports the audience in this
production. The energy and athleticism of the dancing trio receive
grateful, sustained applause because the acrobatics build, and
build some more. By the time the two men are on their backs and
stroking like members of the swim team, anything less than an
ovation for their Olympian effort would be churlish.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about ``Fosse'' is the shape the dancers are in,
a reminder that as far back as Julie Newmar's appearance as
Stupefyin' Jones in ``L'il Abner,'' the human body itself could be
a show-stopper.
</P>
<P>
   `Death of a Salesman'
</P>
<P>
   In a play that rumbles from big moment to big moment, the most
devastating, at least in Robert Falls' acclaimed production, is the
one in which Biff (initially played by Kevin Anderson, now by Ron
Eldard) discovers his father, Willy (Brian Dennehy), in a hotel
room with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   Men, especially, choke up at this scene. It touches on an
insecurity many men harbor, that their own masculinity, derived so
fundamentally from their fathers, is a lie. While Dennehy has been
widely lionized for his portrayal, it was Anderson (I haven't seen
Eldard) who made this scene a heartbreaker. His Biff seesawed from
cocky to gullible; when the tattered strands of Biff's faith in
Willy finally unraveled, a light went on in Anderson's performance
that illuminated the courage Biff musters to face the stark reality
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   `Cats'
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere they snicker. Everywhere, that is, but the Winter
Garden Theater, in which the burnt-out ends of smoky days are being
chronicled for the 6 or 7 trillionth time this very evening in the
show's penultimate song, ``Memory.'''
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard ``Memory'' at the Winter Garden, then you
have in an elevator somewhere. Overexposure has tempered its
authenticity and its power. Yet it is still the most satisfying 11
o'clock number on Broadway. With words by T.S. Eliot and music by
Andrew Lloyd Webber, ``Memory'' is sophisticated and emotionally
stirring. You understand all you need to about Grizabella, the
raggedly glamour cat, from her sole number. It's comforting to know
that she, at least, after all these years, can still raise goose
bumps.
</P>
<P>
   `Chicago'
</P>
<P>
   Velma's ``I Can't Do It Alone,'' a duet for one person, stops
the show cold in the first act. Velma's actual duet with Roxie,
``Hot Honey Rag,'' does it again in the second. No one in the role
has performed ``I Can't Do It Alone'' quite as wondrously as Bebe
Neuwirth; her rendition for the Encores series at City Center in
1996 was a bellwether moment in that concert production, a signal
that the show was Broadway-ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago's'' finale, ``Hot Honey Rag,'' is wonderful window
dressing, a snazzy way to send audiences home on a theater-induced
high.
</P>
<P>
   `Annie Get Your Gun'
</P>
<P>
   A show-stopper here would seem a fait accompli, what with a
score by Irving Berlin packed with standards like ``There's No
Business Like Show Business'' and ``I Got the Sun in the Morning.''
The closest this ``Annie'' comes to one, however, is ``An
Old-Fashioned Wedding,'' an Act II duet for the leads, Bernadette
Peters and Tom Wopat.
</P>
<P>
   Great personal magnetism is generated by Ms. Peters, and
especially by Wopat, even if this mediocre revival, with its gooey
production numbers, misses opportunity after opportunity to
generate some heat. In ``An Old-Fashioned Wedding,'' at least, Ms.
Peters and Wopat seem genuinely at ease with each other and behave
like old-fashioned Broadway stars. The genial grace that is missing
from so much of the show in this instance is received by the
audience with a measure of relief.
</P>
<P>
   `Hedwig and the Angry Inch'
</P>
<P>
   In an evening of sublime satire set to music, John Cameron
Mitchell and Stephen Trask, the creators of ``Hedwig,'' save the
best for last. Hedwig, the confused transsexual rock star with the
botched sex-change operation, undergoes a metamorphosis at the end
of the 90-minute show that signals his success at forging a
meaningful identity, coming to terms with his male and female
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mitchell and his successor as Hedwig, Michael Cerveris,
were positively thrilling in this final, otherworldly
transformation. Kevin Cahoon plays Hedwig now. Ally Sheedy is to
assume the role next, and it should be fascinating to see what a
woman brings to this cathartic moment. If all goes well, it will
stop the show, and then the show will stop, even though you won't
want it to.

(th) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone had to be lying. During the Senate hearings on Clarence
Thomas' nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court, Anita Hill testified
that he had made graphic sexual remarks when he was her boss; he
denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   And as Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson put it in ``Strange
Justice,'' their thoroughly reported and trenchant book, ``Two
people with such completely contradictory accounts cannot possibly
both be telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   That nonfiction book is now the basis for one of the slyest,
most unexpectedly fascinating television dramas of the year.
Showtime's ``Strange Justice'' brings fresh life to a story that is
more than familiar: the Thomas-Hill saga is a benchmark that left
the country more jaded than before.
</P>
<P>
   As a fictional news announcer explains at the start of the film,
the hearings were ``a train wreck of race, sex, politics, all
played out before a TV audience of a hundred million people.''
</P>
<P>
   In those innocent days of 1991, sexual harassment was an odd,
new phrase to most of the country. Since then, of course, Paula
Jones has sued President Clinton over it, and in a
backlash-inducing turn of events grammar-school children have been
accused of harassing their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The film confines itself to events surrounding the confirmation,
yet the viewer's knowledge of how the harassment issue has evolved
matters: in that light the movie emphasizes that today's murky
attitudes toward sexual harassment started with an event that
remains fraught with questions. (The film was enough of a hot
potato for the rights to have been picked up and tossed aside by
Turner and Fox.)
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Epstein's script and director Ernest Dickerson's sometimes
brilliant choices overcome the obstacles of knowing how the story
played out. Deftly moving from outside events to a sparing use of
surrealism, the film comes to reflect the tumultuous inner lives of
the Hill and Thomas characters, whose violent emotions were masked
by their decorum at the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Taking its lead from the book's subtitle, ``The Selling of
Clarence Thomas,'' the film focuses on the machinations of the Bush
White House to get Thomas confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Taylor is affecting as the reluctant Anita Hill,
unprepared for the hardball of Washington politics. The underrated
Delroy Lindo gives one more amazing performance as the fiercely
offended, righteous Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is Mandy Patinkin who holds the film together as Kenneth
Duberstein, the consultant who is assigned by the White House to
help Thomas navigate through the hearings and who is just as much a
player as the principals.
</P>
<P>
   Duberstein says his job is ``the same as selling a product.'' He
rehearses Thomas for the hearings and counsels him to avoid
land-mine topics like abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of spin it is not a news flash that Supreme Court
nominees are just as packaged as political candidates. What
Patinkin's subtle depiction brings to the character are decency and
pragmatism in a portrayal more chilling than if Duberstein had been
presented as a monster. His conservative politics are sincere, and
a job is a job, even when he comes to doubt the nominee's
truthfulness. Here is the scary reality of politics as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayer and Abramson book, written when the authors were
reporters at The Wall Street Journal (they are now at The New
Yorker and The New York Times, respectively), builds a careful
argument that Thomas had a history, going back to his college days,
of interest in pornography and of making shockingly crude remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The film tilts in Ms. Hill's direction but takes a less overt
position. Blink and you'll miss its first reference to a
video-store owner who was, belatedly, willing to testify that
Thomas had rented sexually explicit tapes. Still, the White House
manipulations are enough to smack of distortion, if not dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   The movie presents other women who might have accused Thomas of
harassment or supported Hill's assertions, but who were not called
by the Senate Judiciary Committee. A Thomas adviser threatens,
``When we get through with Anita Hill, there's not going to be
enough left to mop the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the film allows for the sincerity of both characters, a
position that relies more on the oddities of human psychology than
on logic. If it seems clear that Hill is telling the truth, Thomas'
sense of baffled outrage seems just as deeply felt.
</P>
<P>
   Because she plays the simpler, more straightforward character,
Ms. Taylor has less to work with than Lindo does. He creates a
Clarence Thomas who is genuinely tortured by these events yet who
remains a mystery at the end.
</P>
<P>
   He bristles when he believes that Vernon Jordan is condescending
to him. (Jordan is now so familiar, it is disconcerting to see him
played by Louis Gossett Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   After the Hill accusations, Thomas writhes on the floor in the
middle of the night (a scene reported in the book, not invented).
His comforting wife tells him: ``It's God's will. It's his way of
testing you, Clarence. You are his warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   In the film's most daring and effective set piece, the Hill and
Thomas testimonies acquire a surreal edge, taking a decisive step
into pure fiction that turns the characters inside out, as if their
psyches were being splashed across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill was restrained to the point of coldness during her
testimony, in her prim blue suit. Here, as the Senate chamber
recedes into shadow, the character mocks Thomas and speaks in a
ferocious voice, her angry face captured in close-up.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas testimony is depicted in even more dynamic terms. At
first the light glares off his glasses; eventually he stands from
the table and as he shouts, he tears off his jacket and shirt.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrives at his most famous line, calling the hearings
``a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks,'' he gestures as if
hanging himself with his red paisley tie, the image of a
contemporary lynched man. Dickerson guides the film smoothly in and
out of these enhanced scenes; they are not for the literal minded
but work as extraordinary drama.
</P>
<P>
   One of the movie's rare clumsy choices is to splice the actors
into actual news film. It seems less, not more real, to see Lindo
stand next to President George Bush when he announces the Thomas
nomination. That is one of the hazards of dramatizing events that
played out on television to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even this pitfall comes with a reward. The news film
includes a moment that played as congressional high camp even the
first time around: here again is Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, waving a
copy of ``The Exorcist'' and angrily reading from it as a possible
source for the ``pubic hair on my Coke'' remark.
</P>
<P>
   As a Hill adviser says in the most unarguable line of this
shrewd, resonant film: ``These guys play rough. It's politics.
Truth hardly enters into it.''

INCONSISTENCY AS VIRTUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little
minds, as Ralph Waldo Emerson once declared, Republican
presidential candidate Sen. John McCain is a big thinker.
</P>
<P>
   He dared recently to try to shake off his party's merciless
fixation on banning all abortion no matter what the consequences.
McCain has a reputation for independence on other subjects, but not
on this one, a major litmus test of the GOP hard right.
</P>
<P>
   And the Arizona senator's break for political sanity was
complicated by an apparent desire to have it both ways,
psychologically deserting the anti-abortion zealots but not really
reassuring pro-choice advocates either. Purposely, he did not make
himself perfectly clear.
</P>
<P>
   He wobbled around clumsily, warning of the tragic impact on
women of criminalizing abortion. This alone was a departure for a
GOP presidential candidate. The Republican push to outlaw abortion
has been couched primarily in defense of an unborn fetus with
little display of interest in the needs and well-being of the
living female involved.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain also insisted he still favored the eventual overthrow
of Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision declaring abortion
constitutional. He said he just didn't think any reversal could
realistically be done ``in the short term, or even the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain took a practical, if ambiguous, approach to an issue on
which GOP leaders are blindly ideologically committed. But this is
a complicated subject better left to preachers and individuals
rather than politicians.
</P>
<P>
   `` Repeal,'' he said correctly, ``would force X number of women
in America to (undergo) illegal and dangerous operations.''
Back-alley abortions that often led to death were the country's
dirty little secret before the Supreme Court spoke in 1973. For
example, Frank Sinatra's mother, among many others, made their
living by such illegal operations.
</P>
<P>
   And until birth control procedures become universally accepted
and effective, desperate families will always need abortion as an
escape hatch. The World Bank estimates that up to 200,000 women
around the globe die annually of complications from botched, mostly
illegal abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain so inflamed anti-abortion lobbyists for not toeing
their policy line that they gave him a verbal beating, accusing him
of being a traitor to the cause and to his conservative political
roots. They called him ``liberal'' and ``soft,'' favorite
pejoratives ordinarily used against Democrats deemed insufficiently
anti-crime, anti-communist or anti-whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion columnists dismissed his presidential prospects,
thundering that no Republican would ever win a primary without a
pristine pro-fetus record. But presidential rival Gary Bauer, who
gives the issue such a priority that he promises to devote to it
every waking presidential minute, has probably sewed up the
anti-abortion vote anyway. This outcry is not about McCain's
chances. It is about keeping the cause from seeming politically
weak by failing to punish defectors.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, McCain stood up better to pressure from his brutal North
Vietnam captors for five and a half years than he did to the
right-wing onslaught. He immediately began backing away.
</P>
<P>
   He sent a letter to the National Right to Life Committee
reaffirming his past position favoring the reversal of Roe V. Wade
and correctly pointing to his 17-year congressional record of
voting for every anti-abortion amendment to come along. The fuss,
however, may have accomplished what he wanted. He is now identified
with the two other mainstream GOP presidential candidates _ Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole _ as having escaped the
captivity of anti-abortion nuttyhood.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has rejected efforts to make him promise his running mate
and Supreme Court candidates will be all-out abortion opponents. He
says instead that while he himself is against abortion, he thinks
``America is not ready'' for a constitutional amendment outlawing
it. Perhaps he has listened to his mother, former first lady
Barbara Bush, who calls the procedure ``a personal choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps he, like McCain, is playing games. Who knows? Only
deeds, later, will tell.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Dole also says she is against abortion but ducks
behind the statement of ``it's not possible'' when talking about
the constitutional amendment. She adds that she makes an exception
in her opposition to abortion in cases of rape or incest or where
the life of the mother is at risk.
</P>
<P>
   When her husband, Bob Dole, was about to become the 1996 GOP
presidential nominee, he tried to modify the party platform, which
says a fetus has a ``fundamental individual right to life which
cannot be infringed'' and demands that all abortion be outlawed
without exception. All he asked for was language that called for
tolerance of other views, and he lost. He finally resorted to
saying he would simply ignore that platform plank if elected.
</P>
<P>
   A while back, McCain also called for the party to come to its
senses. He said, ``I'm for going back to the platform as it was in
1980. I believe we are an inclusive party and we can be so without
changing our principles.'' The 1980 platform called for
constitutional protection of a fetus but recognized that there are
``differing views on this question.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain goes into this presidential contest as a moderate
Republican of courage and character who is unafraid to take
specific stands that defy his party's establishment. If he is to
make that position stick, he must continue to edge away from the
anti-abortion dogma that has driven a philosophical wedge through
the GOP. What can he lose? Only anti-abortion activists who weren't
going to vote for him anyway.

GLEANING WARMTH FROM MILLET'S LIGHT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: France)   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ It's a good bet that the most satisfying
exhibition anywhere in America at this moment is ``Jean-Francois
Millet: Drawn Into the Light,'' at the Sterling and Francine Clark
Art Institute here.
</P>
<P>
   As its title implies, the show focuses on drawings. Millet's
drawings are limpid and nuanced, with a remarkable feel for light
and the weight of things. They owe debts to Poussin and Delacroix
and have the silent, time-stopped quality of Vermeer. If Millet's
fame rests on a few paintings, like ``The Sower,'' ``The Gleaners''
and ``Man With a Hoe,'' which are also on loan here , no one was
more adept at pastels than he was, or more skilled at exploiting
the bumpiness of textured paper to create a soft, shimmering
effect, or at the technique of rubbing the lines made by conte
crayons. Seurat idolized Millet because, among other things, Millet
virtually invented the vaporous silhouettes that Seurat drew.
</P>
<P>
   So the exhibition reminds us why we should admire Millet beyond
the textbook view of him as a painter of peasants. He was a
first-rate landscapist whose experience of the countryside, where
he spent most of his life (he was born in 1814 and died in 1875),
is reflected in the precision of his perceptions of rural life.
Drawings like ``Twilight'' and the watercolors of bucolic scenes he
made near Vichy during the mid-1860s are not just drawn well,
they're also perfectly true to nature, which is a rarer attribute.
</P>
<P>
   The standard question about Millet comes up here: was he a
sentimentalist? ``The Gleaners,'' maybe his most famous and most
sentimental picture, is so familiar that it's hard to see fresh.
Three women are stooping in a field, one rising just enough so that
her back approaches the horizon line but doesn't break its plane.
The effect is to make the figures look rooted to the earth,
weighted down.
</P>
<P>
   They are also shrouded _ we can't make out their faces _ and
stony. Theophile Gautier once wrote about how Millet ``trowels onto
his dishcloth canvas, using no oil or turps, great masonries of
color, paint so dry no varnish could quench its thirst,'' which is
what we see here: the women seem like solid blocks, dense masses.
</P>
<P>
   At a good distance from them, brightly lighted, men pitch huge
forkfuls of grain into stacks. Two of the stacks, beside a laden
wagon, mirror the configuration of the women, giving the picture a
classical balance, front to back, while emphasizing the extreme
poverty of the gleaners compared to the bounty behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Gleaners, the rural equivalent of urban beggars, scrounged
whatever scraps of grain escaped the reapers' sheaves. They
constituted the bottom rung of peasant society. Millet's goal _ to
suggest the gravity of their existence through a kind of religious
transfiguration _ involved remaking the Bible into pictures of
modern realism. He knew the Old Testament story of Ruth, the
gleaner, and Boaz, the landowner who falls in love with her, and he
had already adapted it for another painting, ``Harvesters
Resting.''
</P>
<P>
   His ``Gleaners'' glorifies the backbreaking work of these women.
It was a bold statement to be making at the time. Jittery after the
revolution of 1848, the urban middle and upper classes, who were
Millet's audience, genuinely feared these peasants, who hadn't
benefited, as they had, from the economic upturn of the Second
Empire. When ``The Gleaners'' was first shown in the 1850s, one art
critic, speaking for other Parisians, perceived in it an alarming
intimation of ``the scaffolds of 1793.''
</P>
<P>
   Millet was never a radical in the way that Courbet was a
radical. His attachment to classical art and to biblical sources
linked him to a tradition that reassured moderates. Critics could
choose to focus on what was provocative about his art or on what
was conventional, depending on their inclinations.
</P>
<P>
   His political views, to the extent they're known, seem to have
been contradictory, which is to say they were fairly normal. If
others regarded him as a wild socialist troublemaker, he was
actually one of those people whose public works and private beliefs
didn't necessarily coincide. The socialists thought that Millet was
on their side, but as Camille Pissarro wrote in 1887, Millet was a
bit too biblical. He was ``another of those blind men, leaders or
followers who, unconscious of the march of modern ideas, defend
those ideas without knowing it, despite themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Millet liked to say that he had been a peasant laborer until he
was 21, but he was born to a prosperous farming family in a tiny
coastal hamlet called Gruchy, in Normandy. Although he worked with
his father and great-uncle tilling the soil and tending animals, he
was steeped in Virgil, Milton and Shakespeare. It is said that he
was one of the best-educated painters of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   He also drew and was sent, at 18, to study art in Cherbourg.
Having received a stipend from the city fathers there, and with
money from his family, he then became a student of the history
painter Paul Delaroche at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, aiming
for a career as an academic painter of portraits, nudes and
biblical subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, however, he began to concentrate more on peasant life
and landscapes. After staying a dozen years in Paris, through the
revolution and despite the fact that he loathed city life, he opted
in 1849 to settle permanently in Barbizon, 30 miles south of Paris,
on the northern edge of the forest of Fontainebleau, where Theodore
Rousseau, the painter, had also retreated a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   His ambition had become epic and posed a number of questions
that are still fundamental to political art. Was it possible to
convey the demeaning, mechanical quality of a task like gleaning or
sowing and simultaneously dignify the people doing it? Could they
be made to look individual while doing such an anonymous job? What
did it take to turn something commonplace into something mythic
without distorting or softening it? Should brutality be made to
look beautiful through art?
</P>
<P>
   When Millet failed to resolve these sorts of issues, his art did
slide toward sentimentalism. But generally he managed to extract
from his classical sources an essential restraint, and
notwithstanding the occasional maudlin effect, he tended mostly
toward sobriety and a kind of obstinate awkwardness of pose and
gesture, which mitigated melodrama. In the end, his works have
heart. Sincerity and sentimentality are different things. Millet
was sincere. He was a painter of humanity for whom nature provided
a context that was always larger than the people he described. His
art was about harmony with the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   His art is summed up in a drawing like ``Woman Pasturing Her
Cow.'' The woman was a poor itinerant. Itinerants were prohibited
from using communal grazing land in France, so she leads her
malnourished cow to feed on tufts of grass beside the roadway. In a
big sunny field behind her, a landowner's fat herd grazes.
</P>
<P>
   Trees are surrounding the woman and separating her from the
field, like prison bars. But Millet doesn't push the point: the
woman, plump-faced, standing erect, contentedly knitting, is not a
cliche of poverty. The picture is as much about light and space as
it is about justice. For Millet, everything returns to nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature yields herself to those who trouble to explore her,''
he wrote. ``But she demands an exclusive love. The works of art we
love, we love only because they are derived from her. The rest are
merely works of empty pedantry.''

JOHN BIRCH SOCIETY, QUIET FOR YEARS, GAINS NEW FOLLOWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROGER CROTEAU  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ At 28, Ray Kaderli is too young to
remember when the John Birch Society was a household name.
</P>
<P>
   Kaderli knows the right-wing organization has a reputation for
seeing communists under every bed, and he thinks it may be right.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he and a few others say the John Birch Society is ``alive
and well'' in New Braunfels and seeking new members.
</P>
<P>
   While Kaderli at first didn't know much about the group, he was
curious enough to dismiss friends who laughed when he said he
planned to attend the organizational meeting for a new chapter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard a lot of `Ray, you're going where? The John Birch
Society? Oh, my God,''' Kaderli said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is a possible threat to your family, wouldn't you
want to find out what that threat was? Everything I've heard makes
sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaderli and his father, Clifton, were among five people who
attended the first meeting Aug. 11. A similar meeting last week
drew two new faces. While the turnout hasn't been overwhelming,
it's a start, said organizer Vernon Smith of Canyon Lake.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the organization, relatively quiet for years, say
they continue to rally against threats to American freedom _
notably socialism and communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national media pretended like we were dead from 1966 until
about 1995,'' said Ken Hoover of Houston, the South and Central
Texas coordinator for the group. ``We kind of dropped out of sight.
But we are certainly a resurgent John Birch Society today.''
</P>
<P>
   The society was formed in Indianapolis in 1958 by Massachusetts
businessman Robert Welch, who believed that communists and other
leftists were infiltrating the U.S. government. The organization is
named for an American soldier who had been killed by Chinese
communists in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The Politician,'' Welch accused President Dwight
Eisenhower of being ``a dedicated conscious agent of the communist
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Birchers have never released membership figures to the
public, but the group is believed to have reached its zenith during
the 1964 presidential campaign of conservative Republican Barry
Goldwater, who had no connection to the group, with as many as
100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   A 1964 campaign led by the John Birch Society to impeach Earl
Warren, the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, generated
hundreds of letters a day to members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Although the group largely dropped out of public view in the
1970s, it still claimed some 50,000 members when Welch died in
1985. After his death, membership shrank to about 15,000, according
to Political Research Associates, an independent, nonprofit
research center based in Somerville, Mass., that monitors
right-wing groups.
</P>
<P>
   Political Research Associates estimates that in recent years,
membership in the John Birch Society has climbed to about 55,000,
now that its theory of a massive conspiracy to form a single world
government has gained followers among militia groups and right-wing
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The group's monthly magazine, the New American, has a
circulation of 53,920, said Dennis Behreandt, research assistant at
the John Birch Society headquarters in Appleton, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-hour talk at the Aug. 11 meeting in New Braunfels,
which is northeast of San Antonio, Smith touched on conspiracy
theories involving the Federal Reserve Board, the United Nations
and high-ranking officials of almost every department of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal of the communists has always been world domination,''
he said. ``But there has always been people in the United States,
Texas and Comal County doing the same things. ... But they can't
get away with it as long as the American people are awake.''

 &HT;    Clinton's affair caused Gingrich to struggle with a deeply
personal dilemma
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, AUG. 29
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich's political future was cloudy at best after his
resignation as speaker and congressman. Now it seems all but over.
News of his impending divorce _ his second _ and allegations of a
lengthy affair with a 33-year-old congressional aide have rendered
him unelectable to any post substantial enough to hold his
interest.
</P>
<P>
   News of his affair has exposed Gingrich to charges of hypocrisy,
not to mention a substantial bit of snickering. Some of that's
deserved. The man who decried what he called ``a multicultural,
nihilistic hedonism that is inherently destructive of a healthy
society,'' and who blamed liberals for Woody Allen's affair with
his stepdaughter and for Susan Smith's murder of her two children,
can't expect much sympathy when the chickens come to roost on his
own bedpost.
</P>
<P>
   However, on the most specific and damaging charge of hypocrisy _
that Gingrich was bashing Bill Clinton for immorality even while he
himself carried on with a House employee _ the issue is a little
more complicated. Because even as other Republicans were calling
Clinton everything up to and including rapist, Gingrich largely
refrained. The record of that period instead reveals Gingrich
struggling with a deeply personal dilemma. As a politician, he
needed to criticize Clinton and make the most of the opportunity
the president had given him, if for no other reason than to satisfy
his own conservative supporters. But as a human being, he could not
condemn Clinton without also condemning himself.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best example of Gingrich's struggle occurred on
April 27, 1998, in a speech before members of GOPAC, the political
action committee that had helped to put Gingrich in the speaker's
chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister-in-law, who is an elementary school teacher, and my
brother drove down with their two children, Kevin and Lauren, to my
daughter's wedding in January right after the scandal broke with
Monica Lewinsky,'' Gingrich told the crowd that night. ``And my
sister-in-law said to me, she was ashamed of the radio news because
she didn't know how to explain to her two children exactly what it
was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `First of all, we don't need to know these things.
There's a level of detail here which is grotesque and demeaning to
every American. We just don't need to know. Let's put it back in
the tabloids. Let's get it off television. Let's get it off
radio.'''
</P>
<P>
   One can only imagine the thoughts rumbling through Gingrich's
head during that conversation. His distaste for delving into the
personal lives of politicians was genuine and longstanding,
predating the Clinton scandal. But he also had to be worried sick
that someday soon, his sister-in-law might turn on the radio and
hear embarrassing details about his own personal life.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the speaker's reticence about Clinton had already
begun to perplex many conservatives. They were wondering out loud
why their favorite attack dog had fallen silent on such a juicy
topic. So in that same GOPAC speech, Gingrich also pledged that ``I
will never again, as long as I am speaker, make a speech without
commenting on (the Lewinsky scandal).'' He kept that promise for
about a week, and even then he focused on Clinton's disrespect for
the rule of law, not his behavior with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Republican hierarchy, at least some of Gingrich's
colleagues must have understood what was going on; even back then,
rumors were circulating that the speaker was having an affair with
a House aide. But those in the know couldn't exactly explain their
leader's predicament to the Republican rank and file that was
screaming for Clinton's head. And eventually, while Gingrich never
did attack Clinton on personal terms, he did capitulate privately
to those who wanted all-out war against the president.
</P>
<P>
   For example, after release of the salacious Starr report to
Congress, the American public responded with anger at those who
thought such material germane to public debate. Within the
Republican House caucus, some moderate members wanted to withhold
additional supporting material submitted by Starr, which contained
tawdry details about cigars and other matters. Despite his belief
that ``such a level of detail ... is grotesque and demeaning,''
Gingrich caved in to the right, telling the caucus in a closed
meeting that the material would be made public.
</P>
<P>
   Again, just before the November election, Gingrich personally
approved $10 million in TV ads lambasting Clinton for his affair
with Lewinsky. That move also backfired, contributing to Republican
losses in the House and eventually leading to Gingrich's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is, Gingrich had been right. The American public
didn't want its nose rubbed in the dirty details of its president's
personal life, and it came to resent those who insisted on doing
so. If Gingrich had stayed true to his own principles, if he had
resisted those in his party willing to use any means necessary to
destroy Clinton, he could have saved himself, his party and his
country a lot of pain.
</P>
<P>
   But Gingrich didn't have it in him.
</P>
<P>
   That weakness fits a pattern that marked Gingrich's entire
career. He had a genius for inflaming and inciting an audience, a
knack born of his ability to ignore the many shades of gray that
make up public policy and cast it instead in stark terms of good
and evil. His audience came to demand that of Gingrich, and he felt
compelled to give them what they wanted. Through GOPAC, he taught
that style to an entire generation of Republican politicians, to
the point that it came to define the party in the public's eye.
</P>
<P>
   However, that aggressive style of politics is best suited to
expressing a hard-right ideology that Gingrich in his heart did not
share. He was never a comfortable fit with the far right, and
through his college courses and his books, he even tried to
construct an alternative GOP ideology around the writings of minor
figures such as Peter Drucker, Alvin Toffler and W. Edward Deming.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that jury-rigged philosophy never took hold.
The people brought into politics by Gingrich's red-meat speaking
style were motivated by abortion, gun control, anti-environment
sentiment, homophobia, immigration and race relations, issues in
which Gingrich had little real interest or even disagreed with the
coalition that had put him into power.
</P>
<P>
   And that was the true hypocrisy. To gain and keep power,
Gingrich chose to say things that he knew weren't true, and to say
them with apparent heartfelt sincerity. It was a tragic choice on
his part, particularly given his oft-expressed admiration for
people such as Winston Churchill and Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill, Reagan and other Gingrich heroes had a strong inner
core. They believed in certain things, and they did not alter those
beliefs even when self-betrayal might have brought them advantage
or saved them pain. That trait defined their greatness. Gingrich
understood that, but he proved incapable of emulating it.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he never achieved the greatness he saw as his
destiny.

LL COOL J BALANCES REEL LIFE, HIP-HOP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOEY GUERRA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet LL Cool J _ the hardest-working man in show business.
</P>
<P>
   Don't scoff. Given the 31-year-old entertainer's recent list of
accomplishments, he may give James Brown a run for his money.
</P>
<P>
   There's the recently released shark flick ``Deep Blue Sea,'' in
which he stars as a Bible-quoting cook; ``In Too Deep,'' the
intense crime drama co-starring Omar Epps, Stanley Tucci and Pam
Grier; and the upcoming ``Any Given Sunday,'' LL's highest-profile
big-screen project to date.
</P>
<P>
   The last, a $40 million football drama directed by Oliver Stone,
stars Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Ann-Margret and Cameron
Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   If that's not enough, the rapper and actor, whose first single
was 1985's ``I Can't Live Without My Radio,'' is also working on a
new album of ``straight-up hip-hop,'' slated for a November
release.
</P>
<P>
   LL (whose real name is James Smith) has also started Rock the
Bells, his own record company, which is dedicated to discovering
and promoting new music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I do, I just prepare myself to try to do it to the
best of my ability. That's my main thing,'' LL said, calling from a
Los Angeles video shoot for hip-hop group the Myth, the first act
signed to the Rock the Bells label. ``For the most part,
preparation for me in anything is just knowing everything I'm
trying to do. I don't have a lot of formulas, no superstitions. I
go out there and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest fruit of those passions is ``In Too Deep,'' a gritty
look at the world of organized street crime. (It opened recently.)
Epps plays an undercover detective whose first mission is to
locate, befriend and expose a citywide crime ring led by a
menacing, if decidedly complex, character known only as God.
</P>
<P>
   For LL, tackling the role of a character as ruthless as God was
a challenge and a welcome change of pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was an opportunity for me to show that I can
be a skilled actor and just really work hard and do a part that's a
stretch for me,'' he said. ``When you think about all of the things
that I've done in my film career so far, most of them are a really
nice guy or a funny guy or a lovable guy. I thought it would be
interesting to take on the challenge of doing something different.
Henceforth, we jump into the villain role.''
</P>
<P>
   LL's screen debut came in the 1985 hip-hop musical documentary
``Krush Groove,'' and his first encounter with acting was in ``The
Hard Way,'' an action-comedy starring Michael J. Fox and James
Woods in which he played an undercover cop.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, LL's film roles have indeed centered around likable
characters. He was a security guard in ``Halloween: H20,'' turned
in a notable cameo in the otherwise forgettable ``Woo'' and played
funny alongside Robin Williams and Joan Cusack in the 1992 holiday
flop ``Toys.'' The lovable streak continued with ``In the House,''
a short-lived sitcom co-starring Debbie Allen and Alfonso Ribeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime fans will be surprised by LL's convincing portrayal of
``In Too Deep's'' crime lord, who is slick and charming one minute
and shatteringly violent the next. LL chalks it up to having an
acting coach, really tapping into the character and finding out
what makes him tick. So much intense rehearsal, however, had an
unexpected effect after each day's scenes were filmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't love beating up on a woman in the rain. The whole
character, in general, as a human being ... I didn't like the
guy,'' LL said. ``Going home to the hotel at night after doing all
the things that I had done during the day was really difficult for
me. It was a funny feeling, like I was going into a dark world. I
would speak to my family on the phone and feel like I was polluting
them or something. It was crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   LL is married to Simone Johnson, with whom he has three
children. Asked about balancing his home and professional duties,
LL's answer is emphatically simple: He always maintains time for a
personal life, he said, ``no matter what. I never allow these
things to take priority over my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Although LL has been working steadily in movies for the past few
years, it's his music that has made him a superstar. Since crossing
over to Top 40 radio with his 1987 breakthrough hit, ``I Need
Love,'' LL Cool J (short for Ladies Love Cool James) has fashioned
one of the longest and most consistent careers in hip-hop music.
His seventh and most recent album, 1997's ``Phenomenon,'' produced
hits in the title track and the introspective single ``Father.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with so much success in both music and the movies, LL says
he simply feels lucky to be able to dabble in so many fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love doing films. There's nothing like going to a theater
and seeing yourself running and jumping with the explosions and all
that. That's crazy,'' he said. ``And then there's nothing like the
feeling of your record coming on when you're standing in a club.
It's the best of both worlds to do both, man. It's a blessing. It's
a beautiful life, man.''

RINGWALD ON THE COMEBACK TRAIL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; In ``Sixteen Candles,'' what does Molly Ringwald's
character, Samantha, let Farmer Ted (Anthony Michael Hall) borrow
at the school dance?
</P>
<P>
   A: Her undies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Claire, her character in ``The Breakfast Club,'' packs the
perfect lunch for her day of detention. What does she bring?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Sushi.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Is the actress poised for a comeback?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; It seems so.
</P>
<P>
   Ringwald can currently be seen in ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle,'' the
latest offering from writer and director Kevin Williamson, creator
of TV's ``Dawson's Creek'' and the hit ``Scream'' films.
</P>
<P>
   The comedic thriller _ about a good student who teaches a cruel
teacher a lesson _ stars ``Creek'' resident Katie Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' choice of Holmes invites comparisons to the working
relationship John Hughes shared with Ringwald during the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Ringwald reigned as Hughes' teen queen that decade. In the
aforementioned movies, and in 1986's ``Pretty in Pink,'' she
embodied teen angst long before it became hip to do so _ years
before ``Creek's'' complicated debates on life and love.
</P>
<P>
   But don't look for Ringwald to offer the younger actress career
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's doing quite well on her own,'' Ringwald, now 31, said of
Holmes during a recent interview from New York City. ``She'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Ringwald hesitates because her transition to adult roles
proved difficult. A slew of mediocre film and TV projects followed
her '80s blockbusters. Fed up with Hollywood, she packed her bags
and headed to Paris to appear in a French film.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary move turned into a four-year stay. While there,
Ringwald learned the language, made more movies and fell in love
with writer Valery Lameignere.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she came back to the United States to star in the
short-lived TV series ``Townies.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a late-1997 project that set her current comeback in
motion. She tackled the lead in off-Broadway's ``How I Learned to
Drive,'' reprising the role for an L.A. run earlier this year. The
play won a Pulitzer Prize, and critics praised her performance.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Ringwald married Lameignere, and the couple is
expecting a child. The family will call New York home, but Ringwald
said time will be spent in Paris as well, when work allows.
</P>
<P>
   Ringwald has several films set to hit theaters in the next year.
``Hearts and Bones,'' with Keifer Sutherland and Darryl Hannah,
will screen at the Toronto Film Festival next month. Kimberly, with
Gabrielle Anwar and Sean Astin, will start on the festival circuit,
too. ``Cut,'' which she describes as ``Australia's answer to
`Scream,''' arrives here next summer.
</P>
<P>
   For now, she's filming ``In the Weeds'' with Joshua Leonard
(``The Blair Witch Project'') in New York and wrapping up publicity
duties for ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A reporter recently asked me if I was playing a student in the
film,'' Ringwald laughed. ``I wanted to ask him, `Are you stuck in
a time warp?'''
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's hard not to associate Ringwald with her younger days
and Hughes' movies. Certain scenes _ such as Samantha and her dream
boy, Jake, sharing a birthday cake atop her dinner table in
``Sixteen Candles`` _ are unforgettable.
</P>
<P>
   The actress also remembers them fondly and says if she could
make a sequel to any of those films, it would be ``Pretty in Pink.
Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmm, ``Prettier in Pink.'' How could we not wish her to come
back?
</P>

 &HT;    A TUG-OF-WAR OVER THE NEW MILLENNIUM
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the year rolls over from 1999 to 2000, many
time travelers will want to be there first. So cruise ships and
some small island nations are marketing millennium celebrations by
taking advantage of positions along the International Date Line in
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise ships will have tens of thousands of travelers lined
up on the 180-degree meridian, which forms most of the imaginary
line dividing yesterday from today, to pop champagne corks before
the New Yorkers planning to pack Times Square have even started
their breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers who want to among the first into see 2000, but
have no desire to be simultaneously hung over and seasick on Jan.
1, islands are the answer. And although islands are not movable,
they are nevertheless jockeying for position in the race to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering began last October, when Fiji switched to
daylight saving time from November through February, moving the
clock ahead one hour for the island nation. Many travel agents
thought that was a clever marketing move, because it would put
Fiji's midnight an hour ahead of the 170 islands of the nearby
Kingdom of Tonga, which shares Fiji's time zone.
</P>
<P>
   But Tonga, not wanting to get left behind, has announced that it
too plans to switch to daylight saving time in November.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's where the competition in the time trials really gets
ugly: Tonga is east of Fiji. In fact, it's east of the 180-degree
meridian, which means it should be the last place on Earth where
the new year begins, not the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But fortunately for its tourist industry, Tonga can promote
itself as ``the place where time begins.'' Years ago, it invoked
international convention to have the dateline bent to the east
around its borders. That allowed Tonga to share the same day of the
week with its neighbors in Fiji, Australia and New Zealand, rather
than always be a day late.
</P>
<P>
   One might assume that with Fiji and Tonga sharing the same time
zone and both using daylight saving time, their race to 2000 would
end in a tie. But Tonga boosters say that while midnight will
strike at the same moment in both places, the millennium will dawn
first on their islands, because they are further east.
</P>
<P>
   All this may seem petty, if not ridiculous. But party planners
everywhere realize that the upcoming New Year's celebrations will
make us all much more aware of the globe's 24 time zones and
celebratory ``firsts.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Americans will still be munching Cheerios on Dec. 31,
TV will be showing us New Year's celebrations in New Zealand and
Australia. By the evening news shows, we'll be watching the dancing
in the streets of Paris and Rome as 2000 arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Will people be getting tired of party scenes by the time
midnight finally rolls around to America? And will the people on
the West Coast feel trumped by the televised celebration in New
York's Times Square?
</P>
<P>
   Party planners in this country are hoping that while we may
watch TV globally, we will still party locally. At The Beverly
Hills Hotel, Californians will be encouraged to focus on the moment
and not wonder about what is happening back east, where midnight
will come three hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Marriott, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said about 500
guests will enjoy a six-course meal, fine champagne, dancing and a
12 o'clock countdown without having to worry about comparisons with
parties in other time zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discussed having TV monitors to show (the midnight hour) as
it goes around the globe, but we ruled that out,'' Marriott said.
``We're having a beautiful dinner here, and we want to stay focused
on our celebration.''

 &HT;    A TUG-OF-WAR OVER THE NEW MILLENNIUM
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Aug. 29.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the year rolls over from 1999 to 2000, many
time travelers will want to be there first. So cruise ships and
some small island nations are marketing millennium celebrations by
taking advantage of positions along the International Date Line in
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise ships will have tens of thousands of travelers lined
up on the 180-degree meridian, which forms most of the imaginary
line dividing yesterday from today, to pop champagne corks before
the New Yorkers planning to pack Times Square have even started
their breakfasts.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers who want to among the first into see 2000, but
have no desire to be simultaneously hung over and seasick on Jan.
1, islands are the answer. And although islands are not movable,
they are nevertheless jockeying for position in the race to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering began last October, when Fiji switched to
daylight saving time from November through February, moving the
clock ahead one hour for the island nation. Many travel agents
thought that was a clever marketing move, because it would put
Fiji's midnight an hour ahead of the 170 islands of the nearby
Kingdom of Tonga, which shares Fiji's time zone.
</P>
<P>
   But Tonga, not wanting to get left behind, has announced that it
too plans to switch to daylight saving time in November.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's where the competition in the time trials really gets
ugly: Tonga is east of Fiji. In fact, it's east of the 180-degree
meridian, which means it should be the last place on Earth where
the new year begins, not the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But fortunately for its tourist industry, Tonga can promote
itself as ``the place where time begins.'' Years ago, it invoked
international convention to have the dateline bent to the east
around its borders. That allowed Tonga to share the same day of the
week with its neighbors in Fiji, Australia and New Zealand, rather
than always be a day late.
</P>
<P>
   One might assume that with Fiji and Tonga sharing the same time
zone and both using daylight saving time, their race to 2000 would
end in a tie. But Tonga boosters say that while midnight will
strike at the same moment in both places, the millennium will dawn
first on their islands, because they are further east.
</P>
<P>
   All this may seem petty, if not ridiculous. But party planners
everywhere realize that the upcoming New Year's celebrations will

CHARLIE CHAPLIN _ MAKING A LIVING AT ESSANAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dw) 
 By BILL KELLEY   
 The Herald-Tribune, Sarasota, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Want proof that the film restoration craze is in no danger of
scraping bottom? Look no further than Kino on Video's fresh series
of Charlie Chaplin tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged in four volumes (at $19.95 per tape), ``Chaplin's
Essanay Comedies'' showcases the comedian in transition. The year
(1915) that Chaplin spent at Chicago-based Essanay is bracketed by
his seminal work at Keystone (1914) and his more polished films for
Mutual (1916-17).
</P>
<P>
   Film buffs can argue, as they have for decades, over the merits
of the individual Essanay titles. The cold fact is, Chaplin went
with Essanay for the money _ 10 times what he was earning at
Keystone. But there is no denying that Kino's is the best visual
presentation of the Chaplin Essanays since their original,
theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
   Kino's archivist, David Shepard, prowled several vaults to
secure the most pristine source material for reassembling these
mostly two-reel comedies.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Chaplin hated his year at Essanay, and with
good reason. The company's California studio was located in Niles,
a one-horse town situated well outside Los Angeles, built for
Essanay's reigning cowboy superstar, Bronco Billy Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated from the Hollywood community, Chaplin _ who wrote,
directed and starred in his films _ also bristled under Essanay's
cost-cutting measures. The most notorious of these was the practice
of editing films by carving directly into the negative, rather than
into a duplicate print.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin won many of his battles with Essanay, but he knew he
would never win the war for creative control. This is why he left
after just a year (the company folded two years later). His work
for the studio is undeniably compromised, yet, the 16 shorts
remastered by Kino offer an abundance of treasures for movie lovers
to savor.
</P>
<P>
   ``His New Job'' (from Volume One), Chaplin's first film for
Essanay, marks his initial pairing with cross-eyed comic Ben
Turpin, and features a young Gloria Swanson as a movie studio
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tramp'' (from Volume Two) expands the character of
Chaplin's signature screen archetype, and contains one of the first
bittersweet fade-outs in movie comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Volume four boasts two near-masterpieces: ``A Night in the
Show'' and ``Burlesque on `Carmen'.'' The former is a hilarious
reworking of a famous music hall sketch by Fred Karno (the British
impresario who brought Chaplin to the United States), while
``Carmen'' _ a spoof of the Bizet opera that had just been filmed
``straight'' by Cecil B. DeMille _ is Kino's restoration of
Chaplin's original. (Essanay had padded it to feature length with
extraneous footage not directed by Chaplin.)
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin's year at Essanay, and his subsequent period with
Mutual, gave him the technical training, and helped build the
confidence, which audiences would later see blossom in such
full-length features as ``The Kid'' and ``The Gold Rush.'' The
four-tape set demonstrates the measurable growth of an artist ready
to cut loose.
</P>
<P>
   A fifth tape from Kino, ``Chaplin's Goliath'' (also $19.95), is
a one-hour documentary profile of early Chaplin foil Eric Campbell.
With his massive frame, close-cropped hair and arched eyebrows, the
Scottish-born Campbell made an ideal nemesis for Chaplin's
mischievous innocent, and ``Chaplin's Goliath'' is a perfect
bookend to the Essanay series.

TERROR IN DAYLIGHT: OSCAR-WINNER KIM BASINGER'S SECRET FEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Kim Basinger 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    For years, Oscar-winning actress Kim Basinger was too terrified
to leave the house.
 &HT;    ``Fear has been something I've lived with my entire life, the
fear of being in public places _ which led to anxiety or panic
attacks,'' Basinger says in a remarkable interview on ``Panic,''
the powerful documentary which airs on HBO in September.
 &HT;    The 45-year-old actress, who won an Academy Award in 1997 for
her role in ``L.A. Confidential,'' says she has been a lifelong
victim of agoraphobia.
 &HT;    The disorder, with its far-reaching and debilitating effects,
has affected her throughout her career and continued even after she
received her profession's most coveted award.
 &HT;    For a time, Basinger now reveals, the disorder turned her into a
virtual recluse.
 &HT;    A former top model and ``Bond girl'' (in ``Never Say Never
Again,'' 1983), Basinger has starred in films such as ``The
Natural'' (1984), ``9 1/2 Weeks'' (1986) and ``Batman'' (1989).
 &HT;    She made millions of dollars as one of America's best-known
movie stars, but her career always seemed to hang by a thread.
 &HT;    Basinger's panic attacks had become a terrible secret which she
felt she had to hide from the public eye.
 &HT;    ``I stayed in my house and literally cried every day. I didn't
know what it was. I didn't know how to define it,'' she recalls.
 &HT;    ``You feel so isolated, so alone, so scared. I just kept talking
to God and saying, `Help me. I don't know where to go or what to
do...''' the actress says.
 &HT;    Basinger, who has a 4-year-old girl with husband Alec Baldwin,
says that when the tidal wave of media attention hit shortly before
her Oscar triumph, her problems worsened.
 &HT;    ``I was taking a shower,'' she recalls, ``And the thought came
that I might win and have to go on stage and say something. I broke
out in a sweat. Anytime they stuck a microphone in my face, the
words would strangle me. I won the Oscar, but I still don't know
how to talk about it,'' Basinger adds sadly.
 &HT;    Sitting in her Hollywood home today, the star describes the
feeling of being engulfed by fear of the outside world.
 &HT;    ``It can hit at any time,'' she says. ``You feel like you're in
an open field, and there's a tornado coming at you. And you're just
consumed by it.''
 &HT;    Between 23 and 28 million Americans (roughly 10 percent of the
population) suffer from some form of anxiety or panic disorder,
according to experts interviewed on the HBO documentary. But only
one in four agoraphobics seeks treatment.
 &HT;    Some say the condition can be traced to flaws in the brain's
structure, while others compare it to a kind of imaginary
suffocation. Still others say the ailment could be a throwback to
the primitive ``fight or flight'' mechanism.
 &HT;    Basinger's problems began when she was a shy middle child
growing up in Athens, Ga.
 &HT;    ``I would have a horrendous time being called on to stand up and
read words out loud in front of other kids. I'd literally start
shaking and sweating and not being able to breathe and would come
close to fainting,'' she says.
 &HT;    Basinger moved to New York and became a sought-after model,
earning $1,000 a day. In 1976 she moved to Hollywood and in just
three years won a leading role in the television remake of ``From
Here to Eternity.''
 &HT;    She appeared to be the epitome of a confident, ambitious young
actress, and even posed naked for a Playboy spread.
 &HT;    But behind the pose, she says, there was anguish.
 &HT;    Basinger vividly recalls her first adult panic attack, which
struck her in her mid-20s.
 &HT;    ``I was in a health-food store. All of a sudden everything
became silent. I could see people's mouths moving, but there was
nothing inside my head other than these strange sounds. My hands
were shaking. I was sweating so profusely I could not move,'' she
says.
 &HT;    ``I made it to my car and remember getting the keys in the
ignition, cranking the car up, taking the back roads to my home and
parking. I didn't leave the house for six months,'' Basinger adds.
 &HT;    Even though her career was booming, she felt crippled and became
so depressed she considered suicide.
 &HT;    ``I felt completely paralyzed ... I couldn't go out without
feeling that I might unwind. You want to just get up and scream or
run,'' Basinger says.
 &HT;    When the attacks continued and she feared she might lose her
mind, she sought treatment from Dr. Ronald Doctor, a specialist who
treated her symptoms without the use of drugs.
 &HT;    ``My therapy was about awareness and education. And it lessened
those horrible panic attacks,'' she says.
 &HT;    Basinger was one of the lucky ones: Even though doctors say that
80 to 90 percent of all agoraphobia patients recover, few seek
treatment.
 &HT;    Many agoraphobics feel their condition is misunderstood and
underestimated, and they crave understanding. Even Basinger's
husband had a hard time coming to terms with her illness.
 &HT;    ``He was baffled by it and wasn't sure it really existed. But he
has seen a great change in me,'' says Basinger, adding that she has
learned to face her fears and has regained control of her life.
 &HT;    ``I'm not naked anymore. I'm not standing alone as a frail kid.
I've had so much help, and so much guidance.
 &HT;    ``When I take my last breath,'' she adds, with a laugh, ``It's
not going to be because I'm having a panic attack _ that's for
darned sure.''

FORGET SUMMERTIME, VIDEO WORLD IS HOT FOR HALLOWEEN SALES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year around this time, video stores start amassing spooky
movies as if pumpkins were already perched on porches. Of course,
that still doesn't jump the gun as much as Christmas sales pitches,
which also should start any day now.
</P>
<P>
   This year's pre-Halloween hype at least starts with something
special: a new edition of Bela Lugosi's 1931 ``Dracula,'' with a
new score composed by Philip Glass and performed by the Kronos
Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Created especially for video, the revised ``Dracula'' is due in
stores Tuesday for a suggested $14.98.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, you can try a new spin on John Carpenter's
``Halloween.'' Offered this week in a special edition by Anchor
Bay, the film has been fully restored by Lucasfilm's THX Digital
Mastering Services and has gained Dolby Surround Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the movie, you get ``Halloween Unmasked 2000,'' a
27-minute documentary that expands greatly on a previous
documentary that was part of a two-tape ``Halloween'' set about a
year ago. Most of the new video's documentary features new
material, including interviews with director and co-writer
Carpenter; producer Irwin Yablans; cinematographer Dean Cundey;
producer and co-writer Debra Hill; and actors Jamie Lee Curtis,
P.J. Soles and Nick Castle, who first played masked madman Michael
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   On VHS you can choose between a wide-screen and full-frame
version of the film, each $14.98. The box art has an image of Myers
that turns into a pumpkin when it's tilted.
</P>
<P>
   On DVD, Halloween comes in two versions.
</P>
<P>
   Costing $29.98 and due Sept. 28, ``Halloween Restored'' on DVD
has the film in wide-screen and full-frame and includes the
original trailers, TV and radio spots, a gallery of posters and
stills _ some never seen _ talent bios and the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Costing $44.98 and due Sept. 14, the ``Halloween Limited
Edition'' two-disc DVD has all of those features, plus an extra
disc with the TV version of ``Halloween'' (with different shots),
shown wide-screen. Thirty thousand numbered copies were produced.
</P>
<P>
   If flesh-eating zombies are more your meat and potatoes, Anchor
Bay has issued a new ``Night of the Living Dead,'' with a new score
and 15 minutes of newly shot scenes edited into the film. Costing
$14.98 on VHS, this 30th-anniversary edition of George Romero's
horror classic has been remastered and also comes in two DVD
editions.
</P>
<P>
   A limited-edition DVD ($34.98) is full-frame and has both the
new cut with the extra 15 minutes and a 1998 version adding a new
score.
</P>
<P>
   Other features are audio commentary by several filmmakers (not
including Romero), a ``Dance of the Dead'' music video, a 32-page
booklet, a behind-the-scenes featurette, the theatrical trailer and
a still gallery.
</P>
<P>
   This edition also comes with a CD of the original soundtrack.
The CD doesn't come with the regular DVD edition, which costs $10
less but has all other extra features.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`GO' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999, R, Columbia TriStar, CC, VHS priced for rentals, DVD
$24.95.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ``Pulp Fiction'' emerged in 1994, copycat movies have
been called ``Tarantinoesque.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' is just that _ to a T. It follows the stories of several
characters whose destinies interlock, often jumping around in time
but not in its essential quest: to shock us with lurid extremes.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing that similar but more cartoonish (that is,
fanciful) extremes from ``South Park'' or ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head''
are trashed by the same critics who praise this film for its
creative genius.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason they've leaped on the bandwagon of director Doug
Liman, whose ``Swingers'' was one of the most overrated movies of
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he again wallows in Las Vegas (get a life, dude) as a
young drug dealer loses his cash, helps steal a car and shoots a
man before fleeing back home to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   There, a grocery-story cashier (Sarah Polley) takes up drug
dealing part-time and encounters a predictably ugly menace, all of
which she seems to deserve. This is a young woman who's willing to
leave a friend as collateral with an armed drug dealer just so she
can pay the rent.
</P>
<P>
   We also meet two TV actors (Jay Mohr and Scott Wolf) who get
into trouble with the police.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is supposed to be a comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go'' does have a twisted, perverse appeal at times, despite
being derivative and mean-spirited. Its cast is great, and its
music is good.
</P>
<P>
   But by this point, its desensitizing extremes aren't shocking.
They're not even grim and depressing. Worst of all for a filmmaker,
they're boring.

   Disney has farmed out more films to Anchor Bay for video

</P>
<P>
   In stores now is Return to Oz, a ``Wizard of Oz'' spinoff from
1985. Due Tuesday is ``One Magic Christmas,'' a 1985 Santa fest
starring Mary Steenburgen and Harry Dean Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Both are $14.98 on tape and $24.98 on DVD, with wide-screen
options for both.

SPORTS: SPURS AND STARS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs and Dallas Stars have new championship
tapes, each running about an hour and costing $20.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' video traces the franchise's history from its origins
to this year's NBA title. With former Rocket Mario Elie in the mix,
some candid shots of player-bonding even recall the Rockets'
championship videos.
</P>
<P>
   Like those tapes, the Spurs' video ends with irrelevant country
music. New Jersey-based NBA Entertainment must think we all wear
cowboy boots every day down here.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' tape goes the route of heavy metal, with Metallica's
``Nothing Else Matters'' as a fitting head-banger theme for
hard-hitting NHL hockey.
</P>
<P>
   This tape doesn't have much history, since the franchise has
been in Dallas only six years. But it does have far more dramatic
footage than you get watching hockey telecasts, thanks to
close-ups, isolations and tight editing.
</P>
<P>
   The rule controversy surrounding Dallas' title-winning goal is
conveniently overlooked.

 &HT;    CENSUS ERRORS THREATEN FUNDING FOR KIDS
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If next year's census misses as many children as
the 1990 Census, more than 2 million children will suffer as
billions of dollars of government aid are directed elsewhere,
according to a national alliance of education, community and
government groups.
</P>
<P>
   Better awareness of the importance of the census to children's
well-being might increase the number of adults who will list their
children for census-takers, representatives of the Census 2000
Initiative said Thursday as they released a study at the National
Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are big for Colorado, according to the study. It
shows that the 1990 census-takers missed 29,988 children in
Colorado, 3.4 percent of the kids in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That included 3.1 percent of the children in Colorado Springs,
3.6 percent in Aurora and 4.9 percent in Denver, which had the 42nd
worst undercount among the nation's 100 largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are enormous for Florida, according to the study. It
shows that the 1990 census-takers missed 134,477 children in
Florida. That undercount of 4.5 percent tied Florida with
Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas for the worst rate among the 50
states.
</P>
<P>
   The enumerators missed 7.2 percent of the children in Miami and
6.4 percent in Hialeah, which had the second and third worst
undercounts among the nation's 100 largest cities. The undercounts
in Florida's other major cities were 5.5 percent in Tampa, 4.8
percent in Jacksonville and 4.7 percent in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are big for Georgia, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   It shows that the 1990 census-takers missed 78,898 children in
Georgia. That undercount of 4.4 percent tied Georgia with South
Carolina for the fifth worst state undercount. Only Florida,
Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, where 4.5 percent were missed,
had a worse rate.
</P>
<P>
   The enumerators missed 6.2 percent of the children in Atlanta
and 4.5 percent in Columbus. The undercount in Atlanta was the
fifth worst and in Columbus the 47th worst among the nation's 100
largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are big for North Carolina, according to the study.
It shows that the 1990 census-takers missed 68,699 children in
North Carolina. That undercount of 4.1 percent was the 12th worst
in the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   That included 5.1 percent of the children in Charlotte, 5.0
percent in Raleigh and 4.1 percent in Greensboro.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that Ohio, where 56,594 children were missed by
census-takers in 1990. The undercount of 2.0 percent wasn't as bad
as in most states, but Ohio's cities had bigger problems.
</P>
<P>
   The count missed 2,312 children in Dayton. That undercount of
4.5 percent ranked as the 45th worst among the nation's 100 largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS
</P>
<P>
   The study shows that 1990 census-takers missed 228,360 children
in Texas. That undercount of 4.5 percent tied Texas with Florida,
Mississippi and Louisiana for the worst rate among the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   The enumerators missed 6.1 percent of the children in Houston,
the 7th worst rate among the nation's 100 biggest cities. In other
major Texas cities, the undercounts were 5.9 percent in Dallas, 5.8
percent in San Antonio and El Paso, 5.7 percent in Austin, 5.6
percent in Corpus Christi, 4.7 percent in Arlington and 4.6 percent
in Garland.
</P>
<P>
   (END COX STATE INSERTS)
</P>
<P>
   ``When children are not counted accurately, we don't get a true
picture of our nation, and communities are robbed of their rightful
share of public funds'' from federal and state governments, said
the study's author, William P. O'Hare, a senior researcher at the
Kids Count Project of the Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau acknowledges that more than half of the 4.4
million people it missed in 1990 were under the age of 18.
Nationally, the undercount was 3.2 percent among children, more
than twice the 1.2 percent undercount for the total population. The
undercount was greatest among children 9 years old or younger.
</P>
<P>
   ``People could argue that adults who resist being counted don't
deserve to be included,'' O'Hare said. But, he added, ``It is hard
to justify leaving out 2 million children who are missed through no
fault of their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Children from racial minorities, distressed big-city
neighborhoods or large families illegally crammed into small
quarters were more likely than other children to be missed. So were
those living with relatives other than their parents, shuttling
between separated parents, or being raised by recent immigrants or
other non-English speakers.
</P>
<P>
   These tend to be the fastest-growing groups nowadays in the
parts of the country where the undercounts were highest in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the Northeast and Midwest, which have
experienced little growth, have received some population-based
federal grants that should have been directed to health and
education programs for children in the faster-growing South and
West. They received the money because their undercounts of 2
percent of children weren't as bad as the rates of 4.3 percent in
the South and 3.9 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Undercounts can also affect decisions on which communities get
state help, on whether to build more schools, or on where to offer
transit service and locate stores and day care centers, said
representatives of the National Education Association and the
National Association of Counties.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to improve the count in 2000 also have the support of
conservatives like Matthew Glavin, president of the Southeastern
Legal Foundation. In January, his foundation won a Supreme Court
case that smashed President Clinton's plans to use scientific
sampling to correct the effect of the undercount on the
apportionment of congressional seats among the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely encourage everyone to exercise their
constitutional right to fill out the census form,'' Glavin said at
the foundation's headquarters in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   He said next year's count should be more complete because people
will be able to fill out forms not just at home, but on the
Internet, ``at the local fire station or welfare office, or even at
the corner Seven-11 store.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, more of the 800,000 census-takers will be
fluent in languages other than English, so that they can perform
better in immigrant neighborhoods, where misunderstandings or
distrust of government often lower census response rates.
</P>
<P>
   If all else fails, he said his organization has no
constitutional objections to legislation that would use statistical
sampling or other corrections for undercounts that influence the
distribution of federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is the constitutional distribution of political
power, not statutory decisions about how and where to spend
money,'' Glavin said.

 &HT;    Politics of destruction could elect us a dope as president
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I never used illegal drugs. Not once. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could say this is because I was, in my tender youth, a
fine upstanding and God-fearing young man, but it just isn't so.
</P>
<P>
   I was, however, a father-fearing young man and my father the cop
had made it plenty clear that if I was caught with drugs he would
see to it that I was put in the deepest, darkest cell with an
inmate whose nickname was ``Boyfriend.'' I believed him when he
told me that 30 years ago and I believe it now. It surely was
enough to keep me on the straight-and-narrow.
</P>
<P>
   But I was an aberration. I am almost positive that more than
half the people in my high school years in the early '70s used
illegal drugs, at least occasionally. You simply could not attend a
party where people weren't smoking marijuana. Cocaine was used by
those who had a little more cash in their pockets. Most of them
were experimenting with speed and LSD.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who did not use illegal drugs did not exactly
ostracize those who did. They were our friends. I don't remember
ever feeling badly in high school about someone who was, as we
called them, a ``doper.''
</P>
<P>
   With only three exceptions I can think of, all of my friends at
least experimented with illegal drugs. I guess it would be helpful
to the anti-drug message if I told you that all those drug users
wound up in the streets, penniless, lives in a shamble.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen, either. Most of them went to college,
graduated, got some sense into their heads and quit using drugs,
then went on to become useful and productive citizens. I'm sure
plenty of them are even Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   (By the way, just because you used drugs as a young adult
doesn't mean you cannot want drug dealers today dealt with to the
fullest extent of the law. Those who hate drugs the most are often
those who used them a great deal.)
</P>
<P>
   Being just a few years younger than George W. Bush, I know he
was faced with the same situation. With anyone from that
generation, I am surprised to find someone who did not use drugs.
If George W. was an exception _ he probably was not _ I would be
surprised.
</P>
<P>
   For a fact, I'm highly skeptical of all those Republican
candidates who all swear that they've never taken illegal drugs.
You're telling me that frat boy Dan Quayle didn't once smoke
marijuana? The most drugs I ever saw in one place other than a
police drug bust, was at a fraternity party in college and I wasn't
even a member.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Forbes? All that money, all those parties before he
turned religious, he never took cocaine? If drugs didn't circulate
in his bloodstream, they certainly circulated in his social circle.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, none of this has anything to do with the
presidential nomination. If George W. Bush snorted a pound of
cocaine a day when he was 25 it wouldn't mean beans now. Nothing. I
don't care if Quayle ever took a toke or if Forbes did an nightly
imitation of Super Fly.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, you know what? I don't even care if all of them are
lying about it.
</P>
<P>
   The politics of destruction we've created in this county is such
that lying has become a candidate's only defense in some cases.
What is the upside of telling the truth? To feel better about
yourself and then see your opponents rip you like a wounded gazelle
amidst a pride of lions? Oh, yeah, that would make you feel better.
</P>
<P>
   If we really live in a country where people would pick Pat
Buchanan over George W. Bush just because Buchanan has never taken
illegal drugs (I believe Buchanan) then democracy is sunk. If we
are looking for perfect people instead of just good, solid
leadership, then we can all stop looking. We aren't going to find
it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is a good man who would make a good president. I believe
that.
</P>
<P>
   I'm also beginning to worry that the jackals aren't going to
give him a chance to prove his possibilities.

WOMAN TELLS ALL WHO WILL LISTEN ABOUT TOURETTE'S
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, Sept. 2)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julie Ann Wilde is a poet. She also has Tourette's Syndrome. She
doesn't think one cancels out the other, but some people do.
</P>
<P>
   Recently Julie, who lives in Petaluma, signed up for a private
poetry workshop and was turned away when she told the organizer
about her condition.
</P>
<P>
   Julie does that, comes right out and announces to people that
she has Tourette's, even jokes about having ``the infamous swearing
disease.'' She does it when she patronizes a new store, meets
someone new or enters a new situation. She'll give you a brochure
if you want one. The idea is, if she educates people about her
medical condition they won't be afraid of her and she can get on
with her life.
</P>
<P>
   The workshop organizer told her that she wouldn't fit in. ``She
said people get pretty emotional when they're doing poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie widens her eyes and shrugs. ``Of course, they get
emotional. It's poetry.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the first time. She was once snubbed by a goddess
study group and says, ``I thought that was very contrary to goddess
energy to be discriminating.''
</P>
<P>
   She knows it comes from ignorance, but it's still rejection. ``I
cry and then I get angry and then I think they don't know what
they're missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie is a clever, attractive woman with an easy sense of humor.
She can tell you everything you want to know about ``Touretters,''
as she calls herself and the 100,000 Americans who have the
neurological disorder. That it's probably genetic, can be modified
with medication but not cured and usually eases as a person gets
older. She's 33, was diagnosed at 24 and probably had it from age
6, when it was more physical than vocal. She would sit and pat her
hands on her knees over and over, repeatedly push at a soft cushion
with one finger.
</P>
<P>
   Caused by a chemical imbalance that forces involuntary physical
movement and vocalization, both called tics, Tourette's is not a
mental illness. Coprolalia, the compulsion to say obscene words,
affects only 20 percent of people with Tourette's. Julie can
control some of it, by swallowing the word so that it comes out
more like a squeak than speech.
</P>
<P>
   It's a surprise if you've never met someone with Tourette's and
you shake hands and she drops a swear word. Julie says she can't
help it. She can hold off for a while, but it's like trying to
strangle a sneeze. Eventually it bursts out.
</P>
<P>
   Her pet theory is this. ``There is a part of the brain where
taboos are kept. Most people have a lock and key to that cabinet.
But mine is unlocked. And I've lost the key. And the drawers just
keep opening and closing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fascinating stuff, even to Julie, who tells about a
Norwegian friend with Tourette's. ``When he comes over here he
swears in English. Back home he swears in Norwegian. His brain
automatically rewrites it.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie didn't have a name for her condition until her mother saw
a young man named Adam Seligman on Geraldo Rivera's television show
talking about his Tourette's and where to write for more
information. Julie's mother got the brochure, passed it on to Julie
and Julie said, ``Oh my God, this is describing me.''
</P>
<P>
   Julie went on to not only meet Adam, a noted jazz critic, but to
marry him. They were together almost six years and wrote a book
together, but last winter Adam died.
</P>
<P>
   Julie goes on and vows the world will hear her words. Workshop
or not, she says, ``I'm still a poet.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the years there's been speculation that Mozart might
have had Tourette's, based on his quirky motor movements and
fondness for scatological references. That is still up for
speculation, but many experts on the brain, including popular
neurologist and author Dr. Oliver Sacks, are pretty sure that
Samuel Johnson had Tourette's. That would be Samuel Johnson, the
poet.

`THE WOUNDS:' THE MAKING OF BRUTES IN THE BALKANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Emir Kusturica demonstrated with ``Underground,'' the anguish
in the Balkans may be better conveyed through raucous, stinging
satire than by more conventionally compassionate means. For him and
now for Srdjan Dragojevic in ``The Wounds,'' the madness and moral
chaos of wartime call for rowdy cinematic outrage in response.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tactic that explodes any last trace of ordinary existence
and shows just how uncertain the future appears. In the case of
Dragojevic's film, it helps to define a new generation of thugs who
arouse both horror and pity. The two young Serbs who evolve during
the course of ``The Wounds'' from relative innocents to flashy
hoodlums are not condemned by the filmmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story about young criminals who I believe have a
deep moral right to be violent, even to murder, despite the
political unacceptability of this idea,'' Dragojevic has said. ``An
insensitive society and a totalitarian Serbian regime have made
thousands of Serbian teen-agers dangerous, senseless killing
machines, ironically whose main victims are themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wounds,'' which spans 1991 to 1996, begins with a glimpse
of its two main characters after they have been molded into the
ruthless, anesthetized brutes he describes. Then it moves back five
years to discover just how Pinki and Kraut (played by two effective
newcomers, Dusan Pekic and Milan Maric) got that way. With
improbable raffishness, it shows how the teen-agers fall into the
orbit of Dickie (Dragan Bjelogrlic), a flamboyant crook and black
marketeer who whispers ``Versace'' as if the word were magic.
Dickie, who could easily have stepped out of Kusturica's own
rogues' gallery, revels in the chance to teach the lads everything
he knows about whoring, drugs, gold chains and illicit commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for sanctions!'' is his credo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wounds'' _ in Serbo-Croatian, with English subtitles _
sustains its sense of the tragically absurd while Pinki and Kraut
grow tougher. It places them in the middle of a disintegrating
culture where the coolest criminals become television stars, where
a billboard advertises a brand name called Democracy Light and
where the right tribute to a fallen comrade is a bottle of Scotch
poured over his grave. Though Vukovar and Sarajevo are bombarded
during the story, the boys show little interest in the battles
raging around them. Only when they inevitably begin harming each
other do the consequences of their corruption hit home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to care about something,'' Pinki insists late in
the story. ``What if you can't find anything?'' Kraut asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wounds'' is best appreciated as an answer to that
question.

 AT THE MOVIES: HORRORS REAL AND IMAGINED  (mk) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For decades, filmmakers from India have largely
avoided dealing with the legacy of their nation's partition in
1947. At that time, when India finally gained independence from the
British, the human cost was horrific.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 12 million people were displaced, as Hindus, Muslims and
Sikhs clamored for pieces of the country, resulting in the division
into Muslim Pakistan and predominately Hindu India. As many as a
million people, and perhaps far more, were killed in religious
violence, which lingers to this day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a painful part of our history, and I suppose it
needs time and distance to look at it objectively,'' said Deepa
Mehta, an Indian-born filmmaker whose latest movie, ``Earth,'' is
an intense and sorrowful depiction of an upper-class family in the
elegant city of Lahore (now in Pakistan) whose easy lives are
engulfed by the religious violence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens in theaters in New York, Los Angeles and other
U.S. cities, as well as in India, on Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mehta, 44, who lives in Toronto and New Delhi, said she
expected strong reaction to the film in India, even though it takes
no religious or political stance of its own. But she is hardly a
stranger to controversy in India.
</P>
<P>
   Her 1997 film ``Fire'' stirred violent demonstrations and
threats for its depiction of two Indian women, in unhappy arranged
marriages, who are sexually attracted to each other. Some critics
said the film was flawed because virtually every man in it was a
male chauvinist or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were Molotov cocktails at theaters, terrorism, the film
had to be taken off the screens in Bombay and New Delhi,'' Ms.
Mehta said. ``But it finally returned. A lot of women felt that
these people should not determine what they could and could not
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mehta's first directorial effort outside India, ``Sam and
Me'' (1990), was about the friendship between two displaced people,
a young Indian boy and an elderly Jewish man, in Canada. It won an
award at the 1991 Cannes film festival.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Ms. Mehta has directed, among other projects, two
episodes of the ``Young Indiana Jones Chronicles'' for George Lucas
and ABC, as well as ``Camilla'' (1993), a drama that was Jessica
Tandy's last film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mehta said that for years she had wanted to deal with the
partition because of her own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I was growing up, I heard nothing but horror stories
about the partition,'' said Ms. Mehta, whose Hindu family fled
Lahore, which is near the Indian border, and settled in the Indian
city of Amritsar, where they distributed movies. ``I grew up
hearing about people being butchered, pregnant women being knifed,
burnings and executions. On all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Ms. Mehta came across an autobiographical novel,
``Cracking India,'' by Bapsi Sidhwa, a highly personal account of
the partition as seen through the eyes of an 8-year-old girl living
in Lahore. Although the girl was a Parsee, a religious group that
remained neutral and nonaligned, she and her family were swept up
by events within a few months. The new film is based on this novel.
</P>
<P>
   The story itself centers on the girl's loving parents and the
household staff of four, including a nanny who is a beautiful Hindu
woman attracting numerous suitors. All the characters in the story
are part of the collection of religions in India, and they are all
content until partition breaks them, and the country, apart.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mehta adapted the screenplay and, with British and Indian
producers, raised the $3.2 million cost of the film from European
distributors as well as a financier in India.
</P>
<P>
   The predominately English-speaking cast includes several top
Indian actors, including Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna and
Kitu Gidwani.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mehta, who has an 18-year-old daughter with her former
husband, Paul Saltzman, a Canadian television producer, said the
film was mostly made on the streets of the old city of Delhi after
the Pakistani government ignored the filmmakers' requests for
permission to shoot in the city of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   Although hundreds turned up every day to watch the moviemakers,
Ms. Mehta said crowd control was not the hardest part of making the
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly the hardest part was that every rooftop has a
television antenna, and this was supposed to be 1947,'' she said
with a laugh. ``We had to deal with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then we wanted to use extras. But every extra showed up in
jeans. The wardrobe was a very big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Peekaboo!

   Two years ago David Koepp, a top Hollywood screenwriter
(``Jurassic Park,'' ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park,'' ``Carlito's
Way,'' ``Mission: Impossible''), strolled into a used-bookstore in
the Brentwood section of Los Angeles and saw a novel, ``Stir of
Echoes,'' by Richard Matheson, one of his (and Stephen King's)
favorite writers of the supernatural. Koepp immediately bought the
book, which was published in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked it up for pleasure, and I got hooked,'' said Koepp.
``Matheson creates these really believable, almost mundane,
domestic situations, and then extraordinary things happen. And the
extraordinary seems so credible because he puts it in a realistic
context.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the book,'' said Koepp, 36. ``And I hunted down the
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Koepp's film adaptation of ``Stir of Echoes,'' which he also
directed, has received early positive reviews. The film, opening on
Sept. 10, is best characterized as an intelligent and absorbing
psychological horror story, a drama about a telephone lineman and
father, played by Kevin Bacon, who is hypnotized at a party by his
sister-in-law, played by Ileana Douglas. Strange and supernatural
things begin happening at the old house that Bacon and his family
rent from a neighbor, and the Bacon character struggles to rid
himself of the ghostly and disturbing visions that consume him.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The film is being released by Artisan Entertainment, whose other
ghostly movie this summer, ``The Blair Witch Project,'' is perhaps
the biggest and most unexpected hit of the year so far. Koepp said
the plethora of ghost stories now was hardly an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``My theory is that ghost stories have been around as far back
as the written word, and they fulfill an essential human need to be
frightened: playing peekaboo with a baby is the earliest example,''
he said. ``And the second thing is just the presence of a ghost
story is comforting to people. It tells you that even if it's the
most terrifying thing you've ever seen, the presence of a ghost
confirms that there's an afterlife. And you can find peace or
justice or greater understanding in that afterlife.''
</P>
<P>
   Koepp said he made the movie for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kinds of stuff I do as a writer tend to be much bigger, a
lot of summer-type movies,'' he said. ``They're a lot of fun. The
characters tend to be larger than life. But you don't develop a
very intimate relationship with them. And I wanted that intimate
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   And the central characters in the drama, he said, were totally
identifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a young couple with a family, like me,'' said Koepp, who
just moved from Los Angeles to the Upper West Side of Manhattan
with his wife, Rosario Valera, and their two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   Koepp previously directed ``The Trigger Effect'' (1996), an
apocalyptic thriller that starred Kyle MacLachlan and Elisabeth
Shue as a suburban couple facing a blackout. The film floundered at
the box office, despite some good reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important that this was my first movie, warts and
all,'' Koepp said. ``It dealt with a lot of things I was thinking
of at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Koepp said he moved into directing out of frustration as a
screenwriter. ``They pay you very well, they do lots of things to
make you comfortable, but even if you have strong friendly
relations with directors you work with, you still work for them,''
he said. ``And there are some stories that you just want to see the
way you imagined them, not someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I've been lucky. I've worked with some brilliant
directors: Spielberg, Zemeckis, DePalma. But even when I saw them
doing it far better than I ever could, it's still different from
what's in my head.'' He laughed. ``Therefore it's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Stir of Echoes'' Koepp said he made one significant change
from the novel, altering the setting from Southern California in
the postwar boom times of the 1950s to a working-class neighborhood
in Chicago. Koepp grew up in Wisconsin but as a child often visited
his mother's family on the South Side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Why did he make the change? ``First of all, Southern California
has been shot to death. So many films are made there,'' he said.
``Besides, it's almost too tempting to shoot there because it's so
easy. You go home every night and sleep in your bed. But when
you're on location, there are so many benefits. You're able to use
local actors, you have a feeling of authenticity in what you do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, you're living in a hotel for three or four months,
and you're a little depressed because you miss your family,'' he
said. ``You're lonely. And you have nothing to think about but the
movie. It's all about the movie. That's really conducive to good
work.''

FRESH APPROACH: A NEW GRAMMAR GUIDE AIMS TO SHAKE THE COBWEBSRITING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA MCUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too many words, and often the wrong ones, have been cluttering
business for decades.
</P>
<P>
   And thanks to the Information Age, nearly all workers have to
write for their jobs these days, making this towering pile of
verbiage even taller.
</P>
<P>
   So it's only fitting that a new English primer is on the scene
written by a hip U.C. Berkeley professor and former editor of Wired
magazine, Constance Hale.
</P>
<P>
   Writers already had Strunk &AMP; White's ``The Elements of Style''
and William Zinsser's ``On Writing Well'' to consult in moments of
indecision and panic.
</P>
<P>
   Although the rules and refinements of both still apply, Hale's
book has blown away some of the dust collected on those older
primers and brought them up to date. Her book is also light-years
ahead of what you read in eighth-grade English: With vivid,
contemporary examples of what to do and what not to do, it's fun to
read.
</P>
<P>
   Hale's book is ``Sin and Syntax: How to Craft Wickedly Effective
Prose'' (Broadway Books, 285 pages, $20).
</P>
<P>
   In her introduction, Hale explains why she chose this title:
</P>
<P>
   ``What, you're wondering, does syntax _ that collection of
prissy grammar rules dictating how to put words together _ have to
do with sin _ the reckless urge to flout the rules and abandon
propriety altogether?''
</P>
<P>
   This book deals with the ``dynamic tensions in language ... (It)
will show you how to avoid bonehead mistakes, but, more
importantly, it'll show you how to make some sinful mischief,'' she
writes.
</P>
<P>
   Hale also wrote ``Wired Style,'' a guide to online English usage
and geekspeak that Newsweek hailed as ``The Chicago Manual of Style
for the Millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think business could use a little cleaning up in
the English department, consider Hale's example of one rule from
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ways of exit access and the doors to exits to which they lead
shall be so designed and arranged as to be clearly recognizable as
such.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall writes that OSHA did rewrite the rule, but even the
rewriting could have been better.
</P>
<P>
   Government isn't the only offender, she contends. Lawyers often
use ``pretentious diction'' that alienates their clients.
Programmers usually speak in code that is virtually unintelligible
to outsiders. Marketers and managers also fall prey to bad English,
Hale argues.
</P>
<P>
   ``When marketing mavens promote hardware and software to the
public, their words are softer than software: implementation,
functionality, interoperability, and even ease of use are just a
bunch of junk words,'' she writes. ``... Let the CEOs sit behind
their desks and yammer on about brand identification, market
capitalization and shareholder value. If you want to write
eloquently as a professional, you need to do it with good words.
Universal words.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale then provides eight chapters on words, covering everything
from nouns and verbs to conjunctions and interjections. She moves
on to four chapters on the sentence, discussing such tricky
elements as phrases, clauses, subjects and predicates.
</P>
<P>
   The final section is devoted to what Hale calls the ``music'' of
writing _ the voice, lyricism, melody and rhythm that sets apart
the well-oiled writer from the hack.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, she uses wonderfully written examples from
Hemingway, Twain, Churchill and other great writers, as well as
numerous journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Hale's take on electronic mail in her ``voice'' section shows
just where she is coming from:
</P>
<P>
   ``E-mail _ that new literary form _ brims with voice. ... It is
chatty, colloquial, intimate. It is composed not in long hours of
reflection and revision but in blunt bursts and on-the-fly
fragments. Since the `rules' of writing never took hold in
cyberspace, e-mail tends to the raw, the typo-laden, the
impassioned, and the unpolished.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale's intended audience may have been fiction writers, but
don't let the ``prose'' in the title fool you. This book is for
anyone who regularly puts words to the page.

   ``Heart to Heart: The Real Power of Network Marketing''
</P>
<P>
   By Scott DeGarmo and Louis Tartaglia
</P>
<P>
   Prima Publishing, $15
</P>
<P>
   Is multilevel marketing _ the selling of products through a
distribution system of users _ the retail wave of the future? These
authors suggest so, pointing to such facts as MCI using Amway to
sell long-distance services and IBM offering Internet training
through a multilevel company called Big Planet. Multilevel
companies do $90 billion in business annually and employ 27
million. This book looks at this selling phenomenon using the very
thing that can make it successful: personal vignettes.

   ``Inside the Tornado: Marketing Strategies from Silicon Valley's
Cutting Edge''
</P>
<P>
   By Geoffrey A. Moore
</P>
<P>
   Harper, $16
</P>
<P>
   Originally published four years ago, this bestseller is now out
in paperback with a new introduction, focused mainly on the
business effect of the Internet, by consultant Geoffrey Moore. The
book has been an international success, having been translated into
six languages, including Chinese. It is also being used as a
textbook at Stanford, Harvard, Massachusetts Intitute of Technolgy
and Northwestern. This is one of the first books to recognize the
powerful effect of technology on the marketplace.

   ``Crossing the Chasm''
</P>
<P>
   By Geoffrey A. Moore
</P>
<P>
   Harper, $16
</P>
<P>
   An earlier work by Geoffrey Moore, published originally in 1991,
is out in paperback with a new introduction. This work is
considered the bible for bringing high-tech products to market.
Moore correctly said that one of the greatest hurdles of a
high-tech entrepreneurial effort is making the mainstream market
emerge _ or crossing the chasm. He provides a model for young
companies to follow to get to the other side.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   After stalling Thursday afternoon, Hurricane Dennis will resume
a slow course to the northwest Friday as it grazes the northern
Bahamas. Until the complex interaction between the hurricane and
capricious steering winds aloft is resolved, the Southeast coast of
the United States will remain at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Moisture associated with the fading but persistent remnants of
Hurricane Bret, which made landfall along the Texas coast last
Sunday evening, will help to fuel heavy rains over parts of the
Southwest states Friday. The heaviest rains will likely occur in
the mountains of western New Mexico and eastern Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The disturbance that produced unusual rains in a few spots
across southern California Thursday will press toward the Great
Basin, producing widely separated thunderstorms in parts of Nevada,
Idaho, Utah and Wyoming. Rainfalls should generally be in the light
to moderate range.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a cluster of thunderstorms will likely erupt across
parts of eastern Montana as relatively moist winds from the
southeast gliding up the sloping terrain are further lifted by an
arriving jet stream disturbance. Storms will then rumble over the
western Dakotas late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The system that produced downpours Thursday in New York City
will continue to move slowly across the Northeast, inciting
scattered areas of rain across New England.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms will erupt across parts of the western
Gulf states as hot, humid air is lifted by a jet stream disturbance
plunging south from east Oklahoma and Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Downtown Downpour
</P>
<P>
   Downpours produced 2.38 inches of rain in just two hours at New
York's La Guardia Airport early Thursday as moist air was lifted by
a disturbance pivoting east from the Appalachians. Widespread
flooding was reported across the city. Such cloudbursts
occasionally affect New York. On July 15, 1997, 3.37 inches of rain
deluged La Guardia in two hours, marking the city's most intense
rainfall rate in recent history. But New York cannot lay claim to
the paragon of downpours. That title belongs to Unionville, Md.,
where 1.23 inches of rain were measured in one minute on July 4,
1956.

   WACO _ WASHINGTON _ The FBI document confirming that pyrotechnic
gas canisters were used at the Branch Davidian siege near Waco was
not prepared until 1996, after Attorney General Janet Reno had told
Congress she had no knowledge of their use there, an FBI spokesman
said Thursday. The statement comes amid calls for new congressional
hearings into the truthfulness of officials' statements about the
siege. Also Thursday, Reno said she was ``very, very frustrated''
about reports of government use of devices and pledged to ``get to
the bottom'' of the question. (Nesmith and Dart, Cox News Service).

Thursday The report listed aircraft, tanks and night-vision goggles

<P>
   DAVIDIAN _ WACO, Texas _ Despite recent revelations, Judge
Walter S. Smith Jr. lets both sides know that he's not going to
allow unrestrained access to the evidence in the Branch Davidian
lawsuit. He says feds have had access to the material for years,
and the plaintiffs have had access through

   CENSUS-CHILDREN _ WASHINGTON _ School-age children were severely

Thursday. (Mollison, Cox News Service). 22.

   TAFT-BLACKS _ When black legislators criticized Gov. Bob Taft
last March for appointing few blacks to Cabinet and top staff
positions, Taft aides said the governor would continue to ``cast a
wide net'' looking for the best candidates. Five months later,
Taft's net remains filled mainly with white men. Of 251
appointments to his Cabinet, boards, commissions, judgeships and
other posts, Taft has appointed just 27 racial minorities,
including 21 blacks, according to records from the governor's
office. And only about one in four of Taft's appointees have been
women. ``I think it's an extremely poor start,'' said state Rep.
Ray Miller, D Columbus, first vice president of the Ohio
Legislative Black Caucus. ``I won't use the word pathetic. It's an
extremely poor start.'' (Wagner/Hershey, Dayton Daily News).

   SHARPTON _ DAYTON, Ohio _ New York activist Al Sharpton is

criticized New York City police officers for their roles in the
1997 brutalization of Haitian immigrant Abner Louima and the

   FUNERAL-SRVC _ Just five days before a new board is supposed to
assume control of the Texas Funeral Services Commission, the only
applicants for the job are the current board members. That means
the new board could look a lot like the old one. The Legislature
passed a law this spring revamping the board to reduce industry
influence after reports that SCI, the funeral home giant, had too
much sway on the board. Also Thursday, a Friday hearing in a

canceled. All motions in the case will be heard on Monday.

million stadium project, which included redevelopment of an
industrial area in East Nashville, was finished two months ahead of

Ellison was stunned by his neighbors' angry response. Residents
staged a march against the facility. A few days later, Ellison
began receiving threatening letters and harassing phone calls.

 &HT;    At the end of a long road, a look that fits
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Get this.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Fulp was so protective of her hip-length hair that when she
lived in Nashville, Tenn., she would fly to Ocala to get it cut.
She trusted no one else. Even when she moved to Tequesta, she'd
drive the three-plus hours to her hometown for a trim.
</P>
<P>
   But the Florida heat got to her. Earlier this summer, Fulp
ducked into some nameless local salon and got 6 inches whacked off,
a stunning amount for her. ``My hair is part of me,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Her hairstyle hadn't changed since high school, but Fulp was
finally in the mood. If she left her hair down, her two kids pulled
it. If she put it in a top knot, she noticed hair loss at her
temples.
</P>
<P>
   So she went to the Babor Institute in Palm Beach for a makeover
_ on her 33rd birthday, no less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what to do with it,'' she told stylist
George Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott listened to her hair history _ never any color, a perm
or two _ and learned that Fulp stays home to take care of the kids
and renovate the house. ``I want it to be easy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor: Fulp's husband, Bob, would pass out if she came
home with short hair. No problem. ``It's nice one length,'' Elliott
said. ``Long and pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   But heavy. Elliott immediately trimmed 3 more inches, and
suddenly Fulp had the shortest hair she'd had in years. For extra
bounce without extra time in front of the mirror, Elliott gave Fulp
a loose body perm.
</P>
<P>
   While she waited for the perm to set, Fulp plotted. Why not buy
a short blond wig on the way home and shock poor Bob into fits?
</P>
<P>
   Elliott put Fulp in hot rollers to give her hair some temporary
lift. Makeup artist Julia Holguin reached for earth tones _ light
brown and blue-gray on the eyes, natural beige foundation, and
maroon lipstick for Fulp's strongest feature, her lips.

   ``Warm is her most natural look,'' Holguin said.
</P>
<P>
   Once primped and spritzed, Fulp said she felt lighter and
fluffier already.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, she was happy to report that she could wear her
hair down, even while swimming, and it didn't get in anyone's way.
</P>
<P>
   And the wig?
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't find one in time to fool her husband, but she got
him anyway. ``I pulled back my hair so it looked short,'' she said.
``Boy, he had a funny look.''

 &HT;    DOCUMENT ON WACO CANISTERS WRITTEN AFTER RENO TESTIMONY
 &HT;    With WACO-MILITARY.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH and BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A document stating the FBI used two ``pyrotechnic''
tear gas canisters in the 1993 siege at the Branch Davidian
compound did not exist in 1995 when Attorney General Janet Reno
told Congress she knew nothing about the use of any such weapons,
an FBI spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A memorandum describing the use of the devices was written in
1996, as FBI lawyers prepared to defend the bureau against
``wrongful death'' suits brought by survivors of some of those who
died in the siege near Waco, Texas, said spokesman Tron Brekke(cq).
</P>
<P>
   But as Republican House members called for a renewal of the
Branch Davidian probe, Reno conceded Thursday that her credibility
has suffered because of the FBI's six-year delay in admitting that
its agents used the canisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very upset,'' Reno said at her weekly press
briefing. ``I don't think it's very good for my credibility. That's
the reason I'm going to pursue it until I get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she and FBI Director Louis Freeh had ordered a fresh
investigation into Waco on Wednesday. ``I will not stop until I get
to the bottom of this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she still has ``no reason at this point to believe the
FBI'' was responsible for the deaths of David Koresh and 79 of his
followers, including 25 children, during a fire that erupted in the
climactic hours of the 51-day siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, all available indications are that the devices
were not directed at the main wooden compound, were discharged
several hours before the fire started, and were not the cause of
the fire,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, it is absolutely critical that we do everything
humanly possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible
and make them available to the public and Congress,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton ``stands with the attorney general in her
determination to get all the facts in this case and to make them
available to Congress and the public as soon as possible,'' his
spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said on Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where
the president is vacationing.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's acknowledgement that the two canisters of
military-issue tear gas were fired at an unoccupied concrete bunker
at least 100 yards away from the main Branch Davidian building came
only after a former senior FBI official, Danny O. Coulson,
confirmed it in a newspaper interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing in our files about this before 1996,'' said
Brekke. ``In getting ready for litigation, it was actually put into
black and white and turned over to a part of the bureau. There it
lay, a relatively short paragraph indicating that two of these
rounds were fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Brekke said FBI lawyers found this document in their files after
the bureau had responded to Coulson's remarks, published by the
Dallas Morning News, by denying _ again _ that pyrotechnic devices
were used.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately upon finding the memorandum, he pointed out, the
bureau reversed itself and said the exploding canisters had been
used.
</P>
<P>
   The canisters in question are not designed to start fires,
Brekke said, but they use an internal explosion to disperse the
tear gas they carry.
</P>
<P>
   He said the canisters were fired ``almost 180 degrees away
from'' the Davidians' main wooden compound at around 6 a.m. on
April 19, 1993. Six hours later, the compound burst into flames.
The FBI has insisted that the fires were started by the Davidians
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she had relied on information from the FBI in
testifying in 1995 before a joint investigation by the House
Judiciary and Government Reform committees that pyrotechnic devices
were not used in the final assault on the compound.
</P>
<P>
   House members Thursday called for the congressional
investigation to be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unbelievable that the attorney general now says that
she's doing to launch an investigation into what happened at
Waco,'' said Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the Government
Reform Committee. ``No one is going to be satisfied with an
internal Justice Department investigation. They have no credibility
at this point. Congress is going to have to conduct a thorough
investigation on behalf of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said
the FBI admissions ``raise serious questions about who is
responsible for the deaths of over 80 American men, women and
children. ... Additionally, this new evidence casts doubt on
statements of Administration officials and could lead to charges of
perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the chairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety
told the Dallas Morning News that explanations are also needed on
why members of the Army's secret Delta Force anti-terrorism squad
were at the Branch Davidian compound on the day it burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone involved knows they were there. If there is an issue,
it was what was their role at the time,'' said James B. Francis of
Dallas. ``Some of the evidence that I have reviewed and been made
aware of is very problematical as to the role of Delta Force at the
siege.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the new FBI investigation would address questions
about the Delta Force, Reno replied: ``We will pursue any issue in
question.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official told the Associated Press that the
issue of whether such a team was present at Waco is being
investigated. The official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said it is not unusual for the military to offer advice
if asked in such situations.
</P>
<P>
   Any direct involvement of the military in a domestic setting
beyond the offering of advice would require a presidential waiver
from a law prohibiting such activity. No such waiver was sought in
the Waco episode, the official told AP.
</P>
<P>
   Brekke pointed out that such a waiver might not be necessary if
military personnel were on the scene merely as observers.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know if they were there, adding that ``that
will be part of our inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Sens. Phil Gramm and Kay Bailey Hutchison, both
Republicans, Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, were traveling and could
not be reached for comment, their aides said.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AUTUMN TALE,' starring Beatrice Romand, Marie Riviere, Didier
Sandre, Alain Libolt and Alexia Portal. Directed by Eric Rohmer
(PG, 110 minutes; in French with English subtitles). The final
chapter of the director's ``Tales of the Four Seasons'' is as
sublimely warming an experience as the autumn sun that shines
benevolently on the Rhone Valley vineyard owned by the central
character, Magali (Ms. Romand). The movie follows the adventures of
this wiry and vital but lonely widowed mother of two after she
allows two friends to play matchmaker. The film's plot, like that
of other Rohmer movies, is mathematically schematic as the
characters indulge in exquisitely verbalized soul-searching. As
sensuously gratifying as it is civilized, with a wonderful
performance by Ms. Romand, it reaches a happy ending that feels
entirely earned (Stephen Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT,' starring Heather Donahue, Michael
Williams and Joshua Leonard. Directed by Daniel Myrick and Eduardo
Sanchez (R, 87 minutes). A horror film shot outdoors by its actors,
who play three scared filmmakers at work on a spooky documentary,
this is a fine example of how to make something out of nothing _
nothing but terrific imagination and a game plan so enterprising it
should elevate its creators to pinup status at film schools
everywhere. With tentacles including a hit Web site, an elaborate
fake witch mythology, a book tie-in, a special on the Sci-Fi
Channel and much more, this clever little indie is at the center of
a new form of synergy and an inspired multimedia blitz (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `BROKEDOWN PALACE,' starring Claire Danes, Kate Beckinsale and
Bill Pullman. Directed by Jonathan Kaplan (PG-13, 100 minutes). In
a movie reminiscent of last year's ``Return to Paradise'' (a much
stronger film), two American girls (Ms. Danes and Ms. Beckinsale)
vacationing in Bangkok are thrown in a Thai prison after being
arrested at the airport with several kilos of heroin that were
planted in their luggage. Although Ms. Danes is convincing as the
headstrong brat responsible for their predicament, the storytelling
is weak and confused. Pullman is the cynical expatriate American
lawyer enlisted to deal with the corrupt Thai justice system
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `BOWFINGER,' starring Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy and Heather
Graham. Written by Martin. Directed by Frank Oz (PG-13, 97
minutes). This hilarious, good-hearted spiritual descendant of
``The Producers'' is a comic coup for Martin. And it's directed
every bit as winningly as Oz directed his ``Dirty Rotten
Scoundrels'' and ``In and Out.'' Murphy is razor-sharp in a dual
role as both a grinning fall guy and the kind of hotshot action
star whose very presence is enough to get a movie made. Martin,
sublimely funny, runs circles around him as an unscrupulous
filmmaker trying to trick the star into appearing in his movie.
``Did you know that Tom Cruise had no idea he was in that vampire
movie until two years later?'' this filmmaker inquires. Made fondly
and knowingly, with nonstop good humor (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB,' with Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay
Segundo and Ry Cooder. Directed by Wim Wenders (not rated, 106
minutes). When the American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder
assembled a group of all-but-forgotten Cuban musicians to record an
album, no one expected that the record would become a phenomenon,
selling more than a million copies worldwide and revitalizing the
Cuban music scene. Wenders' ebullient documentary follows the group
on tour from Amsterdam to New York and includes interviews with the
group's main members. The music pulsates, and the pictures of
Havana compare the city's grand but faded architecture with the
musicians' weather-beaten faces (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `DEEP BLUE SEA,' starring Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool
J, Jacqueline McKenzie, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgard and
Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by Renny Harlin (R, 100 minutes).
Better not mess with Mother Nature. That's the familiar message of
this man-against-shark horror film in which the research team of a
floating ocean laboratory is stalked by three 8,000-pound
genetically ``improved'' mako sharks. Ms. Burrows is the chilly,
anything-for-science marine biologist behind the research, and Jane
the hunky shark-wrangler who tends these razor-toothed killing
machines. ``Titanic'' meets ``Jaws,'' without romance, history,
myth or credible characters, only nonstop action and half an ocean
full of crimson, blood-thickened water (Holden).

   `EYES WIDE SHUT,' starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.
Directed by Stanley Kubrick (R, 145 minutes). This last cryptic,
spellbinding addition to the Kubrick canon provides a stunning
epiphany for the summer of the dirty joke. It's a dead-serious film
about eros and mortality, one that flirts with the ridiculous but
sustains its fundamental eeriness and gravity throughout. Cruise,
as a doctor caught up in a nighttime sexual odyssey of strange,
dreamlike clarity, and Ms. Kidman, as the wife who sparks his
jealousy by speaking frankly of her own libido, give themselves
over body and soul to the filmmaker's meticulous and delicately
balanced scheme. Given the dark themes and explicit nudity found
here, the R rating (achieved by digital alterations to 65 seconds'
worth of film) is a joke (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,' starring John Travolta and Madeleine
Stowe. Directed by Simon West (R, 118 minutes). Murder on a
military base was once enough of a pretext for a detective
thriller, but nowadays it takes more. The prevailing sleaze
quotient calls for kinks, and this galling adaptation of a Nelson
DeMille best seller is happy to oblige. So the title character, a
pretty young officer who the film thinks has no place in the
military, is the victim of a lurid crime. Travolta and Ms. Stowe
affably investigate whodunit, though the unraveling of the crime is
laughably arbitrary. The real point of their ponderous
investigation is that the victim asked for what she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `GRAND ILLUSION,' starring Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay and Erich
von Stroheim. Directed by Jean Renoir (not rated, 117 minutes; in
French with English subtitles). An oasis of subtlety, moral
intelligence and deep emotion on the cinematic landscape this
summer. And the third inspired reissue in three years from Rialto
Pictures, which previously resurrected Godard's ``Contempt'' and
Fellini's ``Nights of Cabiria.'' As this 1937 masterpiece refracts
wartime through the peculiar civility of life in German-run prison
camps, it creates a rich and stirring vision of all that war
destroys. And the sole casualty in one of the most devastating
films about battle is a man who dies in bed (Maslin).

 UNDATED: in bed (Maslin).  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `THE HAUNTING,' starring Liam Neeson, Lili Taylor, Catherine
Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson. Directed by Jan De Bont (PG-13, 117
minutes). In a wildly overdone haunted house with a Gothic nouveau
riche look, walls warp, statues morph and things go bump in the
night. The special effects are piled on so relentlessly that after
a while the sight of the flying cow from De Bont's ``Twister''
would not be amiss. Firmly committed to the idea that more is more,
this is a remake of a 1963 black-and-white film that left much more
to the imagination. But the cast is good; Neeson plays the doctor
who leads the other three principals to Hill House for a psychology
experiment that goes really, really wrong (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `AN IDEAL HUSBAND,' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, John Wood and Jeremy Northam.
Written and directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best
thing about Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar
Wilde's 1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego, Lord Arthur
Goring. In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually
wise, witty and caring) rake, Everett makes him all the more
charming. Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician
and his priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting
the right notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they are almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `ILLUMINATA,' starring John Turturro, Katherine Borowitz, Susan
Sarandon, Rufus Sewell, Christopher Walken and Donal McCann.
Directed by Turturro (R, 111 minutes). An enormously fond homage to
the world of acting, beguilingly presented and full of knowing
backstage humor. The usual suspects _ the aging diva (Ms.
Sarandon), the self-involved leading man (Sewell), the idealistic
aspiring playwright (Turturro) _ are played invigoratingly, as is
Walken's snide Transylvanian-sounding critic. Turturro and Ms.
Borowitz, his somberly beautiful wife, play out a delicate balance
of love and ambition against this nicely tumultuous backdrop
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `INSPECTOR GADGET,' starring Matthew Broderick and Rupert
Everett. Directed by David Kellogg (PG, 85 minutes). The midmorning
midden of children's cartoons that yielded a vein of cinematic gold
with ``George of the Jungle'' has now been mined for this clinker.
Too bad, because this Disney comedy wastes good talent. Broderick
brings an endearing combination of intelligence, wit and naivete to
his portrayal of a security guard who is transformed into the human
gizmo, Inspector Gadget, after being blown up in an effort to
capture a megalomaniacal magnate (Everett). But even Broderick can
go only so far with the film's noisy, childish material. Watching
this movie is like watching a human Swiss army knife for nearly an
hour and a half. It's a remarkable device, but do you really want
to spend a lot of time with a not-too-bright hardware store
Frankenstein creation that can light cigars with his thumb, shoot a
grappling hook to the top of a skyscraper and produce a helicopter
from his head? (Lawrence Van Gelder). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `THE IRON GIANT,' with the voices of Elie Marienthal and Harry
Connick Jr. Directed by Brad Bird (PG, 90 minutes). Based loosely
on a children's fable written in 1968 by Ted Hughes, this film
looks at the fearful years of the Cold War through the politically
correct lens of the 1990s. All this re-examination of the
atmosphere of the post-Sputnik era is wrapped up in the story of a
bright (and therefore unpopular) little boy who befriends a
50-foot-tall iron robot from who knows where that plunges into the
sea one stormy night in 1957 and comes ashore near Rockwell, Maine
The boy, Hogarth Hughes, saves the giant when it becomes entangled
in high-tension wires, and the big lug becomes his secret playmate.
Meanwhile, a nasty, paranoid government agent is closing in on the
giant, leading to a showdown with the military. ``The Iron Giant''
is a smooth, skilled example of animated filmmaking. Many parents
will doubtless approve of the film's messages while they ponder how
the passing years have smoothed the jagged edges of history (Van
Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   `MICKEY BLUE EYES,' starring Hugh Grant, James Caan and Jeanne
Tripplehorn. Directed by Kelly Makin (PG-13, 102 minutes). The
newest Mafia comedy, which features several cast members from ``The
Sopranos'' along with Caan as a New York mob boss, plays like a
spoof of a spoof of a spoof. Grant is amusing as a suave English
art auctioneer who finds his business used as a money-laundering
operation after he becomes engaged to a Mafia princess (Ms.
Tripplehorn). Although the movie is little more than a series of
loosely connected gags, several are extremely funny. One of the
cutest running jokes involves the hopeless attempts of Grant's
character to impart properly thuggish inflections to phrases like
``forget about it.'' ``Fuggedaboudit'' is simply beyond his reach
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MY LIFE SO FAR,' starring Colin Firth, Rosemary Harris, Irene
Jacob, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, Malcolm McDowell and Robert
Norman. Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 93 minutes). A steady
``Masterpiece Theater''-like glow warms ``My Life So Far,'' a boy's
reverie of growing up in the misty Scottish highlands of Argyll in
the late 1920s. Frisky little Fraser (Norman), who narrates the
story, recalls a year in the life of the mildly troubled Macintosh
clan. What strife there is mostly involves his father, Edward
(Firth), an eccentric fiery-eyed inventor, and his Uncle Morris
(McDowell), who brings home a beautiful French wife (Ms. Jacob),
with whom Edward falls in love. If the story is slight, it is
smoothly told and well acted (especially by Firth), and the
nostalgic atmosphere is beguiling (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `MYSTERY MEN,' starring William H. Macy, Ben Stiller, Hank
Azaria, Janeane Garofalo and Geoffrey Rush. Directed by Kinka Usher
(PG-13, 100 minutes). Based on a comic book, this satire on the
superhero genre has a fine deadpan cast and a funny premise, even
if its skit-worthy material is allowed to run out of steam. Its
characters are lovable losers, convinced that superhero status is
mostly a state of mind and can be achieved even if one's secret
power is throwing forks or hoisting a shovel. Macy sets the
entertainingly tongue-in-cheek tone as the intrepid Shoveler, but
Usher does some shoveling, too. His film loads up on so many jokey
characters that it begins to be as overblown as a ``Batman'' _ and
not so far removed from the genre it mocks (Maslin).

   `RUNAWAY BRIDE,' starring Julia Roberts and Richard Gere.
Directed by Garry Marshall (PG, 110 minutes). When the stars and
director first collaborated, on ``Pretty Woman,'' Ms. Roberts was
cast as an adorable Los Angeles streetwalker. Nine years later,
she's as far as she can get from Rodeo Drive, geographically and
otherwise. Playing the stern proprietor of a small-town Maryland
hardware store, she takes an awfully long while to slip from
scowling into flirtatious romantic-comedy mode. And when the sparks
start flying between her character and Gere's likably stubborn
newspaper columnist, they fly on cue. Funny minor characters and
one-liners offset the not-so-pretty story of a woman who habitually
jilts her men (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE SIXTH SENSE,' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment.
Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107 minutes).
What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old boy
(Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child psychologist
(Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into New Age mush
(think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch''). When you
trace the plot backward after its big secret is revealed, the story
doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual smirking one-note
performance. What empathy the movie generates comes from Osment's
intense portrayal of the tormented child (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,' starring Liam
Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd. Directed by
George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and breathless
expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy surprise:
It's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the series and
offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions
that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of
``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed reduced to
playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and
hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in
Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier
and scrappier when it was new, but it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TEACHING MRS. TINGLE,' starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes,
Marisa Coughlan and Barry Watson. Written and directed by Kevin
Williamson (PG-13, 93 minutes). Three teen-agers dislike their
nasty history teacher, so they go to her house, tie her to her bed
and hold her hostage. Surely this had a more honest viciousness
when it was first written by Williamson, who went on to write the
``Scream'' movies, ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``I Know What You Did
Last Summer,'' but it has been absurdly soft-pedaled into a kinder,
gentler version. Retitled ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' from ``Killing
Mrs. Tingle,'' and no doubt with its ending changed accordingly, it
works overtime trying to make the high schoolers sympathetic. As
the teacher, Ms. Mirren is much too good for this material
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR,' starring Pierce Brosnan, Rene Russo
and Denis Leary. Directed by John McTiernan (R, 114 minutes). It
was the stars, Faye Dunaway and Steve McQueen, who made this story
sexy the first time around; now it's the showy big-ticket
accouterments. Brosnan and Ms. Russo seem to share the most
heartfelt moment in this halfhearted romance when they jointly go
shopping. McTiernan is better known for the action in his ``Die
Hard'' and other movies than for the tender moments therein. So the
museum heists here are more convincing and exciting than the scenes
of carefully staged amour (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TRICK,' starring Christian Campbell and John Paul Pitoc.
Directed by Jim Fall (R, 90 minutes). This engaging, tenderhearted
boy-meets-boy story features two handsome, doe-eyed actors in the
story of a romantic one-night stand. As in the Doris Day-era sex
comedies that are recalled here, the story is filled with obstacles
to the affair, the most noxious of them Tori Spelling in the role
of an incorrigible nuisance. Fall gives a small-town coziness to
his film's Greenwich Village settings and makes this a quaintly
likable date movie for audiences of any persuasion (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   `TWIN FALLS IDAHO,' starring Michael and Mark Polish and Michele
Hicks. Directed by Michael Polish (R, 100 minutes). This eerily
effective film carries the real-life closeness of twin brothers
into the realm of haunting fantasy. The look-alike Polish siblings
play conjoined twins whose delicately balanced interdependence
yields a rare brand of tension. With a bleak, lonely look and a
strain of black humor (in their three-legged suit, the film's Falls
brothers impress everyone on Halloween), the film introduces a
wild, gorgeous young woman into their lives and watches what
happens when one twin starts to court her. The story is intensely
rendered, without gimmicks (Maslin). Film Series

   `ONCE UPON A TIME: THE FILMS OF SERGIO LEONE.' By the time he
was 35, Sergio Leone (1921-1989) had worked as an assistant on
nearly 60 films for almost every Italian director and with
Hollywood filmmakers like William Wyler and Robert Aldrich. After
he replaced the ailing director Mario Bonnard on ``The Last Days of
Pompeii'' (1959), he was given a chance to direct his own film,
``The Colossus of Rhodes'' (1961). Within a few years, the Italian
filmmaker had redefined a quintessentially American genre with the
spaghetti western trilogy that began with the international hit ``A
Fistful of Dollars'' (1964). Leone went on to leave his mark on the
history of cinema with films like ``Once Upon a Time in the West''
(1969) and ``Once Upon a Time in America'' (1984). Now he is being
honored with a retrospective at the American Museum of the Moving
Image. This weekend's attractions consist of the spectacular
``Colossus of Rhodes,'' at 2 p.m. Saturday, followed by the
spaghetti western ``The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'' (1966) at 4:30
p.m. On Sunday at 2 p.m., the attraction is the 226-minute uncut
version of his gangster epic, ``Once Upon a Time in America.'' The
series runs through Sept. 5. Admission to the retrospective at the
museum, at 34-12 36th Street, at 35th Avenue in Astoria, Queens, is
$8.50 for adults, $5.50 for people over 65 and students with
identification, $4.50 for children from 5 to 18, and free to
children under 4. Information: (718) 784-0077 (Van Gelder).

RENO PROMISES TO `GET TO THE TRUTH' ABOUT WACO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Admitting her credibility may have been hurt,
Attorney General Janet Reno vowed Thursday to ``get to the truth''
about why the FBI took six years to admit that its agents fired two
incendiary tear gas canisters on the final day of their standoff
with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very, very upset by the information I have received ...
and believe it is absolutely critical that we do everything humanly
possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible and make
them available to the Congress and public,'' she said at her weekly
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno insisted that she had received no information that the
flammable tear gas canisters caused the fire that consumed the
Branch Davidian compound outside Waco on April 19, 1993, killing
the religious cult's leader David Koresh and about 80 of his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason at this point to believe the FBI is
responsible for the deaths of those people,'' said Reno, who for
six years categorically denied that the FBI used any flammable
devices during the 51-day siege of the Davidian compound.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by a panel of independent arson experts
concluded that the fire began simultaneously just after noon in
three separate places inside the compound. On Wednesday, the FBI,
in admitting the use of the two incendiary devices, said they were
fired hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said that through bugging devices, agents heard cult
members discuss plans to spread fuel and to start a blaze hours
before the living quarters burned. Arson investigators also found
evidence that accelerants, including gasoline, charcoal lighter
fluid and camp stove fuel, had been poured in the wooden compound.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she and FBI Director Louis Freeh _ who took over the
agency after the Waco episode _ have ordered a fresh investigation
of what happened on April 19, 1993, at the compound.
</P>
<P>
   According to Justice Department officials, about 40 FBI agents,
led by an FBI inspector, will re-interview everyone who was at the
Waco scene and will re-evaluate all the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman John Collingwood said Wednesday night that the
agents are to report ``within weeks'' on all aspects of the use of
military-type tear gas, including why it took so long to be
admitted publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that after further discussions with Freeh, she will
decide whether outside investigators should be put in charge of the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   Saying she would ``welcome'' congressional hearings on the
matter, Reno said, ``I don't think (this information) is very good
for my credibility and that's the reason I am going to pursue it
until I get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Reno seemed to put some of the blame on the FBI,
saying, ``If anybody says they've never relied on information that
proves to be inaccurate, I'd like to meet them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidian standoff began Feb. 28, 1993, when Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents, trying to search the compound
and arrest Koresh on charges of amassing illegal firearms and
explosives, engaged in a shootout with sect members. Four BAFT
agents were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Then BAFT and FBI agents set up camp around the compound in a
standoff that ended seven weeks later after the government launched
its tear gas volleys and moved in tanks to tear down the sect's
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she had no regrets about her decision to order
government agents into the compound, saying she feared Koresh was
planning a mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if David Koresh would have (set the compound on
fire) two weeks later on his own, without any provocation, and the
federal government would have been blamed for not acting sooner,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, after admitting that its agents launched the two
military tear gas canisters, the FBI insisted that they were fired
not at living quarters in the compound, but at a bunker nearby. The
FBI said the canisters bounced off the bunker's concrete roof and
did not enter any other structures.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI added that the flammable canisters were fired around 6
a.m., nearly six hours before the fire that destroyed the compound
started and that other tear gas canisters used by federal agents
throughout the day were not flammable or potentially explosive.
</P>
<P>
   The admission came in response to a story about the devices in
Wednesday's Dallas Morning News. It represented a reversal from the
federal government's adamant, long-held position that the FBI used
no device capable of sparking a fire on the day the Branch Davidian
compound burned.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to the admission, congressional Republicans said
Thursday they will reopen hearings into the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply concerned by these inconsistencies,'' said Rep.
Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee. He adde, ``I intend for the committee to get to the
bottom of this,''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs the Senate
Administrative Oversight and the Courts Subcommittee that oversees
the FBI, said, ``This is a serious development in terms of further
erosion of the FBI's credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety
told the Dallas Morning News that federal officials need to explain
why some members of the Army's secret Delta Force anti-terrorism
squad were at the scene the day the compound burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone involved knows they were there. If there is an issue,
it was what was their role at the time,'' said James B. Francis of
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the new FBI investigation would address questions
about the Delta Force, Reno replied: ``We will pursue any issue in
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, a senior Pentagon official said the military's advice was
sought on how to end the standoff and that three military observers
were on the scene the day of the raid. At no time was the military
involved in planning or participation, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the military provided communications equipment to
law enforcement officials, as well as various vehicles including a
tank and a helicopter, during the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   But the military had ``no operational involvement,'' said the
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Any direct involvement of the military in a domestic setting
beyond the offering of advice would require a presidential waiver
from a law prohibiting such activity.

TAKING THE CHILDREN: `BOWFINGER,' `THE SIXTH SENSE' AND `TEACHING
MRS. TINGLE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   `Bowfinger'
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin, Eddie Murphy, Heather Graham, Christine Baranski,
Jamie Kennedy, Terence Stamp, Robert Downey Jr., Adam Alexi-Malle
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Frank Oz
</P>
<P>
   PG-13. 97 minutes
</P>
<P>
   At Bowfinger International Pictures, the voice mail messages are
from the phone company threatening to shut off service, and the
money available to begin shooting ``Chubby Rain,'' a new movie
about aliens, totals $2,184. Still, the project is a go. Not that
the indefatigable and irrationally upbeat Bobby Bowfinger (Martin)
has any logical reason to suppose anyone will provide additional
financing, but for him the compulsion to throw together a film crew
and get actors in front of a camera is too much to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby also has a scheme. Instead of actually engaging the very
expensive Kit Ramsey (Murphy) as its star, the Bowfinger production
will use Ramsey without the actor's knowledge. How? Track Ramsey on
his everyday rounds, then have your own actors run up to him in a
restaurant or a parking garage or wherever and spout their lines
while a hidden camera grinds away. After that, it's all in the
editing.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work? Bobby points out that it took Tom Cruise two years
to realize he had been in a vampire movie. Ramsey turns out to be a
highly excitable fellow who is deathly afraid of aliens and sprints
in the opposite direction when accosted by the vampish Carol (Ms.
Baranski) or the lissome, breathy Daisy (Ms. Graham), a Bowfinger
discovery.
</P>
<P>
   That plays beautifully on film, but eventually Ramsey gets so
distraught at these people rushing up to him with nonsensical
bursts of dialogue that he has a breakdown and must be hidden away
by his spiritual guru (Stamp). Without a star, Bobby comes up with
Jiff (Murphy), a dead ringer for Ramsey, and the camera (spirited
off a studio lot) rolls again. But let's not ride off into the
sunset, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: None.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: A kindhearted young woman, Daisy sleeps her way up the
Bowfinger Pictures chain of command. Sexual situations, however,
are more implied than graphic.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: There is some foul language, but it is mild.
</P>
<P>
   For which children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 9: The film is inappropriate for the very young, who
wouldn't get it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-12: Long a favorite of children, Martin wrote this film
with a keen eye for spoof, and viewers this age will have a grand
time with the broad strokes even if they miss some of the finer
touches.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP: Clear sailing in a very entertaining movie for
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   `The Sixth Sense'
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment, Toni Collette, Olivia Williams
</P>
<P>
   Directed by M. Night Shyamalan
</P>
<P>
   PG-13. 107 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Having been shot by a dissatisfied former patient, the noted
child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a trifle hesitant
about taking on the case of 9-year-old Cole Sear (Haley Joel
Osment). Abrasions on Cole's arms indicate abuse or
self-mutilation. The boy speaks Latin to toy soldiers. In school he
sees visions of people hanged 200 years ago and draws a picture of
somebody stabbed in the neck with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe tells Cole that he was a good doctor before he was shot.
Cole doubts that will be good enough, but after much cautious
cultivation of trust between the two he reveals what's ailing him.
``I see dead people,'' he says. They don't know they're dead; they
see only what they want to see. They all want something from him.
</P>
<P>
   Delusional paranoia and schizophrenia are among the first
conclusions Crowe scribbles into his case book, but later he
realizes the boy is telling the truth. Meanwhile, things are not
well at home for either of them. Crowe's wife has disconnected from
her husband for reasons that are puzzling and Cole's poor mother
(Ms. Collette) is beside herself over her son's odd behavior.
</P>
<P>
   How should he behave with apparitions stalking him around the
house? Somebody had better come up with a good revelation.
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Crowe gets shot; the ghosts, who are no Caspers, bear
their bullet wounds and swing from nooses; Cole is forcibly locked
in a dark room by taunting schoolmates. Throughout there are either
violent incidents or situations bespeaking violence that will be
disturbing to young children.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: Crowe and his wife are drunkenly playful at the outset, but
there is no sex.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Very little.
</P>
<P>
   For which children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 7: Under age 7 is decidedly under age and for obvious
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 8-10: Many children will be able to handle the material
without upset, but perhaps some other entertainment would be more
fitting.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13: The film appeals up and down this age bracket.
Parental guidelines differ but go they will, or at least will want
to.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 13 AND UP: If they must.
</P>
<P>
   `Teaching Mrs. Tingle'
</P>
<P>
   Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson, Marisa Coughlan,
Jeffrey Tambor
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Kevin Williamson
</P>
<P>
   PG-13. 93 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Attempting virtually the impossible _ a slightly new wrinkle in
a high school movie _ Williamson's film plays tie up the teacher. A
snide, bitter woman stuck in a little town much too long, Mrs.
Tingle (Ms. Mirren) lives not to teach history but to put down her
students in the nastiest, most spiteful way possible. As the
student most affected by Tingle's summary dismissal of one and all,
Leigh Ann (Ms. Holmes) needs an A on her history project to land
the big scholarship. Instead, Tingle catches her with an
incriminating piece of paper that makes it appear that Leigh Ann is
about to cheat on final exams.
</P>
<P>
   In other Williamson suburban scenarios (``Scream,'' for
example), Tingle, sliced to ribbons, would turn up with the
gardening equipment in the garage rafters. This time, however,
Leigh Ann and two friends, a good-looking lunk named Luke (Watson)
and a shrill aspiring Hollywood starlet named Jo Lyn (Ms.
Coughlan), go to Tingle's house in a misguided attempt to plead
Leigh Ann's case and make peace with the woman.
</P>
<P>
   But the extended olive branch only turns Tingle nastier, and
after a scuffle over a cross-bow (another student's history
project), the three tie her to her bed posts. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE: Aside from a cut on Tingle's head, there's no blood
and whatever scuffling occurs is of a relatively benign nature.
</P>
<P>
   SEX: The teen-agers are sexually active (as is Mrs. Tingle), and
there are a couple of situations and numerous references.
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY: Lots.
</P>
<P>
   For which children?
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 10: No.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 11-13: Everything is in alignment to attract viewers this
age, parents willing.
</P>
<P>
   AGES 14 AND UP: The film is strictly business along the high
school movie conveyor belt, with perhaps a tad less blood and a bit
more soul-searching than usual.

MONTREAL: FOREIGN, NOT FAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, 4th, 5th takes detail places to go and things to do)  
 (bl)  
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In Paris, the familiar eight-sided red street signs
say ``STOP.'' The Academie Francaise, the guardian of linguistic
purity, utters not a peep of complaint. But in Montreal, where
these matters are deemed crucial to cultural identity, the signs
say ``ARRET.''
</P>
<P>
   The proud old Queen Elizabeth Hotel, which dates from Canada's
days as a dominion, is now Le Reine Elizabeth, never mind what the
chatelaine of Buckingham Palace calls herself. In Montreal, Eaton's
department store, a Canadian tradition for generations, is now just
plain Eaton; the possessive ending was amputated because the
authorities ruled it too un-French. They even tried unsuccessfully
to force a local stonecutter to take down his sign; it was
bilingual, OK, but the two languages were English and Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   There is a serious side to all of this opera bouffe, of course.
It is a continuing manifestation of the deep frustration and
resentment that Quebec's Francophones feel toward Canada's
top-heavy Anglophone majority, which has always monopolized the
economic high ground here. That there was widespread discrimination
until fairly recently is beyond dispute; for years,
English-speaking clerks in some shops shunned French-speaking
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the last two decades, hard feelings have pushed Quebec
close to separation from Canada, with severe and lasting
consequences for Montreal, even if the city itself voted no. The
issue still percolates, never very far beneath the surface. ``Je me
souviens,'' the license plates on Quebec cars say, ``I remember,''
as if warning that past slights will one day be avenged.
</P>
<P>
   But the linguistically challenged American visitor need not
fear. Most of the Montrealers one encounters speak excellent
English, though they delight in encountering an American with a
smattering of French. Like us, they laugh at signboard Franglais
that has escaped the language cops, like ``Le Pit Stop'' and
``Poulet BBQ.''
</P>
<P>
   Often billed as the second-largest French-speaking city in the
world, Montreal is delightfully, idiosyncratically ``foreign.'' Yet
under its skin, says Morley Safer, the Canadian-born CBS
correspondent, it is a lot like New York, which is something no one
would ever say about Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, when the sun shines bright for a few precious weeks,
the people of Montreal spill into parks and sidewalk cafes and onto
boats in the broad St. Lawrence River, which lies at their
doorstep. The jazz festival draws 1.5 million enthusiasts a year,
and there are also festivals of bikes and jokes, hot-air balloons
and chamber music. Dragon-boat races, fireworks competitions, a
kite-flying derby, a Beer Mundial and the Carifiesta help pack the
calendar from May to August. Sometimes you'd swear you were in Rio.

   In winter, when as much as eight feet of snow often falls on the
city, Montrealers move underground, into a well-lighted maze of
passages that connect a half-dozen downtown malls, 30 movie
theaters and 7 major hotels. People shrug at ice storms like one
that knocked out power to 1.4 million households in January 1998.
After a few days the good times roll on.
</P>
<P>
   A Parade of Nationalities
</P>
<P>
   Montreal is one of the Western hemisphere's most cosmopolitan
cities, a place that has room not only for Francophones and
Anglophones but also for ``Allophones'' _ people whose first
language is Arabic or Spanish or Russian or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moore, the Ulster-born novelist who worked in Montreal for
a decade as a reporter, always remembered something that caught his
attention on his first trip in from the airport. It summed up the
city for him: a shop calling itself the Notre-Dame-de-Grace Kosher
Meat Market.
</P>
<P>
   Drive or walk up Boulevard St.-Laurent, which climbs from the
Old Port toward the distant Laurentians, and you will witness a
grand march of nationalities: on the sidewalks, in the shops and
above all in the restaurants of this food-mad city.
</P>
<P>
   People call the boulevard ``the Main,'' and in theory it
separates the French east side of town from the English west side.
But the barrier is porous at best, and the Main itself is polyglot.
You will hear Chinese, Vietnamese and Malay spoken at the bottom,
and then, higher up, especially between Roy and Duluth Streets,
Thai, Slovak, Hungarian, Ukrainian, Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks over, and you're on Rue St.-Urbain, the main
stem of Duddy Kravitz's not entirely fictional world. It's no
longer quite as Mordecai Richler described it in his 1959 novel
``The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz,'' with a cigar store,
grocery store and fruit man on each corner, outside staircases
everywhere and ``an endless repetition of precious peeling
balconies, and waste lots making the occasional gap here and
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jews have moved up and on, and some of them, like the
whiskey-making Bronfmans, are now leading citizens of Montreal,
Canada and the wider world. Other immigrants have taken their place
and learned what it is like, as Cohen told Duddy, to ``land in this
country with three words of English and 50 cents in your pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many Americans know it, and not many American schools teach
it, but Montreal played a fascinating if minor role in the American
Revolution. The rebellious colonists hoped to enlist Canadians in
their struggle against Britain, and in November 1775, seven months
after Lexington and Concord, Gen. Richard Montgomery captured
Montreal without much of a struggle, forcing the British governor
of Quebec, Maj. Gen. Guy Carleton, to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably to vent their political passions, American troops
defaced a bust of George III that stood in the Place d'Armes, where
today stands a statue of Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve,
the founder of Montreal. In April 1776, a group of envoys sent by
Congress, headed by Benjamin Franklin, took up temporary residence
in Montreal. But even after he was reinforced by troops led by
Benedict Arnold, Montgomery was unable to drive Carleton from
Quebec City, and Franklin and company headed back south in 1777.
</P>
<P>
   The house where the Americans lived and worked, known as Chateau
Ramezay, has been preserved as a museum. It is one of the hundreds
of handsome gray sandstone buildings that have made Vieux Montreal
one of the most attractive 18th- and 19th-century neighborhoods
anywhere on the continent, where you can easily trace the city's
evolution from a trading post to a French town to a British city to
today's modern, French-dominated metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Head first for the striking, brilliantly conceived new museum at
Pointe-a-Calliere, where Montreal began. Built over extensive
excavations, which you can visit, it mounts changing exhibitions on
the city's history and boasts a bilingual multimedia show that is
not only informative but also witty, in the style of Monty Python.
Don't miss the lookout atop the museum's tower, where you can scan
the city skyline and the site of the Expo '67 World's Fair.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A financial failure, the fair left behind one of Buckminster
Fuller's geodesic domes, built as the United States exhibit, which
now houses an environmental center; a French pavilion that has been
turned into the Montreal Casino, and Habitat, Moshe Safdie's
pioneering modular apartment block, a sensation at the time and
highly popular with tenants ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The Full Flavor
</P>
<P>
   Stroll down Rue St.-Paul, a cobblestone street, to get the full
flavor of Old Montreal, good and bad. Concentrate on the stout,
honest architecture of the houses, churches and warehouses and try
to ignore the cheesy souvenir shops that fill most of them. Among
the highlights are the Marche Bonsecours, with a tin dome, and
Place Jacques-Cartier, filled with tubs of geraniums in summer, and
the Hotel de Ville, or City Hall, where Charles de Gaulle, ever the
rabble-rouser, made a speech in 1967 that ended with the words,
``Vive le Quebec libre!'' (``Long Live Free Quebec!'')
</P>
<P>
   Just a few blocks away is the Place d'Armes, which for centuries
was the city's focal point, near the heart of the old financial
district. Around it stand the imposing neo-classical office of the
Bank of Montreal; the Art Deco Aldred Building (1930), inspired by
New York's Rockefeller Center, then under construction, and the
quite extraordinary Notre Dame Basilica, a Gothic Revival
whoop-de-do in red, gold, white and a lot of sky-blue that can seat
3,800 worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   When someone told me that the pop diva Celine Dion, a Quebec
girl, had been married in a gala ceremony in the basilica, I could
not resist the thought that it looked like a set for a Cecil B. De
Mille movie, executed by A.W.N. Pugin, who decorated London's
Houses of Parliament in a vividly polychromatic ``Gothic'' style.
The church has excellent acoustics, if dubious esthetics, and my
wife, Betsey, and I had the good fortune to hear a concert there
this summer by the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, conducted by
Charles Dutoit, its Swiss-born music director. In 22 years Maestro
Dutoit has made the orchestra the most admired in Canada, while
also serving as music director of major orchestras in Paris and
Tokyo. The Montreal Symphony has played in Europe, Asia and Latin
America during 16 foreign tours, almost one a year; and since 1982
it has appeared annually at Carnegie Hall. Its work is copiously
represented on CD's.
</P>
<P>
   The big counting houses began moving from Old Montreal in the
1970's to new buildings in the newer sections of the city or, in
many cases, to Toronto. Even the Bank of Montreal now has a major
headquarters there.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Canada has stayed, ensconced in a tower near Dorchester
Square, the heart of the new downtown. So has Molson, brewer and
owner of the deeply beloved but recently floundering Montreal
Canadiens, who play in the Molson Center (nickname: the Keg),
having forsaken the sporting temple known as the Forum. There,
Rocket Richard and Boom-Boom Geoffrion wrote hockey history. Over
the years the Canadiens have won the Stanley Cup 24 times.
</P>
<P>
   But one undeniable consequence of Quebec's repeated flirtation
with independence has been an episodic flight of businesses from
Montreal. When the political mood is calm, economic life
flourishes; when referendums on separation loom, recession strikes.
At the moment, with independence on the back burner after having
been voted down decisively in 1980 and very narrowly in 1995 _ by
only 52,000 votes, in fact _ Montreal is enjoying a mini-rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, almost half a million ``Anglos,'' as they are called
here, have left town in the last 23 years, and the children of many
Anglos who remain do not return after college. Investment dollars
are hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically speaking, Montreal could be a huge, beautiful
tree,'' said Derek Burney, a former Canadian ambassador to the
United States, who lives here. ``But with the future in doubt, it's
only a bonsai.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Montreal Anglos feel that they live under cultural siege,
and it is certainly true that Montreal and Quebec stand well apart
from the rest of Canada, and not just because of language.
(Canadian French, by the way, is no more Parisian than American
English is Oxonian. The word ``depanneur,'' to take one example,
means convenience store in Canada, repair man or repair shop in the
old country.)
</P>
<P>
   Quebecers smoke more and get divorced more than other Canadians.
They are forbidden, unlike other Canadians, to turn right on red.
But their isolation enriches their cultural life, in a way. In most
of Canada television programming comes mostly from the United
States, but in Quebec 70 percent is produced in Canada.
French-Canadian theater flourishes, as does French-Canadian
literature, partly because they meet such a great need.
</P>
<P>
   The leading English theater in Montreal, the Centaur, is housed
in the creatively adapted old stock exchange. In the coming season
Gordon McCall, the artistic director, plans to mount several Irish
and American works, including ``The Crucible'' by Arthur Miller,
but also, in translation, a play by Michel Tremblay, the best known
of French-Canadian playwrights. Tremblay is more often produced by
the outstanding French-language Rideau Vert Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The center of the performing arts in Montreal is the Place des
Arts, a complex of five theaters and concert halls, begun at a time
of growing French cultural awareness in the 1960s. It includes the
Montreal Contemporary Arts Museum, which concentrates on Canadian
and particularly Quebec artists, and the all-purpose, 2,982-seat
Salle Wilfrid Pelletier.
</P>
<P>
   This is the home base for Dutoit's musicians, the up-and-coming
young Montreal Opera and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, which was
founded in 1958 by Ludmilla Chiriaeff, who more or less
single-handedly created a lively dance scene in Montreal. It has
been led since 1989 by Lawrence Rhodes, a highly regarded American
dancer. Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal is another ornament of the
local ballet stage.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The Montreal troupe best known abroad is the Cirque de Soleil,
which has grown from modest origins _ a pooling of talents by
street performers in 1984 _ into a global phenomenon, seen to date
by 18 million people. It is a circus without animals, but not
without genius. At the moment two of its seven companies are
performing in Las Vegas, one at Disney World in Florida, one in
Biloxi, Miss.; one is touring North America, one is touring Europe,
and one is traveling in the Pacific. Next year is Montreal's
chance.
</P>
<P>
   But this city's well-developed taste for the innovative, the
surreal, the avant-garde, lights up the Cirque's performances
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Shimmering Towers
</P>
<P>
   To get a good picture of what Montreal has been up to in the
last two decades, stand on the little platform on Rue Cathcart,
with your back to I.M. Pei's Place Villa-Marie, which helped to
establish the new, revitalized downtown when it opened in 1962. You
will be looking up Avenue McGill College toward McGill, Canada's
premier English-speaking university (its premier university of any
kind, to venture into political incorrectness). It scrambles up the
steep flank of the overgrown hill for which Montreal is named,
Mount Royal, which was landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted, an
American.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Canada's best post-modern architects have been employed
by the builders of the shimmering skyscrapers on either side of the
avenue. Peter Rose, of whom more in a moment, helped design the
rose-and-pale-blue Montreal Trust building at No. 1500. But nothing
here matches the ninth-floor dining room of the Eaton store on Rue
St.-Catherine, which crosses the avenue. Perfectly preserved, it
was decorated in 1931 by the Frenchman Jacques Carlu in the Art
Deco style of the trans-Atlantic liner ``Ile-de-France.'' Eaton has
just announced plans to liquidate; it is not yet clear what will
happen to the spectacular dining room.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of Avenue McGill College, just before the university
gates, you will reach Rue Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue,
which is lined with hotels, antiques shops and fashion outlets,
many of which sell Canada's fine furs. Here, in the so-called
Golden Square Mile, where once lived the Britons, most of them
Scots, who controlled three-quarters of Canada's entire wealth at
the turn of the last century, stand the McCord Museum, a historical
collection with fine Indian artifacts, and the Museum of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Safdie, the Israeli architect, designed the newer of the art
museum's two buildings, which houses both its international
collections and the superb special exhibitions in which it has
specialized in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the former you will find portraits by Memling and Rembrandt,
a pair of riveting grisailles by Mantegna and a string of excellent
20th-century pictures by Picasso, Feininger and Leger, among many,
many others.
</P>
<P>
   The current temporary exhibition, which closes Oct. 17, is
``Cosmos: From Romanticism to the Avant-Garde,'' which traces
artists' conceptions of, and reactions to, remoter corners of the
world and outer space. Goya looks at balloons, Moran at
Yellowstone, Church at icebergs, van Gogh at the sun and stars,
Calder at the solar system, Kiefer at the heavens, all struggling
for answers to questions that none of us understand, along with
Malevich, Kupka, Delauney, Hartley and Balla.
</P>
<P>
   It is a gem of insight.
</P>
<P>
   Economic Plants
</P>
<P>
   And the visual delights of this island city of 1.8 million, a
port 994 miles from the Atlantic Ocean, run on and on. Beneath the
Museum of Fine Arts (and hence a bit difficult to find) is an
excellent Decorative Arts Museum. Sharply focused on the 20th
century, it was designed by the Canadian-born Frank O. Gehry in a
style as low-key as his Bilbao museum is flamboyant.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was the architect of the Canadian Center for Architecture a
few blocks away. Financed by Phyllis Lambert, a Bronfman heiress,
it may well be the best of its kind anywhere. Its exhibitions (at
the moment, Carlo Scarpa) and the exhibitions elsewhere to which it
lends are enriched by a collection of more than a quarter-million
books, prints, models and photos.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes to the northeast, finally, is Montreal's
fabulous Botanic Garden, exceeded in size only by Kew in London.
Extensive greenhouses, including a wonderful array of ``economic
plants'' _ did you know that strychnine grew in Burma? _ are
followed by annuals, perennials and acres of trees, including
Canada's birches, spruces and, of course, maples.
</P>
<P>
   When beauty pales, you can visit the notably ugly Olympic
Stadium nearby, which has the additional virtue of a retractable
roof that no longer retracts. No wonder the Expos, who play there,
are one of the sorriest teams in baseball, one that sometimes seems
to exist mainly to sell the stars it develops to others. No wonder
fewer than 10,000 show up for most home games. No wonder the team
is seriously considering a move to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, your greenback is worth $1.50 in Montreal. Who cares
whether the stadium works or not?

<P>
   Montreal is about 335 miles from Manhattan. Here is a sampling
of attractions, and travel information. Prices are in U.S. dollars,
figured at $1 to $1.50 Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   AUBERGE DU VIEUX PORT, 97 Rue de la Commune Est, (514) 876-0081.
This 27-room package of charm, tucked into a waterfront building in
Old Montreal, is marred only by a somewhat clamorous cafe on the
ground floor. Guest rooms have exposed stone or brick walls,
polished floors and brass headboards; an appealing little
restaurant, Les Remparts, occupies the basement. Double rooms: $90
to $167.
</P>
<P>
   BONAVENTURE HILTON, 1 Place Bonaventure, (514) 878-2332. The
hotel sits atop a fortresslike exhibition complex in the city
center, but once you take the express elevator to the three top
floors, that seems irrelevant. There, a lobby decorated with bonsai
and Japanese screens awaits you, plus an outdoor pool that you can
enter from indoors in cold weather, and a lush two-acre garden,
complete with waterfall. The rooms are fresh and modern. Double
rooms: $148.
</P>
<P>
   LOEWS HOTEL VOGUE, 1425 Rue de la Montagne, (514) 285-5555. A
stylish, low-key hotel, rather European in style, lurks behind a
pink facade across from Ogilvy, the carriage-trade department
store, and down the street from the Museum of Fine Arts. The
bedrooms boast silk fabrics, the bathrooms boast whirlpool tubs,
and the snug little lobby bar welcomes one and all. Double room:
$200 to $300.
</P>
<P>
   RITZ-CARLTON, 1228 Rue Sherbrooke Ouest, (514) 842-4212.
Montreal's grandest hotel, smack in the middle of the Square Mile,
is an Edwardian dowager, built in 1912 and updated with style.
Brass elevator doors in the lobby, country antiques in some rooms
and proper keys, not plastic key cards, are all welcome reminders
of the past; electronic safes bespeak the modern era. Elizabeth
Taylor was once married there, but a lot of places can make that
claim. Double room: $164 to $234.
</P>
<P>
   Where to Eat
</P>
<P>
   L'EXPRESS, 3927 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 845-5333. A mere sliver of
a room where the buzz never stops. With marble tables, oxblood-red
walls and checkerboard tiles on the floor, it's a convincing
evocation of 1930's Paris. So is the food: pot-au-feu, calves'
liver with tarragon, onglet with shallot butter and frites, to say
nothing of a grandmother-worthy floating island under a dome of
brittle caramel. If I lived in Montreal, I'd head to L'Express for
lunch several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   JONGLEUX CAFE, 3434 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 841-8080. This
split-level restaurant (it's not really a cafe) is the latest
venture of Nicolas Jongleux, a talented young Frenchman. The
service is slow and the wine list needs work, but dishes like pork
cheeks, braised with vegetables in tomato bouillon and topped with
cheesy ravioli, combine finesse and peasant robustness.
</P>
<P>
   MEDITERRANEO, 3500 Boulevard St.-Laurent, (514) 844-0027.
California in Quebec, a brassy, trendy spot with decor faintly
reminiscent of the Normandie and glass walls that slide back in
summer. The glistening veal chop, big as a bass fiddle, resting on
a hill of spinach, epitomizes the modern culinary approach, and the
Italian and American wines match it perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   LE PASSE-PARTOUT, 3857 Boulevard Decarie, (514) 487-7750.
Trained by Charles Barrier, a legendary chef in the Loire Valley,
New York-born James MacGuire is Montreal's premier baker. His
incredibly moist sourdough puts San Francisco to shame. The modest
restaurant next door, more Montparnasse than Montreal, serves
``simple things,'' he says, but they are all perfect: gutsy salmon
that he smokes himself, rilletes and terrines that he makes
himself, maybe a masterly estouffade of lamb. Try the lovely little
French country wines, like the apple-scented Cheverny, which cost
three times nothing.
</P>
<P>
   SCHWARTZ'S, 3895 Boulevard St.-Laurent, (514) 842-4813.
Officially the Delicatessen Hebraique de Montreal, Schwartz's is
the size of a luncheonette, and just as chic. The raison d'etre
here is smoked meat, a dry-cured Montreal beef similar to pastrami.
Piled high on mustard-smeared rye, it makes a delectable sandwich.
Warning: the cholesterol-averse will wince.
</P>
<P>
   TOQUE, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084. Unlike the critics,
who raved, the New York public failed to embrace Normand LaPrise's
Manhattan venture, Cena, which closed this summer. In Montreal he
is the king of the mountain. In dining rooms decked out in primary
colors, he serves inventive dishes based on adroit combinations of
carefully chosen local products. The spice-glazed eel with green
beans, the cold yellow tomato soup with rice vinegar and basil oil,
and the caramelized fig tart all made me sigh with delight. The
service is every bit as good as the food: young, savvy and jolly.

 &HT;    Few new tricks, but solid acting in remake of `Dog of Flanders'
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Remember those after-school specials
that aired before the days of Nickelodeon, ``Power Rangers'' and
``Pokemon''? Those earnest dramas in which the grade-school set
faced all sorts of dilemmas, small yet serious?
</P>
<P>
   There's something about the new version of ``A Dog of Flanders''
that rekindles their spirit. Which is to say, it's not a
particularly slick or creative movie. But it tells a story _ and
tells it well. Throw in a fine sense of period detail _ the film is
set in 19th-century Belgium _ and you have an innocent
entertainment, the kind of movie for kids they don't make anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The story, of course, is based on Ouida's classic children's
book, a tale that has already been turned into a handful of
cinematic renderings. Meet the young orphan Nello (played by Jeremy
James Kissner and Jesse James), a kindly kid who has inherited his
late mother's gift for art. He's being raised in a farming
community by his grandfather (Jack Warden), who remains a wise and
warm soul in spite of harsh financial circumstances. He encourages
Nello to draw; so does a gifted local artist, Michel Le Grande (Jon
Voight), who looks to countryman Peter Paul Rubens as his idol.
Completing the loving picture is Nello's childhood friend, Aloise
(Farren Monet and Madyline Sweeten), and his dog, an abused pooch
he rescues and renames Patrasche.
</P>
<P>
   As Nello grows up, his talent becomes his only hope for
survival, particularly when Aloise's father falsely accuses him of
burning down his barn. He enters an art competition but is rejected
in favor of a less-gifted entrant from an upper-class family. What
will become of poor Nello?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, this is a story that plays on its young audience's
sentiment _ and director and screenwriter Kevin Brodie, a child
star-turned-filmmaker, has no problem wringing each precious moment
for its maudlin due. It's not really an impediment, but one wishes
the dialogue wasn't so stale and clumsy. There are too many
speeches that end with the equivalent of ``Fulfill your promise,
young Nello'': It's as if the ``Star Wars'' crew had invaded the
set. And much of the talk about art and the hereafter is
dumbed-down to the extreme.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Brodie has a feel for place _ the picture
captures everything from the bustling town market to a quiet
lakeside escape with colorful curiosity. And Brodie lets his child
stars discover the essence of their characters _ there's nothing
forced or cute about the acting, particularly when it comes to the
talented Jesse James, a natural cinematic presence. Too bad Brodie
couldn't loosen up Jon Voight a bit: He's too stiff for us to see
him in a sympathetic light. As for Jack Warden, he's in his best
salt-of-the-earth form.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, we need more movies like ``Dog of Flanders'' to remind
us that children's pictures should be simple affairs. Save the
sophistication for the grown-ups.

 &HT;    Stone shines, but Brooks blunders, and `Muse' is just not very
amusing
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Art imitates life in ``The Muse,'' or
maybe it's the other way around. In making a movie about a
screenwriter who loses his edge, Albert Brooks demonstrates the
dilemma all too well _ this comedy is flat and edgeless.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Brooks has made some very clever, cerebral
features (``Lost in America,'' ``Defending Your Life''), but like
his character Steven Philips, he appears to have lost his creative
spark this time. There's something to be said for a summer comedy
that doesn't try to assault us with over-the-top crude humor, but
``The Muse'' is a couple of quarts low in the laughs department.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it could still become a hit, because the arbitrary
nature of Hollywood success is exactly the point of ``The Muse.''
Film fame and fortune are so fickle you might think that some
godlike, inspirational force is involved. What else could explain
James Cameron's career?
</P>
<P>
   No sooner has Steven received a humanitarian award _ the kiss of
death in Hollywood _ than his three-picture deal at Paramount gets
yanked from him. Complaining to his Oscar-winning scribe buddy Jack
(Jeff Bridges), Steven is let in on one of the town's best-kept
secrets, a daughter of Zeus named Sarah (Sharon Stone) who serves
as muse and inspiration to her clients.
</P>
<P>
   But divine intervention doesn't come cheap. Sarah expects lavish
tributes from Tiffany's, a high-floor suite at the Beverly Hills
Four Seasons, limo service and 24-hour on-call attention from
Steven. Such demands soon wear on Steven's psyche and his wallet.
And, after some initial amusement, the idea becomes tiresome for
us, too.
</P>
<P>
   The predictable extension of the premise occurs when Steven's
wife, Laura (Andie MacDowell), becomes suspicious, then jealous, of
this woman he is showering with gifts. Then the movie takes a
curious left turn when Laura and Sarah meet, and Laura is suddenly
inspired to start a gourmet cookie business. The rudderless script
follows this dull plot thread for a while, until it is time for an
even less satisfying conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, ``The Muse'' does have some amusing tangents,
most notably Brooks' uphill trek to a pitch meeting with Spielberg.
It turns out to be with Stan Spielberg (Steven Wright), not his
cousin, Steven. There are also some amusing cameos by the likes of
Martin Scorsese and ''King-of-the-World'' Cameron as other clients
of Sarah's. Scorsese babbles about remaking ``Raging Bull'' but
with a thin guy, and Cameron is crushed by Sarah's advice to stay
away from water in his next movie.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond these industry jokes, though, there's not much laugh
power in ``The Muse.'' Even Brooks must sense this, for he throws
in a clumsy slapstick sequence that leaves him with room service
salad all over his face and egg all over the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks doesn't stray far from his usual lugubrious screen
persona. It's an acquired taste, but it doesn't wear well with
flimsy material. The pleasant surprise is Stone, who demonstrates
an unexpected comic flair as ditsy, materialistic Sarah. The
casting blunder is MacDowell, whose leaden line readings drag down
each scene. For that matter, Jennifer Tilly and celebrity chef
Wolfgang Puck are unconvincing in walk-ons as themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there were a movie that needed an injection of
inspiration, it is ``The Muse.''

SCIENTISTS CALL PHOTOS FROM SPACE OBSERVATORY `ASTOUNDING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Astronomers displayed the first images taken by NASA's $1.55
billion Chandra X-ray Observatory on Thursday, declaring the new
telescope in perfect working order and the picture quality
``astounding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It works. It works perfectly. It meets all of our
specifications,'' said Ed Weiler, NASA's associate administrator
for space science. ``We have the most powerful X-ray observatory in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The first pictures included:
</P>
<P>
   _ An immense sizzling interstellar cloud left by a star 10,000
light years away that exploded 320 years ago. Detected for the
first time amid the remnant gases of Cassiopeia A is a small bright
object that may be the dense neutron star produced in the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   _ A quasar 6 billion light years away. Astronomers believe the
large black hole it harbors is responsible for the fierce,
high-velocity gas jet streaking from the object across a distance
twice as wide as the Milky Way galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago, Weiler had the unpleasant duty of disclosing
that the Hubble Space Telescope had been launched with a misshapen
mirror, corrected three years later by spacewalking astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was nothing but praise for Chandra, a sister of
the Hubble. It was launched in July to study the high energy X-ray
emissions from stellar explosions, galactic collisions and black
holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really astounding,'' said Harvey Tananbaum, director of
the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Chandra X-ray Center in
Cambridge, Mass., noting the images of Cassiopeia were taken in
less than 90 minutes. ``It's just a glimpse, a first look at the
kinds of things that Chandra will be able to see. We couldn't be
more delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   The 45-foot long telescope was launched July 22 aboard the
shuttle Columbia, whose five-member crew was led by Air Force Col.
Eileen Collins, the first woman spacecraft commander.
</P>
<P>
   It was deployed by the shuttle crew less than 200 miles above
the Earth, then a combination of propulsion devices lofted the big
telescope into a looping orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The trajectory takes the telescope as far as 86,500 miles from
the Earth, or about a third of the way to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual orbit places the telescope above the Earth's Van
Allen radiation belt, which would interfere with the observations.
</P>
<P>
   The protective door over the barrel of the telescope was opened
in response to remote commands Aug. 12 and the images displayed
Thursday were taken about a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have not had the opportunity to scrutinize them with
the same diligence they will apply to the observations that follow.
</P>
<P>
   When they aimed the telescope at the distant quasar as part of a
calibration exercise, they expected only to see a bright point of
light. The fine resolution came as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra was designed for at least five years of observations.
However, it is in an orbit stable enough to afford a 30- to 50-year
lifetime, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   X-ray astronomy is a field born of the Space Age. The Earth's
atmosphere blocks the harmful form of radiance from reaching
ground-based observatories.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra is the third of NASA's series of great observatories.
The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory joined the Hubble in orbit in
1991. The last in the series, the Space Infrared Telescope
Facility, is planned for launching in 2001.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; ON THE SECTION FRONT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-GENOMICS (Undated) _ It's time for the gene merchants to
deliver the goods. Before there was an Internet bubble, before
biotech left a bad taste in money managers' mouths, capital was
ventured and shares sold in a group of companies that aimed to
leapfrog the Human Genome Project. By sequencing, and patenting,
genes ahead of the publicly-funded genome centers, the companies
would control the next era of healthcare, and make their founders
and shareholders rich. But now, as the international quest to spell
out the precise sequence of the three billion letters in the human
genetic code speeds to the finish line, the race to commercialize
genomics has narrowed. By Lawrence Fisher.

   BIZ-CAR-PRICING (Undated) _ Friction between Merecedes and some
of its American dealers over pricing policy is turning nasty, with
the suing and countersuing between one Toms River, N.J., dealer and
Mercedes getting so acrimonious that the company used a court
maneuver to abruptly yank his franchise away. By Skip Kaltenheuser.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-ECON-COLUMN-WAGES (Undated) _ The 3,100 drivers at C.R.
England, Inc., a trucking company in Salt Lake City, got a big
raise this month, their first raise in nearly three years. They now
average about $35,000 a year. But it is not enough. Even their boss
says so. Most of the nation's 500,000 long-haul drivers are in the
same boat. Inflation has eaten at their pay, and the raises that
are just beginning to come through have not restored the buying
power that existed for these drivers in the late 1970s. The
re-engineering of the American economy started then and is still
having its effect today. By Louis Uchitelle.

   INVEST-STRATEGIES (Undated) _ `In the long run, we're all
dead,'' John Maynard Keynes once said. But many investors may want
to send a similar message to their value-oriented financial
advisers, who often admonish them to shun the high-priced stocks
that have led the market to new highs and, instead, to focus on
shares that are cheap on the basis of their fundamentals. By Mark
Hulbert.

   INVEST-BRODY-PPM (Undated) _ Investing With Richard S. Brody,
who disproves the notion that consultants are better at giving
advice than doing the job. By Hillary Rosenberg.
</P>
<P>
   INVEST-RENTAL-EQUIPMENT (Undated) _ It was just over a year ago
that investors were engaged in an industrial-sized obsession with
the stocks of equipment rental companies _ businesses that rent out
everything from bulldozers to 100-foot telescopic boom lifts to
generators and hand tools. Since then, however, these stocks have
turned earthbound. Yet there is much to recommend the sector. By
Sana Siwolop.
</P>
<P>
   BIZ-STAR-TREATMENT (Undated) _ Three years ago, Marnie Lerner
and Cynde Cassel started Star Treatment, a company that created
whimsical, personalized gift baskets. Living in Los Angeles, it did

</P>
<P>
   CARSMART-OLD-IMPALAS (Undated) _ Mention ``Impala,'' and people
of a certain age get wistful. Add ``Super Sport'' and you're likely
to hear tales of youth misspent at the wheel, under the hood, in
the back seat. The memories are free, but parking a genuine old
Impala in the garage will cost you. By Paul Duchene.

<P>
   IN-MY-BRIEFCASE (Undated) _ Stand alone graphic: In My

global strategist for Deutsche Bank Securities, Edward Yardeni, is
a favorite Wall Street figure for technology skeptics these days.
After all, he has said that there is a 70 percent chance that Year
2000 computer problems will lead to a global recession. But as he
prepared for a recent two-day, four-city trip to address the bank's
West Coast clients, a look into his briefcase revealed that he is
the kind of consumer the computer industry loves. ``I always want
the latest and newest, and I want it compact,'' he said.

SCIENTISTS FIND WATER IN A METEORITE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.M., Ill.)  (th) 
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is not quite manna from heaven, but NASA scientists Thursday
announced the first discovery of liquid water in an object from
space.
</P>
<P>
   The water was trapped, like a fly in amber, in salt crystals on
a meteorite that thudded to Earth last year in Monahans, Texas. The
meteorite is 4.5 billion years old, so analysis of the water may
provide clues to the solar nebula, the swirling cloud of gas and
dust that gave rise to the Sun and the planets.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the first direct water samples ever found in a
meteorite,'' said Michael E. Zolensky, a space scientist at NASA's
Johnson Space Center in Houston and lead author of a paper
describing the study, being published Friday in the journal
Science. ``It's a look back at the earliest days of the solar
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert N. Clayton, a professor of chemistry at the University of
Chicago, who was not involved in the discovery, described it as
``intriguing and exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has seen anything like that in a meteorite,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that, said a co-author, Everett K. Gibson Jr., a
NASA scientist, is that nobody was ever before able to analyze a
rock so soon after it struck Earth. As things turned out, the short
lapse of time in this case almost certainly proved crucial.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-pound-11-ounce piece of the meteorite hit about 40 feet from
where seven boys were playing basketball on March 22, 1998, in
Monahans, a West Texas town of about 8,000 people. The boys picked
up the rock while it was still warm and called the police. Less
than 48 hours later, it and a companion piece were in a laboratory
at the space center, being cracked open with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very fortunate,'' Gibson said. ``As far as we know,
it's the shortest time ever for getting a meteorite analyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   When the scientists looked at a natural fracture on the rock,
they noticed a blue-purple crystalline mineral that preliminary
analysis showed to be halite, or common salt. (The color was a
result of bombardment by radiation during the billions of years the
rock journeyed through space as part of a larger asteroid.)
</P>
<P>
   Had there been much delay in getting the rock to a laboratory,
humidity would have most likely caused the salt to dissolve. ``We
would have just seen a rust-colored spot and wouldn't have thought
anything about it,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   When the researchers looked at the crystals under a microscope,
they saw tiny spaces, some of which contained bubbles, like the
glass in a carpenter's level. Further analysis showed that these
spaces, known as ``inclusions,'' contained a brine _ water with
sodium and potassium as well as other minerals.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of water is so small, Gibson said, that if it was all
collected from the meteorite, ``you wouldn't even see a drop on the
end of a needle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Planetary scientists have long known that the early solar system
must have had abundant water, said Adrian Brearley, a professor of
geological and planetary sciences at the University of New Mexico.
Some meteorites contain water that, rather than being liquid, has
been broken down into component ions and bound to minerals. Others
show indirect evidence that water once flowed on their parent
asteroids.
</P>
<P>
   But this is the first time that liquid water has actually made
it to Earth. A 1980s report of water-containing crystals in a
meteorite was later discounted, as it was shown that the samples
had been contaminated by liquid used to prepare them in the
laboratory. That error, Zolensky said, ``put people off trying to
even look for these things for years and years.''
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the Monahans samples, Zolensky said, is to
analyze what isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen they contain, ``to see
where the water came from _ whether it is interstellar or
home-grown solar system water.'' Because the amount of water is so
small, that analysis will have to wait at least a year, until more
precise instruments are developed.
</P>
<P>
   One remarkable thing about the discovery, Brearley said, is that
the water was found on a type of meteorite that is ordinarily
thought of as very dry. Shortly after its asteroid formed billions
of years ago, radioactive decay within the rock caused it to heat
up, boiling off water and even melting the rock. So the halite
crystals probably formed after this, when the rock was cooling.
</P>
<P>
   Zolensky and his team have suggested two scenarios by which the
halite could have formed. In one, water trapped within the asteroid
could have been expelled through a crack, perhaps caused by a
collision, and evaporated very quickly at the surface, leaving
behind the halite crystals.
</P>
<P>
   In the other scenario, the source of the water was an encounter
with a comet or other icy body, essentially a cosmic snowball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it was hit by a snowball, that snowball is still 4.5
billion years old,'' Clayton said. ``We're still dealing with very
primitive stuff.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. military acted properly in providing
almost $1 million in assistance for the federal law enforcement
assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas, the U.S.
General Accounting Office said in a study released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helicopters, tanks, and a grenade launcher, the
report confirmed that the military supplied Army Special Operations
observers when the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms led the raid in April 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting office, which serves as the investigative arm of
Congress, concluded that the military involvement was fully
authorized under federal antidrug law.
</P>
<P>
   Before the assault, local and federal law enforcement officials
reported evidence that the Davidians may have operated a
methamphetamine laboratory. No proof of drug manufacturing was
found after the attack, which ended when the compound burned,
killing 80 people inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drug connection legitimizes providing military assistance
without reimbursement,'' said Carol Schuster, who oversaw the GAO
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The report said no formal standard exists for justifying a
military role in drug investigations, giving military officials
``considerable discretion'' in deciding whether to assist law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the drug tie, the military could still provide
support, but civilian agencies would have to pay the costs, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
   In Waco, the Texas and Alabama National Guard, the Army and the
Air Force were reimbursed for about three-quarters of their
non-drug-related expenses. The biggest single cost to the FBI was
$230,000 for an Army helicopter, damaged because of pilot error
during the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   Schuster said that she could not confirm published reports that
personnel from the secret rapid-deployment Delta Force were present
at the raid.
</P>
<P>
   According to the GAO report, an unidentified Army special
operations unit provided observers, classified equipment and
operators, as well as trainers during the siege. The report does
not specify which military unit played these roles, but elsewhere
it mentions assistance from the Army's Joint Task Force Six's
rapid-support unit, based at Fort Hood, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO study sheds no light on the FBI admission this week that
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters were used against the compound. A
long list of gear provided by the Defense Department included
``ammunition for grenade launcher,'' but Schuster said this was a
different kind of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The catalog of equipment and services provided by the military
was estimated at $982,4000 and included helicopters and airplanes
to provide surveillance and standby for medical evacuation, tanks
and combat vehicles, flak vests, night-vision goggles, and
training.

COMPAQ DROPS ALPHA-WINDOWS NT PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp. is giving up on efforts to customize
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT operating system to work with Compaq's
powerful Alpha microprocessor chip.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and Compaq said Thursday they would halt an
effort to design a version of Windows NT that would take advantage
of the Alpha chip's unique design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically to simplify the strategy of the company and the
product offerings,'' a Compaq spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The death of the Alpha-NT program is part of a campaign by
Compaq to cut its operating costs. The company expects to lay off
as many as 8,000 workers in a variety of departments, including at
least 100 involved in development of NT for Alpha. The Internet
computer news service CNet reported that layoffs at Compaq could
begin as early as today (Aug. 27).
</P>
<P>
   Compaq says it's still committed to the Alpha chip, which is
manufactured for the company by Intel at a plant in Hudson and also
by the Korean firm Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. But future Alpha
machines will run only non-Microsoft operating systems. These
include the sophisticated Unix operating system; OpenVMS, a system
designed for large and midsized business computers; and the
increasingly popular free operating system Linux.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to abandon Windows NT for Alpha means future
Alpha-based computers won't run one of the world's leading
operating systems. This could reduce demand for Alpha computers
among corporate buyers who often prefer to rely on Microsoft
software.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpha chip was originally developed by Digital Equipment
Corp., the Maynard, Mass. company acquired by Houston-based Compaq
last year. The Alpha can process data in 64-bit chunks, compared to
the 32-bit pieces used by rival processor chips. This enables
Alphas to quickly search vast databases of information.
</P>
<P>
   But to take full advantage of the 64-bit feature, an Alpha
computer needs a custom operating system. Versions of Linux, Unix
and OpenVMS already do this. But Windows NT and its upcoming
successor, Windows 2000, are designed for 32-bit computers. (There
is a version of Windows NT that runs on Alpha, but it doesn't make
full use of the chip's 64-bit power.)
</P>
<P>
   Compaq and Microsoft have worked together for years to develop a
64-bit version of Windows NT and 2000 for Alpha. Microsoft is also
designing 64-bit software for the Merced processor, set for release
next year by chipmaker Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Compaq and Microsoft announced they would halt work on
the 32-bit version of NT for Alpha. Compaq officials noted that few
Alpha customers used the product. But until Thursday, both
Microsoft and Compaq had insisted that they would continue to work
on a 64-bit version of NT for Alpha.

IN BID TO PRESERVE PEACE, BRITAIN SAYS IRA DIDN'T BREAK
CEASE-FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Stirring a furor among Protestant politicians, Britain
sought Thursday to prevent the collapse of peace efforts in
Northern Ireland by ruling that recent charges of murder and
gun-running against the Irish Republican Army did not constitute a
breach of its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The assessment by Mo Mowlam, the Northern Ireland secretary, was
apparently intended to insure that Sinn Fein, the IRA's political
affiliate, does not pull out of a planned review next month of the
labored effort to bring peace to the British province. The review
is to be conducted by George Mitchell, the former U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   Announcing her long-awaited decision to reporters in Belfast,
however, Mowlam indicated that she was seeking to walk a narrow
line between maintaining the peace effort and letting the IRA and
its political arm know that ``if violence continues, the political
process, which depends on confidence and trust, will be
increasingly at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   She had, she said, come ``very close to judging that the IRA
cease-fire is no longer for real.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ``the peace we have now is imperfect but better
than none.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the situation in relation to the IRA is deeply
worrying, I do not believe that there is sufficient basis to
conclude that the IRA cease-fire has broken down,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nor do I believe that it is disintegrating or that these
recent events represent a decision by the organization to return to
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mowlam said, ``we are very close to the edge'' of a
breakdown in the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA declared a cease-fire in July 1997, paving the way for
last year's so-called Good Friday peace agreement. Under the terms
of the deal Britain has released around 280 paramilitary prisoners
and 200 more are scheduled to be freed by next May if the peace
effort remains intact.
</P>
<P>
   Before Mowlam's decision, Northern Ireland's largely Protestant
Unionists, who want continued ties with Britain, pressed her to
declare the cease-fire over and to suspend the release of IRA
prisoners. But Sinn Fein dropped broad hints that it would withdraw
from next month's peace review if the prisoner releases ceased.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Sir Ronnie Flanagan, head of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary, accused the IRA of involvement in the July 30 slaying
of Charles Bennett, a 22-year-old cab driver, who was killed by a
gunshot wound to the head. His hands were tied behind his back. The
slaying has been depicted as the vengeance murder of a suspected
police informer.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam said she accepted Flanagan's version of events, calling
the killing ``savage and disgraceful.'' She said ``information is
also clear'' about IRA links to illicit arms deals with suppliers
in the United States that has led to arrests in Ireland and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But she maintained these developments did not constitute a
formal decision by the IRA to break the cease-fire. ``There is no
example of organized violence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision drew protests from leading Unionists, including
David Trimble, the province's first minister, who called the ruling
``deeply disappointing, deeply flawed.'' Other Unionists demanded
Mowlam's resignation, but Trimble did not go that far, saying only
that Mowlam had been unable to ``tell people the simple truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite clear that the IRA is not keeping what we would
recognize as a cease-fire,'' Trimble said. ``She appears to be
accepting the IRA definition of events.'' He added that her
assessment had done serious damage to public confidence in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Other Unionists went further, saying, in the words of the
hard-liner Jeffrey Donaldson, that Mowlam's decision was ``a sick
joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has lost all credibility and should do the honorable thing
and resign,'' Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sinn Fein's chairman, Mitchel McLaughlin, welcomed the
decision, saying it protected the troubled effort for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year's accord, the agreement has been repeatedly
strained by a series of incidents. Many of them have been depicted
as vengeance killings on both sides of Northern Ireland's sectarian
divide. Forty-one people have died in 11 incidents, including the
bombing in the town of Omagh on Aug. 15, 1998, which killed 29. A dissident faction called the Real IRA took responsibility
for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Others strains are also emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists are also complaining about leaked versions of a
British report to be published in three days' time, suggesting that
the province's police force is to be revamped.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers have said the report urges that the Royal Ulster
Constabulary's most overt ties with Britain _ such as its name and
its oath of allegiance to the monarchy _ should be abolished.

BELL ATLANTIC TOLD TO SPLIT PENNSYLVANIA UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pennsylvania regulators Thursday took a first-in-the-nation step
of ordering Bell Atlantic to split its Keystone State operations
into two independent companies to promote local telephone
competition, a radical change urged by some Bell competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts and Bell rivals such as MCI-WorldCom have
been pushing a concept sometimes called ``Divestiture II.'' It
involves splitting the Baby Bells's local-service retail operations
from their network operations in the same way regional phone
companies were divested from AT&AMP;T in 1984 to promote long-distance
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania is the first state to pursue the plan, which
Massachusetts regulators call unworkable and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Under a proposed order to be made final within a month, Bell
Atlantic would continue to operate the state's phone network, but
by an as-yet unspecified time would have to create an independent
retail marketing company. This company would compete to serve
residential and business customers through the network on an even
footing with MCI, AT&AMP;T, Sprint, and other rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania regulators also ordered the Northeast phone giant
to cut access charges for rivals and froze its local rates until
2003.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Pennsylvania president Daniel J. Whelan slammed
the ruling as illegal and vowed to appeal it. Whelan said the order
amounts to ``robbing Bell Atlantic of its assets, its revenues, and
its incentives to invest'' in the state and will actually slow down
local calling competition by miring the process in confusion and
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   But state utility commission chairman John Quain told reporters
the moves would cut costs, saying: ``Local phone competition has
been an unfulfilled promise for too long.''

<P>
   DILI, Indonesia _ Opponents of independence for East Timor ran
wild in the streets of this tiny provincial capital Thursday,
firing guns, throwing rocks and setting fire to at least two
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the United Nations, which is organizing a
referendum on self-rule Monday, said he believed that four people
had been killed, either by anti-independence thugs or by panicked
policemen, and that many more had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke rose from the fires as the thugs, known as
militiamen, roared through the city in trucks. Shopkeepers pulled
down their shutters, and the streets became empty and silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can be viewed as a final effort by armed militiamen to
destabilize the popular consultation in its final days,'' said U.N.
spokesman David Wimhurst.
</P>
<P>
   The people of East Timor are to vote Monday on whether to become
an independent nation or an autonomous region within Indonesia,
which invaded the remote territory in 1975 and has battled a
separatist insurgency ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by the Indonesian military, the armed militias have
sought to intimidate the territory's 800,000 residents or to derail
the referendum through violence.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the targets of intimidation Thursday were foreigners
here to organize or observe the vote. But Wimhurst said the
referendum would proceed as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The violence was the worst in the capital since the arrival of
U.N. officials in May, but other parts of East Timor have seen more
bloodshed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wimhurst said that from 40,000 to 60,000 people had fled their
homes outside the capital and were living as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an increase in violence in the last week or 10
days,'' said another U.N. official who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``Today was certainly not a day we like, but it may not
have been the worst. What was unusual about it was that it happened
here in Dili, but there have been worse days elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department said Thursday that it
deplored the outbreak of violence in East Timor and blamed the
Indonesian government for failing to crack down on
anti-independence militias that have been blamed for most of the
recent killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indonesia has a clear responsibility to provide security and
maintain order in East Timor, not only in the coming days but
throughout an orderly transition to East Timor's new status,'' said
a spokesman, James Foley.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thursday began with rallies and motorcades on the final day of
pre-election campaigning by more than 10,000 independence
opponents. Mostly tough young men, they wound their way through
Dili in small trucks or on motorcycles, waving red-and-white
Indonesian flags and placards reading ``Otonomi'' _ advocating
autonomy under continued Indonesian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a rally, one militia leader, Eurico Guterres,
threatened to begin a campaign of violence if his side loses the
vote. ``If East Timor becomes independent, it will become a sea of
fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, members of a militia motorcade threw stones
and shot at the headquarters of the main pro-independence group. On
Wednesday, 10,000 supporters of independence had held their final
rally in a festive and peaceful atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Thursday's motorcades passed through the eastern edge
of town, scores of young men leaped from their trucks and stormed
through two villages. They set homes and vehicles on fire, fired
their mostly homemade guns and beat some residents.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, militiamen shot in the direction of a group of
foreign journalists. A photographer for Reuters was shot in the
thigh and a photographer for The Sydney Morning Herald was beaten.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. official said he was threatened at gunpoint as he drove
past a militia checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   A foreign election monitor, Suzanna Bruz, said her office was
fired upon by members of a motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were attacked in our own house, and we are international
observers,'' she said. ``They were running in the street and they
shot at us, pa-pa-pa-pa, and we were screaming.'' She said nobody
was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome, Wimhurst said, was the inability of
police to control the violence. Under procedures for the referendum
agreed to at the United Nations, the Indonesian police are
responsible for security during the campaign and on polling day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police have got to take full account of the situation and
face their inability to control these localized outbreaks of
violence,'' he said. ``I believe they felt overwhelmed. We will be
discussing this situation fully with the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said police were very slow to arrive when violence
flared on the city's eastern edge and that when they did they
appeared to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw one man get shot,'' said a woman, Yenni Wahid. ``He was
running from the police and they tried to grab him. He got away and
they fired warning shots. He kept running. One guy pointed a gun
and all the journalists shouted, `No!' And bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Other witnesses said they saw a police officer aim his rifle
point-blank at one young man and shoot him in the forehead.
</P>
<P>
   If the territory does vote for independence, the Indonesian
police and military forces here will continue to be responsible for
security during a transition period of three to six months, a
government spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to leave a vacuum here,'' the spokesman, Dino
Djalal, said. ``There has to be some continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign military experts estimate that Indonesia currently has
8,000 police officers and between 12,000 and 15,000 troops
stationed in East Timor.

<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Beware of Greeks baring forehands?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday. According to the dialogues of Plato, as
translated by the late pugilism scholar, Chelsea's Sam Silverman:
``You gotta be double-tough with both hands.''
</P>
<P>
   A new boy in town, Solon Peppas, never heard of Silverman and
isn't too familiar with the works of countryman, Plato, but he
recognizes the truth of it. ``When I come back,'' he is saying
hopefully, ``I will be better here.'' He indicates the left side,
the backhand, possibly his Achilles' heel.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Solon Peppas, a racket-toting journeyman in the US
Pro Championships, has had the time of his life at Longwood Cricket
Club. From an unnoticed life in the limbo of qualifiers and bush
league tournaments, he emerged, if only briefly. People watched him
at his chosen work. They applauded him, and he was asked for an
autograph or two.
</P>
<P>
   Although the US Pro doesn't go back as far as the Golden Age of
Greece (only to 1927), it is the elder among professional tennis
tournaments, annually an international convention. Still, Peppas is
the lone Greek ever to ply his trade therein, and be caught up in
the odyssey of men's pro tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans of every stripe are common. Longwood has been graced
by competitors from every continent but Antarctica (penguins are
suspect, apt to take dives). But no Greeks _ until 24-year-old
Peppas showed up unannounced with his Spanish coach and his good
but, well, not-quite-Herculean forehand.
</P>
<P>
   A Rhodes scholar of tennis, having grown up on that island, he
was a Ping-Pong enthusiast as a youth. But his mother, Arete,
suggested he get out of the house and try the larger game _
``running, more exercise, better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest player in the history of Rhodes couldn't find
enough testing opposition at home, and moved to Athens at 16 to
become the greatest player in the history of Greece _ can anyone
name another? _ the stalwart of the otherwise not very stalwart
Davis Cup team. ``They don't pay us like most countries. Tennis is
a poor sport in Greece. But you want to play for your country.''
</P>
<P>
   Peppas, a solidly put together 5 feet 11 inches with slicked
back brown hair, brown eyes, and a terrific smile, is sad to pack
and leave our town, which, he was informed, goes by the sub-title
``The Athens of America.'' He likes it here. The place is
``memorable'' because ``it was my best time in tennis _ four
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of them were in the morass of qualifying, but never mind.
To crash the gate to the main event _ his first time earning his
way into the big league _ Solon had to beat the spiky Uruguayan,
No. 78 Marcelo Filippini, 2-6, 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``My best win. Then.'' But next, in his first-round triumph, he
took out No. 55, Spaniard Albert Martin. A better best win. The ax
fell in the next round, in the left hand of first-seeded Greg
Rusedski, 6-3, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous at first. So many people,'' Peppas shrugs.
``I never see so many (4,500) seeing me. And I never play anybody
like Rusedski. He's in the US Open final in 1997.'' The Greeks have
a word for Rusedski's serve: ``terastio'' _ huge. Peppas, a
sprightly scamperer, had been able to hide his backhand in a
closet. His Grecian formula was running like mad to make sure he
hit a forehand from anywhere. But that faded.
</P>
<P>
   Although Peppas was a nowhere man when he passed his last
qualifying exam Monday, ranked No. 386, being the 386th best tennis
player in the wide wide world isn't exactly chopped feta. But it
isn't very lucrative either. His parents, artists Arete and
Constantinos Peppas, have been financial angels. This Greek goes
away bearing the prize money gift of $5,500, by far his finest
payday.
</P>
<P>
   More rewarding is his advance to No. 315. His coach, Ricardo
Sanchez, feels Peppas can make the top 100. ``If I do that I will
be a big hero in Greece, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You will be the Hercules of the hard courts,'' says his pal,
Nick Cargadouris, a leading Greek junior player who enters Brown
University in a few days. ``Maybe you and me will be the Greek
Davis Cup team, Solon.''
</P>
<P>
   By Zeus, they might. ``I'm behind other guys my age,'' says
Solon. ``For one thing I had to spend 20 months in the army.
Compulsory service. But my success here will make me try even
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the bushes he goes, scrounging for more wins and
computer points, yearning to return to the bigs, the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Will we ever hear of the earnest Solon Peppas again? Who knows?
Maybe we should consult the Oracle of Delphi.

THREE DIE IN EAST TIMOR STREET VIOLENCE

   ATAMBUA, Indonesia _ Violence flared Thursday in Dili, the
capital of East Timor, as militias rampaged through the streets
following a rally of forces opposed to independence from Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The street clashes, which left at least three dead, erupted four
days before residents of the former Portuguese colony vote on a
proposal that would confer greater autonomy on the province but
keep it part of Indonesia. Indonesia's president, B.J. Habibie, has
promised to grant independence to East Timor if the autonomy plan
is rejected in the long-sought referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's violence capped six months of escalating clashes
between civilian militias who want East Timor to remain part of
Indonesia and longtime supporters of independence for the
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the capital fled indoors as gangs of militiamen
swarmed through the streets firing assault rifles and homemade
shotguns and exploding homemade grenades. Witnesses said riot
police made little effort to halt the mobs.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were reported killed when the militias fired into
rock-throwing crowds of independence supporters, and a third was
shot dead by police. Many were wounded by gunshots, stabbed, or hit
by flying rocks and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Eurico Guterres, leader of a militia group, told the 15,000 who
attended the anti-independence rally in a sports stadium that ``it
will become a sea of fire'' if proindependence forces prevail in
the voting.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Secretary General Kofi Annan and the
Security Council demanded a halt to the violence. Annan said he was
appalled by the fighting and demanded that Jakarta take immediate
steps to restore and maintain law and order.The United Nations has
twice proposed the referendum because of earlier violence.
</P>
<P>
   In Lisbon, Jose Ramos-Horta of East Timor, a Nobel laureate,
called the violence ``a provocation, an act of desperation'' by the
Indonesian military, because the country believes the vote will
favor independence.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor gained independence from Portugal in 1975, but
Indonesia promptly invaded and gained control in civil war in which
an estimated 200,000 people died in the fighting and starvation and
disease that ensued. The Indonesian government imposed a harsh
rule, but its sovereignty over East Timor is not recognized by the
United Nations, the United States, or most countries.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Portugal and Indonesia accepted a UN-brokered agreement
to hold a ballot this month on the autonomy plan. Habibie's promise
to grant independence would have to be ratified this year by
Indonesia's parliament _ by no means a done deal.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Habibie said that Jose Alexandre Gusmao, an East
Timorese rebel leader who has been under house arrest in Jakarta,
would be freed around Sept. 15. He is considered likely to become
president of East Timor if it becomes independent.
</P>
<P>
   Observers have been predicting the ballot would bring bloodshed
between proindependence guerrillas and pro-Indonesia militias,
which claim 50,000 members. The majority of ordinary people are
thought to support independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst thing would be a war _ it's very possible. Both
sides have arms and neither one is ready to accept defeat,'' said
Abinanto, an official with the Jakarta-based Independent Committee
for Election Monitoring. A team from the group was waiting at the
border with West Timor before attempting to enter East Timor to
monitor Monday's voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter which way the vote goes, there will be bloodshed,''
said a Catholic priest in the border town of Atambua. The priest,
who spoke on condition of anonymity, predicted there would be less
violence if the pro-Jakarta side wins, since it is better-armed and
backed by the military and security forces. But he added that he
believes the vote will go for independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian military denies supporing the pro-Jakarta
militias, but top officials and local military commanders have held
numerous rallies alongside militia leaders. Amnesty International,
after a fact-finding mission this year, said militias were being
trained and armed by the military and were using military
facilities to detain independence supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, a senior official for the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees arrived in West Timor's capital of Kupang to make
preparations for an expected onslaught of refugees following
Monday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will happen. It already has,'' said Damaris Johana, a field
worker for Catholic Relief Services in Kupang. She said an
estimated 13,000 East Timorese refugees have fled since violence
escalated early this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees sheltering in West Timor are migrants from
other parts of Indonesia who moved to East Timor in search of jobs
after Indonesia annexed the territory in 1976. Now they are afraid
to remain in East Timor if Monday's ballot goes for independence,
Johana said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they are intimidated by pro-independence groups who
don't let them fly our Indonesian flag,'' Johana said.
</P>
<P>
   Truck drivers and a group of Indonesian election monitors slept
in their vehicles at the border Thursday night, afraid to cross by
night for fear of attacks by either side.
</P>
<P>
   Reports circulated that the border would be sealed at 8 a.m.
Friday to prevent armed gangs from crossing from the west to
provoke more violence and intimidate East Timorese. West Timorese
are loyal to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, a senior leader of pro-Jakarta militias in Dili
said they would seek to close all borders and the airport the day
after the election so that the proindependence ``political elite''
could not flee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the violence and reports of intimidation, some East
Timorese said they had every intention of voting and were looking
forward to the chance to have their say.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are happy about the election, because it will bring an
end to all of this _ it will either be indpendence or stay with
Indonesia,'' said Yasinto Jemu, 35, a truck driver from East Timor.
``But the government's program for autonomy versus independence I
don't really understand, and I don't know which way the vote will
go. I'm still scared.''

BATTLE RAGES OVER PATIENTS RIGHTS LEGISLATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Doctors say HMOs are shelling out millions to kill
legislation that would give patients better access to needed
medical care. HMOs suggest they are defending the average consumer
against trial lawyers who would make health care unaffordable.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the contradictory messages being peddled across the
nation this month as powerful special interests jockey for an
advantage in the fight over patients rights legislation. The House
is expected to debate a measure this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved a managed care measure earlier this year,
but it has been attacked by most Democrats and even some House
Republicans who believe it did not go far enough in giving patients
the ability to challenge their HMO decisions.
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan group of House members, led by Rep. Charles
Norwood, a Republican dentist from Georgia, and Rep. John Dingell,
D-Mich., unveiled legislation before the summer break that covers
more people than the Senate bill, makes it easier to appeal HMO
decisions and gives consumers the right to sue their medical plans.
</P>
<P>
   This week the powerful American Medical Association threw its
endorsement behind the Norwood-Dingell bill and announced a
newspaper advertising campaign to promote the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement, titled ``What are HMOs so Afraid of,''
accuses the health insurance industry of spending $100 million to
defeat measures that would give patients more rights to appeal
health plan decisions and give doctors more authority to make
medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   AMA officials hope their $140,000 campaign will place pressure
on GOP House leaders to get behind the Dingell-Norwood effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the Republican leadership wakes up and listens to their
constituents,'' said AMA president Dr. Thomas Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the top House Republicans have been tiptoeing around
the measure, particularly a provision that would amend a federal
law to allow consumers enrolled in employer-sponsored health plans
to sue their providers for punitive and compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   They claim that such suits would increase costs for insurance
companies and leave employers who offer health plans liable to
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   A Congressional Budget Office analysis of a Senate Democratic
managed care plan that included the right to sue concluded that
mandates of the bill would cause health care premiums to rise 4.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Reardon said patients wouldn't mind paying a few more
dollars to ensure that they were getting better medical care.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Medical Association also argues the liability costs
are exaggerated. They point to their own analysis showing that HMO
premium rates in Texas have gone up less than the national average
even though the state has granted consumers the right to sue their
health plans. So far three lawsuits have been filed against managed
care plans in Texas since the law was passed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, citing the fear of increased costs and litigation,
a well-financed coalition of HMOs, insurance and business groups
opposing the managed care legislation have been working to defeat
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   This week the American Association of Health Plans, which
represents HMOs, launched a new television campaign that claims the
managed care plans will enrich trial lawyers at the expense of
working Americans, who could lose their health care if costs
skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   The association plans to spend $5 million during the current
congressional session to defeat the Dingell-Norwood managed care
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Merritt, vice president and chief of strategic planning and
public affairs for AAHP, called the managed care legislation ``a
political rip-off.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt said he doesn't believe voters are so upset with their
health plans that they are demanding that Congress make changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the real world this is a second-tier issue. Only in
Washington is it a first-tier issue, ''he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Harris poll released this week found that health care ranked
fourth among voters' concerns, behind education, taxes and crime,
but ahead of Social Security, gun control and the economy.
</P>
<P>
   But one influential segment of the population, medical
professionals, are unhappy with managed care, according to recent
survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   In the survey of 1053 physicians and 768 nurses, most said their
patients have experienced some type of denial of coverage for
health services in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of those surveyed said managed care had increased
their administrative paperwork and decreased time spent with
patients. One of the few positives of managed care cited was the
increased use of preventive services by patients.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Leavitt, an official with the Kaiser Family Foundation,
said that considering the frustration with managed care it is not
surprising that doctors would get behind the toughest managed care
bill.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that the AMA support would boost its chances of
passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMA brings a great deal of political clout and money and
credibility. Doctors are still very trusted professionals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And holding only a slim majority in the House, GOP leaders may
have difficulty blocking efforts to pass a managed care bill that
is significantly stronger than that passed by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Already a number of Republican lawmakers, including several who
are doctors, have attacked the Senate bill as not doing enough to
protect doctors and patients.
</P>
<P>
   They have been particularly critical of an external appeals
provision in a Senate plan that lets the health plan, not
physicians, decide whether a procedure is medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they want any legislation to apply to the 161
million Americans covered by all health plans. The Senate measure
only applied to 48 million people in health plans that are
regulated by federal and not state laws.
</P>
<P>
   The measure also includes less controversial items such as
guaranteeing that patients are taken to the nearest emergency room
and ensuring consumers the right to see specialists.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has said he expects
his chamber will take up the managed care measure in September.
</P>
<P>
   His office has been working with GOP Rep. Tom Coburn, an
Oklahoma physician, and Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz., who have
drafted a version that grants consumers only limited right to sue
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   But Hastert spokesman Pete Jeffries said the speaker has not yet
endorsed their bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point it is a work in progress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas doctors will be watching what the House does because the
ability of the state to carry its own managed care law may depend
on whether Congress amends federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Houston last year threw out the mandatory
appeals procedure included in the state law, saying that federal
law supersedes the state regulations. However, the judge affirmed
the ability of consumers to sue their HMOs. Both decisions have
been appealed.

BRITAIN TO IGNORE IRA INFRACTIONS, CONTINUE PEACE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Britain, in an apparent effort to keep the badly
listing peace process afloat in Northern Ireland, ruled Thursday
that the IRA's cease-fire was still in place despite the republican
guerrilla organization's use of violence in its own community.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Mo Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for
Northern Ireland, was bitterly attacked by unionists who represent
the Protestant majority there. Unionists accused her of turning a
blind eye to murder and the IRA's alleged attempts to arm itself
even as its political allies say they can get the IRA to turn in
its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Mowlam said she believed the ``overall'' cease-fire remained
in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace we now have is imperfect but better than none,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   If she had ruled that the IRA's continued use of violence to
discipline its own dissidents and petty criminals in its
neighborhoods constituted a violation of its cease-fire, any
sanctions she would have sought to impose would have led the IRA's
political allies in Sinn Fein to boycott the next attempt to revive
the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sinn Fein will take part in the review of the process, which
will be overseen by the former US senator from Maine, George
Mitchell, who chaired the negotiations that led to the Good Friday
Agreement of 1998, the basis for a political settlement that is in
danger of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam also risked a major rift with the Irish government,
London's partner in brokering the peace process. On Monday, Irish
Foreign Minister David Andrews said Dublin believed the cease-fire
was still intact.
</P>
<P>
   While Sinn Fein was pleased with Mowlam's decision, unionists
were furious. Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble said her
decision was ``deeply disappointing, deeply flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Maginnis, the security spokesman for Trimble's party who has
survived IRA assassination attempts, was more blunt, calling
Mowlam's decision ``total, unmitigated rubbish.''
</P>
<P>
   Unionists and the Conservative opposition in the British
Parliament had called on Mowlam to halt the early release of IRA
prisoners that is mandated under the Good Friday Agreement. Some
270 have been released, and another 200 are scheduled for release
next year. But that sanction likely would have led to Sinn Fein
boycotting the process that, without them, can go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam announced her decision just one day after Royal Ulster
Constabulary chief Ronnie Flanagan said he was convinced the IRA
was involved in the murder last month of Charles Bennett, 22, in
Belfast. Flanagan, however, did not say that the IRA's involvement
in the murder of Bennett, a reputed IRA member, or what he called
the daily use of violence and intimidation by the IRA and their
loyalist counterparts, amounted to a violation of its cease-fire.
He said that was a political decision that had to be made by
Mowlam.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA was also suspected of being behind an attempt to smuggle
guns from Florida last month. The guns were bought legally in
Florida but shipped illegally to England and Ireland. The attempt
to rearm itself even as Sinn Fein claimed the IRA was preparing to
disarm is seen as especially cynical by unionists who don't believe
the IRA is committed to seeking a united Ireland through peaceful
means.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam said she was disturbed by the IRA's recent activity, and
that she came ``very close'' to deciding the cease-fire was over,
but that it was not enough to throw the republican movement out of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the situation in relation to the IRA is deeply
worrying,'' she said, ``I do not believe that there is sufficient
basis to conclude that the IRA cease-fire has broken down. Nor do I
believe that it is disintegrating or that these recent events
represent a decision by the organization to return to violence.''
</P>
<P>
   For unionists, this is more evidence that the British government
is more interested in political expediency than creating a
democracy that will command the respect of both sides of the
community in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But John Hume, the moderate nationalist leader who shared the
Nobel Peace Prize with Trimble, said Mowlam's decision was the
right one, and said those who were criticizing her were trying to
find any excuse not to implement the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not allow those who have never believed in the work we
have been involved in to knock us off course,'' Hume said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, said it was
incumbent upon politicians to now ``show that politics work.''

 `13th WARRIOR' IS AN AGREEABLY, OLD-FASHIONED HISTORICAL ACTION (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a movie with a name as big as Michael Crichton's attached
to it is kicked around the release schedule as long as ``The 13th
Warrior'' (going on two years), and gets a last-minute title change
to boot, it certainly builds up some negative expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, it's not so bad. True, it's a bit underwhelming in
the spectacle department, but otherwise it's a straightforward,
no-nonsense, agreeably old-fashioned historical action movie of the
kind Hollywood used to crank out by the dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Co-produced by Crichton, and based on his 1976 potboiler,
``Eaters of the Dead,'' it's the story of a real-life 10th-century
Arab poet and courtier (Antonio Banderas) who, after getting on the
bad side of the Caliph of Baghdad, is sent north to serve as
ambassador to some unnamed distant land.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he hooks up with a roving band of Vikings, who,
on the advice of their soothsayer, press the Arab into service to
help them save an isolated Norse kingdom that's being preyed upon
by a band of savage marauders.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the movie is a series of battle scenes, all shot on
the film's fog-shrouded British Columbia location, that mostly take
place either in the dark or in the bowels of a cave _ so the scenes
are so murky it's always hard to tell who is hacking whom.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees of such rowdy Viking epics from Hollywood's past as
``The Vikings'' and ``The Long Ships'' might take offense at what
has to be the most politically correct band of Norsemen in movie
history: no raping, no pillaging, complete tolerance of other races
and creeds (including the hero's Islamic practices).
</P>
<P>
   Still, I confess to having enjoyed this movie. Banderas creates
a sympathetic hero, the script is remarkably free of '90-isms, the
Viking characters (played by a largely Scandinavian cast) are
engaging, and ``The 13th Warrior'' offers some of the rousing retro
pleasures of a good '50s cavalry-and-Indians B-movie.
</P>
<P>
   The 13th Warrior. Directed by John McTiernan. Produced by
McTiernan and Michael Crichton. Screenplay by William Wisher and
Warren Lewis. Cast: Antonio Banderas, Dennis Storhoi, Vladimir
Kulich, Omar Sharif. Touchstone. 110 minutes. Rated R for violence.

 &HT;    Borges beloved in Texas city where he taught
 &HT;    By Anne Morris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The 100th birthday today of Argentine writer
Jorge Luis Borges deserves more than passing mention in Austin, a
city where he once taught and where many of his papers are housed.
</P>
<P>
   Borges, who died in 1984, ranks as one of the towering figures
of 20th-century Spanish-American literature. His unique
philosophical essays and stories helped lay the groundwork for
magical realism.
</P>
<P>
   When Borges first came to Austin in 1961, at the age of 62, he
was well known in Argentina, but the rest of the world had yet to
discover his work. The University of Texas was the first place he
came to visit. He would return four times to lecture, making
friends throughout the university.
</P>
<P>
   Borges arrived in Austin that first time a week late because
after flying to Miami, he and his aged mother decided to travel by
bus, to ``see the South.'' It was a strange choice, since Borges
had been going blind since his '50s.
</P>
<P>
   Carter Wheelock, now a professor emeritus of Spanish at UT, took
that first class from Borges on Argentine poetry and got to know
him. He describes him as a modest fellow, somewhat mischievous,
with a broad, kindly face _ and very upbeat and philosophical about
his blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Wheelock talked about his friend at a UT
symposium on Borges:
</P>
<P>
   ``He stayed a whole semester and was hardly known outside the
Department of Romance Languages. But in the seven years that
followed his first visit, he became famous throughout the world,
and when he returned in 1968 the public received him as if he were
the pope or Elvis Presley.''
</P>
<P>
   Borges' popularity hit its peak in the '60s, Wheelock said,
``years of moral chaos and intellectual rebellion on American
campuses, when students were fed up with a conceptual world that
was too real, too objective ...They were looking for a new way of
perceiving and conceiving the world.''
</P>
<P>
   They found an answer in Borges' ironic stories filled with
images of maze and labyrinth. ``Borges had written that reality is
no more than one or another of the infinite configurations of
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Wheelock recalls that Borges gave a memorable lecture on
Cervantes' novel ``Don Quixote,'' calling it a happy union between
reality and dream, and saying dream was the superior part. ``There
is no reason to suppose that dream is less real than the content of
the daily newspapers,'' Borges said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why his work did not concern itself with ethical
questions, Borges answered: ``You North Americans worry a lot about
right and wrong, perhaps to your own hurt. In my stories I do not
try to show whether a man is right or wrong, but whether he is a
brave man or a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   On one visit to the campus, Borges asked to go up in the Tower
where Charles Whitman had opened fire on the people walking below,
killing 14, and ultimately being killed by police officers. ``We
(Borges and I) went up to the observation deck,'' Wheelock said.
``Unable to see anything but light and dark, Borges paused a few
moments in silence, and then said, `I want to see where they killed
him.' We went to a corner by the wall. Borges turned his sightless
eyes toward the sky and stood for a full minute as if contemplating
the universe. Suddenly he asked, `Why did they kill him?'''
</P>
<P>
   Borges set one story in his 1975 ``The Book of Sand'' at UT, and
even inserted an Austin friend's name as a character. He also wrote
a sonnet about Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his connections here and his importance worldwide
(perhaps even because Borges was director of the National Library
of Buenos Aires for 18 years), the Ransom Center recently acquired
a large archive of Borges' material. It includes two rare posters
featuring his poetry and signed by him in tiny script, four
notebooks written in his hand and a fifth dictated to his mother.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a brief draft for a film script and other
manuscripts. Included is his Texas sonnet.

 &HT;    FBI's smoke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the 1993 raid in which nine people died to the tear-gas
assault 51 days later that resulted in flames and death, federal
handling of events at Mount Carmel has been a maddening succession
of missteps, misstatements and outright lies.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, who federal agents represent with their firepower and
subpoena power, deserved the facts on these events. Five years
later, we still feel misled.
</P>
<P>
   Yes or no: Were pyrotechnic tear-gas devices used in the assault
on the compound on April 19, 1993? No, said the FBI. Yes, says the
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   What a glaring and damaging admission, that evidence that has
sat at arm's reach of any investigator has repudiated the FBI's
words.
</P>
<P>
   Could the devices have caused the fire? No, says the FBI. They
were fired at outbuildings and long before the fire raged. Is this
to be believed or will we find out something else in five years?
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno wants an investigation. It seems we
already had one, and supposedly a massive one.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is for sure, Reno's Justice Department shouldn't be
doing the investigation. It has botched one more job.
</P>
<P>
   At this point no evidence points to the FBI causing the fire,
only to the once-vaunted agency fanning flames of continued
distrust.

 &HT;    `The Muse' has inspired moments
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ For me and Albert Brooks, it's laugh at first
sight. I derive amusement merely from his stony mug, which always
looks on the brink of crumbling into a crestfallen heap. His
ball-shaped head is an eternal scramble of befuddled distress,
topped by a dense nest of snail curls that look as though they
could be lifted and placed back in the box labeled ``clown.''
</P>
<P>
   Facially and verbally, Brooks shines in the hit-and-miss ``The
Muse,'' a jovially grumpy glimpse at the ignominy of the Hollywood
screenwriter, co-written and directed by Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   The comedy is vintage, bumbling Brooks _ consistently funny as
long as he's on screen. He's there most of the time, bristling with
inflated neuroses and agape with contained astonishment, as if he
can't believe what's happening to him. A cooler, West Coast Woody
Allen, Brooks is invariably a victim persecuted by a world gone
mad.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks plays Steven Phillips, a successful screenwriter whose
newest script is so bad that his studio drops him. He's lost his
edge, he's told by a studio whippersnapper (played with weasly
aplomb by the uproarious Mark Feuerstein). Phillips has a wife and
kids who need to eat, so this is a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Sarah, the muse (Sharon Stone), a loopy, mysterious woman,
who dispenses inspiration to stifled filmmakers in exchange for
material luxuries. Her spotless track record _ she's done wonders
for Rob Reiner, James Cameron and Martin Scorsese, all of whom have
riotously self-parodying walk-ons _ has rendered her a demanding
pain, and Brooks naturally gets the brunt of her tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   He puts her up in a $1,700-a-night suite, gets her a limo, buys
her gifts, feeds her. Soon she moves into his house. But somehow
she delivers: His latest screenplay is coming along famously thanks
to Sarah's offhand suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Sporting playful hair and a spangly wardrobe, Stone grapples to
bring an original comic touch to her underwritten role. Her innate
hardness shines through and makes Sarah's spoiled nonchalance look
instead like boredom. Micro-talented Andie MacDowell simply fills
space as Brooks' wife.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks is a skilled conjurer of middle-class tableaux, which is
served well by his wincingly flat visual instincts. There's not a
striking image in the movie and scenes are staged like museum
dioramas rather than moving pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``The Muse'' supplies enough dour laughs to make cinematic
concerns immaterial. Brooks' incessant grousing could wear on some
viewers, but, oddly, it's that exaggerated heaviness that makes his
humor so light.

`THE MUSE' IS A CLEVER, OFTEN HILARIOUS, INSIDE-HOLLYWOOD FARCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like Woody Allen, Albert Brooks is a former stand-up comedian
who has built a long, if never hugely popular, career for himself
as the writer, director and star of a series of highly personal and
extremely eccentric relationship comedies.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Allen, Brooks works rather infrequently, and his movies
always tend to be very tightly scripted (invariably working with
the same writing partner, Monica Johnson), and based on an
outrageous and totally original story idea.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, his movies tend to be events, at least for critics. And
his latest effort, ``The Muse,'' is no exception: It's a clever,
often hilarious, inside-Hollywood farce that makes the most of _
and extracts some genuine profundity from _ a delightfully absurd
premise.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks plays a successful but aging screenwriter who, as the
film opens, has just received a major industry humanitarian award,
but the next day gets his walking papers from an obnoxious young
studio executive who tells him he's ``lost his edge.''
</P>
<P>
   His career seems to be over until his Oscar-winning writer pal
(Jeff Bridges) puts him onto one of A-list Hollywood's mostly
tightly held secrets: a muse _ a woman (Sharon Stone) who, like the
muses of Greek mythology, has an uncanny ability to inspire writers
to do the best work of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the ultimate trendy Hollywood New Age-babble, but
the writer soon discovers that all of the muse's former clients
have gone on to huge success: Rob Reiner gushes over her, James
Cameron stops by for career advice, Marty Scorsese swears by her.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. The woman is a whiny kook who insists on
having her every whim catered to and being supported in style by
her client of the moment _ a chauffeured limousine, a suite at the
Four Seasons, a stream of presents from Tiffany's.
</P>
<P>
   So the writer struggles to write his script and keep his muse
happy as she insists on moving in with his family, inspires his
wife (Andie MacDowell) to
</P>
<P>
   abandon her housewifely duties to become a designer cookie
maker, and can't ever quite seem to spare him the time of day.
</P>
<P>
   The film's first act is by far its best. Brooks' exasperation is
at its most cynical, and the script starts out to be perhaps as
savage and witty a statement about the empty cruelty of
contemporary Hollywood as any filmmaker has made since Robert
Altman's ``The Player.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fade-out, however, that rage has completely softened, and
the film has lost much of its bite to become a more standard
situation comedy and, even, on a certain level, a smug and
self-congratulatory affirmation of big-studio Hollywood filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's funny, Brooks' put-upon character is perversely
endearing and his film is a shrewd little lesson in how, in the
rarefied atmosphere of Hollywood, the magic of self-confidence can
be found in very strange places.
</P>
<P>
   The Muse. Directed by Albert Brooks. Written by Albert Brooks
and Monica Johnson. Cast: Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone, Andie
MacDowell, Jeff Bridges. USA Films. 97 minutes. Rated PG-13 for no
obvious reason.

<P>
   ROME _ Nobody knows when the custom began among travelers to
Rome of turning your back to the Trevi Fountain and tossing in a
coin over your left shoulder as a means of assuring your return.
</P>
<P>
   Do it these days, however, and you will probably spy, over to
the left and a few steps up the narrow Via di San Vincenzo, a row
of tan awnings labeled Dunkin' Donuts.
</P>
<P>
   Rome, the Eternal City, home to ... Dunkin' Donuts? Yes. Only
two months old, the little store that bears the bright colors is
selling 1,200 to 1,300 donuts a day. For a store of only 690 square
feet, a fraction of the size of the average Dunkin' Donuts in the
United States, said Gianluigi Contin, president of the company that
operates it, ``that's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Why would Italians, raised on tasty cannoli, Neapolitan pastry
and tiny cups of espresso, enjoy fluffy donuts with American-style
coffee? That is not easy to explain, but the timing seems right as
a fresh wave of fast-food establishments sweeps across not just
Italy but much of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The wave is gathering momentum as a result of a combination that
includes a crisis in local family-owned mom-and-pop food
businesses, large fast-food franchises eager to expand into what
they see as underserved territory and investors on both sides of
the Atlantic who are awash in money available at low cost and who
can taste the prospect of quick growth and future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   This fertile terrain prompted a group of international
investors, including several from the United States, to bid enough
to win the master franchise for Dunkin' Donuts in Italy and
Germany, and possibly other countries. The store at the Trevi
Fountain is the flagship, but the group, known as S&AMP;C
International, plans to open about 110 stores in six years, roughly
70 in Germany and 40 in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The first German Dunkin' Donuts, in Berlin's fashionable
Charlottenburg quarter, is expected to open by November. The next
Italian store will open in October at Rome's Termini railway
station.
</P>
<P>
   Partly, the expected growth is a result of the realization that
many big fast-food franchises have virtually saturated the United
States, while Europe's fast-food map still shows large empty areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a market there,'' said Contin, 35, of S&AMP;C
International, noting that Italy's roughly 180,000 coffee bars are
almost all individually owned, and many are in poor financial
health.
</P>
<P>
   While market leaders like the McDonald's Corp. have blanketed
the European landscape, most other fast-food franchises are far
more thinly spread. Dunkin' Donuts, for instance, had been limited
until now in Western Europe to a small number of stores in Britain,
Greece, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain, leaving big markets
like France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland bereft.
</P>
<P>
   The company has decked the store out in big pop plastic donuts,
in garish shades of orange and hot pink, with fluorescent lighting.
To amuse and inform customers, table-top folders ask provocatively,
in Italian, ``Ever tried American coffee?'' then go on: ``Do you
think it's dirty water? If so, have an espresso. We'll never
convince you.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Burger King opened its first restaurant in
Italy in Milan, and more are to come. In July, Autogrill SpA, a
restaurant operator controlled by the Benetton clothing group,
spent almost $1 billion to acquire its big American rival, the Host
Marriott Services Corp., which operates Pizza Hut, Starbucks and
Sbarro franchises in North America. It plans to expand the reach of
those names into new European nooks and crannies.
</P>
<P>
   Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., which was spun off last year by
Pepsico Inc., has said it sees tremendous growth potential in
Europe for its franchise brands Pizza Hut and KFC. Other big
chains, including Starbucks, are also looking closely at large
European markets, notably Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to expand in Europe,'' said Lyne Mongrain, brand
marketing director for Dunkin' Donuts International, which has been
owned by the British beverage group, Allied Domecq PLC, since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   This second wave of fast-food expansion follows a hiatus in much
of the 1990s, as European economies slumped and the 15-nation
European Union struggled to introduce a single currency and
integrate other countries into its earlier core.
</P>
<P>
   In Toti Attanasio's home town of Catania, a Sicilian city of
378,000, the first fast-food restaurant, a McDonald's, plans to
open in October. On a recent trip to Rome, Attanasio, 28, a court
magistrate, stumbled on the new Dunkin' Donuts while sightseeing
with his girlfriend. They were so impressed by the donuts, he said,
that after a four-day side trip to Bologna, they made a point of
returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We even bought three to take home, but then ate them while we
were walking down the street,'' he said between bites of a French
cruller.
</P>
<P>
   The donuts, at the equivalent of 98 cents each, are more
expensive than in New York, where they sell for about 85 cents. But
Attanasio, who said he was a fan of American culture and a
collector of Bruce Springsteen recordings, described the donuts as
a treat because they were unlike anything Italian pastry had to
offer. ``We Italians like to try new things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is bubbling with enthusiasm over the
arrival of Dunkin' Donuts in romantic corners of Europe like the
Trevi Fountain, which was immortalized by the voluptuous Anita
Ekberg frolicking with the heartthrob Marcello Mastroianni in its
dark nighttime waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as it creates jobs, it's all right with me,'' said
Paolo Becker, who for the last 10 years has sold accessories for
smokers _ fancy pipes and cigar humidors _ in a store across the
street. But he added, softly: ``It's a typical product of American
culture _ the colors, the fake plastic donuts. It's not my thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that he had taken his daughter, who is 13, to
McDonald's. But like many Europeans, he is uneasy, partly for the
threat to small independent retailers, partly for the changing
character of historic inner cities. It is not just American stores
that raise a certain level of ire; so do locally owned chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``The neighborhood used to be traditionally Italian, but have
you seen the Benetton on the square?'' Becker said, waving toward
the Italian clothing chain's large, modern outlet opposite the
soaring fountain with its prancing marble horses. ``It used to be a
historic store, called Giusti, a family haberdashery, but it died
because 95 percent of the people who pass here now are tourists,
often groups, and groups don't have time to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   His own store, he said, relied on a loyal clientele of pipe and
cigar smokers from throughout Rome, generating only about 5 percent
of its sales from tourists.
</P>
<P>
   While many Europeans bemoan the loss of charm in their historic
cities, developers and retailers are convincing city planners that
American-style franchising, and the job creation and promotional
spending that go with it, can help keep central cities vibrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to drive out the traditional coffee bar,'' said
Leonardo Mainella, a 27-year-old law student who works part-time at
the Dunkin' Donuts. ``We want to be here alongside them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Toni Impeduglia, the new store's manager, said the developers
were at pains to give the store a bit of European flair. A star
Milanese architect, Matteo Thun, was called in to impart to the
design a vaguely retro look, with chrome tubular chairs and plastic
accessories in bright colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's trendy,'' said Amelia Hindi, 25, who toured Switzerland
and Italy this summer after graduating from Brooklyn Law School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back home,'' she said as she sipped a coolatta, ``they don't
have donuts with lights hanging from the ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeduglia, 35, who heads off this fall to the Boston area for a
six-week course at the Dunkin' Donuts University there,
acknowledged that, given the rush of summer tourism, probably 70
percent to 80 percent of the store's daytime customers are foreign
tourists, though the number of Italians increases in the evenings.
Come autumn, he said, he expects the percentages to reverse.
</P>
<P>
   He said Italian customers do not make unfavorable comparisons
with local pastry. ``In Italy, we have our own pastry tradition,
but you shouldn't compare the two,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds true for American-style coffee, he argued. In the
store's first months, sales of American coffee, which costs a
dollar for a regular cup, have been roughly double that of
espresso, which costs only 70 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit of a fashion, particularly among Italian women in
their 30s and 40s,'' Contin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less hysterical, you sit down to drink it,'' unlike
espresso, which Italians gulp on the run, he said. ``And there's
three times less caffeine, so there's a small but widening niche.''
</P>
<P>
   As for bagels, Impeduglia said, Italian customers tend to look
on them ``as just some kind of bread.'' The Trevi Fountain store
stocks five varieties, including onion, sesame, cinnamon and plain,
and serves them with five varieties of cream cheese, including
dill, salmon and plain. This fall, bagel sandwiches will go on
sale, with fillings like chicken salad and boiled ham.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many investors rushing in, should the fast-food
industry be afraid of a European glut?
</P>
<P>
   Paolo de Spirt, chairman and one of the founders of S&AMP;C
International, thinks not.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the simple numbers of it, the number of chains in Europe is
far behind that in the United States,'' de Spirt, a former
investment banker at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said. In Europe, he
said, only 16 percent of food distribution is franchised, and in
some major markets, like Italy, as little as 5 percent, compared
with more than 50 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for growth here is enormous,'' he said.

STOCKS IN BROAD RETREAT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks retreated broadly Thursday. A rally based on
the belief that Tuesday's interest-rate increase would be the
Federal Reserve's last for the year gave way, as traders began to
suspect that it might not be.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates climbed, especially on the actively traded
two-year note, after the government reported that consumer spending
was even more robust than first estimated in the second quarter and
that the job market remained taut last week. Some investors were
moved to cash in winnings.
</P>
<P>
   After setting two records earlier in the week, the Dow Jones
industrial average was on the defensive throughout the session and
finished down 127.59 points, or 1.13 percent, at 11,198.45. The
NASDAQ market, which had posted four straight gains, advanced in
the early going but slumped in the afternoon to close 30.98 points,
or 1.1 percent, lower at 2,774.62.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index did worst of the major
gauges, skidding 19.78 points, or 1.43 percent, to close at
1,362.01.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good run,'' said Andrew Brooks, senior equity
trader at T. Rowe Price. ``It shouldn't be cause for concern that
the market's given some up today.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, contended Todd Petzel, chief investment officer of the
Commonfund Group, what was surprising was the market's optimism
leading up to and immediately following the Federal Reserve move,
not that there were sober second thoughts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Technology, financial, oil, drug and airline stocks were among
the chief casualties. The paper and forest product group, which was
battered on Wednesday, was an isolated gaining sector following a
recommendation by Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Activity was relatively light at 719.01 million shares on the
New York Stock Exchange. In addition to the usual late-summer
doldrums, flooding prevented many in the New York City area from
getting to work Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an initial public offering by Bamboo.com attracted lots
of attention after underwriters marketed 4 million shares at 7. The
company, based in Palo Alto, Calif., operates an Internet service
that allows viewers of real estate to pan and zoom in on
properties. Its stock opened at 9 1/8 and leaped to 17 9/16 at the
close, with more than 24 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   This made it the fourth-most-active stock of the day after
Cisco, Dell and Microsoft, and ahead of Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 30 Dow Jones blue chips, J.P. Morgan took the biggest
toll, falling 4 3/8 to 134 7/8 in a weak bank group, as investors
appraised Ecuador's hope of restructuring debt. Citigroup fell 1
1/4 to 47 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   The next biggest drags were Hewlett-Packard, down 2 9/16 to 102
9/16, and Procter &AMP; Gamble, down 2 7/16 to 100 3/16, followed by
Chevron and Exxon, which lost 2 3/8 and 1 15/16, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Oil shares were weighed down by negative comment by an analyst
at HSBC Securities in London who switched his view of Royal Dutch
to ``reduce'' from ``add,'' helping drive the issue down 2 5/8 to
61 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, which often move opposite to oil shares, also fell
Thursday, apparently in response to cuts of as much as 30 percent
in seasonal leisure fares by United and Continental, resulting in
the second industry sale this month. Delta and American fell 3 3/16
each, U.S. Air 2 7/16 and United, Continental and Southwest more
than a point.
</P>
<P>
   Bank of New York, which is involved in a money-laundering
investigation, fell an additional 2 5/8 to 35 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks declined after five straight advances, as analysts
pointed to a rally in the dollar that tends to crimp export sales
and shrinks the value of repatriated foreign profits.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks were mostly lower, with Amazon.com losing 4 5/16
to 128 9/16 and Yahoo 5 7/8 to 152 11/16, while Priceline.com was a
conspicuous exception, jumping 7 7/16 to 72 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange 1,790 issues declined, while
1,191 advanced. New 52-week lows nearly doubled new highs, 85-43.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were narrowly mixed in major European markets but lower
by more than 1 percent in Tokyo and Sao Paulo.

`NIGHTMARE TOWN': A COLLECTION OF SUBSTANDARD HAMMETT STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct name of the Industrial Workers of the World in
graf 4.)  (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.)

<P>
   In 20 long-unavailable _ and for the most part, disappointing _
stories by Dashiell Hammett, the author's dark, unrelenting view of
society as a den of sin, inequity and corruption is hammered home
again and again. People aren't safe on the streets of Hammett's
cities, nor are they safe in their homes, where guns have a way of
going off and people end up dead or maimed or at the very least
stripped of their paltry illusions.
</P>
<P>
   There are corrupt cops, phony doctors and murderous civil
engineers in these stories. In fact, almost no one in this volume,
aside from Hammett's detective heroes, is who he seems to be:
Identity more often than not is a con for his characters, who
double- and triple-cross their colleagues with practiced
nonchalance.
</P>
<P>
   In the title story, ``Nightmare Town,'' an entire community is
part of a Prohibition-era scam to manufacture illegal booze and
cash in on an insurance racket. ``The word went around that the new
town was a place where a crook would be safe so long as he did what
he was told,'' a character explains. ``The slums of all the cities
of America, and half of 'em out of it, emptied themselves here.
Every crook that was less than a step ahead of the police, and had
car fare here, came and got cover.''
</P>
<P>
   This bleak view of society, the biographer William F. Nolan
tells us in an introduction, dates to an incident in 1917 when the
young Hammett, working as a strikebreaker against the Industrial
Workers of the World in Butte, Mont., was offered $5,000 to kill
union agitator Frank Little. ``After Hammett bitterly refused,''
Nolan writes, ``Little was lynched in a crime ascribed to
vigilantes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Hellman, Hammett's longtime companion, considered this a
turning point. She later observed, writes Nolan, that ``this must
have been, for Hammett, an abiding horror. I can date (his) belief
that he was living in a corrupt society from Little's murder.''
</P>
<P>
   In time, of course, this bleak outlook led Hammett to transform
the detective-story genre. In moving away from the genteel
tradition of the British ``puzzle mystery,'' Hammett created the
hard-boiled school of social realism _ a distinctively American
form that reflected the country's brash frontier ethos and the
author's darkly Hobbesian view. He also introduced detectives like
Sam Spade and the Continental Op, who are as tough and cynical as
their adversaries, men who ``go forward day after day through mud
and blood and death and deceit'' toward ``a dim goal, with nothing
to push or pull'' them toward it except their dogged dedication to
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Although these stories work territory that will be familiar to
readers of Hammett's novels _ seven tales feature the Continental
Op, the hero of ``The Dain Curse'' and ``Red Harvest,'' and three
feature Sam Spade, the hero of ``The Maltese Falcon'' _ they do not
provide a terribly effective showcase for Hammett's talents, his
gift for immersing the reader in a Hopper-esque world painted with
harsh lights and stark shadows, a world made palpable through his
streetwise, tough-guy prose.
</P>
<P>
   In these stories, guns are still ``rods'' or ``gats,'' women are
``pretties'' and people still say things like ``I'm a gone baby
anyhow,'' but the language too often verges on self-parody. ``He
had the sensation of being caught in a monstrous net _ a net
without beginning or end, and whose meshes were slimy with blood,''
Hammett writes in one story. And in another, a character insists
that his client must be let out of jail: ``But another day of
imprisonment _ two days, or perhaps even two hours _ and she won't
need anybody to clear her. Death will have done it!''
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the short-story form seems to inhibit Hammett, forcing
him to rely on formulaic structures and clumsy exposition. ``The
Man Who Killed Dan Odams'' is a Western with a predictable O.
Henry-esque ending: a fugitive seeks refuge in a remote shack that
turns out to belong to the widow of the man he killed. ``The
Second-Story Angel,'' which concerns a writer's encounter with a
female burglar, similarly pivots around a surprise revelation on
its final page.
</P>
<P>
   As for the detective stories, they consistently employ the same,
numbing framework: a crime or mystery is introduced (someone is
murdered, someone disappears or something is stolen); the detective
shows up, questions the various parties involved, and then comes up
with a solution or persuades one of the suspects to confess. There
is no room in these tales for philosophical asides _ like the
famous Flitcraft episode in ``The Maltese Falcon,'' which laid out
the author's vision of a precarious, random world _ and
insufficient space for Hammett to delineate his characters through
dialogue and dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed the reader need only compare the stories in this volume
with the first-draft chapters of ``The Thin Man'' included at the
volume's end to see how the novel form liberated Hammett's
storytelling gifts: ``The Thin Man'' material (which would be
revised considerably before it was published as the novel featuring
Nick Charles) is suspenseful and acutely observed; in sharp
contrast to the stories, it never feels rushed or contrived.
</P>
<P>
   Because they all suffer from compression, because they all share
a similar structure, stories as disparate as ``House Dick'' (about
three dead men found in a hotel room), ``Zigzags of Treachery''
(about a duplicitous doctor and his double), ``The Assistant
Murderer'' (about a woman who is set up as a murderer by a pair of
grifters) and ``One Hour'' (about an apparent hit-and-run accident)
all end up feeling depressingly similar. At the same time, their
explanatory endings (reminiscent of the clunky conclusion to the
Hitchcock movie ``Psycho'') suggest that terrible crimes can always
be ``solved,'' that actions all have motivations, that loose ends
can eventually be tied up. Like the more traditional English
mysteries that Hammett disdained, these stories suggest a far less
threatening, far more rational world than Hammett delivered in his
finest work.

VENEZUELAN CONGRESS MOVES TO DEFY ITS SUSPENSION BY RIVAL BODY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ Venezuela on Thursday braced for a political
showdown, as its Congress threatened to meet Friday in defiance of
a new Constitutional Assembly that effectively shut it down and as
opposition leaders accused President Hugo Chavez of manipulating
the assembly to end democratic government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is using the constitution to carry out a coup,'' said
Cesar Perez Vivas, a congressional deputy and the leader of the
center-right Copei group, one of two parties that has dominated
Venezuelan politics since a military dictatorship gave way to
democracy in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday evening, the assembly, which is dominated by Chavez
supporters, decreed a ``legislative emergency'' and passed a
measure that strips the opposition-controlled Congress of its
authority to pass laws and ordains that all of its ``ordinary and
special sessions are suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   The move came barely a week after the assembly, which was
elected in July to draft a new constitution, took similar action
against the judiciary, granting itself the authority to fire judges
and overhaul the court system.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday opposition leaders criticized the assembly's latest
action as an illegal usurpation of powers and vowed to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has maintained that the constitutional panel enjoys
unlimited powers. Earlier this month, he symbolically offered the
assembly his own resignation to demonstrate its power to dismiss or
reconfirm him.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised speech Thursday that was largely devoted to
analysis of an economic situation that has worsened considerably
since he took office in February, Chavez defended the assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Venezuela, democracy is being born,'' he said. ``Venezuela
is coming out of tyranny. The entire world should recognize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, who was elected with a sweeping majority last
December, is a former army paratrooper who was cashiered and
imprisoned in 1992 after leading an unsuccessful coup attempt in
which dozens of people died. He has vowed to carry out a peaceful
``social revolution'' in his country, which has the largest
reserves of oil outside the Middle East and is the United States'
main source of imported oil.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents accuse him of seeking to install a left-wing
military dictatorship. Among ordinary Venezuelans, however, Chavez
remains wildly popular, with an approval rating above 70 percent.
In the July 25 balloting to elect the Constitutional Assembly, 121
of 131 seats went to his supporters, including his wife, a brother,
several former military colleagues and five former members of his
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was expected that the assembly would focus
exclusively on drafting a new constitution _ the 26th in the
country's turbulent history. By law, the body is required to finish
its work within six months and then submit the document to a
popular referendum for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez has submitted a draft that would extend his term to six
years, and allow him to succeed himself in office and to promote
military officers without the Senate's approval. But the assembly
itself has spent much of its first three weeks extending its
control over existing branches of government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Popular dissatisfaction with the two dominant parties and
Congress, which have been criticized as hopelessly corrupt and
inefficient, has been mounting in recent years. After the assembly
was elected in July, Congress _ recognizing it had little support
and wishing to avoid a confrontation with the assembly _ decided to
recess until October and even offered the assembly its chamber as a
meeting place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when resistance just for the sake of
resistance makes no sense,'' Enrique Capriles, 27, a Copei deputy
who is the speaker of the lower house, said in explaining the
legislature's action. But he also contended that ``the constituted
powers retain their character until the new constitution'' goes
into effect, and warned that if the assembly tried to dissolve
Congress, ``we will react.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring that warning, the assembly on Wednesday passed the
measure limiting the legislature's work to matters such as
supervising the budget and communications. Lawmakers immediately
responded by declaring their summer recess ended, and said that
they would reconvene Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the assembly proceeded with its moves to restructure
the judiciary. Nearly half of Venezuela's 4,700 judges, clerks and
bailiffs are estimated to be facing accusations of corruption, and
the assembly has vowed to resolve those cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitutional Assembly has absolute powers,'' said Manuel
Quijada, a lawyer whom the assembly has placed in charge of a
special commission to revamp the courts. ``The objective is that
the substitution of judges take place peacefully, but if the courts
refuse to acknowledge the assembly's authority, we will proceed in
a different fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Supreme Court ruled, by an 8-6 vote, that the
assembly did not act unconstitutionally in assuming judicial
powers.
</P>
<P>
   That led Chief Justice Cecilia Sosa Gomez to resign Tuesday,
lamenting the disintegration of what she called ``the last control
on constitutionality and legality that existed in Venezuela'' and
accusing her fellow judges and Congress of caving in to political
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court simply committed suicide to avoid being
assassinated,'' she said in a nationally televised news conference.
``The the result is the same: it is dead.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In an interview published Thursday in the Spanish newspaper El
Pais, Carlos Andres Perez, the former president whose overthrow
Chavez sought in 1992, predicted that Chavez would himself fall
from power before his first term expires. Saying that ``the
concentration of powers is anti-democratic,'' he accused Chavez of
seeking ``a military government that will totally wipe out the
triumphs of the Venezuelan people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not one to encourage coups or violent attitudes, but it
is clear what is going to happen,'' said Perez, who ran for a seat
in the assembly from his home state of Tachira but suffered a
humiliating defeat. ``I think the upheaval we are in will last two
years, and afterward Venezuela will begin to get back on its feet,
but without Chavez at its head.''

   VICTORIA, British Columbia _ Inside the hilltop mansion of the
Queen's representative here, portraits of the royal family and
gleaming gold maple leafs lent a traditional air as Dan Miller was
sworn in Wednesday as the new premier of Canada's Pacific province.
</P>
<P>
   But even the neo-Westminister pomp and circumstance, the crystal
chandeliers and gilded mirrors failed to distract from the
political instability that makes this capital seem less like London
and more like La Paz, Bolivia. Only days ago, Miller himself, a
stoop-shouldered, sad-faced man, acidly described the premier post
as the most dangerous job in the province.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Glen Clark, resigned last week, the province's
third premier in a row to resign under a cloud of scandal. It has
been 20 years since voters here elected a premier who served out
his term. The new premier, Clark's former deputy, now vows to step
down as soon as his party, the New Democrats, chooses a successor _
the province's sixth premier in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been crazy,'' the reluctant premier said after the
ceremony, referring to the take-no-prisoners political culture that
has taken root in Canada's third most populous province. ``The
biggest advantage that I have in this job is that I don't really
want it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Canada's other nine provinces, politics are no more unstable
than in American states. But, to the rest of Canada, this
province's instability is endemic to what they call ``Lotusland'' _
a final frontier peopled by dreamers who have cut ties of family,
home and religion and drifted to the nation's left coast.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In a veiled reference to strong green tendencies here, The
National Post snickered this week from Toronto: ``Perhaps the
Sierra Club should declare the scandal-free B.C. premier an
endangered species.''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail recalled that in 1872 the province's premier
of the day legally changed his name to ``Amor de Cosmos,'' or lover
of the universe. Clark, the newspaper suggested, should change his
name to ``Amor de Chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, for residents here, provincial politicians keep
living up to the wacky stereotype. Voters wince when they recall
the evening when television cameras in the stately Victorian-era
parliament building here caught a female finance minister placing a
windup dancing penis doll on the desk of a male political
adversary. Or when the local head of the Liberal Party had an
extramarital affair with the leader of his parliamentary
delegation, explaining that they had ``identical brains.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just shake our heads; we don't know why such a different
type of people go into politics here,'' said Jaqueline Darmanin, a
piano teacher who is a transplant from Alberta, the conservative,
oil-and-gas province separated from British Columbia by the
mountains of the Continental Divide. ``In Alberta, you just don't
have the scandals, the backstabbing. There is nothing like the
spectacles you have here.''
</P>
<P>
   For many voters, the latest political scandal will long be
symbolized by a grainy television video taken one night last March.
Clark can be seen pacing inside his living room as detectives from
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police searched his home for documents
linking him to the granting of a casino license to an old
neighborhood friend, Dimitrios Pilarinos.
</P>
<P>
   According to police documents supporting the request for the
search warrant, the casino applicant made free ``renovations'' on
Clark's house and vacation cottage. The city assessor's office
later placed a $16,000 value on these renovations, twor
decks.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's lawyers dispute the value of the decks and say that he
gave Pilarinos a $5,000 check. After Pilarinos tore up the check,
the lawyers say, Clark gave his friend an Indian hunting knife.
</P>
<P>
   Clark might have survived this ambiguous case, if pollsters did
not rank him, after only three years in office, the most unpopular
premier in Canada. In June, only 16 percent of respondents to a
survey by the Angus Reid polling organization said they would vote
for him, and 80 percent said they disapproved of his government.

<P>
   To some political observers, Clark was only the latest British
Columbia politician to rise and fall on populist rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A former provincial finance minister, Clark campaigned in the
May 1996, saying that the provincial budget was balanced. One month
after winning the election, he admitted that there was actually a
$140 million deficit. This year, the deficit has ballooned to
almost $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   Enamored of megaprojects, Clark unveiled a plan to revive
shipbuilding here by building fast ferryboats, vowing that he had
crunched the numbers ``right down to the toilet paper.'' To date,
only one of these aluminium hulled boats has been built, coming in
at $140 million over budget. This year, when he proposed a
half-billion dollar expansion to Vancouver's convention center,
some voters were calling their 42-year-old premier ``Glennochhio.''
</P>
<P>
   Saddled with the highest unemployment west of Quebec, Clark
blamed the province's woes on the economic implosion in Asia, a
region that receives one third of British Columbia's exports.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to drum up popular support, Clark played two cards
that usually are crowd-pleasers in the Canadian West _
Ottawa-bashing and Washington-bashing. Vowing to be ``tough with
the Americans,'' he tried to force Washington to cut U.S. catches
of Pacific salmon by refusing to renew a longstanding lease for a
Canadian-U.S. underwater missile testing range near here.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government in Ottawa responded by cutting him out of
negotiations on a salmon treaty, which was finished in early June.
At the same time, Ottawa dusted off a century-old, never-used
expropriation law and moved to seize from the province the seabed
area where the United States had invested $100 million for torpedo
testing.

<P>
   Others blame the harsh political language, which American
tourists to this superficially genteel provincial capital rarely
hear. Trading parting shots over the weekend, Clark called Gordon
Campbell, a frontrunner in polls for a provincial election next
year, ``the scariest guy around.'' In return, Campbell, a Liberal,
said, ``I think Glen Clark is going to go down in our province's
history at the probably worst premier we've had.''

park called Fantasy Gardens?'' he asked, referring to Bill Vander
Zalm, a premier here until 1991, who lived in a replica Dutch
castle left over from Vancouver's 1986 world fair.
</P>
<P>
   Still, undeclared candidates can be seen lining up for the race.

<P>
   Immediately after the oath taking ceremony at government House
here, the best attended press conference was given by Gordon
Wilson, provincial minister, amateur playwright and author of the
``identical brains'' remark.
</P>
<P>
   In opinion polls, the leading New Democrat is Ujjal Dosanjh, the
province's India-born attorney general. He was nearly beaten to
death here in 1985 by a Sikh radical wielding a steel bar. In
interview Wednesday, Dosanjh complained that local politics is no
longer a battle of ideals or ideas, concluding, ``Politics in B.C.
has become a blood sport.''

CHANDRA MAKES DISCOVERY WITH FIRST IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The new orbiting Chandra X-ray telescope has
not only lived up to the expectations astronomers had built up for
it during two decades of planning, NASA and Harvard-Smithsonian
scientists reported Thursday, but it accomplished something beyond
what anyone expected: In its very first observation, it may have
already made an important new discovery.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, after preliminary testing and adjustment since
its launch by the space shuttle on July 23, Chandra pointed its
large high-precision mirrors at an object called Cassiopeia A _ a
shell of debris hurled outward by a star that exploded about 300
years ago. Immediately, the most powerful X-ray telescope ever
built was able to produce a dazzling image that revealed wispy
details never seen in earlier pictures.
</P>
<P>
   That part was expected, since the new telescope was designed to
produce pictures with at least 10 times more detail than any
previous X-ray telescope. ``That's just a beautiful sight,'' said
astronomer Harvey Tananbaum, director of the Chandra X-ray Center
where the new space observatory is controlled and its observations
are received and processed.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a startling detail that the astronomers hadn't
counted on: There, at the very center of the ring of expanding gas
and debris, was a perfect little bright point. Although astronomers
knew that a remnant of the original exploding star must be there _
most likely in the form of a neutron star, an incredibly
concentrated form of matter _ nobody had ever been able to see any
sign of it with any kind of telescope before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we may have found the neutron star that was formed at
the moment of collapse'' 300 years ago, Tananbaum said. Seeing this
``long-sought, never-before seen'' remnant of the original star
``was a real bonus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Making such a significant find on the new telescope's very first
scientific observation was ``like an infant opening its eyes for
the first time and discovering a new planet,'' said Robert
Kirshner, a Harvard University astronomer and supernova specialist
who was not directly involved in the Chandra project. ``I have a
great deal of joy in seeing these images,'' he said, calling it ``a
great day for all astronomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Weisskopf, the project scientist for Chandra, said that
when the Cassiopeia A image first appeared at the control center,
``I was just astounded. It was something like I imagine Mark
McGuire felt after he hit his 70th home run.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery represents the ``first glimpse of the kinds of
things Chandra is going to be able to see,'' Tananbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only surprise the 45-foot-long, $2.7 billion
telescope had to offer. One early test observation used to adjust
the telescope was a quasar that astronomers expected to be a
``point source'' _ a starlike image with no features.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the image revealed unexpected detail, including what
appears to be a jet of matter being ejected from the quasar's
center. While such jets are not unusual from quasars, nobody had
expected to see one in this X-ray image, and astronomers cannot yet
explain what makes this jet glow as it does.
</P>
<P>
   As Kirshner explained, the things an X-ray telescope ``sees''
are very different from medical X-rays, where X-rays are used to
produce shadows of bones on a piece of film. X-ray telescopes, by
contrast, collect X-rays that are naturally emitted by extremely
hot objects _ in some cases many millions of degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the launching of the Chandra telescope has opened ``a
unique window on the hottest and most violent parts of the
universe,'' Kirshner said.
</P>
<P>
   And such hot, violent objects are crucially important to our
understanding of the universe, he said. Supernova explosions such
as Cassiopeia A, he explained, show us the source of ``what we are
made of. The calcium in your bones was made in a supernova
explosion.'' In fact, most of the chemical elements in the universe
originated inside supernova explosions, which scattered them
through space where they could form clumps and eventually become
new stars, beginning the cycle once again.
</P>
<P>
   And Cassiopeia A is not just any supernova: At just 10,000
light-years away and 300 years old, it is the ``nearest, youngest
and most interesting example of this kind of phenomenon,'' said
Kirshner.
</P>
<P>
   The astronomers are excited about the quick successes of the
long-awaited observatory, and eager to get on with the next round
of observations, which will include examples of almost every kind
of object known in the heavens. Already, astronomers have proposed
more than six times as many observations as the telescope could
accommodate in its first year, and managers expect to face even
more proposals in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope project was designed and is being managed for the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration by scientists at the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge. It is the first
major satellite to be controlled here.
</P>
<P>
   Although funded for a five-year lifetime, the telescope is
expected to keep working much longer than that, perhaps as long as
a few decades. Weisskopf said he expects that he and his colleagues
will ``wheel out in wheelchairs in about 20 years, and we'll talk
about the latest images.''

`A DOG OF FLANDERS' IS A PASSABLE ENOUGH BABY SITTER FOR FAMILY
AUDIENCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' campaign in the '90s to remake some of Hollywood's
greatest family movie classics has had some notable successes,
including a 1993 retooling of ``The Secret Garden'' and a 1994
version of ``Black Beauty'' that were arguably better than the
originals.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the studio's latest effort in this department _ a
remake of the oft-filmed novel ``A Dog of Flanders'' _ doesn't
quite measure up to that high standard. It's full of good
intentions and high production values, but it fails to be as
charming or magical as it sets out to be.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an 1872 novel by British-French novelist Ouida, it's
the story of Nello, a boy orphaned at birth and raised in a small
village in Flanders (the Dutch-speaking part of Belgium) by his
kindly grandfather (Jack Warden).
</P>
<P>
   The title refers to a large Bouvier dog that Nello rescues after
it's been beaten nearly to death by its abusive master. The dog
becomes his best friend, and is threatened here and there in the
film, but is actually somewhat incidental to the plot.
</P>
<P>
   More properly, the story is about Nello's ambition to become a
great artist (like his hero, Peter Paul Reubens), his changing
relationship with the family of his childhood sweetheart, and the
torment he suffers at the hands of his evil landlord.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reliable story that's more or less worked in four
Hollywood versions: in 1914, 1924, 1935 and 1959 (with the dog-star
of Disney's ``Old Yeller''). It was also a 1976 German miniseries
and an animated Japanese feature.
</P>
<P>
   As produced by one-time mega-mogul Frank Yablans, this version
is the most lavish of all, with authentic Flanders locations and a
name cast that includes Warden, Jon Voight and Cheryl Ladd (whose
former husband, David Ladd, starred in the '59 version).
</P>
<P>
   The two child stars who play Nello (Jesse James in the early
scenes, Jeremy James Kissner as an older boy) are also engaging and
sympathetic. Overall, the film makes a passable enough baby sitter
for family audiences starved for anything close to wholesome
entertainment this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, somehow, the elements do not add up to be anything
especially memorable. Writer-director Kevin Brodie gets off on the
wrong foot with an inappropriate '90s pop song over the titles, and
is never able to make the film as emotionally gripping or
melodramatically effective as it needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   A Dog of Flanders. Directed by Kevin Brodie. Screenplay by Kevin
Brodie and Robert Singer. Cast: Jack Warden, Jeremy James Kissner,
Jon Voight, Jesse James, Cheryl Ladd. Warner Bros. 100 minutes.
Rated PG for one sexual reference and scenes of cruelty to dogs and
children.

`GENE EXPRESSION CHIP' REVEALS GENETIC PATTERN IN AGING OF MICE 
</HEADLINE>
 675&AMP;ADD- NYT   (bl)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists have gained a deep insight into the nature of aging
by means of a new device known as a gene expression chip. The chip
has shown both that a specific pattern of genetic changes occurs in
aging, and that these changes can be largely prevented by caloric
restriction: putting mice on a diet with only 75 percent of normal
calories.
</P>
<P>
   The research supports the longstanding idea that a
semi-starvation diet prolongs life in mice, and maybe people, but
its wider significance is that the chip offers for the first time a
way to measure aging at the cellular level. Similar chips should
help to test whether present anti-aging remedies do any good and to
screen for better drugs, including perhaps ones that might give the
same effect as low calorie diets but without the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we understood how caloric restriction works we might be
able someday to elicit its benefits without having to undergo the
dietary restriction, so in that sense this is a very important
study,'' said Dr. Leonard Guarente, an expert on aging at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, reported in Friday's issue of Science, builds
on the view held by many biologists that aging is not an inexorable
process but rather the outcome of a genetic program that could be
manipulated. It also gives comfort those who argue that a
manageably small number of genes are involved.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by Dr. Richard Weindruch, Dr. Tomas Prolla and
colleagues at the University of Wisconsin, depends on injecting
mouse muscle samples into a special chip, about the size of a
business card but roughly a 1/4 of an inch thick. Made by
Affymetrix of Santa Clara, Calif., the chip was was programmed to
recognize the activity of some 6,000 mouse genes. Mice probably
have about 100,000 different genes, and the 6,000 were those whose
DNA sequence had already been decoded and filed in public data
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch is known for his studies of caloric restriction in
mice and he has in progress a long term study with rhesus monkeys
to see if their life span can be extended by a low calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, Weindruch and Prolla looked first at the
muscles of elderly mice fed a normal mouse diet and then at mice of
the same age who had been on a diet restricted in calories. They
examined the animals' calf muscles because muscle, along with brain
and heart, is one of the tissues not renewed during life and often
are the first to show signs of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Providing the first broad snapshot of how gene activity changes
in the aging cell, the Affymetrix chip shows that in elderly mice
fed a normal diet, most of the cell's genes continue as usual. But
1 percent of the genes _ those involved in responding to stress and
to nerve damage _ become very much more active. Another 1 percent,
genes involved in generating energy from glucose, become very much
less active.
</P>
<P>
   In elderly mice of the same age fed a diet restricted in
calories, the researchers report, most of these changes were
prevented, giving the cells a profile similar to those of much
younger cells. But cells from the mice on restricted diets had
their own pattern of changes, notably decreased activity by genes
that repair damaged DNA and proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch and Prolla believe most of these changes can be
explained in terms of the chemical damage caused by glucose
metabolism. The process of combining glucose with oxygen creates
harmful chemicals known as free radicals that damage many
structures in the cell, particularly the energy-generating units
known as mitochondria.
</P>
<P>
   The gene expression chip, they believe, will allow them to
pinpoint the genetic changes that underlie aging in human tissues.
``The technique allows us to measure the aging process at the
molecular level. Now for the first time we have molecular
biomarkers of aging,'' Prolla said, referring to the characteristic
patterns of gene expression revealed by the Affymetrix chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our goal to test a patient's biological age from a drop
of blood,'' Weindruch said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Affymetrix has already produced chips programmed to detect the
activity of human genes. The Wisconsin researchers also hope to
apply the human chip to their monkey study. It would otherwise take
another 20 years to see if the monkeys were in fact living longer
on their restricted calorie diet. But by testing whether caloric
restriction is preventing the cellular changes typical of aging,
the biologists may arrive at the answer much sooner. Monkey genes
are sufficiently similar to human genes that the human chip will
provide meaningful answers, they hope.
</P>
<P>
   Although the technology of making the chips belongs to
Affymetrix, the Wisconsin researchers have applied for patents on
using the pattern of gene activity levels as a measure of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Austad, an expert on aging at the University of
Oregon, said their work was ``fascinating as a new way to approach
aging'' but cautioned they had so far looked at a single tissue in
one strain of laboratory mice.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have recently made progress in understanding
the cellular mechanism that limits the number of times a cell can
divide. The limiting mechanism, known as the telomere system, may
affect the durability of tissues that are constantly renewed
throughout life, like skin, white blood cells and intestinal lining
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists do not yet know which kind of tissue _ the
nonrenewable ones like the muscle studied by the Wisconsin
researchers or the renewable ones governed by the telomere system _
is the first to break down in natural aging. Guarente said he
believed that serious intervention would be needed in both cases to
affect life span as a whole. ``You would need not one magic bullet
but a series of magic bullets,'' he speculated.
</P>
<P>
   In animals like the laboratory roundworm, a single ``magic
bullet'' _ the alteration of particular genes _ has been found to
make the worms live up to six times as long as usual. Unlike
people, the worms consist wholly of nonrenewable tissues. Most of
the longevity-promoting genes in the worm seem to be involved in
the energy-producing activities controlled by insulin, or at least
the worm's counterpart of this ancient hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Prolla and Weindruch say caloric restriction also seems to work
through effects on the energy-production systems controlled by
insulin. ``Our data fit with the current view that the
insulin-signaling pathway plays a major role in aging,'' Prolla
said.

PENNSYLVANIA THRIFT FAVORED IN SALE OF FLEET BRANCHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Fleet Financial Group Inc., seeking to appease
regulators who have the power to approve its proposed merger with
BankBoston Corp., has agreed to sell about 270 branches to
Sovereign Bancorp as a first step in a complex agreement that
includes branch sales to community banks, banking sources confirmed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's selection of a winning bidder is as significant a
milestone, in Boston's financial world, as was the announcement of
the Fleet-BankBoston merger itself.
</P>
<P>
   If Sovereign acquires Fleet's divested branches _ about $11
billion in deposits _ the thrift based in Wyomissing, Pa., an
hour's drive north of Philadelphia, would be the second-biggest
lender in the region. The addition of Fleet's branches would boost
Sovereign's assets to $37 billion _ about one-quarter the size of
the combined Fleet-BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet announced in March its merger with its biggest crosstown
rival, BankBoston, setting off alarms about a competitive vacuum
that would result from merging Boston's two biggest banking
companies into a single, $160 billion institution that would dwarf
all other players in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of the deal, the US Department of Justice
required that Fleet sell some branches to preserve competition. The
divestiture is the largest in US banking history.
</P>
<P>
   Banking analysts were lukewarm on the deal Thursday, and
questioned whether Sovereign has the financial heft to compete with
such a dominant institution as Fleet-BankBoston. On the other hand,
analysts said, Sovereign has a good reputation for its lending to
mid-sized business and its community lending programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area will be adequately served by Sovereign, and it'll be
another competitive force against Fleet-BankBoston,'' said Gerard
Cassidy, banking analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded on one side by regulators who can veto any deal they
deem unacceptable and by politicians concerned about lending in
small communities, Fleet is hammering out the final details of a
package of deals to sell branches to both Sovereign and a slew of
community banks throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   If agreements are reached that satisfy the small banks _ while
preserving the central deal with Sovereign _ Fleet will present the
package to the the Justice Department for approval. The Justice
Department's primary concern is to ensure competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, which is concerned with the financial
soundness of a merger, must also approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's spokesman, James Mahoney, declined to comment on the
agreement reached early this week between his company and
Sovereign.
</P>
<P>
   Mahoney said an announcement on Fleet's sale of branches is
expected ``as early as next week.'' However, he said, ``The process
is ongoing and a final plan is not in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McCollom, Sovereign's head of corporate development,
declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet in the past disclosed that it would sell about 292
branches scattered throughout four states, including Massachusetts
where 196 of them are located. But banking sources said Thursday it
may sell as many as 300 to meet the needs of both Sovereign and
community banks bidding on the deal. Branches are also being sold
in Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   If Sovereign buys about 270 branches, as expected _ a final
number has not yet been determined _ that would leave at least 30
for community banks, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the deal said the final phase of
negotiations has become complex because Fleet must sort, branch by
branch, through its divested assets and reach separate agreements
with numerous small banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horse trading. That's what's going on now,'' the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   For small community banks, the Fleet sale is a rare opportunity
to flesh out local franchises. For example, Eastern Bank in Lynn is
bidding on branches that would strengthen its presence on the South
Shore, where it has acquired Quincy-based Hibernia Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most prominent small to mid-sized banks named in the
bidding are Boston Bank of Commerce, Enterprise Bank and Trust Co.
in Lowell, and Cape Cod Bank and Trust Co. in South Yarmouth. A
consortium of nine Massachusetts banks, which includes Plymouth
Savings Bank, is also in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still negotiating purchase agreements as part of our
bid and haven't been notified of anything,'' said Thomas Olsen,
chief executive of Plymouth Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Sovereign, if its deal is approved, would win out over a number
of substantial bidders for the biggest block of assets, including
London-based HSBC Holdings, Detroit-based Comerica, and
Cleveland-based Charter One Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor mill was rife with speculation that the battle isn't
over yet: Citizens Financial Group, currently the state's
third-largest bank, is still being mentioned as a late-hour buyer
for the branches.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction in the financial community to Sovereign's tentative
agreement to buy Fleet's branches was puzzlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financially this is virtually an impossible transaction,''
said Larry Cohn, a bank analyst with Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. in
Livingston, N.J., noting that the deal would expand Sovereign's
size by 50 percent in one sweep and require the mid-sized thrift to
raise about $2 billion in capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be betting the bank. The whole thing just doesn't
make sense,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also questioned whether Sovereign, as a thrift, could
compete forcefully and immediately with a combined
Fleet-BankBoston, which would be formidable competition in
commercial lending.
</P>
<P>
   Thrifts typically are focused on retail and small business
lending, though Sovereign in recent years has tried to transform
itself into a competitor in the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody knows Sovereign is a thrift _ and that's a big
thing. Thrifts think differently than banks,'' Cassidy said.

NORTHWEST AIRLINE RISES ABOVE STRIKE, BAD PUBLICITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LAURA GOLDBERG 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Been down so long, there's nowhere to go but up.
</P>
<P>
   Could be a line from a blues tune, but it's also the story of
Northwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Northwest was on the brink of a pilots strike that
would last 15 days, shut the airline down and cost it more than $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Management-labor tensions weren't limited to the pilots as
slowdowns and disruptions by other employees also plagued the
carrier in the months leading up to the strike.
</P>
<P>
   And in January, bad publicity buried Northwest, after passengers
at its Detroit hub were trapped for hours on grounded planes during
a snowstorm. Some sat for eight or more hours as food and water ran
out, and toilets stopped working.
</P>
<P>
   ``You reach a point where you can only do better,'' PaineWebber
airline analyst Sam Buttrick said of Northwest. ``You couldn't do
worse than they did last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The current snapshot of Northwest, which has a partnership with
and a controlling ownership stake in Houston-based Continental
Airlines, is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operationally, the airline is running well,'' said Richard
Anderson, Northwest's chief operating officer and an executive vice
president. ``Our passengers are coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Key indicators of airline performance, collected by federal
regulators, are up. Passenger traffic is increasing faster than new
seats are being added.
</P>
<P>
   And the Eagan, Minn.-based airline made money during the second
quarter for the first time since the strike. After a money-losing
1998, it expects to be profitable for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The labor situation appears calm, at least for the moment. In
February, the Machinists union signed contracts covering about
18,000 employees, including customer service and reservation sales
agents, clerical workers and others.
</P>
<P>
   Ballots cast by flight attendants will be tallied Friday, and a
thumbs up or thumbs down given to a tentative five-year deal hashed
out by union and company negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   With some flight attendants exhorting colleagues to vote no, the
result is expected to be close whichever way it goes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the contract is rejected, it's unlikely a strike could
happen this year as the National Mediation Board must give the
union permission for a job action.
</P>
<P>
   But all is not well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better, but still a ways to go,'' John Pincavage, an airline
analyst with Warburg Dillon Read, said of Northwest's current
performance.
</P>
<P>
   The airline still has a public image problem, which analysts say
makes some travelers reluctant to fly it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has a poor public image.'' said Buttrick of
PaineWebber. ``They're not well liked by their customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Northwest said it's working to restore travelers' confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customer-servicewise we're regaining credibility, and we have
a ways to go,'' said Anderson, who was elevated to his current job
in December.
</P>
<P>
   One way to succeed, Northwest said, is to post a consistently
good showing in the U.S. Department of Transportation's monthly
report that tracks several performance indicators, including
on-time rates, mishandled bags and consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The August report, which details results for June, shows
Northwest ranked second among the top 10 U.S. carriers in on-time
performance, with 75.1 percent of domestic flights arriving on
time. A year before, it ranked 10th with a 58.7 percent on-time
record.
</P>
<P>
   For the second quarter of 1999, it ranked first at 79.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also:
</P>
<P>
   _ Northwest came in fourth for mishandled bag reports in June,
with 4.48 per 1,000 passengers on domestic flights. For June 1998,
it ranked ninth, with 8.36 per 1,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   _ In consumer complaints for domestic and international flights,
Northwest was fifth, with 1.97 per 100,000 passengers in June. But
that's still an improvement from its 10th spot in June 1998, with
2.34 complaints per 100,000 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson detailed other steps Northwest is taking to improve its
performance and image. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ A new terminal is under construction at its Detroit hub.
</P>
<P>
   _ The carrier has boosted customer service training for
front-line employees, including gate agents and ground handlers.
Agents were granted the authority and flexibility to solve problems
on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   _ This fall it will unveil a revamped first-class cabin
offering, including new food and service standards. At the same
time, food for coach passengers is to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   _ The carrier bought air conditioning carts for its hub cities
so planes will be cool when passengers board.
</P>
<P>
   _ Northwest has refurbished the interiors of its DC-9s, which
account for 172 of its 419 planes, and will do the same for other
jets. It's also updating its fleet, now the oldest among domestic
carriers. Starting this year, deliveries of new planes will average
about one every three weeks over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The carrier, with its Tokyo hub, is also starting to see a small
uptick in its Pacific traffic, which has been hampered by the
region's troubled economies.
</P>
<P>
   At the airline's Minneapolis hub, passenger opinions ran the
gamut. Some praised the carrier, while others blasted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' is how frequent flier Dan Yates described the
airline's service. ``That's why I fly Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Iowa resident has logged 575,000 miles on Northwest in less
than 10 years. His bags have never been lost and he's had no
problems with delays.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Anderson, a Minnesota grocery sales broker-manager, said he
flies Northwest about 25 weeks of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Although he believes the service is ``pretty decent,'' he wants
more competition for Northwest, as he's seen fares go up.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Slominski, a suburban Detroit resident and a U.S. Army
engineer, finds the carrier's baggage claim slow and said the
employees aren't very friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very good qualitywise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Slominski, who flies Northwest about twice monthly, said the
nickname some have tagged the airline with fits. That is
``Northworst.''
</P>
<P>
   At Continental, officials last year said they were concerned
about putting passengers on Northwest because of ``discrepancies''
in service levels between the two. They are noting the changes at
Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Northwest has really been focused on improving their
product,'' said Greg Brenneman, Continental's president and chief
operating officer. ``You can see it in their on-time numbers and
bag numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The carriers feed each other passengers as part of the
Northwest-Continental alliance. Some travelers fly part of the way
on each airline to reach their destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've gotten better and better from a service perspective,''
Brenneman said.
</P>
<P>
   At least part of Northwest's improvement is a reflection of its
labor relations.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Steve Zoller, chairman of the master executive council of
the Northwest local of the Air Line Pilots Association, said the
vast majority of pilots have put the strike behind them.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot-company relationship has improved greatly since the
job action, he said, and contract implementation has gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're married to this company,'' he said. ``We want to see it
do well.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of improved relations, Douglas Steenland, general
counsel at Northwest, pointed out that the company and the union
were able to quickly negotiate pay rates for a new Airbus model
that was added to the fleet.
</P>
<P>
   But flight attendants, who sat down at the bargaining table with
Northwest at the end of 1996, see it differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of anger and resentment toward Northwest
management,'' said Billie Davenport, president and principal
officer of the Teamsters union local that represents more than
10,000 flight attendants at Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Morale is suffering and flight attendants believe the company
doesn't respect them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But company spokesman Jon Austin replied: ``We respect our
flight attendants for their professional, caring attitude and
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is optimistic the pending contract deal will be
approved, but said it will be close. She believes the package is
the best the union could have achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would grant raises upon the signing of the contract of
6 to 24 percent, depending on years of service with Northwest.
Raises of almost 12 percent by the contract's end would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who voted against the contract was Danny Campbell,
secretary-treasurer of the union.
</P>
<P>
   A retirement plan that isn't livable and too many concessions to
the company concerning work rules are among the problems he sees.
</P>
<P>
   The company still has another labor group to contend with. Its
more than 9,000 mechanics recently left one union to join another.
Negotiations are likely to start this fall.

 &HT;    Martin acquitted of money-laundering charges
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Final score in the government's first money-laundering
case against a prominent pro athlete: Miami Dolphins 1, United
States 0.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury acquitted Dolphins receiver Tony Martin of all
six counts of helping a drug dealer hide dirty money Thursday after
a trial of nearly four weeks and 17 hours of deliberation.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 33, faced at least three years in prison if convicted.
At his age, prison meant the almost certain end of his career and a
$14.2 million, four-year contract with the Dolphins, who hope he
can help them reach the Super Bowl this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all or nothing,'' Martin said. ``My whole career was
flashing before my eyes ... It's a lot of weight off my
shoulders.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an embarrassing, high-profile defeat for federal
prosecutors, but not a total loss. The jury convicted co-defendant
Rickey Brownlee on six of 11 charges relating to conspiracy and
dealing cocaine and heroin. Convicted twice before on drug charges,
Brownlee faces up to life in prison. Sentencing was set for Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors did not believe the government proved Martin knew he was
laundering drug money when he agreed to write, in exchange for
cash, more than $200,000 in checks for cars and attorney fees for
Brownlee, a longtime family friend. Martin, who calls Brownlee
uncle, wrote the checks from 1994 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was used,'' juror Guillermo Gomez said afterward about
Martin.``He acted in good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury made a clear distinction between Brownlee, a
twice-convicted drug dealer, and Martin, whose lawyers said he has
never tested positive for drugs in a 10-year NFL career with Miami,
San Diego and last year's Super Bowl-contending Atlanta Falcons.
Martin has no criminal record in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference,'' Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez denied that the appearance of Dolphins quarterback Dan
Marino as a character witness changed anyone's thinking, but Martin
made a point of thanking Marino for supporting him.
</P>
<P>
   Martin also thanked coach Jimmy Johnson for sitting behind him
in the courtroom during the early stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy Johnson still believed in me and gave me a chance,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson received news of the verdict with pleasure and relief at
Dolphins camp in Davie.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was sitting on that little bench and I sat next to his
mother and father, the only thought that went through my mind was
this guy does not belong in jail,'' Johnson said. ``Forget about
football, forget about catching passes, he did not belong in jail
and I am glad to see him acquitted.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellow receiver O.J. McDuffie, who also appeared in court to
support Martin, said he was impressed by Martin's confidence that
the legal system would work in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt in his mind he would go free,'' McDuffie
said. ``I was more worried than he was.''
</P>
<P>
   When the verdict was announced, Martin's father Hal shouted,
``Praise God!''
</P>
<P>
   Martin hugged attorney Howard Srebnick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're grateful the jurors listened to the evidence, not the
hearsay,'' Srebnick said.
</P>
<P>
   The government wins more than 90 percent of money-laundering
cases that go to trial, but this time its case proved thin on
demonstrating Martin's criminal knowledge and intent and involved a
defendant who could afford good lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were disappointed in the Martin verdict,'' said First
Assistant U.S. Attorney Guy Lewis. ``We believed there was
sufficient evidence to convict Mr. Martin. It was a tough case,
regardless of the circumstances, the celebrity status and the
nature of the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired IRS agent and money-laundering expert Michael McDonald
said he suspected the government made the indictment to get Martin
to cut a deal and testify against Brownlee. McDonald claimed no
inside knowledge, but speculated when Martin refused, they had no
choice but to play out a relatively weak case in court.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors declined to say whether they had offered a plea deal
to Martin, and Srebnick said only that such offers are ``always
made.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's mother Sarah said there was never any doubt in her mind
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was innocent,'' she said. ``There was no way were going to
accept a plea bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the only questions that linger are not legal but moral
ones: Shouldn't Martin, a public figure and role model, have been
smarter than to associate with a drug dealer so powerful he was
known as ``the mayor of Opa-locka''?
</P>
<P>
   Martin said he had learned from the episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned to be more strict on myself, and trust my family
more,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Many hearing him assumed Martin meant he would not be so
trusting next time toward someone like Brownlee. But more likely he
was referring to financial advisers who oversaw Martin's plunge
into bankruptcy, because he remained loyal to Brownlee even after
the verdicts were read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I love him and good luck and I'm still there for
him,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether that is admirable loyalty to a troubled family
friend _ or just bad judgment _ the jury is still out.

COMMENTARY: WHOSE WEB SITE IS THIS?

   TAIPEI, Taiwan _ You just knew something like this would happen.
China, unable so far to occupy Taiwan on land, has done it in
cyberspace. The Internet address Taiwan.com was recently claimed
and registered by China.com, an Internet portal that is partially
owned by China's state-run Xinhua news agency. According to The
Asian Wall Street Journal, several hundred Taiwanese professors and
lawmakers have petitioned the Taiwan government to reclaim the
Taiwan.com domain name by taking the Nasdaq-traded China.com to
court in the United States for misrepresentation.
</P>
<P>
   One country, two Web sites. Not good.
</P>
<P>
   This cyberdrama, though, is a perfect illustration of how
all-consuming is the identity struggle between China and Taiwan _ a
struggle that has made both states crazy. On one side, it has
blinded the Taiwanese to their own strength. This remarkable
country so clearly has the winds of history at its back. At a time
when China is facing the huge task of modernizing a nation of 1.2
billion people, and could implode under the strain, Taiwan has
already arrived. It has Asia's most dynamic economy. It is Silicon
Valley's most feared competitor. And it is a thriving free-market
democracy. As long as it can avoid provoking a war with China,
Taiwan has everything going for it. But tell that to people here
and all they will tell you is that China just beat them out of
diplomatic relations with Tonga!
</P>
<P>
   But if Taiwan can't see its strength, China can't see its
weakness. China is so caught up in the principle that Taiwan is its
renegade province that it has completely forgotten that Beijing has
to court the Taiwanese people if it wants to win them back by
anything other than force.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing needs to try a strategy on Taiwan that it's never really
tried before: a charm offensive. I know it's unlikely, but charming
Taiwan would surely get Beijing a lot more than its present
overture, which is: ``Marry me or die.'' That is, without a doubt,
history's worst pickup line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they talk to us about unification is like a
traditional Chinese arranged marriage,'' said Antonio Chiang,
publisher of The Taipei Times. ``The father just tells the
daughter, `You will marry your cousin.' There is no love, no
dating, no coffee. Look, we're a free country here. If people were
attracted to China, there is no way the government could stop it.
But they have not made their system attractive to us.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Chinese idea of a charm offensive is to suggest
that the recent declaration by Taiwan's president, Lee Teng-hui,
that Taiwan and China should deal with each other as two separate
``states'' is a formulation that only Lee believes in _ not the
Taiwanese people. The fact is, Lee was following the public mood
here, not leading it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the average Taiwanese has negative feelings toward
China,'' said Bikhim Hsiao, 28, a pro-independence activist. ``The
word China means threats and squeezing Taiwan's international
space. If the mainland wants us to unify with them, they should
tell us the benefits. Look what the latest fad is here _ it's a
Japanese doll called `Hello Kitty' that McDonald's uses as a
promotion. People stand in line all night at McDonald's to get
them. A Japanese doll! The Japanese colonized us for 50 years, but
Japan has a more favorable image here today than China.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the history, any overture by Beijing would be greeted here
with suspicion. But if China were to speak about coming together
with Taiwan in some sort of loose commonwealth, before unification,
or if China were to let Taiwan have an observer seat at something
as utterly innocuous as the annual World Health Assembly, it would
have a big impact. Every poll shows that when China is less
threatening, people here identify more as ``Chinese''; when it is
more threatening they identify as ``Taiwanese.'' The longing for
some kind of unity still exists, but it is buried under layers of
scar tissue, and China has to decide whether to add to those layers
or start peeling them away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were a soft sell for a change, a soft-pedaling ... I
think it would make a difference,'' Taiwan's vice president, Lien
Chan, said to me. ``Why don't we start by having the two of us _
governments or non-governmental organizations _ study together how
we establish a peace zone in the Taiwan Strait?''
</P>
<P>
   Another Taiwanese politician was more blunt: ``I could get
(China's president) Jiang Zemin elected president here _ easy _ if
they would just try a different approach.''

 &HT;    Dennis expected to graze Bahamas
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane Dennis kept South Florida on
edge Thursday as it continued its march across the Atlantic toward
a weather system that may or may not send it back out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   But not before it bruises the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists at the National Hurricane Center expected the
western edge of Dennis to begin grazing the Bahamas early today,
possibly making landfall in the northern islands early Saturday
morning. However, a pressure trough hunkered over the eastern
United States is also expected to begin turning Dennis
north-northwestward today. How quickly it turns will determine how
much of the storm hits the Bahamas and whether it remains aimed at
the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial turn ``is the $64,000 question,'' said Hurricane
Center meteorologist Todd Kimberlain. ``If it doesn't turn in time,
if it gets closer, we're going to get inclement weather.''
</P>
<P>
   If it makes the turn, meteorologists predict Dennis and its 80
mph winds will come no closer than about 200 miles east of Palm
Beach County and the Treasure Coast, a distance that will give us
sunny skies and unusually hot weather fanned by a westward wind.
Dennis had been moving only slightly early Thursday and then
stalled late in the afternoon. Forecasters expected it to resume
moving at about 7 mph. Even if Dennis _ with hurricane-force winds
extending 45 miles from its center _ were to continue in a straight
line, at this point it would land no farther south than Cape
Canaveral.
</P>
<P>
   But beware: Marine conditions off the South Florida coast will
be dangerous. Fearsome rip currents are expected as large, 5 to 7
foot swells collide with strong tides, said National Weather
Service meteorologist Jim Lushine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was moving at a faster speed, the swells would go in the
same direction. But because this one is so slow, the swells can
move out in all directions,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   This crashing of tides and swells will be particularly dangerous
at inlets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cruise ships steered clear of the Bahamas, making course
corrections day to day.
</P>
<P>
   With the snowbird season still months away and school resuming
this month, beaches have been mostly empty, said Chuck Price,
district supervisor for the Palm Beach County Beach Patrol. Still,
guards will be on alert for the tricky riptides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the swells come in and they're not too big, it's just a
time for surfers to have fun and keep a close eye on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, meteorologists say Dennis should miss land altogether.
However, since it is expected to pass within 100 miles of the
Carolina coast, forecasters are warning the area to remain
watchful.
</P>
<P>
   And creeping up in Dennis' wake is Emily. Thursday it weakened
to a tropical depression with winds of 45 mph. Emily is forecast to
follow a path slightly east of Dennis, Lushine said. Hurricane
Cindy, on the other hand, the third of the trifecta that appeared
earlier this week, has become ``a nonfactor, going out to
nowheresville,'' he said. Late Thursday, it was 830 miles southeast
of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   While forecasters are reasonably confident that Dennis will miss
Florida, they warned that the situation could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until it gets well north of our latitude, you don't want to
totally turn your back on it, sort of like a baseball batter
waiting for the ball to hit the catcher's mitt,'' Lushine said.
</P>
<P>
   Water managers are abiding the warning and continued to lower
canals in eastern urban areas in Palm Beach, St. Lucie, Broward and
Miami-Dade counties, said South Florida Water Management District
spokeswoman Ann Overton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it came here a high category one (winds of 95 mph), it
would not be a wind threat. It would be a rain threat,'' she said,
adding that water managers are working round the clock to keep an
eye on water levels. ``We're not even out of August yet. We still
have September, which is peak hurricane season.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Treasure Coast, the St. Lucie and Indian Rivers have been
deluged with millions of gallons of fresh water in runoff,
rainfall, flow from creeks and canals that water managers have
dumped since last Friday. No water has been released from Lake
Okeechobee, a move that in the past has killed fish and caused
environmental problems in the St. Lucie River.

COMMENTARY: VOTE ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By A.M. ROSENTHAL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Notice to the public: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vote now on drugs, one of the only two ways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. If you support the war against drugs, vote now for pending
congressional legislation designed to wound major drug lords around
the world. It cuts them off from all commerce with the United
States, now a laundry for bleaching the blood from drug-trade
billions and turning them into investments in legitimate
businesses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vote by telling your members of Congress that when the
House-Senate bill authorizing intelligence funds comes up for final
decision, probably next month, you want them to vote for the
section called ``blocking assets of major narcotics traffickers.''
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Insist they start now to tell the administration not to try to
water it down to satisfy any country for diplomatic or economic
reasons _ including Mexico, the biggest drug entry point for
America, already complaining about ``negative consequences'' of the
proposal.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Turn yourself and your civil, labor or commercial organization,
or religious congregation, into lobbists for the bill _
counterweight to the lobbies of drug-transfer nations and American
companies beholden to them.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. If you are against the war on drugs or just don't care about
what drugs are doing to our country, then don't do a thing. That is
a vote, too. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is in Washington. Members of Congress
introduce legislation, committees discuss it for months, votes are
taken and then when the time comes to work out House-Senate
differences, administrations on the fence and under professional
lobbyists' pressure use their power to try to mold the legislation
to their liking. That is exactly the time for ordinary Americans
around the country to do their own lobbying.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill targeting drug lords extends throughout their vicious
world the economic sanctions already directed at Colombian drug
lords, by President Clinton's executive order. It will prohibit any
U.S. commerce by specifically named drug operators, seize all their
assets in the United States, and ban trading with them by American
companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill specifies that every year the U.S. government list the
major drug lords of the world, by name and nation. The lists are
certain to include top drug traders from countries such as
Afghanistan, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic, Thailand and Mexico. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate it was introduced by Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., and
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and passed with bipartisan support. In
the House it also has support in both parties, including Porter
Goss of Florida, a Republican and chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, and Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. It awaits the
final September House-Senate Joint Intelligence Committee vote. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a while I heard from within the administration the kind of
mutters that preceded the Clinton certification last year that
Mexico was carrying out anti-drug commitments satisfactorily, which
was certainly a surprise to Mexican drug lords. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then, Thursday, the White House told me that it favored some
target sanctions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Its objection to the bill was that the administration would have
to list all major drug lords for the president to choose targets,
and that could endanger investigations. The White House said it
would be better for the president to select targets without having
to choose from a list. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bit of a puzzle. The bill already gives him the right to decide
which of the drug lords to target from the administration's
unpublished list. But some members of Congress think the motive is
to avoid a list that might include just a little too many from a
``sensitive country.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No one bill will end the drug war. Only the determination of
Americans to use every sort of resource will do that _ parental
teaching, law enforcement with some compassion toward first
offenders and none for career drug criminals, enough money for
therapy in and out of jails, targeting drug lords _ and passionate
leadership. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That would preclude presidential candidates who mince around
about whether they used drugs when they were younger _ unless they
grow up publicly and quickly. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mitchell S. Rosenthal, head of the Phoenix House therapeutic
communities, says that the bill ``reflects the kind of values that
we don't hear enough these days.'' So vote _ one way or the other.

BLEDSOE SEES NEED FOR STRONGER RUNNING GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUPEN FOFARIA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Drew Bledsoe is feeling the urgency to win
in late January, and he's ready to wage the air attack to get the
Patriots there. What he needs is a little help from the ground
forces, a.k.a. a running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to have some balance,'' he said. ``We need to
establish that we can run the ball. I mean, we're not going to be 4
yards and a cloud of dust. We'll probably throw the ball to win
games. But we still need to establish it for balance.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, everything else checks out with his troops as they
moved from training camp in Smithfield, R.I. and practiced Thursday
at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of guys on the team, now, that we know what
we're going to get out of,'' said Bledsoe. ``I can count on Bruce
Armstrong to protect my backside; I know what I'll get from the
receiving corp; the biggest thing is the offensive line with their
pass protection, and they work well together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe is ready to carry the team to and through the postseason
on the strength of his arm and a receiving corps that ``when I drop
back and throw the ball, I can trust they're going to be where they
need to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have six guys, really, that can come in and play and us not
miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   The war is about to start and the victor goes to the Super Bowl.
Bledsoe is in his eighth season in the NFL, and he's feeling the
urgency to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a sense of urgency with this team,'' he said.
``Really with everything now, with free agency and all, you never
know what you're going to have coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the best team you'll ever go on. This may be your
best chance to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue comes up because Bledsoe sees a lot of veterans on the
team. You can't sit around forever in the National Football League
and wait for a championship to come to you.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of experience, Bledsoe feels it's time to start
playing for a championship. If the young guys don't understand,
it's the veterans' responsiblity to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to have that perspective when it's your
second, third year in the league,'' Bledsoe said. ``I mean, that
first year you're really just in awe that you made the team. It's
something that as a veteran you have to impart to them.''
</P>
<P>
   What is the true test of a football player's worth? Coach Pete
Carroll says longevity and a little hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think only time will tell,'' Carroll said on how Bledsoe's
career will be remembered. ``It's a test of survival and you also
have to have the stage to do it in. He has the stage. I think he's
got players around him that give him the opportunity to give him
that long run.''

FED IS PLAYING WITH FIRE AS IT TWEAKS INTEREST RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve apparently has committed itself to the
perilous task of letting the air out of the stock market without
deflating an economic expansion that will become the longest in
U.S. history if it lasts until February.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fed raised the central bank's key interest rates
Tuesday, it did so in the name of pre-empting inflation. This is,
however, a pro forma pretext because the only discernible inflation
is the asset inflation occurring in the stock market. This is
obviously what the Fed is reacting to.
</P>
<P>
   Bond traders hailed the Fed's latest rate tweak by bidding up
prices and thereby causing yields to fall on the bellwether 30-year
Treasury bond. Wall Street's cheer, however, obscured the toll
tighter money has taken on those being ravaged by weakening
commodities markets.
</P>
<P>
   Farm markets remained soft Tuesday, gold continued its decline
and most major commodity indexes gave ground. Even oil prices were
lower, which was surprising because oil has been the exception to
the general weakness in commodities.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's actions put it on the back of a tiger and risk a
calamitous climax to one of America's headiest boom periods of this
century. Anyone who doubts the stakes of the Fed's game should
reflect on what has happened to Japan over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s Japan's monetary authorities were worried
about the bubble that had developed in the country's equities and
real estate markets. Their response was to tighten monetary policy
in hopes of letting the air out gradually. What happened instead
was a catastrophic and uncontrollable collapse of both stock and
real estate prices. The miscalculation devastated what had been the
world's most dynamic economy, and Japan is still struggling to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, some analysts are finding increasing parallels
with the U.S. experience that began in the mid-1920s. A lengthy
analysis in Investor's Business Daily on Tuesday recounted how the
roaring bull market of the '20s worried the Fed and led to a series
of interest rate increases in an effort to rein in the bull.
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as they say, is history. The stock market
disintegration that began in late 1929 led to the decadelong
deflationary horror known as the Great Depression. The lesson of
this experience is that once the Fed committed to deflating the
bubble, it found itself unable to get off the tiger's back.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts fear history may repeat itself. By raising rates
in the absence of inflation, the Fed's message is that its moves
are prompted by events on Wall Street rather than Main Street. This
perception has led to the dubious view that this week's rate
increase will be the last for the foreseeable future. If the stock
market keeps soaring, the Fed will be back to further punish
investors for their imprudent exuberance.
</P>
<P>
   How far would the Fed have to go to kill the bull market and tip
the economy into recession? Nobody knows. Markets thrive on
confidence born of certainty. It's impossible to know when
confidence will be irretrievably lost. Students of history,
however, do know from the United States' '30s experience and
Japan's '90s experience that when it's gone it's gone, and the
process of recovery is very long and painful.

U.N. DIPLOMATS SEARCH FOR WAYS TO AVOID VIOLENCE IN HAITI 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Faced with the almost-certain withdrawal of a
U.N. police mission from Haiti in November, just before national
elections are scheduled to take place, diplomats are searching for
alternative ways to help the Haitian government avoid another
descent into political violence.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely first step would be to move the Haitian issue
out of the Security Council, to avoid a Chinese veto or other
opposition, and into the General Assembly, injecting some urgency
into its work.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats see this as an interesting and innovative test
case for the United Nations in an era where the implosions of
government seem more frequent, but not all situations rise to a
level demanding international peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The security situation in Haiti remains a matter of concern,''
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in a report to the Security
Council on Wednesday. There are fears, he said, that withdrawing
the international civilian police mission, which now has 279
officers from 10 countries in Haiti, might undermine stability ``at
a particularly sensitive stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a Security Council resolution that expires in November,
foreign officers have been training the Haitian National Police, an
organization accused by a range of Haitian political parties of
killings and torture of people in custody. One of those accusations
is the killing in May of 11 detainees at Carrefour-Feuilles, an
outlying neighborhood of the capital, Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   The Haitian police also appear to be involved in
drug-trafficking, the secretary-general's report said.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Annan wrote, the Haitian government is unable to
build strong political institutions or even provide public services
because of political discord.
</P>
<P>
   President Rene Preval _ who succeeded Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
the overthrown leader restored to power by the United States _
dissolved the Parliament in January because it would not accept any
of his nominees for prime minister. That job was then given to
Jacques Edouard Alexis, whom opposition parties consider an
illegitimate prime minister because he was appointed without
parliamentary approval.
</P>
<P>
   National legislative elections are planned for the end of this
year, and an elected government, with a new Parliament, has been
promised by Jan. 10. The Security Council mandate runs out just
before the voting is scheduled to begin. And to further complicate
the situation and make it more dangerous, the United States is
reported to be planning to begin withdrawing 480 American troops
stationed in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   In order to avoid leaving Haiti in a lurch, the six countries
that call themselves ``friends of Haiti'' here _ the United States,
France, Canada, Venezuela, Chile and Argentina _ want to move the
Haitian issue out of the Security Council, where China has always
opposed operations in Haiti because Aristide has ties with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say that a renewal of the Security Council mandate is
virtually impossible, unless the Haitian elections are postponed as
some expect, and a short extension is approved. But this would be
considered at best a stop-gap measure, and Western diplomats would
prefer to adopt a different approach.
</P>
<P>
   In July, working through the Economic and Social Council, a U.N.
panel that is now being revived to deal with an age of collapsed
governments and moribund economies, the six nations proposed a new
way of aiding Haiti within the U.N. system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are opening the door to a new type of mission in Haiti,
which would pursue the work of the U.N. without a Security Council
resolution,'' said Michel Duval, Canada's deputy chief
representative.''
</P>
<P>
   A General Assembly resolution is being written with the help of
the Haitians that will preserve the coordinating role of a special
representative of the secretary-general, enhance the work of the
U.N. Development Program, ensure a continuing civilian police
advisory group and promote human rights, an area that has been left
largely to the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. mission would be smaller than it is now,'' said Duval
``It would not be a peacekeeping mission. We could call it a
peace-building mission, a stabilization mission.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The need is to be able to have a follow-on mission starting at
the beginning of December,'' he said. ``We are working with the
secretariat to ensure that there would be no artificial cut between
the two missions.''
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats are also enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is actually the first test case of whether or not you can
have a seamless transition from a peacekeeping operation to a
long-term development program,'' said Nancy Soderberg, the American
envoy working on this issue. ``It's the first time we've attempted
to do a transition like this. It has broad support.''

ENQUIST BATTLES CANCER, BUT RUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Ludmila Engquist says she's already spoken too
much about the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Olympic gold medalist in the 100-meter hurdles,
Engquist said she is not here to talk about the mastectomy she had
in April shortly after discovering a lump in her right breast. She
is not here to detail the four chemotherapy sessions she has
already had, or the two that still await. She is not here to talk
about the IV needles, the fear, the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here to compete, '' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   In an amazing comeback that echoes the courage of cyclist Lance
Armstrong and outfielder Eric Davis, Engquist is in Seville this
week at the World Championships of Track and Field to defend her
title barely four months after cancer surgery and in the midst of
chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy I'm here, '' said the hurdler. ``For me, it's
very, very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking fit and stylish in her new short haircut _ cropped after
the first chemotherapy session in case her hair began to fall out,
which it hasn't _ and new contact lenses stamped with the light
blue-and-yellow Swedish flag, the Russian-born Engquist on Tuesday
appeared ready to conquer the world. She began doing exactly that
Wednesday morning, when she ran the fastest time (12.62 seconds) of
the 41 women trying to reach the quarterfinals. And she didn't slow
down much Thursday night, clocking 12.65 to easily advance to
Friday night's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, ``I am very, very realistic, '' she cautioned. ``I
don't think I can win. But I would like to be on the podium.''
</P>
<P>
   Her cancer is only the latest setback in her athletic career. A
fall in the 1988 Olympic semifinals may have cost her a medal in
Seoul, and a hamstring strain knocked her out of the same round in
Barcelona four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1993, she was banned from competition for four years
when a drug test revealed anabolic steroids in her system; she
insisted she was innocent, and the ban was overturned in December
1995 when her Russian ex-husband, Nikolai Narozhilenko, admitted he
had spiked her vitamin supplements before a bitter divorce.
</P>
<P>
   After marrying her coach, Johan Engquist, she became a Swedish
citizen just two months before winning gold in Atlanta. Together,
they are trying to put her career back together yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of crying, a lot of emotion, '' Johan Engquist
said, describing his 35-year-old wife's reaction to the news of her
illness. ``When she was told she was going to have to have
chemotherapy, her career was over for about four hours until we
consulted with some other doctors that had more interest in
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Those doctors told her she probably wouldn't compete this year
but, if all went well, she could be back in 2000. Surprisingly,
Engquist was able to resume training just five days after her
mastectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is extremely strong in her mind and her will,'' said
Johan. ``She is extraordinarily strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Engquist began chemotherapy in mid-May with the most recent
session on July 15; after each dose, said her husband, she spends
most of the following day in bed, takes an easy jog on the third
day and resumes training on the fourth. Three or four weeks later,
the cycle begins anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course it is not possible to train as hard, '' Johan said,
estimating the level at about 50 percent, with six to eight
workouts a week instead of 11 or 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful story,'' said Dr. Leroy Parker, an
oncologist and breast cancer specialist at Dana-Farber Partners
Cancer Care in Boston. ``It's good for people to hear'' how active
someone can be during cancer chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Standard regimens for the disease in this country are two weeks
of chemo followed by two weeks of rest, or one intravenous chemo
session every three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Does he consider her stamina unusual under the circumstances?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unusual for a world-class athlete being treated''
with chemotherapy while competing, said Parker, ``but it's not
unusual for women to do remarkable things while having
chemotherapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Parker added that Engquist's story will help dispel
misconceptions that having chemotherapy means the patient won't
have any energy.
</P>
<P>
   The specialist said that how active someone in her position can
be depends on how often she's getting treatment and how it affects
the production of blood cells in her body. He said it would be
reasonable for Engquist to be receiving a drug such as
erythropoietin, which boosts the body's production of blood cells,
even though it might not be appropriate for a healthy athlete to be
taking the drug.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, Engquist made a stunning return to competition at a
meet in Stockholm, winning in her first race since surgery. As she
finished, in 12.68 seconds, she ran into her husband's arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she had finished last, she would have been the winner,''
said American hurdler Melissa Morrison, who finished second.
``She's our hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Engquist competed three more times before coming to Seville, but
did not duplicate her victory. ``I feel good, but it was not like
Engquist,'' she said of her races. ``I was third, or fourth, or
second. It's not me, but I was very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, this week she's trying to avoid the subject of her
illness, and Gail Devers understands why. ``To have gone through
chemotherapy and come back as quickly as she's come back, it's
tremendous, but it's also draining,'' said Devers, a rival hurdler
who in the early '90s battled back from Graves Disease. ``And it's
draining any time you have to think of that situation, because it's
not that long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither is it that far in the future. For on Thursday, just five
days after the hurdles final, Engquist has another chemotherapy
appointment.

   WASHINGTON _ Badly injured but ``in good spirits,'' American
researcher Daja Meston arrived safely in Hong Kong for medical
treatment Thursday, after Chinese authorities had forced him to
confess that he had entered a ``restricted area'' and to apologize
for it, sources said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Meston, a 29-year-old Tibetan scholar, was also barred from
returning to China for five years, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Meston was conducting research in the sensitive area of Qinghai
province, the site of a highly controversial World Bank program to
resettle poor farmers.
</P>
<P>
   After what Meston associates say was several days of
interrogation by Chinese security in a hotel room, Meston tumbled
from a third-story window. There is no evidence that he was
tortured or tossed from the window.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, which Chinese officials say was part of an escape
attempt, Meston broke vertebrae in his back and suffered internal
injuries that made it necessary to remove his spleen.
</P>
<P>
   Meston was flown to Hong Kong and is expected to return to the
Boston area when he is physicaly able. ``I think it depends on his
health condition,'' a high-ranking diplomatic source said.
</P>
<P>
   Meston ``is in good spirits,'' said Dana Clark of the
Washington-based Center for International Environmental Law, which
has been battling the World Bank project. However, moving Meston is
a delicate task because of the severity of his injuries, said Lisa
Jordan of the Washington-based Bank Information Center, which has
been raising money for Meston's enormous medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the information center, which assists non-governmental
organizations, has raised $58,000 for Meston, who does not have
health insurance. The group estimates it could take months for
Meston to recover, and the cost of his medical flight to Boston
alone could be as high as $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Meston, who was born in Tibet but is a US citizen with residency
in Newton, Mass., was detained by Chinese authorities Aug. 15 with
another researcher, Australian Gabriel Lafitte, and Tsering Dorje,
an ethnic Tibetan and Chinese national.
</P>
<P>
   Lafitte was released last week after he said he was repeatedly
interrogated by Chinese police and deprived of sleep. Dorje's
whereabouts are unknown, and supporters fear the man may be treated
worse because of his ethnic Tibetan background.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``extremely common for Tibetan detainees to be tortured,''
said Kate Saunders of the London-based Tibet Information Network.
</P>
<P>
   Meston was looking into the impact of a World Bank proposal to
move 58,000 impoverished farmers to a plateau area now sparsely
occupied by mainly ethnic Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   The project would make the area majority Chinese. ``The Tibetans
see it as a calculated policy to make them a minority in their own
homeland,'' said John Ackerly of the International Campaign for
Tibet, based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Others oppose the project because of its possible damage to the
environment. Foes of the plan have scheduled a protest rally in
front of the World Bank's Washington office on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a chance that the project could be stopped, World
Bank officials say, since the funding has not been finally
approved. But moving the people is meant to alleviate poverty, not
to stir up ethnic troulbe, said World Bank spokeswoman Melissa
Fossberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people in this area are the poorest of the poor,''
Fossberg said, and may have a better life if they are moved to an
area where they can farm.

WACO REVELATION BRINGS CALL FOR PROBE OF FBI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, whose department was
already under attack for a series of missteps, acknowledged
Thursday that the latest controversy involving the FBI and the
fiery deaths of 86 Branch Davidian cult members in 1993 has further
damaged her office's credibility and left her ``very, very
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, noting how this week's revelations arrived
on the heels of a string of other Justice Department and FBI
miscues, called for hearings. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa
Republican whose Senate Judiciary subcommittee has investigated the
FBI's failures in several high-profile criminal cases, said, ``This
is a serious development in terms of further erosion of the FBI's
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor were all the critiques partisan, though Democrats weighed
their words carefully Thursday and avoided on-the-record criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another public relations nightmare,'' said a
Democratic counsel for a committee that oversees Reno's department,
placing the FBI's performance in the alleged Chinese theft of
nuclear secrets, the bureau's investigation of the Olympics bombing
in Atlanta, and disarray in the FBI's famed crime labs atop a list
of embarrassing setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Republican committee investigators added the Waco controversy,
the infighting between the FBI and the Justice Department over the
handling of the 1996 campaign-finance scandal, and the bureau's
decision to share FBI background files with the Clinton White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is obvious concern,'' even among Democrats, the
committee counsel said. ``The question is whether this is a
systemic problem at the bureau, or just a bad series of
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has triumphs to point to as well, but when the attorney
general admits to being ``very, very upset,'' ``very, very
frustrated'' and ``very, very troubled'' at the bureau's
performance, as Reno did Thursday, people take notice.
</P>
<P>
   The cause for Reno's dismay was that contrary to everything she
and the FBI have said since the Branch Davidian members were killed
in Waco on April 19, 1993, the FBI this week admitted firing two
``pyrotechnic'' military gas grenades at a concrete bunker some 100
yards from the compound early in the morning of the final showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``All available indications are that the devices were not
directed at the main wooden compound, were discharged several hours
before the fire started, and were not the cause of the fire,'' Reno
said. ``I have no reason whatsoever at this point to believe that
the FBI was responsible for the deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked how the bureau's change of position had affected
her department, Reno conceded, ``I don't think it's very good for
my credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the best you can. You try to pursue every avenue to get
to the right thing to do, to get to the truth,'' Reno said, when
asked about the string of recent reversals. ``If you are going to
let things get you down, maybe you should go do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Representatives Dan Burton of Indiana and Bob Barr of
Georgia, two longtime critics of the Clinton administration, have
called for a congressional investigation. In a letter to Reno, Barr
said the FBI admission ``raises questions'' about whether federal
officials perjured themselves, and whether other forms of
incendiary devices may have been used on the final day of the
seige.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who
serves on the House Judiciary Committee, scoffed at such
suggestions. Burton and Barr ``should investigate each other,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the General Accounting Office issued a report
Thursday that said the Pentagon provided ``a wide variety of
assistance'' at Waco to the FBI and the Treasury Department's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The cost of the
assistance, which has be known for years, was put at $1 million by
the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco tragedy ended a 51-day seige that followed a raid by
federal agents from the ATF, during which four of the agency's
officers and two cult members were killed in an exchange of
gunshots. In the April confrontation, the FBI used tanks to punch
holes in the wooden walls of the Branch Davidian compound and pour
CS riot gas into the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon the compound burst into flames, whipped by
the prairie wind. Most of the 86 people who died succumbed to the
smoke and fire. Several government investigations, including one by
the House Government Reform Committee that Burton chairs, concluded
the fire was started by suicidal members of the cult, some of whom
turned their firearms on themselves and each other.

 &HT;    A little animal magnetism can add allure to any wardrobe, but
beware of too much of a good thing
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a jungle out there.
</P>
<P>
   Animal prints _ leopards, tigers, ponies, zebras and giraffes
among them _ are multiplying at astounding rates.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion industry has been inspired by animal magnetism for
years. But designers went especially wild for fall/winter 1999,
producing everything from purses to shoes to outerwear and apparel
in animal print fabrics, faux furs and genuine skins.
</P>
<P>
   Some prints are sophisticated enough to wear to work, especially
when they accessorize a solid-colored outfit. Other garments, such
as pants, miniskirts and jackets, are more appropriate for evening
or casual occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's possible to wear animal print from head to toe,
try to resist the urge. Those who can pull off such a busy look
stylishly are a rare species.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what else fashion experts advise:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use animal prints for detail; don't dress entirely in them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Choose a print that's flattering to your figure. ``If you're a
big person, choose a smaller print,'' says Anita Finkelstein,
fashion market editor for Women's Wear Daily. ``Think about
choosing a print that's in proportion to your frame.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't mix and match animal prints in one outfit, unless that's
the way the designer made the garment and the prints blend.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Think about how much of a statement you want to make before
wearing something loud such as an animal print jacket or pants.
``If you don't want to dress that boldly, pick up the trend in a
bag or a shoe,'' offers Susan Forehand, fashion director at Saks
Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fringe is in, especially on cow print garments. So think twice
before you buy one, unless you want to look like one of the herd.
``Every woman this fall is going to have something fringe,''
Finkelstein says.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nia Long is doing the Samuel L. Jackson right now.
</P>
<P>
   No that's not some new dance your kids haven't bothered to show
you. Nor is it the actress's imitation of Jackson's infamous
quarter-pounder with cheese speech in ``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   It's just that for the next six months Long will be as much of a
movie presence as the seemingly indefatigable co-star, Jackson.
Counting the drama that opened this past Wednesday, ``In Too
Deep,'' the former co-star of television's ``Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air'' will be appearing in five films and one HBO project _ all
scheduled to hit the screen by January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working so much that, to be honest with you, I don't
know what has gone on in my life between last year and now,'' Long
says at the start of her recent one-day stop in Atlanta. ``It's
like one big blur to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But professionally, the blur is better than the break she's had
from the movie screen since her co-starring role in 1997's hit
``Soul Food.'' ``People forget that I haven't really done anything
in a while because (`Soul Food') is on cable, and you see my face
on `Fresh Prince' reruns,'' continues Long, not mentioning that her
accessibly attractive face is featured in the recent In Style,
music magazine XXL and the new black men's fashion magazine Code.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just got the kind of look that lingers,'' ``In Too
Deep'' co-star LL Cool J says with a dimpled grin. ``I'm sure the
fellas will be glad to see her back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I purposely took my time to make sure I came back on the scene
with a body of work,'' Long continues as she sips on hot tea at
downtown's Ritz-Carlton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' isn't exactly a big ``I'm Back!'' for Long _ as
she appears only briefly as co-star Omar Epps' love interest. ``I'm
probably in the trailer longer than I am in the movie,'' she
laughs. ``But it's not a love story. It's a very male-driven film.
They just always have to put the woman in there to make the guys
excited, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a small role Long took because she wanted to work
with Epps and director Michael Rymer. ``And I liked the
character,'' she says. ``What's funny is when the script was
originally written Myra was a nurse. Then I ended up being a dancer
and a nude model. It was shocking, but I really liked the idea
because I grew up in the Midwest (Iowa City, Iowa) part of my life
and my mom was a painter and she used to model nude for art
classes.''
</P>
<P>
   So Long shows some skin in ``In Too Deep,'' and her chops in
these upcoming projects:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  `` `The Best Man' is an ensemble cast picture, but Taye Diggs
(`How Stella Got Her Groove Back') and myself are the main
characters. Taye Diggs' character writes this book and my
character's a journalist _ a nosy one. She reads the book,
discovers that all of his skeletons are being revealed. They also
had a crush on each other in college, so there's a lot sexual
tension. It's funny, it's sad sometimes and it's really intense.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  `` `Held Up' (formerly titled `Inconvenienced') is a romantic
comedy starring me and Jamie Foxx. And basically we're on a road
trip where everything that you can imagine that could go wrong goes
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  `` `Stigmata' is about people who have stigmatic episodes
(bleeding). It happens to Patricia Arquette and I play her best
friend. We live in Boston, we're hairdressers, party girls.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``In `Boiler Room' Giovanni Ribisi and Ben Affleck are these
guys that have this fraudulent investment company. I run the front
desk and I'm Giovanni's love interest.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Finally I've got this HBO Project, `If These Walls Could
Talk _ Two.' And I play a lesbian feminist in the 1970s. My
character was really interesting because, as a black person in the
'70s, the last thing you could admit to being was gay. Everybody
was all about black power. No other issues. So my character wasn't
really accepted by the black folk. And she couldn't fully voice her
opinion as a feminist. It was a great challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   And a reintroduction to the TV audience, for which she's
developing a pilot. ``I can't say too much about it,'' the former
soap opera star says. ``But believe me, I'm going to do my best to
maintain who I am as a black woman in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   An incredibly busy one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B -
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps, LL Cool J. Rated R for strong sensuality and
language, and for some violence. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 50
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   AJC movie critic Steve Murray's verdict: A decent undercover-cop
thriller highlighted by some smart performances.

 &HT;    This `Game' an idiot's delight
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If ``American Pie'' isn't your particular dish of comedy, why
not try something with a little more Continental flavor?
</P>
<P>
   French filmmaker Francis Veber (he co-wrote ``La Cage Aux
Folles'') serves up comic frustration au jus in ``The Dinner Game''
(``Le Diner de Cons'').
</P>
<P>
   The second-biggest hit in France after ``Titanic'' (use this
space to fill in your own Jerry Lewis crack), ``Dinner Game'' has a
yummy premise. Every Wednesday, a bunch of snotty Paris yuppies
stages a dinner party. The challenge? Each diner is expected to
bring a guest: a grade-A idiot whose unwitting foolishness provides
the evening's entertainment. The winner is whoever hooks the
biggest dope.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Brochant (Thierry Lhermitte), a smugly successful
publisher, thinks he has a sure thing with his latest ``prize.''
He's Pignon (Jacques Villeret), a rotund, pathetically
eager-to-please government employee whose hobby is building scale
replicas of famous monuments. Out of matchsticks. His pride and joy
is his Eiffel Tower, which took 346,422 sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Fate, however, intervenes when Brochant injures his back. Forced
to miss the dinner, he becomes both host and hostage to Pignon,
who, while trying to be helpful, manages to wreck his life in a
matter of hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinner Game'' isn't what you'd call sophisticated fare. But
its silliness is infectuous and virtually unstoppable as disaster
builds on disaster. The piece's theatrical origins are clear in the
way virtually all the action takes place in Brochant's sumptuous
apartment. Pignon may get out the door, but he never gets very far.
And all the other characters _ from Brochant's estranged wife to a
sharp-eyed tax auditor _ find excuses to drop by. But the farce
never feels forced. The cast's timing is just too good.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``Dinner Game'' is nothing more than a diversion.
But on its own terms, it's an idiot's delight. And best see it now,
in its original version. Word is that Hollywood has already bought
the rights for an English-language remake. Worse word is that
they're thinking Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte and Jacques Villeret. Directed by
Francis Veber. Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innuendo.
Subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 22 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A feast of foolishness.

 &HT;    It's tough abiding by school dress codes
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The school year is barely under way, but students
throughout metro Atlanta have already learned a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   There's life after short shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Dress codes in public schools vary widely; one in Coweta County
prohibits kids from going beltless if their pants have belt loops _
causing some mothers to take scissors to the loops. One rule that's
fairly consistent, however, is that shorts must come at least to
midthigh. That's not a problem for boys, whose shorts tend to be
Bermuda length, but for girls, and their parents, it's a headache.
</P>
<P>
   They're not necessarily opposed to having a dress code. They're
just having a hard time finding shorts that are both long enough to
meet school requirements and hip enough to satisfy theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Rohan, a sixth-grader at Ellis G. Arnall Middle School
in Coweta County, had to work hard to find shorts that wouldn't get
her sent to the principal's office. After combing the malls with
her mother, Jane Rohan, she finally settled for baggy, midthigh
shorts from Goody's Family Clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really hard to find some,'' Allison said. ``I was
thinking they might as well put us in uniforms.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Davis of Peachtree City found the same shopping challenge.
After searching for hours with her 12-year-old daughter, Lauren,
Davis found only two pairs of shorts that were long enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally spent the day at Perimeter Mall. We went into at
least 20 stores,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I would tell them what the dress code was, at least 10
salespeople shook their head and said, `We don't have anything that
long.' It was very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Some girls eventually give up the search altogether, resorting
to Capri pants, pedal pushers and long pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the pedal pushers and the Capri meet the requirements,
and they're something that's in style, so they're liking them a
lot,'' said Yolanda Lightfoot, a saleswoman at the Limited Too in
Northlake Mall who has helped many frustrated students _ and
parents _ find alternatives to shorts.
</P>
<P>
   The policy at Carl G. Renfroe Middle School in Decatur prohibits
shorts from being more than 4 inches above the knee. But Marty
Monroe, a Decatur mom, couldn't find any to suit her 11-year-old
daughter, Alexandra.
</P>
<P>
   ``She traditionally wears shorts in Atlanta's hot weather, but
we had to reevaluate,'' Monroe said. ``The styles right now are
very short in girl's shorts. Four inches is pretty long.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra doesn't like Capri pants or pedal pushers, so they
weren't an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``They look like they would bunch up and give me wedgies,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   So she reluctantly decided to wear only long pants this fall.
Her mother bought her five pairs. As it turns out, that was a good
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Renfroe, where Alexandra just entered sixth grade, is well
air-conditioned, not hot and stuffy like her elementary school was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I might be able to deal with pants,'' she said.
``Now that I've gone to school for the past few days, I like it
because the school is freezing.''

 &HT;    `Gatsby' the latest book making leap to the stage
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apparently even the most unlikely book is fair game for the
theater these days. Following the recent news that John Updike's
novel ``The Witches of Eastwick'' would be turned into a London
musical comes word that John Harbison's opera based on F. Scott
Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby'' will open at New York's Met on
Dec. 20. Elsewhere in New York, Christopher Walken and Blair Brown
will appear in a musical adaptation of James Joyce's ``The Dead.''
Previews begin Oct. 1 at Playwrights Horizons. If this trend
continues, the next toe-tapping songs may come from ``Angela's
Ashes.'' Or perhaps we'll see ``Hannibal: The Musical''?
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Literary inspirations: Speaking of ``Angela's Ashes,'' you
would expect that Samuel Beckett would be one of Frank McCourt's
favorite writers, but Kurt Vonnegut? ``They both have an unadorned
style. ... They are great models if you're a young writer just
starting out,'' McCourt says in an interview in the
September/October issue of Poets &AMP; Writers magazine. As for other
writers who have influenced him, McCourt lists Anton Chekhov,
William Trevor and poet Seamus Heaney. Heaney, McCourt says, is ``a
lesson for all of us. He writes so much about digging, in more ways
than one _ archaelogically digging, psychologically digging _ into
your people's past. I think maybe subconsciously I was thinking of
him when I wrote my first book.'' ``'Tis,'' McCourt's sequel to his
best-selling memoir, will be published next month.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In the works: Atlanta author Robert Coram (``Dead South'') has
signed a deal with Little, Brown to write a biography of the late
John Boyd, considered by many to be the most influential military
theoretician since Sun Tzu some 2,400 years ago. Boyd was the
author of the Aerial Attack Study, which became the bible of air
combat tactics, and developed a 15-hour briefing that became the
strategic and tactical foundation for victory in the Gulf War.
``While in Atlanta attending Georgia Tech,'' Coram says, ``he
developed his Energy-Maneuverability Theory, which changed the way
aircraft are designed and enabled America for the first time to
assess the combat capability of Soviet aircraft. In between all
this, he was the father of the F-15 and the F-16.'' The book is
scheduled to be published in the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Not out to pasture: Effie Wilder is celebrating her 90th
birthday Saturday with her fourth novel, ``One More Time.''
Wilder's first three books, ``Out to Pasture,'' ``Over What Hill?''
and ``Older But Wilder,'' have sold more than 500,000 copies,
according to Atlanta's Peachtree Publishers. Wilder, who lives at
the Presbyterian Home in Summerville, S.C., draws on the daily life
of the retirement community for her fiction. In the new novel,
Wilder's protagonist, Hattie McNair, stages a variety show to help
the town recover from a hurricane while she deals with the
developing health problems of a close friend.

TURKEY SEEKS TO KEEP MUSLIM GROUPS OUT OF QUAKE RELIEF EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Early last Saturday morning, a squad of
police officers arrived at the Istanbul headquarters of a
Muslim-oriented foundation called Mazlum-Der and searched the
premises. They were not looking for weapons or subversive material
but for illegally collected blankets, tents and other earthquake
relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the foundation had not collected any
supplies, and the officers left empty-handed. On Monday, however,
the governor of Istanbul ordered the foundation's bank account
blocked until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   The raid reflected the government's determination not to allow
Muslim groups to join the earthquake relief effort. Senior military
and civilian leaders fear that if such groups win public confidence
with their relief work, they will also win new converts to the
cause of political Islam, which the government views as a threat to
Turkey's secular order.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials have urged donors to contribute only to the
Red Crescent, Turkey's equivalent of the Red Cross, or other
officially approved relief groups. They have refused to grant
permission to groups that are perceived as pro-Islamic, like the
Mazlum-Der foundation, to collect or distribute aid in the
earthquake zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has looked weak and incompetent and powerless during
this crisis,'' said Yilmaz Ensaroglu, general secretary of the
foundation. ``If civilian groups show efficiency and strength, that
could be seen as weakening the prestige and authority of the state.
That's what some people are afraid of.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, religious groups in Turkey have served as unofficial
welfare agencies for the destitute, homeless, unemployed and
dispossessed. When a house burns down, a child takes ill or a
family is evicted from its home, Islamic foundations and
neighborhood clubs often respond more quickly and generously than
government agencies. The beneficiaries of their help often become
enthusiastic supporters of the Islamic political movement.
</P>
<P>
   After last week's catastrophic earthquake, it seemed logical to
expect that Islamic groups would be among the most active in aiding
victims. But in most devastated towns, they were nowhere to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is that the Islamic-oriented political party
to which many of these groups are loyal has been torn by a
leadership struggle and may not be able to mobilize people as
easily as it has in the past. The party, Virtue, is the successor
to the Welfare Party, which was banned last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has also worked on various fronts to prevent
Islamic groups from aiding earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``These groups are very active whenever there is a crisis, and
some people in high places are not happy with this,'' said Fehmi
Koru, the former editor of the pro-Islamic newspaper Zaman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing everything in their power to make sure that
these groups are not allowed to work visibly in the earthquake
zone. They see this work as ideological, and don't want Islamic
groups or Islamic people to be able to take credit for helping
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Many earthquake victims are seething with outrage at the
government's relief effort, which they complain began late and
remains in chaos. Officials fear that in this climate, Islamic
groups could win considerable sympathy if they show themselves able
to deliver aid quickly and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is very sensitive, because they're worried
about the political consequences of this growing public anger,''
said Nilufer Narli, a scholar who has written widely about the
Islamic political movement. ``Muslim brotherhoods have been very
active in meeting the needs of migrants and poor people, and now
they're trying to reach people in the earthquake area. The
government finds this very alarming. They see it as an effort to
create a support base for Islamic politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Islamic groups have not publicly protested restrictions
on their relief work, some of their more avid supporters have
suggested that the earthquake was a form of divine punishment for
Turkey's insistent secularism.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Islamic-oriented newspaper Akit has referred to the
earthquake as ``the Aug. 17 decision of God.'' It suggested that
the naval base at Golcuk, which was destroyed in the quake, was a
target of heavenly wrath because it was the site of meetings in
1997 at which military officers decide to crack down on Islamic
political movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The headquarters of mere humans are weak,'' one Akit
commentator wrote. ``Preventing people from doing what their
religion commands is punishable even in this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Another columnist for Akit said that the earthquake was too mild
a punishment for Turkey, considering what the government has done
to curb the power of religion in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthquakes are brought on either by adultery or oppression,''
the columnist wrote. ``When people practice these sins, the earth
rebels, prays to God and then shakes. This will continue until God
deals a fatal blow to these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Such views, which are not widely shared even among devout
Muslims in Turkey, reflect the internal tensions that have weakened
the Islamic political movement here. Its principal vehicle, the
Virtue party, has been torn by strife between old-liners led by
former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and a restive group of
younger dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party is not well organized now,'' said Abdullah Gul, a
member of Parliament who is a leader of the dissident faction.
``Plenty of our people rushed to the earthquake area to help, but
they did it as individuals. A lot of help also came from cities and
towns where our people are mayors. But because of the party's
internal problems, we haven't been able to act in any united way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other problem is the pressure the state has been putting
on us,'' Gul said. ``They are very suspicious of our motives, and
so they're preventing many of our groups from sending aid. That
wouldn't be so bad if the state itself was perfectly organized, but
as we have seen, that's not quite the case.''

 &HT;    Father, son clash in tale of old, new West
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29
 &HT;    By Ron Franscell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Montana, not far from where Ivan Doig grew up beneath the big
sky that still haunts him, three rivers flow together to form the
deep and wide Missouri, lacing through time and landscape, the old
West and the new.
</P>
<P>
   And like the brawny Missouri, Doig has channeled three deep
literary tributaries into ``Mountain Time,'' a coda to his
McCaskill family trilogy (``English Creek,'' ``Dancing at the
Rascal Fair'' and ``Ride With Me, Mariah Montana'').
</P>
<P>
   Mitch Rozier is flotsam, a 50-year-old environmental columnist
for a post-hip alternative Seattle weekly paper, a baby boomer
treading water with his own past and present: estrangement from his
grown children, tenuous job security and a scrappy lover.
</P>
<P>
   Lexa McCaskill is jetsam, the earthy and divorced Montana
expatriate swirling in Mitch's eddy, catering swanky Seattle
software soirees, also going nowhere. Together, they are caught in
the undertow of Lyle Rozier, Mitch's father. Lyle is dying of
leukemia, and Mitch is summoned back to his childhood home in
Montana, where he's caught up in the ordeal of his filial
obligation: ``You can't not go home again when someone is sitting
there dying.'' Mitch faces an ancient question un-
</P>
<P>
   earthed by a new generation, twisted to fit a new sensibility:
Dare we go home again?
</P>
<P>
   That's what Mitch asks himself when his father calls from
Montana:
</P>
<P>
   ``The old hated tone of voice. Lyle Rozier proclaiming he had
the world on a towrope and a downhill pull at last. Rubbing his
opposite ear as if the words had gone right through him, Mitch
winced into the phone that next morning. How many times had he
heard this, or something an awful lot like it?''
</P>
<P>
   But Mitch's reluctant reunion with his crusty old dad is flooded
with lingering family disappointments and secrets _ and the
revelation that Lyle wants to sell the family land to a gravel
company, rewriting his own life history in the process. Lexa comes
along for moral support but brings her sultry sister, world-weary
photographer Mariah McCaskill, who documents Lyle's deathwatch and
proves a bitter reminder of Lexa's unrooted angst. Their desperate
and disparate lives flow together when they hike into the mountains
on a sad journey to scatter Lyle's ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Three people, three intense relationships, three rivers.
``Mountain Time'' is the confluence: The very real familial clash
between Lyle and Mitch echoes the clash between the historic and
contemporary West, where exploitation has always been at odds with
environmental anxiety. But the reader also stands on the near bank
of a dynamic, flowing history in which men have both protected and
profaned the Western landscape, which is as much a character in
Doig's work as any McCaskill.
</P>
<P>
   Doig's poetic prose remains intact here, but for the first time
in his literary career he's pretty damned funny, too, especially
when he's satirizing the foibles and excesses of the Pacific
Northwest ``Cyberia'': ``The Cascopia (newspaper) building was in
Seattle's Fremont district, where the Sixties still roamed. The
hempen necessities of life were available there, as were cafes with
good rowdy names such as The Longshoreman's Daughter, plus deluxe
junk shops, plus bars that were museum pieces from the days when
hair was `Hair.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mountain Time'' will not dissuade those who rank Doig among
the best living American writers, and one might even begin making
comparisons to some of the best dead ones, too. Faulkner comes most
readily to mind: The Sartorises of Yoknapatawpha County are no more
troubled and no more human than the McCaskills of the Two Medicine
country in Montana. Two great rivers in different landscapes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  FICTION
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Time. By Ivan Doig. Simon &AMP; Schuster. $25. 316 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Poetic prose from the reigning master of new
Western literature.

 CARMELLO27-COX &HT;    Actress never got hobby out of her system
 &HT;    By Kathy Janich
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carolee Carmello left college in 1983 with a degree in business
administration. Then she opened on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't go quite like that, but the scenario isn't far from
the truth. Carmello's is a fairly incredible story of someone who
didn't do theater until late in college, didn't know an actors
union existed until she had to join it and has worked steadily ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   She has played some of the more interesting women in American
musical theater. The pragmatic Abigail Adams in a rousing revival
of ``1776.'' The second lesbian from next door in the funny, fatal
``Falsettos.'' And perhaps most importantly, Lucille Frank in the
stunning 1999 production of the Alfred Uhry musical ``Parade.''
</P>
<P>
   That show _ which tells the true and terrible story of Leo
Frank, accused of killing 13-year-old Mary Phagan at the Atlanta
Pencil Factory in 1913 _ earned her a Drama Desk award and a Tony
nomination. It's still dear to her heart. But something more
lighthearted has brought her to Atlanta this week. Carmello, 36,
plays Marguerite in ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' at the Fox Theatre
through Monday. Marguerite is the duplicitous (or is she?) woman
desired by two men: her husband, Percy (aka the Scarlet Pimpernel),
and her ex-lover, Percy's nemesis, Chauvelin.
</P>
<P>
   Carmello did ``Pimpernel'' in workshops. It went to Broadway
with another actress, and received mostly negative reviews. It ran
for a while, was briefly shuttered for rewrites and recasting, and
reopened to mostly favorable notices. Now in its third incarnation,
``Pimpernel'' is finishing a three-city summer tour here before
hitting Broadway again Sept. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' Carmello says, ``because it's like I'm getting a
second chance at it. I'm able to do the role now that they've
figured it out, and I don't have to do all of the legwork.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, between bites of fried green tomatoes at a
Midtown restaurant, Carmello took time to chat about ``Pimpernel,''
``Parade'' and her life on and offstage.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Her favorite moment in ``Pimpernel'': ``The sword fight, just
because I've never done it before. It doesn't involve any singing,
which is usually what I get paid for. So it's a break for me.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What's most difficult about playing Marguerite: ``Singing with
a French accent. The singing itself is not that difficult, but when
you add the way you have to manipulate your mouth and your throat
to make a French accent, it uses the muscles differently.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Why she and husband Gregg Edelman (a three-time Tony nominee)
work so often: ``We have the luck to have appearances that are
pretty flexible. We're not enormously tall. We don't look
especially like one nationality or another. And we have voices that
are pretty flexible, that can go from more legitimate things to
more pop things. And I really think it's luck.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Her family: She and Edelman live in Teaneck, N.J., with their
3 1/2-year-old daughter, Zoe. They once had a hamster. ``She didn't
live a long life, but hopefully it was a happy one.'' Carmello's
parents and three brothers still live in the Albany, N.Y., area.
None is in show business.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  How her theater thing got started: ``I was about to graduate
and was not really sure what I wanted to do. I was considering law
school, maybe an MBA. I had done theater as a hobby and never
considered it as a career. Ever. And this job offer came in to do a
summer thing at a dinner theater. So it was, `I'll just do it and
not worry about it. Get that out of my system.' I moved to New York
that fall to get it out of my system a little more, and I kept
working.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The ``Parade'' experience: ``Incredibly fulfilling and
incredibly frustrating. Frustrating in the sense that I wanted it
to go on for a longer time. That as an actor you have so little
control over your jobs and what happens to the shows. I was so
invested in it, body and soul. I so believed in it, and I still
do.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The future of ``Parade'': ``I don't think it will have the
broad appeal that something like `Scarlet Pimpernel' does. I hope
it will be one of those shows that's looked upon as ahead of its
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Scarlet Pimpernel''
</P>
<P>
   8 tonight and Monday; 2 and
</P>
<P>
   8 p.m. Saturday-Sunday. $15-$42. Theater of the Stars, Fox
Theatre, 660 Peachtree St. N.E. 404-817-8700.

 &HT;    Living legacy connecting with a new generation
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talking to June Carter Cash, you have to wonder why VH1's
``Behind the Music'' hasn't visited her for a profile. Or why she
wasn't up there, linked arm-in-arm, with Sarah McLachlan at Lilith
Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Because not only has the singer, faithfully wedded to Johnny
Cash for four decades, been there for the entire evolution of rock
'n' roll _ she played the Fox Theatre with Elvis Presley in the
mid-1950s _ she's part of one of the great female dynasties in
American music. Born into the Carter family, whose DNA equals
country music, Cash was touring with Mother Maybelle Carter and her
various kin when most kids her age were still in kindergarten.
Songs such as ``Will the Circle Be Unbroken?'' ``Meeting in the
Air'' and ``Diamonds in the Rough,'' all written by father A.P.
Carter, are as intrinsic to the country tradition as the timber
that built the Grand Ole Opry. And they all turn up on Cash's new
album, ``Press On'' (Risk/Small Hairy Dog), her first solo release
in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   Don't call it a comeback. Cash, who performs Saturday at the
Cotton Club, has long toured alongside her husband, the grave and
gravelly baritone who has been battling Shy-Drager syndrome, a
degenerative neurological disorder. Though the 67-year-old ``Man in
Black'' is at work on a new album, he has mostly retreated from the
stage. In a way, June Carter Cash, 70, has stepped into the gap,
picking up on the same Generation X fan base that responded
strongly to her husband's last two, career-juicing albums for Red
Hot Chili Peppers' producer Rick Rubin, ``American Recordings'' and
``Unchained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to these places John played when his last album
came out,'' says Cash, resting up at her family's Virginia retreat
after the recent death of her sister Anita, who was 66. ``Rick
liked us to play these little rock 'n' roll clubs. I played the
Bottom Line in New York, the Troubador in Los Angeles. That's what
they wanted me to do. I said, `Are you crazy? My name's Carter!'''
</P>
<P>
   Along with traditional Carter family numbers, Cash sings a batch
of original songs, oddly touching scraps of autobiography that mix
reflection with back porch humor _ a reminder that the singer used
to pay her bills as a comedian on radio and early television. And
she may do a few of those classic duets with ... Johnny Cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he feels good, he just kind of shows up,'' she says. ``If
he doesn't feel like it, I don't push him to do it. It just seems
like he keeps showing up. I don't think he'll miss Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   It was while the pair was on tour, playing a 1996 date at the
House of Blues in Los Angeles, that former Guns N' Roses manager
Vicky Hamilton got the idea to set up a recording deal for June.
``I was standing at the bar with Rick Rubin and Tom Petty,'' she
says, ``and we talked about how she kicked .... What's not to love?
She's the ideal American mom and grandmom, saint and singer and
famous family member. I grew up in West Virginia and had the
country roots to understand it. My mother and her sisters used to
sing those songs. Rick encouraged me to work with June. Up until
that point, I had been the metal maven.''
</P>
<P>
   Released on Hamilton's Small Hairy Dog label (June came up with
the name), ``Press On'' is one of the year's happier surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Q:Well, how's the tour going?
</P>
<P>
   A:All of my life I've been able to kick the ceiling if I wanted
to. I have been a vivacious kind of person. It's a fun show. It's
good. Somebody will push me to do some classic no one's really
heard. There's a whole generation that knows none of those songs.
It's poetry from a time these young people want to know about.
Though I don't think I'm so much older than they are. They truly
want to hear what I have to say.
</P>
<P>
   Q:You mentioned that you recorded your album with some of your
``ex-sons-in-law,'' Rodney Crowell and Marty Stuart. It's nice to
know you're still on good terms with everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A:The sons-in-law never go away, the ex-ones, they just come and
bring their new wives and sit at the table. And my daughters,
they'll get a new husband now and then. That's my fault. I'd say,
`I want you girls to get married; don't go running around. We've
had 15 marriages out of six daughters. That's a pretty good group.
Some of them are going around again. They marry their men. ...
Maybe that's better than doing it the way some people do it. ... I
started with one dining room. Now it takes three to get the whole
family in. They just don't go away. I'm proud of that. I love them.
</P>
<P>
   Q:The funniest of your new songs is written about your
granddaughter Tiffany Anastasia Lowe. (It warns the aspiring
actress to steer clear of ``Pulp Fiction'' director Quentin
Tarantino, who ``makes his women wild and mean.'')
</P>
<P>
   A:Tiffany Anastasia Lowe is 6 feet tall; she's just gorgeous.
She's here with us now. I had visions of her being out there in Los
Angeles in the same building as Quentin Tarantino. I was so afraid
she was going to run into him, and all I could think of was movies
he had done. Oh, Lord, Tiffany, get out of there!
</P>
<P>
   Q:How did you meet Johnny Cash?
</P>
<P>
   A:I heard a lot from Elvis about Johnny Cash. We were playing at
those theaters (throughout the South), and we'd stop in little
cafes, and he would always play Johnny's records. I came home one
night from New York (where she and her daughter Carlene were
living). I had to come to do the Opry. He just walked up to me
backstage and told me his name was Johnny Cash and he had always
wanted to meet me, had seen me on his high school trip to the Grand
Ole Opry. He wondered why we never worked together. I said, ``Maybe
you never asked me.'' It was 1961 before I worked any dates with
him. We always liked each other. It was not a convenient time for
our lives to be together. I've had a very good and wonderful life
with Johnny Cash. We've done everything we wanted to do and still
continue to do that. ``The Far Side of the Banks of Jordan,'' I do
love that song. It's just a promise of an eternal life together,
and if you're lucky enough to have a romance or love in your life
that is like Romeo and Juliet, then you've had a very special time.
And that doesn't happen to many people. We've had a very special
kind of life.

<P>
   UGLJARE, Yugoslavia _ Belated and confusing confirmation by NATO
forces in Kosovo that at least 15 bodies were found in a mass grave
site in the east of the province a month ago prompted the Yugoslav
government on Thursday to blame NATO for what it called a mass
killing of Serbs and to demand that the Security Council review the
situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The grave site _ at a lonely spot in a steep valley between the
Albanian villages of Ugljare and Podgrade _ gave little clue
Thursday as to the veracity of the accusations swirling around it.
The controversy apparently stemmed from a statement issued
Wednesday by the NATO force in Kosovo that at least four of the
bodies found at the site were those of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   That statement was retracted Thursday, and no firm details were
offered on the exhumation of the bodies by investigators from the
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. American soldiers
found the bodies on July 24 after local people reported their
existence.
</P>
<P>
   This investigation in eastern Kosovo is the only instance known
where the war crimes tribunal is involved in investigating killings
that may have been committed by Albanians against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government used Wednesday's statement about Serb
victims as what it terms further proof that the NATO-led force in
Kosovo and the U.N. administration here are failing to protect the
few remaining Serbs. It reiterated its demand that Yugoslav forces
be allowed to move in to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, called for an
urgent session of the U.N. Security Council to discuss reports of
the mass grave site and accused the NATO-led force, known by its
acronym KFOR, of covering up the discovery, the Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the U.S. KFOR troops, in whose area this crime
against humanity was discovered, knew about the case on July 24 and
have concealed it from the international public ever since
indicates an intention to cover up this revolting massacre,''
Tanjug said, citing a Foreign Ministry statement.
</P>
<P>
   Amplifying the statement from NATO forces on Wednesday, Maj.
Erik Gunnars, public affairs officer at the American troops' base
at Gniljane, in eastern Kosovo, said Thursday that the 15 bodies
discovered appeared to include Albanians killed during the war over
the province, as well as Serbs killed after hostilities ceased.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Risley, spokesman for the tribunal in The Hague, said by
telephone from the Netherlands that two of the bodies might be
those of two Serbs who went missing after NATO troops arrived in
Kosovo in June. Risley said, however, that the tentative
identification was based only on a description of the clothes worn
by the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Some, if not all, of the dead appear to have been executed, said
Capt. Larry Kaminski, another spokesman for the American forces in
Gniljane. If the victims were civilians killed by an armed party,
the killings would constitute a war crime, Risley said. Revenge
killings or straight criminal acts would not be prosecuted as war
crimes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, spokesmen for the NATO-led force in Pristina, the
provincial capital, said they could not confirm Wednesday's
statement that four of the victims were Serbs. They said they had
no information as to whether any of the bodies found were those of
Serbs or Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Lying amid the dust and stones of the grave site are scraps of
human hair, what appear to be vertebrae, and several black plastic
bags. Flies and a heavy sickly smell still hang over the site.
</P>
<P>
   Nexhmedin Mustafa, a young farmer from the nearby village of
Podgrade, said he came to the site before the bodies were removed.
``The graves were very shallow,'' he said. ``I saw a leg sticking
out here. You could see the clothes of some of them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of the bodies was that of a child between 7 and 10,
he estimated. He also said he had seen spent cartridges on the
ground just yards from the graves.
</P>
<P>
   Local villagers showed an uncomfortable silence when asked about
the grave site. Most denied knowledge of its existence, although
they recounted in detail other deaths in the region during the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if they were Serb or Albanian,'' said Ekrem
Sherifi, of Podgrade. ``We were thrown out of our village during
the war. We weren't here when it happened.''

film. Little in ``American Pie'' deserves honest laughs. (Bob
Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes. C+

<P>
   ``Better Than Chocolate'' Unrated, but contains nudity
</P>
<P>
   and sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wendy Crewson
</P>
<P>
   and Karyn Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny but badly scattered gay romantic comedy. The Canadian
comedy follows the love lives of a group of lesbians connected to a
book store called Ten Percent. Full of subplots, it's hard to
actively dislike. But like a puppy, it's sloppy and hyper and badly
in need of discipline. (SM)1 hour, 43 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Heather Donahue,
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Leonard and Michael Williams.
</P>
<P>
   It's a journey into the kind of terror that comes from trying to
glimpse something in the shadows just beyond the campfire. Three
students head into the woods to document an 18th-century witch
tale, then disappear. The movie wrings chills out of the slightest
effects _ odd twiglike contraptions hanging from trees, a pile of
stones, strange noises in the night _ but its power comes from
psychological intensity. (SM) 1 hour, 27 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Bowfinger'' PG-13 (sex-related material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Steve Martin,
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin has come up with a beautiful premise for a movie.
Martin plays a hapless Hollywood producer with a stinky script and
a gem of a way to get it filmed with impossible-to-get megastar Kit
Ramsey (Eddie Murphy). ``Bowfinger's'' got a few good laughs but
not much more. Sadly, it never takes on Hollywood with the zing of
``Wag the Dog'' or ``The Player.''

   (Bob Longino)1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokedown Palace'' PG-13 (violent content, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Claire Danes,
</P>
<P>
   Kate Beckinsale and Bill Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers prison drama. Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale
sweat it out in a Thai maximum-security pit after being duped into
dope smuggling. Unbearably high-minded, the movie doesn't even have
the B-movie juice of an old babes-behind-bars melodrama. (SM) 1
hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Blue Sea'' R (excessive gore, dismemberment)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   There is precious little that is original about this movie. It
really doesn't matter, though. When the plot kicks in and the
killer shark starts prowling and munching, the film delivers all
the thrills, explosive action and sheer gore that audiences have
come to expect from the shark genre. (Hap Erstein, Cox News
Service) 1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit Rock City'' R (brief nudity, sexuality, drug use,
</P>
<P>
   profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Furlong
</P>
<P>
   and Sam Huntington.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss it off. This lame rip-off of Robert Zemeckis' ``I Wanna
Hold Your Hand'' chronicles the misadventures of four die-hard Kiss
fans as they try to crash their idols' concert. Set in 1978, the
film has a few amusing nostalgic touches, but mostly it's a sorry
collection of adolescent fantasies that look almost quaint compared
to what else is going on in teen movies this summer. (ERG) 1 hour,
30 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte
</P>
<P>
   and Jacques Villeret.
</P>
<P>
   A feast of foolishness. A bunch of snotty Paris yuppies holds a
weekly dinner to see who can bring the biggest idiot as his guest.
Publisher Thierry Lhermitte thinks he's got a sure thing when he
meets Jacques Villeret who builds scale-model monuments out of
matchsticks. But fate intervenes when Lhermitte throws out his back
and is forced to spend the evening with Villeret. (ERG) 1 hour, 22
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``A Dog of Flanders'' PG (mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Not a total dog but close. A Dutch touch is about all that
distinguishes this adaptation of a 19th-century children's book
about an orphan boy who befriends the titular canine and dreams of
one day becoming an artist. Filmed on location in Flanders, the
movie abounds with windmills and picturesque town squares. What it
lacks, alas, are interesting characters and a decent story line.
(ERG) 1 hour, 50 minutes. C-''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' PG (mild comic action violence,
</P>
<P>
   profanity, innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Sarah Jessica Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' is just plain wrong-headed. Based on one of
the weaker elements of Jay Ward's TV 'toon series ``The Bullwinkle
Show,'' this live-action takeoff has so much less to offer. Brendan
Fraser (``George of the Jungle'') plays Dudley and it's clear he'd
rather not be here. There's not one joke or one slapstick moment
that's funny. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 27 minutes (including a new
``Fractured Fairy Tales'' cartoon short). F+
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Eyes Wide Shut'' R (profanity, sexual content, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   drug-related material)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Nicole Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   The late Stanley Kubrick's final film is a letdown _ an often
frustrating peephole view at jealousy and sexual obsession that
confronts a rich New York couple (Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman).
While it has its moments, its much-touted centerpiece orgy doesn't
work. What you get resembles Cirque du Soleil as performed by the
cast of ``Showgirls.'' (SM)2 hours, 35 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haunting'' PG-13 (intense horror sequences)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Zeta-Jones and Lili Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Scary in all the worst ways. ``The Haunting'' is a Hollywood
debacle, an overpriced mess with only one scare in it. That scare
is of the old-fashioned ``boo'' variety. It has nothing to do with
the over-the-top computer effects that make this less a remake of
the 1963 classic than a theme park in search of a script. (SM) 1
hour, 53 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Illuminata'' R (profanity, sex and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Turturro,
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Borowitz , Susan Sarandon
</P>
<P>
   and Christopher Walken.
</P>
<P>
   For the seriously stage-struck. John Turturro's film chronicles
the shenanigans of a turn-of-the-century New York theatrical group.
The company's leading lady (Katherine Borowitz) has both radiant
talent and infinite patience when it comes to her beloved's
(Turturro) unfinished play. Susan Sarandon has fun as a purringly
self-assured diva. A bit fussy and overdone, but there are moments
of magic. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' R (profanity, sensuality, some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances. Omar Epps is quite good as the detective, but LL Cool
J is a revelation as the ruthless drug kingpin, a monster made all
the scarier by his seeming benevolent charm. (SM) 1 hour, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' PG (wacky violence, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   The best gag is the first one in Disney's big-screen version of
TV's popular animated part-human, part-machine, mucho-gizmo lawman.
Matthew Broderick is perfectly cast as Gadget. Rupert Everett goes
over the top as bad man Sanford Solex. Kids will enjoy watching
them both. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 20 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' PG (mild violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Aniston and Harry Connick Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Nice story for kids, nifty look for adults. In 1957, a giant
metal-eating robot crash-lands on Earth and is befriended by
9-year-old Hogarth. But the robot's trail of munched-on trucks and
grain silos attracts a super-paranoid government agent. The
interesting mix of voice talent in this animated film includes
Jennifer Aniston as Hogarth's mom and Harry Connick Jr. as a
beatnik with seductive Elvis eyes. (ERG) 1 hour, 24 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mickey Blue Eyes'' PG-13 (profanity, some violence
</P>
<P>
   and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant, James Caan
</P>
<P>
   and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   An effete British auctioneer (Hugh Grant) experiences culture
clash when he finds himself married to the mob, literally. Call it
a sleeping-with-the-fish-out-of-water comedy. Grant's one-trick
performance as an elegant bumbler is treadworn. He's terrific at
it, yes. But it's time to show more range. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes.

   ``The Muse'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Albert Brooks,
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Stone
</P>
<P>
   and Andie MacDowell.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Brooks wrote, directed and stars in this Hollywood fable
about a veteran screenwriter who's ``lost his edge'' and is sent to
an honest-to-the-gods Muse (Sharon Stone) for inspiration. Stone is
delicious. She plays her Muse as a mix of material girl, expert
networker and distracted spoiled child. In other words, she's
modeled her after half of Hollywood. (ERG)1 hour, 37 minutes. A-

<P>
   ``Mystery Men'' PG-13 (comic action violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, Geoffrey Rush,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Janeane Garofalo.
</P>
<P>
   It's a spoof! It's an adventure! No, it's an amiable mess. Ben
Stiller and Janeane Garofalo headline a ragmuffin team of superhero
wannabes. But the movie is mostly like its hapless heroes _ kind of
clumsy and good intentioned but with none of the knack it takes to
save the day, or itself. (SM)2 hours, 1 minute. C+

   ``Run Lola Run'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Franka Potente
</P>
<P>
   and Moritz Bleibtreu.
</P>
<P>
   A pyrotechnic celebration of style over substance, this
adrenalin-fueled German flick is the big-screen love child of every
video game and MTV quick-cut editing trick of the past 10 years.
Franka Potente plays the flame-haired woman who has 20 minutes to
run through Berlin in search of 100,000 marks, or lose her lover.
In German with English subtitles. (SM)1 hour, 21 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG)1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) 1 hour, 47
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM)1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching Mrs. Tingle'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   teen drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Helen Mirren, Katie Holmes, Barry Watson and Marisa
Coughlan.
</P>
<P>
   It barely makes a passing grade. Three high school kids take
their evil history teacher hostage in her home and then try to
figure out how to get out of the mess they've created. It ends up
being a wishy-washy remake of 1980's silly ``Nine to Five.'' As the
tied-up teach, Helen Mirren is pretty good. Her young co-stars,
however, fail to match her talent. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 35 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes cheesy movies can be great fun. That's true of this
rip-roaring yarn about a medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas)
who's drafted by a roving gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a
Norse village from a mysterious enemy that comes from the mist,
kills everything in sight and leaves a trail of headless corpses.
This flick hits the ground running and never stops. (ERG)1 hour, 43
minutes. B

<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The Imax film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)
40 minutes. B-

<P>
   ``trick'' R (sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and mature themes)Starring Christian Campbell
</P>
<P>
   and John Paul Pitoc.
</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Universal Soldier:
</P>
<P>
   The Return'' R (violence, profanity, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, Michael Jai White and Bill
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   It's loud, it's brutal and, unfortunately, not packed with
enough fun. This is a return to Jean-Claude Van Damme's 1992
``Universal Soldier,'' in which dead military guys are turned into
chiseled, nearly unstoppable, cyborglike warriors. This time he's
got to battle wrestling's Bill Goldberg and a monstrously buffed
Michael Jai White. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 22 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Wolves'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary.
</P>
<P>
   Not as visually stunning as some Imax films, this is a highly
instructive look at the once nearly vanquished gray wolf's gradual
reintroduction to Yellowstone National Park and other parts of the
American West. Covers a bit too much ground, historically and
geographically; the best parts show wolves ranging from adult pack
leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.
(Jill Vejnoska) 41 minutes. B-

<P>
   ``The Wood'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps,
</P>
<P>
   Taye Diggs and Richard T. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Friendship is what sets this movie apart from the usual genre
pigeonholing of African-American cliches and becomes something much
more universal. It's a male-bonding flick that transcends issues of
race. (SM) 1 hour, 46 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu:
</P>
<P>
   The Sent-Down Girl'' R (strong sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lu Lu Lopsang.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Chen demonstrates a real director's touch in eliciting rich
performances in this tale of a Chinese girl relocated to the
Tibetan outback. Chen gets maximum effect from the gorgeous but
indifferent landscape of her locations. The story's emotional
bleakness will limit its appeal, but it's a rigorous piece of work.
Beautifully shot and acted but brutal in its view of human nature,
it's an art-house, feel-bad film. (SM) 1 hour, 39 minutes. B

 &HT;    Clever `Muse' a comedic inspiration
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought you couldn't take any more of Hollywood's
self-absorbed navel-gazing, along comes Albert Brooks' perversely
amusing ``The Muse.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer-director-star plays Steven Phillips, a longtime
screenwriter who, as everyone keeps telling him, has suddenly
``lost his edge.'' Over lunch, a baby-suit at Paramount informs him
that his three-picture deal is kaput and he's got to get off the
lot by 5 because ``Brian De Palma needs your office.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Steven's old friend and fellow scribe, Jack (Jeff
Bridges exuding Hollywood insider self-confidence), has a tip. It's
a little, um, unusual, but it worked for Jack. He introduces Steven
to Sarah (Sharon Stone), a genuine honest-to-the-gods Muse. As in,
one of the nine daughters of Zeus.
</P>
<P>
   Before you can say Mighty Aphrodite, Sarah has taken over
Steven's life and his bank account. As she explains to him, her job
is to inspire. And in Hollywood, inspiration doesn't come cheap.
She demands everything from a $1,700-a-night suite at the Four
Seasons to hand-delivered (by Steven) Waldorf salads at 2 a.m. And,
of course, there's the constant stream of trinkets in little
Tiffany's boxes, proffered by such grateful clients as Rob Reiner,
Martin Scorsese, Wolfgang Puck and James Cameron (``Don't go near
the water,'' Cameron muses on his way out. ``So no sequel.'')
</P>
<P>
   As is so often true with Brooks' films, his framework is funnier
than his follow-through.
</P>
<P>
   Once Steven meets his Muse, the movie, well, loses a little of
its edge. It becomes a broader satire, of everything from marriage
to writer's block. When Sarah advises Steven's wife (Andie
MacDowell) on how to start her own cookie business, the two begin
arguing over her as if she were their couples therapist.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a cheerful, kind-spirited lunacy throughout the
movie. And sometimes it's downright hilarious. Especially when
Brooks is satirizing his home turf. When Steven's little daughter
asks if she can star in one of Daddy's movies, he replies, ``Of
course, honey. As soon as you're an older man.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks clearly loves comedy. All sorts of comedy. An exchange at
a Spago's party is a pitch-perfect re-creation of the rhythms and
non sequiturs of a Marx brothers routine. A scene where Steven
tries to learn more about this Muse thing from Jack takes place
during a tennis game as Jack blithely serves about 30 balls into
the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse'' is a lot like Brooks' sense of humor _ subtle,
self-deprecating, off-the-wall clever.
</P>
<P>
   In these days of broad bodily fluid gags, it's almost a miracle
of composure and craftsmanship. And as for Stone, as anyone who saw
her more than a decade ago in ``Irreconcilable Differences''
already knows, she's as comfortable with comedy as she is with
crossing her legs. She plays Sarah as a shrewd mixture of
gold-digging material girl, expert A-list networker and distracted,
spoiled child.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she's modeled her after at least half of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Muse''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Albert Brooks, Sharon Stone and Andie MacDowell.
Directed by Brooks. Rated PG-13 for language, sexual innuendo and a
brief glimpse of Stone's nude back. At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict:
</P>
<P>
   Always amusing, sometimes hilarious.

   COMEDY
</P>
<P>
   `Dudley' rides into a fiasco
</P>
<P>
   By Bob Longino
</P>
<P>
   ``Dudley Do-Right'' is plain wrongheaded.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's based on one of the weaker elements of Jay Ward's
immensely creative TV cartoon series ``The Bullwinkle Show.'' But
this big-screen, live-action takeoff of the witless Canadian
Mountie character has much less to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Brendan Fraser, who starred in the surprisingly successful
live-action takeoff of Ward's ``George of the Jungle,'' is Dudley,
and it's clear that he'd rather be anywhere but here. Ditto Sarah
Jessica Parker, who plays Nell Fenwick. As Snidely Whiplash, Alfred
Molina (the crazed drug dealer in ``Boogie Nights'') tries real
hard to inject some life into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the story finds Whiplash creating a fake gold rush so
he can take over a Canadian town and overcharge the suckers who
come panning for fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing's funny: not one joke, not one slapstick moment, not one
innuendo.
</P>
<P>
   One example of not funny: A tribe of Kumquat Indians emerges to
clog and tap-dance. The punch line: ``This is `Riverdance.'''

<P>
   Good-hearted `Chocolate' has plot meltdown
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Than Chocolate'' is like a puppy that wants you to pet
it and play with it and hug it and squeeze it and pet it again.
It's cute and eager, but after a while you want it to calm down or
go away.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian comedy follows the love lives of a group of
lesbians connected to a bookstore called Ten Percent. Maggie (Karyn
Dwyer) is a recent college dropout who finds love with a sketch
artist named Kim (Christina Cox), who moves in. The problem is that
Maggie's newly divorced mother, Lila (Wendy Crewson), also moves
in, along with Maggie's teenage brother; neither knows that Maggie
likes girls.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its coming-out-to-family story, the movie throws in a
scad of subplots. There's the bookstore's neurotic owner, Frances
(Ann-Marie MacDonald), whose shipments are being seized by
authorities on obscenity charges (even a volume of ``Little Red
Riding Hood''). Then there's the graceful transsexual Judy (Peter
Outerbridge), who lusts after Frances and becomes pals with Lila,
who remains clueless as to Judy/Jeremy's gender flux. Then uptight
Lila discovers the joy of sex toys. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chocolate'' wants to be a cousin of ``Tales of the City,'' or
a lighter spin on Pedro Almodovar's wacky sex comedies. But
screenwriter Peggy Thomson and director Anne Wheeler never decide
what the movie is really about. In an attempt to give the sunny,
slipshod plot some heft, the script throws in politics and an
explosive ending that's more of a sputter. ``Chocolate'' is hard to
actively dislike. But like a puppy, it's sloppy and hyper, and
badly needs some discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better Than
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Wendy Crewson and Karyn Dwyer. Unrated, but contains
nudity and sexual situations.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 43 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A sunny but badly scattered gay romantic comedy.

<P>
   Painting a hokey, heartfelt picture
</P>
<P>
   By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
</P>
<P>
   A flavorful Dutch touch is about all that distinguishes ``A Dog
of Flanders,'' a pedestrian and, at times, thoroughly kitschy
adaptation of a semi-classic children's book written in 1872.
Filmed on location in Flanders, the picture abounds with windmills,
thatched-roof cottages and delightful Old European town squares.
What it lacks, alas, is interesting characters and a decent story
line.
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of 19th-century children's literature, the story
focuses on a poor but plucky orphan, Nello (Jeremy James Kissner,
then Jesse James), who lives with his ailing grandfather (Jack
Warden, hamming it up to high heaven) and dreams of being an
artist. One day he rescues the titular canine after it's been
abused and left for dead by its master. The two become best buddies
and roam the city delivering milk to pay the rent. But they always
work in a stop to worship at the statue of Peter Paul Rubens.
That's where Nello meets Michel La Grande (Jon Voight), a
celebrated local artist who takes a special interest in the boy,
for his character as much as for his talent.
</P>
<P>
   Give the film credit for having the courage _ if that's the word
_ to stage a scene between a delirious Nello (he's been out in the
snow all night) and the ghost of his idol, Rubens. Not exactly the
usual fare for kids weaned on Spice Girls and ``Star Wars.'' But
even there the picture fumbles, turning the encounter into a kind
of ``Touched by an Angel'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Dog of Flanders''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jon Voight. Directed by Kevin Brodie. Rated PG for mild
violence.
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 50 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Not a total dog, but close.

BUSH PROMOTES READING AT SOUTH CAROLINA SCHOOL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Royall Elementary School is cq) 
 
By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, S.C. _ Gov. George W. Bush took his mantra on reading
to one of this state's most successful elementary schools Thursday,
telling pupils what he has preached across Texas: that the ability
to read is the foundation for learning.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush was preaching to the choir at Royall Elementary School,
one of four stops he made on the second day of a three-day swing
through the South. The 520-student campus has won national and
state awards for reading and writing initiatives as far back as
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his wife, Laura, toured the school, visiting a
classroom and then stopping in the school library where Bush was
stumped by one child's question: ``What was your favorite book in
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Willie Mays Story,'' Bush said, but then admitted that
wasn't a book. He fished for answers, then settled on a history
textbook from the fourth grade, though he couldn't remember the
title.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pupils, though, had far more pressing concerns _
crime and gun control. The concerns were never voiced aloud during
the tour; rather fifth-graders asked their questions in letters
they presented the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to ask him to take all the guns away so nobody will
get shot or killed,'' said Ernest Dargan, a fifth-grader who said
he lost a cousin to street gang violence three years ago when
Dargan lived in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Several others echoed the gun-control sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Several students said they had witnessed the growing problem of
weapons in U.S. schools in 1992, when one youngster suffered a
gunshot wound to the leg after his backpack, in which he had
stashed a handgun, fell off his desk and discharged.
</P>
<P>
   Another fifth-grade pupil, Joanna Hutto, said her major concern
is capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is elected president, she wanted to know, ``will he be
as tough on crime as he is in Texas? .... Will he do the same thing
and kill people who kill others?''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has the most prolific record in the country in carrying
out executions, and she thinks Bush ``should do a little less than
that, because I think that's a little strict.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush emphasized his message of local control
on education matters to a crowd of about 400 at the Myrtle Beach
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions at that event, Bush said he is not
opposed to posting of the 10 commandments in public school
classrooms, but he said that is a decision to be made by local
officials, not the federal government.

 &HT;    `13th Warrior' fights to the finish
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes cheesy movies can be great cheesy fun. That's
certainly the case with ``The 13th Warrior,'' a rip-roaring,
blood-running yarn that hits the ground running and never stops to
take a breath (or to form a coherent thought, which of course is
irrelevent in flicks like this).
</P>
<P>
   Sometime around the turn of the millennium _ the previous
millennium _ a limpid-eyed Arab poet (played by limpid-eyed Antonio
Banderas) is banished from Baghdad and handed a bogus job as an
ambassador. He runs into some randy roving Vikings _ sort of like a
poetry major stumbling into a frat party _ and finds himself
drafted as their 13th warrior. Their mission? To rescue some fellow
Norse villagers from a mysterious and deadly enemy that comes out
of the mist, kills everything in sight and leaves a gory trail of
gnawed-on, headless corpses.
</P>
<P>
   Neato. Really. Once you get past the inevitable echoes of Monty
Python (``The Tartars are coming! Run for your lives!''), this
movie just goes for it. And goes for it. And goes for it. You feel
as if you're back at a Saturday afternoon matinee, with all that
nonstop cliff-hanger action and oooh-scary hints of something out
there in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   Director John McTiernan (``The Hunt for Red October'')
reportedly had control of the production taken from him by Michael
Crichton, from whose 1976 ``Eaters of the Dead'' the movie is
adapted. With Crichton's name (``Jurassic Park,'' ``Rising Sun'')
attached, the producers may have been hoping for something a little
more respectable. But who needs respectable when you're having this
much mindless fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th
</P>
<P>
   Warrior''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas. Directed by John McTiernan. Rated R
for violence. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   43 minutes.
</P>

   The verdict: Pure cheese and pure entertainment.

 &HT;    A casualty of the Cultural Revolution
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rolling clouds that press down on the lonely grasslands of
Tibet become a resonant visual metaphor for the heroine of ``Xiu
Xiu: The Sent-Down Girl.'' When we meet Wenxiu (Lu Lu) _ nicknamed
Xiu Xiu _ she's an eager teenager who happily leaves the city as
part of the Chinese government's Cultural Revolution (the film is
set in 1975). She appears to have the whole world spread out before
her, but by movie's end her horizons have darkened and drastically
narrowed.
</P>
<P>
   A Communist experiment meant to erase class barriers by mixing
the wealthy with the poor, this ``sending-down'' process relocates
Xiu Xiu to the Tibetan outback, where she learns to ride horses
with other young people. Early on, the Communist ideal is mocked in
a scene that has these transplanted teens watching a propaganda
film espousing the virtues of group effort. When the projector
breaks down, one guy uses the momentary darkness to grope Xiu Xiu _
which sparks fighting and shoving among the whole cluster of
``comrades.'' Here, director Joan Chen shrewdly encapsulates the
problems of a high-minded cultural dogma that refuses to
acknowledge the baser, animal instincts of its people.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Xiu Xiu is deprived of even the rowdy pleasures of her
fellow teenagers' hormones. She's reassigned to the open
grasslands, where she shares a tent with Lao Jin (Lopsang), who is
supposed to teach her to herd horses. A laconic, stony loner, Lao
Jin is the butt of gossip and ridicule because he was reportedly
castrated during a long-ago skirmish. That news doesn't really
reassure the girl, and Chen keeps the possibility of danger brewing
in the actors' scenes. But the heart of the movie turns out to be
something like a love story between the teenager and the outcast
... if a very depressing love story.
</P>
<P>
   As the girl slowly realizes that the dreams of the Cultural
Revolution have disintegrated, leaving her stranded, ``Xiu Xiu''
becomes a deepeningly grim drama about innocence not only lost but
ruthlessly exploited. Shot guerrilla-style by Chen, the movie made
headlines when the Chinese government denounced the
actress-turned-director for making the film on the sly, eluding or
misleading on-set censors who would probably have shut down her
dark drama if they'd known what it was really about. (An occasional
narrative choppiness seems to be the result of this
shoot-on-the-fly strategy.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie deserves to be remembered for more than this. Chen
demonstrates a real director's touch in eliciting rich performances
from her actors. She gets maximum effect from the gorgeous but
indifferent landscape of her locations. The story's emotional
bleakness will limit its appeal, and an overexplicit score
underlines and weakens the movie's punch. But it is a rigorous
piece of work. Beautifully shot and acted, but brutal in its view
of human nature, it's an art-house, feel-bad film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xiu Xiu:
</P>
<P>
   The Sent-Down Girl''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lu Lu and Lopsang. Rated R for strong sexual content. 1
hour, 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An accomplished but deeply depressing political
parable.

 &HT;    An American saga of dreams deferred
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Aug. 29
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``On September 24, 1943, at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas, army
captain James T. Quirk received a telegram advising him that his
wife, Elizabeth, had given birth that morning in Philadelphia to
their first child, a son.''
</P>
<P>
   The words are intentionally flat, straightforward in their
factuality, without hint of the future. But the son born 56 years
ago next month would be the lone witness to a familiar American
tragedy. Rory Quirk was James and Elizabeth Quirk's only child, and
the legatee to dreams that never quite came true. The story he
tells in ``Wars and Peace: The Memoir of an American Family'' is on
one level his story, on another his parents' and, on still another
level, the story of a generation that sacrificed without complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Quirk is an eloquent writer but to say he tells this story is
only partly true. ``Wars and Peace'' is built upon wartime letters
his father and mother exchanged, first during World War II and then
during Korea. Theirs was the informal eloquence of a husband and a
wife, intimate and yet keenly observant of events that were
transforming their lives and the world. James Quirk, in particular,
had a gift for portraiture in words and pithy summation. Of Gen.
George Patton, whom he served as press attache (and admired
greatly), he wrote Elizabeth during the Battle of the Bulge:
</P>
<P>
   ``He is tall, baldish, with white bushy eyebrows over
penetrating eyes, a chin like a rock and a small, thin-lipped mouth
which relaxes into sort of a grin when he is pleased. ... He is
quite interesting with a fine historical knowledge, a real
consciousness of that fact that he has his place in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the letters _ which are placed at the Harry S. Truman
Library in Independence, Mo. _ belie a bittersweet truth their son
would understand only after his parents had gone to their graves.
</P>
<P>
   James and Elizabeth had been sweethearts during the Depression
and a young married couple living in Philadelphia when World War II
broke out. Like thousands of others in their generation, they were
shareholders in the American Dream: a house of their own, a family,
building a life together in peace and relative prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that they would realize a generous measure of that
dream. But the promises they made each other in their letters would
be continually deferred. They wanted only to be together as a
family, and seldom were.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any quantitative, material measure,'' Rory Quirk writes,
``their dreams came true. At a qualitative cost. Their
much-anticipated reunion and the hopes of lazy, rainy Sundays ended
up among the casualties _ spiritual intangibles absent from the
material cornucopia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rory Quirk, a lawyer in Washington, came into possession of his
parents' letters (most are from his father, writing home from the
front) 30 years ago while fighting his own generation's war, this
one in Vietnam. His mother had died six years earlier, in 1963. His
father, after he left the military, became a newspaper executive
and, later, the first publisher of TV Guide. He made money, knew
important people and was away on business a lot. Now, in 1969, Rory
Quirk's father was also dead, the victim of a heart attack he
suffered in an airport. James Quirk was 57.
</P>
<P>
   He was away at war when his son was born and when a single red
candle was planted in his son's first birthday cake. He was still
in Europe when his son turned 2, and through the next decade, with
the war over, he was always somewhere. He missed baseball games and
school functions. More years passed, and then the son was away _
``off to college, off to war.'' When he came home, it was his
parents' letters he was left with.
</P>
<P>
   As a testament, they are haunting in their lyricism and
affecting in their simplicity. His mother's salutation was always
``Dear James.'' His father's was always ``Darling.'' In September
of 1944, Elizabeth Quirk wrote her husband that she was planning
his homecoming dinner (``It will all be just like you said'') and
reported that his son's first birthday party had been a grand time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the cake, Rory ``had his usual Pablum and junk, and we
had chicken salad and potato salad and devilled eggs. ...''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the domestic happiness of those years was always the
anxiety. Three months earlier, as the invasion of Normandy was
under way, Elizabeth wrote her husband: ``I was so keyed up that I
never went to bed at all and just stuck with WIP (a radio station)
and Mutual til dawn, then showered and dressed, and went to church
to offer my aimless little prayer for all the guys _ most
especially my own.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as she wrote, James Quirk was in a landing craft crossing
the English Channel:
</P>
<P>
   ``Going ashore on a long low coastline with a ridge of low
hills. No trouble except that a craft about 200 yards from us went
up with a mighty roar and we all became a bit white-faced as we
ducked the wreckage. A big ship is firing monotonously off to our
right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only say that I love you very much and shall be home to
you safely. I hope that Rory will be proud of his father and you of
your man.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be years before Rory Quirk took the time to sift
through his parents' letters, reading them one by one. There was an
element of what psychologists might call denial. ``My grief over my
father's death,'' he writes, ``eroded into resignation and
ultimately into nothingness. I squirreled it away in the deepest
recesses of memory.'' And then, one night in 1990, he and his
family went to a movie. ``The film was `Field of Dreams.' At the
end, when Kevin Costner played catch with his long-dead dad in the
cornfield Valhalla, I cried. My children had never seen me cry. We
rode home in embarrassed silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the letters, the son had taken possession of the
dreams James and Elizabeth Quirk nursed through two wars and would
only partly realize. When others marvel at his willingness to
volunteer at his children's school and to coach his son's baseball
team, he knows it's something deeper than good-guy altruism. He
reads his father's letters, and knows there are dreams to be lived
now and not later.

 &HT;    No embellishment needed for `Justice'
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Filmmakers often give history a little goosing, a nip and tuck
here and there to make their subjects seem more, well, historical.
</P>
<P>
   Or hysterical in the case of ``Strange Justice,'' a new Showtime
movie about the sexual harassment charges Anita Hill made against
her former boss, Supreme Court Justice nominee Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The agonizing 1991 Senate confirmation hearings brimmed with
memorably graphic testimony about stray pubic hairs and X-rated
film stars, and packed enough built-in drama to keep the nation
riveted to its TV screens for days.
</P>
<P>
   But working from a book by two Wall Street Journal reporters
about the Thomas-Hill episode, director Ernest Dickerson takes the
real-life story over the top. Then he just keeps on going.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Delroy Lindo (``Get Shorty'') as Thomas and Regina
Taylor (``I'll Fly Away'') as Hill, both actors credibly evoke the
physical and verbal tics of their alter egos.
</P>
<P>
   Although taller and thinner than Thomas, Lindo has the justice's
edgy presence and clipped monotone down pat. And Taylor is a Hill
look-alike who conjures up the law professor's prim, unblinking
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   The early scenes are staged the way most of us remember the
hearings, with Thomas and Hill making separate he said/she said
appearances in an ornate Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly, whoosh-bang sound effects whisk us away to some
badly lit parallel universe where facts and common sense are on
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson's direction is more indulgent than insightful, adding
to his reputation for overwrought camera work that he earned as
longtime cinematographer for Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When Lindo utters the judge's now-famous remark comparing the
hearings to a ``high-tech lynching,'' we see him barefoot and
bare-chested, yanking on his necktie as if it's a hangman's noose.
</P>
<P>
   During Hill's testimony, Taylor explodes in a tearful rant. One
moment she's yelling uncontrollably at a row of faceless senators,
then she's idly humming a tune to herself. Neither event ever
happened, and these surrealistic scenes don't help us understand
Thomas' or Hill's inner motivations. It just make them look nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the bizarre flights of fancy, the rest of ``Strange
Justice'' holds up well, thanks to performances by the considerably
more restrained cast.
</P>
<P>
   There are brief cameos by Paul Winfield in a fright wig as a
grumpy, soap opera-watching Justice Thurgood Marshall. Louis
Gossett Jr. mails in his stint as Washington rainmaker Vernon
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Mandy Patinkin is solid as the sharklike Ken Duberstein, a
spinmeister for President Bush, who plays den mother to the
embattled appointee. There are also several engaging scenes that
underscore how special interest groups latched onto the Thomas
hearings to advance their own political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, this movie winds up taking cinematic license with a
tawdry historical episode that was already stranger, and more
interesting, than any fiction.

 &HT;    Veterans of Emory University's college bowl teams hit it big on
the game show circuit _ and now `Want to Be Millionaires'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They thought they were just having fun, those quiz
whiz kids of Emory University's College Bowl teams of the 1980s, if
you define fun as memorizing lists of all the Pulitzer
Prize-winning novels or the geologic eras in order.
</P>
<P>
   But they were really in training _ serious trivia training _ to
go on quiz shows like ``Jeopardy!'' and, now, this summer's hottest
show, ABC's ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,'' and win hundreds of
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what College Bowl trains you for, is to become a
professional game show contestant,'' says Todd Leopold, who was on
Emory's team from 1982 to 1986 and later on ``Jeopardy!''
</P>
<P>
   Leopold's former teammate, Norman ``Trip'' Payne, an Atlanta
crossword puzzle writer, won $32,000 on ``Millionaire'' near the
beginning of the show's highly rated two-week run, which ends
Sunday. Coincidentally, another teammate, Dr. Margaret Stone, a
Lawrenceville dermatologist, was watching ``Millionaire'' at home
the night Payne won. She knew something about winning _ she's a
former ``Jeopardy!'' Tournament of Champions semifinalist who took
home more than $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also watching Payne's ``Millionaire'' run was former Emory
teammate Mike Dupee, now a lawyer in Gainesville, Fla. Dupee is a
finalist for a contestant's slot on Sunday night's one-hour finale
of ``Millionaire,'' and if he gets to compete, watch out, says his
former coach Lloyd Busch. Dupee is one of the all-time top money
winners on ``Jeopardy!,'' with $170,000. He won the 1996 Tournament
of Champions, and then wrote a book, ``How to Get on `Jeopardy!'
and Win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' says Dupee, who if he ends up competing
Sunday night will have several old Emory teammates on the list of
friends he can call if he needs help with an answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 14 people who were on (Emory's) College Bowl team
who have gone on game shows and won money.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little golden age,'' says Busch, now an Emory
University reference librarian, of the teams he coached from 1982
to 1992. There are no records of how many students participated;
sometimes 15 to 20 would show up to practice, but there was usually
a dedicated core of only a handful; a competing team is limited to
four players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of fun with it, but we also approached it as a
varsity sport,'' says Dupee. ``The soccer team was out taking kicks
again and again, we were writing and memorizing lists, doing
drills, assigning ourselves outside reading.''
</P>
<P>
   Before there was ``Jeopardy!'' or ``Millionaire,'' there was
``College Bowl,'' the TV show _ two teams of players competing over
a broad range of knowledge, both academic and trivial. It debuted
in 1959, in the first wave of TV game shows such as ``The $64,000
Question,'' and ran until the '70s. By the '80s, Emory's golden age
of whiz kids, national tournaments were held _ and are still held _
but were no longer televised. The '88 Emory team won the National
Invitational Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The '80s quiz kids hung out together, partied together,
occasionally slept together (one love triangle among teammates
didn't end well) and practiced endlessly. There was Tom Waters,
whom The New York Times called the greatest College Bowl player
ever, and Tim Budho, who went on to win $29,000 on ``Jeopardy!''
and now teaches in Japan, and Al Lin, who made it to the Tournament
of Champions.
</P>
<P>
   But there also weren't many women. It's been noted on
``Millionaire'' that the vast majority of the players (who have to
pass tests to qualify) are male, as are players in the
``Jeopardy!'' Tournament of Champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the deans looked at our team photo,'' Busch recalls of
the early '80s, ``and it was 20 guys and two women. And he said:
`Where are the women?' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think guys are rewarded more for being aggressive,'' Busch
theorizes. ``They're rewarded for going `Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!' with their
hands up since the first grade.''
</P>
<P>
   But the gender mix is straightening out, he notes. Emory's
current team is close to 50-50, as were the finalists recently on
the ``Jeopardy!'' college tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lloyd was a large part of the allure of the team,'' says
Lawrenceville's Stone, whom Busch recalls as one of the first truly
competitive women on the team. ``He held us together, kept things
organized. The last couple of years I was playing, he'd stopped
coaching, and there just wasn't as much direction, not as much life
in the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch, who's now the Emory team adviser, says he's had trouble
getting students with the right work ethic since the ``golden
age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been able to get the same kind of commitment. It
was an unusual bunch. It was one of those things where they
established a level of quality, and the people who followed just
kept rising to it. They found us; I didn't find them.''

MARKET PLACE: SEC PROBES SHORT-SELLING ABUSES BY DAY TRADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As part of an investigation into the practices of online
brokerage firms and day trading houses, the Securities and Exchange
Commission is examining whether the firms and their customers abide
by the regulations governing the short selling of stocks, which is
a bet that prices will fall.
</P>
<P>
   One former day trader who has told his story to regulators said
the firm he was associated with employed a system to circumvent
short-selling rules and estimated that illegal short sales
accounted for as much as 30 percent of the sales at one office
while he was a customer.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are stepping up their scrutiny of online brokerages
as the number of investors making computerized trades at home or in
day trading rooms is exploding. The number of online brokerage
firms stood at 140 in June, up from 100 six months earlier. The
number of online brokerage accounts is expected to reach 10.5
million by the end of 1999, up from 7.1 million in 1998, according
to Gomez Advisors, a research firm specializing in electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators have grown increasingly concerned that some online
firms are not fully enforcing securities regulations.
</P>
<P>
   How firms enforce the rules that apply to investors who sell
stocks short is of concern to the SEC and is one of the issues the
commission is questioning online brokerages about, confirmed SEC
spokesman Chris Ullman.
</P>
<P>
   Selling a stock short is a relatively sophisticated technique
that enables an investor who is pessimistic about a company's
prospects to profit from a decline in its shares. A short seller
essentially sells stock he does not own, hoping to buy it back
later at a lower price. If the stock rises instead, the investor
will have to pay more to buy it back than he received when he sold
it, creating a loss in his account.
</P>
<P>
   The business of selling stocks short is more highly regulated
than the outright buying _ known as going long a stock _ or selling
of shares held by a customer in his or her account. That is because
in the years surrounding the 1929 market crash, groups of short
sellers were found to have harmed investors by forcing down the
prices of certain stocks by the sheer force of excessive and
unrelenting selling.
</P>
<P>
   To rid the markets of such manipulations, regulators devised a
rule that investors can sell short only if a stock's last trade was
at the same price or higher than the previous trade. Regulators
also require that investors who sell shares they do not own must
first arrange to borrow the shares so that they can be delivered to
the person buying them. This is supposed to prevent the sales of
many more shares of a stock than are available for trading, a
technique known as naked shorting. If an investor is unable to
borrow a stock, he is not supposed to be able to sell it short.
</P>
<P>
   Muriel Siebert, chairman of Siebert Financial Corp., a
well-known discount brokerage firm, said her firm's computer system
automatically alerts a manager if a customer tries to sell a stock
that is not held in the account. The manager then tries to locate
shares to borrow. If successful, the trade is done; if
unsuccessful, the short sale is not executed.
</P>
<P>
   A story in the Wall Street Journal earlier this month reported
that some investors are selling short shares of initial public
offerings of stock, even though those shares are not typically
available to be borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   But professional traders say that naked shorting extends well
beyond shares in IPOs. These people suspect that the rapid-fire
trading that is common among day traders does not leave a firm
enough time to ascertain that a stock can be borrowed before the
trade is executed.
</P>
<P>
   These traders also suggest that some firms flout the uptick rule
and allow their customers to sell stocks they do not own even when
the stocks are declining in price.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   These fears are confirmed by the experience of John Skiersch,
33, a performance artist in Chicago who lost more than $200,000 day
trading stocks in 1997 and 1998. Skiersch described how one of the
two firms he traded with allowed its customers to circumvent
short-sale rules.
</P>
<P>
   Upon opening an account at the firm, which Skiersch declined to
identify, customers were asked to pay $100 to have a corporation
set up with its own taxpayer identification number. Then the firm
created an account for the entity that was linked to the customer's
regular account. Phony stockholdings were then placed in the
corporate account.
</P>
<P>
   In Skiersch's case, his ``corporate'' account held $200,000 to
$250,000 worth of stocks for which he had never paid a cent. The
phony holdings included 500 shares each of Intel, Dell Computer,
Cisco Systems and other stocks that a customer might want to sell
short.
</P>
<P>
   ``They manufactured these positions,'' Skiersch said. ``The
software was then tricked into believing that you were long the
positions so you could initiate sales without ever owning the
stock. I believe it was intentionally premeditated to violate the
essence of the short-sale rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiersch estimated that up to 30 percent of all the sales
executed in that office of the day trading firm violated short-sale
rules. ``When regulators were in the office one day, the whole
office was instructed not to sell on any downticks that day,'' he
recalled. Skiersch does not know if the questionable practices are
still taking place at the firm, but he has since talked to the SEC,
the National Association of Securities Dealers and the Illinois
state securities regulator.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Day trading firms may try to skirt requirements by allowing a
customer to short a stock as long as someone else in the day
trading room owns the shares in question. Day traders may also sell
stocks short without borrowing them during market hours as long as
they close out their short position before the end of the day.
Regulators say both practices are against the rules. Some short
sellers and other traders have argued that the rules are outmoded
and should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   Several veteran Wall Street traders said that one sign of
illegal shorting occurs when the daily trading volume in a stock
far exceeds the number of shares available to the public, known as
the float.
</P>
<P>
   One trader pointed to the recent trading in Grand Toys
International, the Canadian distributor of the popular Pokemon and
Furby toys, as an example. The company has a little more than 1.5
million shares available to public investors, but on Wednesday,
almost 20 million shares, or 13.3 times the public float, changed
hands. Even if only 1 percent of those trades were short sales,
they would have exceeded the public float by half a million shares.

DAEWOO'S CREDITORS DEFER DEBT PAYMENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Daewoo's South Korean creditors gave the
nearly insolvent conglomerate another reprieve Thursday, deferring
repayments on debts owed by 12 of its affiliate businesses for
three months and providing $700 million in new short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in less than two months that the
creditors have delayed interest and principal due on Daewoo group
debts, which total about $57 billion and have become a growing
source of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   A Daewoo bankruptcy would mark one of the most spectacular
corporate failures of all time and could reverberate painfully
through South Korea's economy, pulling down 6,000 suppliers and
other, smaller businesses. That could threaten the country's
budding recovery from the financial crisis that erupted nearly two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to a worsening liquidity situation, not only the Daewoo
group, but its contracted suppliers may experience tremendous
difficulties,'' said Lee Yong Keun, vice chairman of the Financial
Supervisory Commission, explaining one of the reasons behind the
reprieve announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a restructuring plan that was announced last week, most of
the conglomerate's businesses will eventually be sold to satisfy
debts, leaving Daewoo with little more than its automotive
business. But the reprieve Thursday will effectively accelerate
that plan by putting the weakest affiliates under bank management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect creditor banks to lead restructuring efforts at
Daewoo affiliates under a firm agreement to defer their debts,''
Lee Ho Keun, managing director of Korea First Bank, one of the
group's major creditors, said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 Daewoo affiliates affected must sell assets, strengthen
their capitalization and seek foreign investment, the Financial
Supervisory Commission said. The affiliates will also have to lay
off workers, cut wages and scale down their operations, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's domestic creditors will have to accept reduced
interest-rate payments from the affiliates that are put under the
plan, extend loan maturities and transform loans into equity, while
providing ailing companies with enough capital to remain in
business, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates affected by the arrangement include Daewoo Corp.,
Daewoo Motor Co., Daewoo Heavy Industries, Daewoo Electronics,
Ssangyong Motor Co. and Daewoo Telecom, as well as six smaller
businesses. Daewoo Securities, a profitable brokerage house, as
well as 13 other relatively healthy affiliates, were not part of
the latest debt reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The affiliates selected for workout are either core units or
those facing difficulties in short-term liquidity,'' said Lee Hun
Jai, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission. ``The
companies that have been excluded from the workout program are
under normal management and capable of surviving on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's severe cash shortage has worsened, even though domestic
creditors supplied around 4 trillion won ($3.3 billion) in new
loans last month, as well as a six-month extension of its debt
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Daewoo agreed to continue interest payments on $6
billion of debt it owes foreign banking companies including Chase
Manhattan, HSBC Holdings and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo is South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, behind
Hyundai. Financial mismanagement and heavy short-term debts at
several of the biggest conglomerates are considered important
reasons behind the severe Korean financial problems that reached
crisis level late in 1997, requiring an International Monetary Fund
rescue program.

 &HT;    Ohio lawmakers disappointed in low number of minority posts
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner and William Hershey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ When black legislators criticized Gov. Bob Taft
last March for a lack of diversity in his cabinet and top staff
appointments, Taft aides said the governor would continue to ``cast
a wide net'' looking for the best candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, the governor still is casting.
</P>
<P>
   Of 251 appointments to the cabinet, boards, commissions,
judgeships and other posts, Taft has picked 27 racial minorities,
including 21 blacks, according to the governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   That means about 11 percent of the appointments have gone to
minorities, including 8.3 percent to blacks, somewhat lower than
their representation in the population. U.S. Census projections
indicate minorities will make up 14 percent of Ohio's population
when the census is taken next year and blacks will be 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the numbers fall even shorter. Just 69 appointments,
or about 27 percent, have gone to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an extremely poor start,'' said state Rep. Ray
Miller (D-Columbus), first vice president of the Ohio Legislative
Black Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Some top lawmakers, however, say it's too early to grade Taft's
record on diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's way too early to be judging his appointments, but
I think there is a legitimate effort out there to make sure
minorities are represented,'' said Senate President Richard Finan
(R-Cincinnati). ``One thing I don't subscribe to is the using
quotas to fill positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft has only been in office about eight months and many of his
fellow Republican leaders and staff say he is committed to
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has not appointed any new black members to his cabinet
_ which is composed of 23 of the state's high-profile and
high-paying posts. The only two blacks in Taft's cabinet _ Reginald
A. Wilkinson, director of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and
Correction, and Mitchell J. Brown, the Ohio Lottery director _ both
held jobs in Gov. George Voinovich's administration. Wilkinson held
the same job for Voinovich, while Brown was Voinovich's public
safety director.
</P>
<P>
   Taft's cabinet has only four women and one of them, current Lt.
Gov. Maureen O'Connor, is considering leaving state government next
year. O'Connor said Thursday she will decide in the next 60 days
whether to leave's Taft's team to run for the post of Summit County
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Taft on Thursday said his office is constantly searching Ohio
communities for minority and female candidates for appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are working very hard on this, and it's an issue
that we seek to address any time we review a board or commission,''
Taft said. ``I think you should look at the composition of the
state work force, where a variety of minorities are very well
represented.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Milburn, Taft's press secretary, said the governor has
made it clear to his staff they need to do better in finding
qualified minority appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not satisfied with what he's done so far,'' Milburn said.
``The governor does not believe in the quota approach to hiring,
but it's too early for members of the minority community to truly
understand how committed the governor is to diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Milburn said the governor receives suggestions for appointments
from friends, legislators, political allies throughout the state,
community representatives, members of industries and professions
being regulated and other sources. Those interested in being
appointed also frequently contact the governor's office themselves,
Milburn said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Aug. 20, Taft had named 228 people to various posts
outside of the cabinet. Twenty-five of the appointments went to
minorities, including 19 to blacks; 65 went to women. Of the 19
blacks appointed, four were to posts that address black issues or
students, such as the Martin Luther King Jr. Holiday Commission and
the Central State University Board of Trustees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those numbers for minorities are way under what they should
be,'' said House Minority Leader, Jack Ford (D-Toledo). ``I think
the governor will make a presidential run at some point and if I
were him, I would start building a base of minority positions for
10-15 years from now. The governor needs someone close to him,
reminding him all the time that it's important to have people of
color in these positions.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson (R-Reynoldsburg) said Taft is
``sensitive'' to the needs of minorities and women, and she also
believes it's too early to draw any conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Davidson, a longtime advocate for getting women involved in
politics, said other state leaders must get better at helping Taft
find interested and qualified women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never really been good at having women become
interested in politics and having resumes ready for the governor's
desk,'' Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers, who defended Taft, said the governor doesn't
have many black candidates to pick from for certain posts. Finan
said one example was a recent open judgeship in Montgomery County
where a white male was appointed, but no black candidates applied
for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, however, suggested Taft get help from Ohio Secretary of
State J. Kenneth Blackwell, a black Republican who like Taft comes
from Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Blackwell can find them, Ken has an outstanding record of
attracting African-Americans,'' Miller said. ``He has not had
difficulty at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Dayton area lawmakers and officials are also unhappy
with Taft's early appointment record.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rhine McLin (D-Dayton) said Taft has talked about
making diversity a top priority, but hasn't yet delivered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are we going to have to start calling him wobbly-knee Taft?,''
McLin said. ``I expected more out of Taft. When all the tension in
this country is on racial issues, it just seems there should be an
effort from top to down to reach out.''

JONES' AGENT DOESN'T KNOW WHEN SHE WILL BE ABLE TO RESUME
COMPETING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones will race no more at the world
track and field championships. The question now is, when will she
race again?
</P>
<P>
   Will it be as scheduled in the Golden League meet in Brussels,
Belgium, on Sept. 3? Or will it not be until next season?
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the 23-year-old American who won the 100 meters and
finished third in the long jump, pulled up in the middle of her
200-meter semifinal on Wednesday with what her doctors called back
spasms.
</P>
<P>
   After shouting in pain and falling to the track, she was placed
on a stretcher and wheeled off for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, her agent, Charlie Wells, said that Jones was walking
and ``in good spirits'' but would not compete in either of the two
relays on Sunday, the final day of the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``She still has spasms in her lower back,'' Wells said. ``We
need a couple more days to evaluate and make a decision on whether
she can continue the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who remained unavailable for comment, is being treated by
two American physicians, Dr. Norman Levin and Dr. Stephen Bernabeu,
who travel with Wells and the group of athletes he manages.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wells, Jones plans to stay in Seville at least
until this weekend. He said he had no idea what caused her injury
and refuted a claim by Robert Wagner, an Austrian agent, that Jones
had been suffering from back problems earlier this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows more than me then,'' Wells said. ``Our schedule was
much tougher last year than this year. This year, she's competing
once a week. Last year, it was twice a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones had hoped to win four gold medals in Seville and had been
competing every day here until the injury. She took six attempts in
the long jump final on Monday night, often landing awkwardly, and
then ran two 200-meter heats on Tuesday and the semifinal on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's harder than Atlanta,'' Kevin Little, the
American 200-meter runner, said of the Mondo track here. ``But it's
hard on your legs when you run a lot of races on it. I've done most
of my training on grass, because this track will wear you down.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jones is unable to compete in Brussels, she will lose any
chance of sharing in the $1 million Golden League jackpot, which is
split between those athletes who win their events in all seven
Golden League meets. Jones is one of four athletes still in
contention with two meets remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't even talk about it,'' Wells said.

WACO REVELATION BRINGS CALL FOR PROBE OF FBI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno, whose department was
already under attack for a series of missteps, acknowledged
Thursday that the latest controversy involving the FBI and the
fiery deaths of 86 Branch Davidian cult members in 1993 has further
damaged her office's credibility and left her ``very, very
frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress, noting how this week's revelations arrived
on the heels of a string of other Justice Department and FBI
miscues, called for hearings. Senator Charles Grassley, an Iowa
Republican whose Senate Judiciary subcommittee has investigated the
FBI's failures in several high-profile criminal cases, said, ``This
is a serious development in terms of further erosion of the FBI's
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor were all the critiques partisan, though Democrats weighed
their words carefully Thursday and avoided on-the-record criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another public relations nightmare,'' said a
Democratic counsel for a committee that oversees Reno's department,
placing the FBI's performance in the alleged Chinese theft of
nuclear secrets, the bureau's investigation of the Olympics bombing
in Atlanta, and disarray in the FBI's famed crime labs atop a list
of embarrassing setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Republican committee investigators added the Waco controversy,
the infighting between the FBI and the Justice Department over the
handling of the 1996 campaign-finance scandal, and the bureau's
decision to share FBI background files with the Clinton White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is obvious concern,'' even among Democrats, the
committee counsel said. ``The question is whether this is a
systemic problem at the bureau, or just a bad of
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has triumphs to point to as well, but when the attorney
general admits to being ``very, very upset,'' ``very, very
frustrated'' and ``very, very troubled'' at the bureau's
performance, as Reno did Thursday, people take notice.
</P>
<P>
   The cause for Reno's dismay was that contrary to everything she
and the FBI have said since the Branch Davidian members were killed
in Waco on April 19, 1993, the FBI this week admitted firing two
``pyrotechnic'' military gas grenades at a concrete bunker some 100
yards from the compound early in the morning of the final showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``All available indications are that the devices were not
directed at the main wooden compound, were discharged several hours
before the fire started, and were not the cause of the fire,'' Reno
said. ``I have no reason whatsoever at this point to believe that
the FBI was responsible for the deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   But when asked how the bureau's change of position had affected
her department, Reno conceded, ``I don't think it's very good for
my credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do the best you can. You try to pursue every avenue to get
to the right thing to do, to get to the truth,'' Reno said, when
asked about the string of recent reversals. ``If you are going to
let things get you down, maybe you should go do something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Representatives Dan Burton of Indiana and Bob Barr of
Georgia, two longtime critics of the Clinton administration, have
called for a congressional investigation. In a letter to Reno, Barr
said the FBI admission ``raises questions'' about whether federal
officials perjured themselves, and whether other forms of
incendiary devices may have been used on the final day of the
seige.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Barney Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat who
serves on the House Judiciary Committee, scoffed at such
suggestions. Burton and Barr ``should investigate each other,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the General Accounting Office issued a report
Thursday that said the Pentagon provided ``a wide variety of
assistance'' at Waco to the FBI and the Treasury Department's
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The cost of the
assistance, which has be known for years, was put at $1 million by
the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Waco tragedy ended a 51-day seige that followed a raid by
federal agents from the ATF, during which four of the agency's
officers and two cult members were killed in an exchange of
gunshots. In the April confrontation, the FBI used tanks to punch
holes in the wooden walls of the Branch Davidian compound and pour
CS riot gas into the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon the compound burst into flames, whipped by
the prairie wind. Most of the 86 people who died succumbed to the
smoke and fire. Several government investigations, including one by
the House Government Reform Committee that Burton chairs, concluded
the fire was started by suicidal members of the cult, some of whom
turned their firearms on themselves and each other.

JOHNSON SETS NEW 400-METER RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ For Michael Johnson, relief seemed to trump
joy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven years chasing it and I finally did it,'' said the
31-year-old Johnson after his bravura 43.18 performance Thursday
night broke the world record for 400 meters. It was a race that
featured no true opponents but the clock and the weight of
expectations, both of which Johnson overcame with room to spare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's finally over,'' said his longtime coach, Clyde
Hart. ``It was a long hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also made Johnson a four-time world champion at the
distance and tied him with Carl Lewis for the most career gold
medals at the World Championships with eight. He has the chance to
break Lewis's mark in the 4 x 400 relay Sunday night in the grand
finale of the meet.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the finish line, Johnson glanced over his left shoulder
at the clock, which first read 43.19 but was soon adjusted
downward. After pumping first his right fist and then his left into
the air, he calmly acted like a man who had been in this situation
before _ he had, with his 200-meter world record at the 1996
Olympics _ and had fully planned to get there again, on this very
night, after years of rehearsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there could have been a better time in my career
to break the world record,'' said Johnson. ``Now I can go into the
Olympics next year without the pressure that it might be my last
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous mark of 43.29, set by Butch Reynolds in 1988, had
been one of the longest-standing track records on the books. But
Johnson and Hart both said he's capable of running even faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think he can run under 43 seconds,'' said Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Any doubts that Johnson would win _ which were few, after his
43.95-while-jogging-the-last-60-meters statement in the semifinal _
were quashed before he was halfway around the track. Telling
himself to go out fast but not too fast, as is the danger for a
200-meter runner, Johnson hit his target time of 21 seconds flat
for 200 meters, and by 300 was leaving his rivals hopelessly behind
as any suspense in the crowd of 41,515 about whether he would break
the record melted away in the warm night air.
</P>
<P>
   By the finish, he would have an 8-meter lead on the runner-up,
Sanderlei Claro Parrela of Brazil (44.29) and bronze-medalist
Alejandro Cardenas of Mexico (44.31), both of whom Johnson dragged
to national records. After them came Americans Jerome Young (44.36)
and Antonio Pettigrew (44.54).
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like running 21 flat for 200 and I didn't think any of
the other guys were gonna do that, so I knew I was going to have a
lead,'' said Johnson, explaining his strategy. The most difficult
part of the race, he said, was that first half. ``You need to be
aggressive out of the blocks, but being a 200-meter runner you know
you have the potential of being far too aggressive, so I wanted to
make sure I got a perfect first 100 meters, and I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's target pace for 100 meters was 10.9 seconds, which he
ran in all three rounds and again Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The final step, as he came off the last curve, was telling
himself not to panic when he saw his big lead, because ``the last
100, that's the part of the race that's familiar to me; I know it
like the back of my hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the past few months, Johnson has been dogged by
critics who say he ducks tough opponents by claiming injury.
(Johnson reportedly has a hip-alignment problem that puts too much
stress on his legs, causing occasional twinges and strains as well
as some past injuries.) ``There have been some challenges basically
in the way that I've been doubted,'' he acknowledged after the
race. ``I don't know what I've got to do. I guess I'll just keep
doing what I've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also acknowledged that the accusations have made him
wonder if he should quit the sport. ``It just wasn't fun leading up
to this,'' he said. ``I've always said, when it's not fun I won't
do it anymore. For awhile, I (thought), do I want to keep doing
this? But again, thank God for my coach, who kept me motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, however, has been a different story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys have been focused on the world record the last few
days,'' he said. ``That's fun!''

SPORTS COLUMN: KINDER, GENTLER PARCELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bill Parcells looks fit and rested and, you
might be tempted to think, almost content. Nevertheless, he keeps
the pressure on his New York Jets. The theme for this season is
Start Over. Last season the Jets went to the conference
championship game. Last season does not count.
</P>
<P>
   And that is why the Jets are a different franchise from the
mentally snakebit lot that stumbled through the mid-'90s. The older
players, who have experienced four different Jets coaches, say
Parcells' constant prodding is the reason the Jets came within a
game of the Super Bowl last season. And the beat goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, preparing for Saturday's exhibition against the New
York Giants, Parcells told reporters, ``I've got 79 players, but
sometimes I wonder why I worry about one guy when I could actually
cut to 48 right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this warning is devious technique or instinctive
bluster, only Parcells knows in the depth of his sinister coaching
heart. He is the master of the public barb, aimed at one player,
but one size fits all.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has been known to ask a player, ``Are you going to
retire _ and let us know in two years?'' The players smile because
he is funny. They also know he means it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a family,'' Mo Lewis said Thursday without rancor.
``You would not abandon your child if he couldn't get a job done,
but here, if you don't produce, you're out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis played the last two years of the Bruce Coslet regime, the
only year of Pete Carroll, three with Rich Kotite and now two with
Parcells. The Jets had a 30-66 record in Lewis' first six seasons.
They are 21-11 in the regular season under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was talent here before,'' Lewis recalled. ``But I would
say the talent was out for themselves. There were guys who wanted
the accolades. They wanted New York for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said Kotite ``came in on the bad end of things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He came from a veteran team in Philadelphia, and he felt he
could trust guys the same way here, but we really didn't have the
leadership. It was a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells does not permit disasters, but he is not a negative
bully, his veterans insist. Lewis recalls being asked what his goal
was, and telling Parcells, ``I want to be part of a No. 1
defense.'' The coach liked that answer. Victor Green, who arrived
in 1993, recalls how the bottom fell out of Carroll's promising 6-5
start in 1994, with Dan Marino's faked spike leading to a Miami
comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was just devastating,'' Green said. ``We lost four
straight after that, and didn't make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just not prepared before,'' Green added. ``But Bill
makes us practice everything. There might be a fourth-and-1, and
you think it's a no-brainer they will run, but Bill prepares you
that they might take a hard count, with no intention of running,
just trying to get you offside. He alerts you.''
</P>
<P>
   The older players were not surprised when they reported for camp
and found Parcells in a dyspeptic mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before it was always `Same old Jets,''' Green said. ``Now we
know we could go from 12-4 to 8-8 or whatever. In our last
exhibition, we won but it was not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was asked Thursday whether he had ever been happy with
a team during the preseason. He thought about it for a good long
while and then recalled: ``Yeah, one time. In 1985 we were coming
off our first playoff win and we thought we were going to be even
better, and we won all five exhibitions.''
</P>
<P>
   How did he communicate his happiness with that Giants team? ``I
don't know that I necessarily said it,'' Parcells said, adding, ``I
was worse than I am now. I was more malicious.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be true. Thursday he was downright jovial, schmoozing
and talking about his love for the New York Giants in baseball, and
his deep respect for sports journalists like Tim Cohane, Willard
Mullin and Bill Gallo. Like his friend Bob Knight, Parcells has a
soft spot for elders he met on his way up.
</P>
<P>
   His soft spot does not extend very far to his current crop of
players. On Thursday Parcells said, ``All we'd have to do is trip
and we'd do better than we did last week.'' He is currently
impatient with Blake Spence, a young running back who has had
nagging injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks good in practice, when he's out there,'' Parcells
said, dropping a little zinger at the end, ``which is seldom,''
</P>
<P>
   The malice was muted, almost. Maybe he was so calm because he
already knows which 31 players he could cut. Was he joking? The
players are afraid to find out.

A QUESTION OF ETHICS IN ADVERTISING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. _ Remember the gold-sprayed microphone trophy
``awarded'' to ESPN SportsCenter anchor Dan Patrick by partner
Kenny Mayne on the set to commemorate his 2,000th show? Remember
there were also streamers falling from the ceiling and crew members
diving after his clip-on mike for a souvenir?
</P>
<P>
   That prop from the famous ``This is SportsCenter'' commercial
actually sits amongst the clutter of Patrick's desk in his ESPN
office space.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter actually broke it yesterday,'' Patrick said with a
smile, touching the oversized numerals that were temporarily
knocked off the base.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ask about the OTHER commercial he's been in lately _ the
Coors' ``expect more from an original'' spots with John Elway _ and
Patrick's smile begins to fade. Seems that for as much backslapping
as he received by media writers for participating in the smart
``SportsCenter'' spots, Patrick has been taken aback by slapping
criticism from many of those same scribes for his innocuous role in
a beer advertisement.
</P>
<P>
   Questioning Patrick's motives are legit. Why would a
well-respected TV journalist associate himself with something so
politically incorrect? How will he handle a story about an
athlete's DUI arrest? Can he make fun of a clip shown of an
intoxicated fan diving in the stands for a foul ball?
</P>
<P>
   When Patrick did TV spots for 7-Up or Rolaids, there was hardly
a flap. This apparently is another story.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, could it be that some just expect more from an
original like Patrick?
</P>
<P>
   His explanation is sincerely credible. He never holds the beer
in his hand, never mentions the product by name, never encourages
people to drink. He just tells a story about Elway, who then shows
up at the end of the commercial cracking open a cold one.
</P>
<P>
   So it's guilt by association. And despite having ESPN's blessing
to do the spot, Patrick wasn't ready for the backlash he calls ``a
hit and run'' by some high-and-mighty media judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to judge the people who want to judge my integrity,''
Patrick said, leaning back in his chair, trying to not come off as
bitter. ``These same people who built me up have lost their
integrity by not calling me. But I've learned from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Learned what?
</P>
<P>
   ``That everything's fair game,'' Patrick continued. ``Chris
Berman told me five years ago, `They'll build you up and take you
down.' These are the same guys who don't even remember that I did
the public-service announcements for three years telling people not
to drink and drive.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugs his shoulders. What can you do?
</P>
<P>
   The average viewer, it seems, has no trouble with guys like
Patrick who might find themselves acting as unbiased reporters one
minute on TV but at the commercial break suddenly becoming paid
spokesmen. They've built your trust one minute, now they're telling
you it's cool to use this product the next.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's Bob Costas hasn't taken much heat for wearing a milk
mustache. CBS' Jim Nantz is allowed to endorse Titleist golf balls.
Fox's Pat Summerall and John Madden pitch tools for competing
hardware chains. And then there's Berman, a shamelessly effective
pitchman for almost anything and at one time the voice for the Bud
Bowl commercials during the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are difficult decisions,'' admitted John Walsh, ESPN's
senior vice president and executive editor who comes from a
newspaper journalism background. He is considered in the world of
media to have the highest of moral standards. ``We have guidelines
and we give people the opportunity to enhance their visibility and
enhance their economic situations. As we go along, we make these
decisions and see the reaction. And another chapter is written.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Walsh's polite way of saying he probably shouldn't have
let Patrick do the commercial because he could see this twist
coming.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN could have blocked Patrick; it didn't. Coors is a loyal
sponsor of the network. And some ESPN people openly admit the
company fears if it consistently stops its anchors from doing
commercials, they'll eventually leave (to the competition) where
it's allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Elway, as it turns out, asked Patrick to be in the commercial.
Patrick could have just said no. He wanted to help a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fine line, for sure, but one not any clearly defined
than, say, 50 years ago, when respected newsman John Cameron Swayze
used to not only smoke cigarettes on the air during NBC's ``Camel
News Caravan,'' but he'd invite viewers to ``sit back, light up a
Camel and be an eyewitness to the happenings that made history in
the last 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick has been viewed as a villain for the same reason Sports
Illustrated's Rick Reilly was wrong for promoting Miller Beer. In
the business, we've accepted these professionals as models for what
media representatives should be. And now they've disappointed us,
even more than someone like ABC's Jim McKay doing a schlocky
futuristic spot for some sports-drink company.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick understands all that but again has no answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not Ted Koppel; other people have placed their values on
this,'' said Patrick. ``I do a job that I'm thankful attracts a
great audience. I know there is journalistic integrity that goes
along with what I do. But who's in control?
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Reilly about this, after he was criticized and
then after I was. He was pretty bummed out at the reaction to him.
He said Frank Deford did the same kind of Miller spots 20 years
ago, but now, all of the sudden, the media is watching closer. I
don't think Deford is any less a writer now than he was then. I'm
not less either.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be a shock if Patrick continues to take some hits
when his appearance in another commercial starts soon. He and Mayne
are in spots for T.G.I. Fridays, comparing the ``every day is
Friday'' atmosphere of the bar/eatery to a SportsCenter set.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds cute. Until it dawns on someone there's liquor being
served in those places and it's another inappropriate place for a
sports TV guy. The question should sort of be: Why are they
promoting a place that's a competitor to the new ESPN Zone theme
retaurants that are starting in every big city?
</P>
<P>
   Patrick, who has been at ESPN for 10 years, shouldn't have to
worry about whether next he'll receive a trophy for his 2,000th
commercial. As crazy as this sounds, maybe if the top-notch anchors
were paid even more, they wouldn't be tempted to fund their kids'
college funds by crossing the line.
</P>
<P>
   And give the viewers a little credit here, eh? But most
important, give Patrick a little more credit, too. He's learned
something from the process that's far more valuable. &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES &QL; 
__ Can't tell you how much we love GQ magazine's ``Why We Love
Football'' special September issue. For Terrence Rafferty's piece
on how Hollywood has fumbled trying to convey the sport on the
screen, followed by an account of Oliver Stone's attempt to do the
next great football flick. For the Chris and Stefanie Speilman
story. For the Neil Leifer photo gallery. For its list of the 50
greatest players _ in order (topped by Jim Brown). For the fashion
spreads that include John Elway, Jason Sehorn and Cade McNown (in a
spiffy Tommy Hilfinger $325 wool toggle coat). For the
not-so-surprising !racepace!``Bully'' Bo Schembechler piece. And
finally, put on the back page but definitely deserving better
billing, for the ``Profile-O-Matic'' formula that shows how Sports
Illustrated's feature stories have become painfully predictable.
Maybe the Street &AMP; Smith football guides of the publishing world
have better info about drafting a fantasy-league team, but this GQ
issue is the real deal. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
__ Did we mention that GQ's list of the 50 greatest players decided
John Elway belongs 40 spots below No. 4 Dan Marino? &QL; 
__ MSNBC will have the earliest jump in the NFL Sunday-morning
pregame parade _ a 6 a.m.-to-7 a.m. (PDT) airing of the radio show
by WFAN's Mike Francesa. Gotta be a mad dog to watch that early. &QL; 
__ In a stunning revelation to Parade magazine, ESPN
motor-mouthpiece Chris Berman admits he hasn't seen a
regular-season NBA game in four years because ``the league
epitomizes the bad direction sports have gone.'' Not incidentally,
it's also the only major sport whose games ESPN has been
perpetually shut out from covering on TV. &QL; 
__ Even Bob Costas admitted Wednesday it was pretty warped to hear
him do promos for upcoming ESPN ``SportsCenters'' and other ABC
programming when he sat in with Joe Morgan to do ESPN's coverage of
a rather meaningless Detroit-Seattle game. Our internal compass was
fooled all night long listening to the voice of NBC throw it to
Bill Pidto in the Bristol, Conn., studio for updates on other
games. We understand Costas needs practice leading up to NBC's
playoff and World Series coverage. But isn't there some batting
cage he can use instead?

ENCORES FOR A MONTANA PLAYHOUSE AND ITS TOWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mont., Fla.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIGFORK, Mont. _ By one measurement, the distance from here to
Broadway is about 2,000 miles. By another, they are just a few
steps apart.
</P>
<P>
   Once a sleepy little logging town on Flathead Lake and the Swan
River that grew through midcentury as a stopover for visitors to
Glacier National Park, 40 miles to the north, Bigfork has since
blossomed in size and stature, and now attracts thousands of
tourists every summer.
</P>
<P>
   Most come to attend performances at the Bigfork Summer
Playhouse, a theater company celebrating its 40th year this summer.
It is the centerpiece of Bigfork's transformation into a thriving
arts community that includes a handful of celebrities among the
town's 1,000 permanent residents and a main street lined with
galleries, boutiques and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It seems so odd, here beside the spectacular, pristine beauty of
Glacier and four national forests, that audiences can find talented
young actors belting out songs from ``Oklahoma,'' ``Li'l Abner,''
``Brigadoon'' and ``Singin' in the Rain,'' the four musicals
produced this season.
</P>
<P>
   But the incongruity of it all has spawned Broadway careers and a
tightly knit community, proud of its evolving cultural ambiance.
The 432-seat auditorium is sold out many nights, which also means
it is hard to get a seat in the local restaurants for a pretheater
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a job everybody wants,'' said Britt Hancock of
Macclenny, Fla., a recent college graduate who returned this summer
for his fifth season of performing here. ``When we audition for
other places, it's an advantage if you've worked in Bigfork.''
</P>
<P>
   In baseball terms, the Bigfork playhouse is like Class AA of the
minor leagues. All the actors and musicians have excelled to this
point in their careers, and many show promise to go on. Some do,
like George Dudley and Branch Woodman, who won roles in New York
productions, and J.K. Simmons, who plays a recurring role of a
doctor on the television series ``Law and Order.''
</P>
<P>
   Others kick around in repertory companies, dinner theaters and
summer stock.
</P>
<P>
   For Donald E. Thomson, the playhouse producer, and his wife,
Jude, the annual productions have become a way of life, four months
of performances and the rest of the year scouting for new talent at
regional auditions and molding the summer season ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has certainly been an interesting experience,'' said
Thomson, who came to Bigfork as a college graduate in 1964 to
design and build stage scenery. Three years later he took over the
playhouse from Firman H. Brown, the head of the theater department
at the University of Montana, who founded the troupe to showcase
Montana talent.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the talent pool expanded to include actors from all
over the country as the Thomsons produced comedies, dramas and
Broadway musicals from as far back as the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   As the company grew, so did Bigfork, with upscale businesses and
art galleries replacing dusty saloons and greasy-spoon restaurants
along the main street, Electric Avenue. Expensive summer homes
began dotting the lakeside and overlooking hills. Among the notable
summer residents are Lea Thompson, who starred in NBC's ``Caroline
in the City''; Phil Jackson, the former coach of the Chicago Bulls,
and Connie Chung, the ABC-TV news correspondent, and her husband,
Maury Povich, the television talk-show host.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Goff, who left a corporate job with AT&AMP;T in Manhattan
five years ago and became executive director of Bigfork's Chamber
of Commerce last January, said the town has more than 200
businesses, many of which came to feed off the success of the
playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But growth has also caused some alarm among residents here, who
fear that uncontrolled growth might overwhelm the town's delicate
fabric of life. Already, parking is a problem. Local hotels counsel
their guests to take the trolley-tram into town rather that risk
not finding a parking space.
</P>
<P>
   The latest concern involves a tract of 500 acres along the Swan
River, just east of town, that is for sale by a local utility
company. The land includes a popular nature trail.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Gates and her niece, Cary Siess, manage Eva Gates
Preserves, a Bigfork company that has made preserves and syrups for
50 years. Eva was Ms. Gates' grandmother and Ms. Siess'
great-grandmother. They said they were worried the land might be
turned into new expensive homes or, worse, a casino, which is legal
in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contained growth is wonderful,'' Ms. Siess said. `'The problem
is people who want to come in without studying the ambiance of the
place and want to put up a huge hotel or casino. People are
attracted to the village the way it is now. If you change it, the
same kinds of people are not going to come here.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not without hope that she will prevail. The traffic light
at Routes 35 and 209, the main feeder highways into Bigfork, is the
main reason. Until a few years ago, the intersection was
uncontrolled and hazardous. Bigfork asked Flathead County officials
for help. They said they would consider it. Bigfork waited.
</P>
<P>
   Impatient, town leaders sought donations and raised enough money
to put up their own traffic light. They are mounting a similar
effort to preserve the river property.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town does rise up,'' said Ms. Goff, the Chamber of
Commerce official. ``In Bigfork, we know how to get things done.''

<P>
   OTAWARA, Japan _ Perched 20 feet up atop a rickety awning,
Myoshi Kotani peeped through the surrounding cedar trees to get a
better view of the shrouded buildings below.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bad, very bad,'' Kotani said, referring to the workmen
assembling prefabricated housing for members of Aum Shinrikyo, the
religious sect behind the 1995 nerve gas attack in the Tokyo subway
that killed 12 people and made 6,000 others ill. ``We've got to
stop them. We can't let these murderers move into our community.''
</P>
<P>
   As a black Toyota jeep exited the front gate of the clandestine
complex, farmers who were camped out front jeered and shook their
fists. ``We don't want you here!'' someone yelled through a
bullhorn. ``Go away, Aum!''
</P>
<P>
   The residents of this tranquil farming village on the Nakagawa
River, about 80 miles north of Tokyo, are on the front lines of a
bitter nationwide campaign to banish followers of the religious
cult from Japanese society.
</P>
<P>
   While anger at the cult runs high, the widespread public
tolerance for the campaign and its draconian tactics is raising
concerns about the depth of Japan's commitment to civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese and Americans differ on how to strike a balance between
individual rights and the welfare of society. The Japanese believe
that the United States often emphasizes individual rights at the
expense of the welfare of society as a whole. They cite as one
example the recent shootings by Americans belonging to hate groups.
Many Japanese see Aum as a dangerous force that continues to
threaten their nation.
</P>
<P>
   Aum Shinrikyo is a doomsday cult whose teachings are based on
tenets borrowed from Hinduism and Buddhism. At the center of the
group's beliefs is reverence for Shoko Asahara, Aum's founder, who
teaches that the end of the world is near. Many Aum followers are
said to be people who were lost in Japan's workaday society and
seeking guidance or spiritual salvation. Police officials said the
group currently has about 5,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, dozens of municipalities across Japan have
taken drastic steps to drive Aum members out of town. Many of their
tactics are blatantly discriminatory and often violate the Japanese
Constitution, which guarantees citizens the right to live where
they choose.
</P>
<P>
   The most common anti-Aum tactic has been for municipal
governments to refuse to accept members' residency applications,
which are a legal requirement to live in any Japanese city and
qualify for social services. Without residency permits, people
cannot receive medical care, pensions or other public services.
They cannot vote or obtain employment, a passport or a driver's
license.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, residents will not allow children of cult
members to attend public schools or to play in parks. Businesses
will not sell goods to Aum followers, restaurants will not serve
them and outdoor spas will not allow them to bathe. In one extreme
case, waste management firms will not pick up the cult's garbage
and sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Sympathy for Aum followers is hard to come by in Japan, which
was devastated by the nerve gas attack in the subway. Except for a
few human rights activists and constitutional scholars, almost no
one has criticized this country's treatment of Aum followers.
</P>
<P>
   Masayuki Tanamura, a law professor at Waseda University who
specializes in civil rights law, said that Japan's treatment of Aum
followers sets a dangerous precedent for a democratic society.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very worried that this kind of suppression of basic
democratic rights, of freedom of expression and religion will
destroy Japan's free society,'' Tanamura said. ``It's not right to
restrict or regulate people just because they have dangerous
thoughts and believe in dangerous religions.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such actions violate the cult members' rights, national
and local government officials have turned a blind eye to them.
Kijuro Tateno, mayor of Sanwa in Ibaraki prefecture, which has
refused to allow 24 Aum followers to register as residents, said
his town ``may be violating the law in order to protect the safety
of local residents.''

<P>
   Asked about the issue at a recent press briefing, Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hiromu Nonaka said: ``I think the heads of the
municipalities in those areas are put in an extremely difficult
situation. As they are dealing with a group that had committed
brutal crimes in the past, my feelings are that I can understand it
is inevitable that they take such measures.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by Kyodo, Japan's leading news
service, at least 35 cities in 16 prefectures have taken steps to
oust Aum members from their borders. But the report found that such
efforts appear to have had little impact so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst treatment of any group that I've ever seen
in Japan,'' said Kenichi Asano, a human rights advocate and
communications professor at Doshisha University. ``I saw a sign the
other day that said: `Aum Get Out of the Earth and Go to the
Cosmos.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a defender of Aum, and if my daughter decided to join
the group, I would strongly try to persuade her not to do it,''
Asano said. ``But until they commit a crime, members of religious
groups have the same rights under the constitution as anyone
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials, who are closely monitoring the
situation, said that strong public opposition to Aum is fallout
from the 1995 subway attack, which they described as the country's
worst terrorist attack in modern history. ``They call Aum the
doomsday cult, and for many people who were trapped in the subway
that day, it really did seem like the end of the world,'' a police
official who spoke on condition of anonymity said. ``You don't
easily forget that.''

<P>
   Public anxiety over Aum has mounted in the last year as the
group stepped up its recruitment efforts, particularly on the
Internet and at universities, and as its commercial ventures,
mainly discount computer shops, have prospered, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the sect has purchased numerous properties
across the country where it is constructing housing for its
expanding membership. In addition, many Japanese fear that Aum may
be planning another attack, since several senior members, who
recently completed prison terms related to the subway attack, have
returned to the group.
</P>
<P>
   While the Japanese have become more accepting of groups that are
foreign to their largely homogeneous society and more willing to
defend the rights of others, their tolerance wears thin when there
is a threat, real or perceived, to social order.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Aum officials said they are baffled by the widespread opposition
to its members, who themselves have not been accused of any crime.
Hiroshi Araki, acting chief of Aum's public relations department,
said the group has received no assistance from the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't find any government organization that deals with this
issue because it's an unprecedented case,'' he said. ``We don't
quite know how to respond to what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has filed claims seeking help from Japan's Bar
Association and it has appealed the local governments' denial of
residency registration to the provincial courts, but so far it has
had no success.
</P>
<P>
   Araki said that denying Aum followers residency registration has
caused great hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every single aspect of our ordinary, everyday lives is being
deprived by these local communities,'' Araki said. ``And it's
possible that it can get worst. Stones are being thrown and trucks
are being crashed into our facilities. The physical damage could
escalate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, police officials have said that violent attacks against
cult members are on the rise. One cult member was stabbed by two
men while he was circulating flyers advertising a computer shop
that is believed to be owned by Aum followers.
</P>
<P>
   Yukinari Yamano, assistant director of the investigation
division of the Justice Department's civil liberties bureau, said
the agency is monitoring the Aum situation and that it does not
normally involve itself in such matters unless a formal complaint
has been lodged.
</P>
<P>
   Yamano said the agency is mainly set up to promote civil rights
and does not engage in enforcement, although it can conduct
investigations and recommend that the Justice Department become
involved. ``One must keep in mind that both the residents of these
cities and the members of Aum have human rights that must be
protected,'' Yamano said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Public Security Commission, an independent body,
rejected the government's request to apply the country's
anti-subversion law to disband Aum.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows the government to outlaw subversive organizations
that have engaged in terrorism and are likely to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the government said it was studying amendments to the
law that would limit the cult's activities, but it abandoned those
plans after religious groups complained that such an amendment
might also restrict their freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government is considering new legislation aimed
specifically at Aum.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to consider this carefully,'' said Nonaka, the Cabinet
secretary. ``But we must step up our effort within the government
to diminish people's concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has opposition to Aum been more hostile than in Otawara,
a place known for its pastoral way of life. Residents work hard
tending the abundant rice fields and dairy cattle that dot the
landscape, but they also take time to enjoy life and to get to know
their neighbors, whom many here consider family.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since 20 members of the Aum sect began converting an old
inn into residential housing two months ago, local residents have
made it clear that they were not welcome. The municipal government
prevented the school registration of two children of Aum's founder,
Shoko Asahara, who is on trial on charges of masterminding the
subway attack and a series of crimes, including murder.
</P>
<P>
   Otawara's Chamber of Commerce has advised city businesses to
refuse to sell goods to cult followers, and many shops display
posters that read ``We do not sell any goods to people connected
with Aum.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, the protests turned violent when a man whom police
described as a right-wing activist rammed his truck into the front
gate of the compound, sending two male Aum members to the hospital
with minor hand and back injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, about 3,500 protesters from Otawara and nearby
towns formed a human circle around the Aum compound and chanted
``Aum get out!''

 &HT;    Nashville's new stadium set to open
 &HT;    By Jane DuBose
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ After three years of temporary shelter, the
Tennessee Titans land in their permanent home today when the
nation's newest NFL stadium opens in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Playing the Atlanta Falcons in a preseason matchup, the Titans
will unveil their new digs to a sold-out crowd of 67,000 at
Adelphia Coliseum. The first regular season game is Sept. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Friday night is a chance for us to promote the economy and
showcase Nashville as a wonderful sports town,'' said Joe Kelley,
chairman of the city's Sports Council.
</P>
<P>
   The $292 million stadium project, which included redevelopment
of an industrial area in East Nashville, was finished two months
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications giant Adelphia Corp., the parent company of
Hyperion Communications, has agreed to pay $30 million to the
Titans over the next 15 years for the right to use its name on the
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although the sale of permanent seat licenses failed to reach the
original goal of 57,000 by August, it appears that the seats will
be filled with fans buying single-game tickets. Just days before
today's opener, more than 50,000 PSLs were sold, and at least half
of the Titans' 10 home games are complete sellouts, said Cliff
Hawks, executive director of the Sports Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are definitely on track with this,'' Hawks said. ``The
model we have been using is Charlotte, which sold PSLs for its new
stadium. We are comparable to them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What remains to be seen is how the team performs in this new
stadium. If the team goes to the playoffs, we won't have any
trouble selling tickets,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   PSL sales are critical because proceeds helped to guarantee
bonds used for constructing the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans are the former Houston Oilers, who announced their
intentions to move to Nashville three years ago. In the interim,
the team has had reason to worry whether many people were willing
to pay to see them play anymore.
</P>
<P>
   First, they finished out a season to sparse crowds at the
Astrodome in Houston, then moved temporarily to Memphis for a
season at the Liberty Bowl, where folks miffed that Memphis hadn't
gotten its own team practically boycotted the games.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Titans finally arrived in Nashville, they
had trouble filling Vanderbilt Stadium at first, but crowds picked
up as the team began to sparkle in the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Titans owner Bud Adams has maintained the team will be a
statewide draw, but Hawks said about 90 percent of the PSLs were
sold to people in Middle Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said the Titans, along with the NHL Predators and the
city's first college football bowl game last year, are putting
Nashville on the sports map.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've done is basically been very fortunate in having
venues turn out well,'' he said. ``They've set the expectation, and
we have to deliver on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville arena, home of the Predators, has also acquired a
corporate sponsor. Gaylord Entertainment, which is based in
Nashville and operates the Opryland Hotel and the Grand Ole Opry,
bought naming rights for $80 million over the next 30 years.
Gaylord also owns 20 percent of the Predators.
</P>
<P>
   Gaylord Entertainment Center, as it is now called, will host the
first and second rounds of the men's NCAA basketball tournament in
2000, and it also houses an arena football team called the
Nashville Kats.

CLINTON RESTS UP FOR THE NEXT ROUND OF FUND   RAISING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Germany, Ireland)   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ After a couple of days of relative languor,
President Clinton resumed his recreational activities Thursday,
riding horses in the morning with his daughter, Chelsea, and
playing two rounds of golf in the afternoon before attending a
clambake Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The most remarkable thing about the president's day was what he
did not do _ raise money. He began his vacation a week ago and has
attended four fund-raisers so far. Two were for his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, who is expected to run for the Senate from New
York, one was for the America Ireland Fund and the fourth was for
the Martha's Vineyard Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that one rolled around Monday night, the money
raising was so common that one of the guests, Mike Wallace, the CBS
newsman, said to the crowd of donors: ``Can you imagine? Another
Bill Clinton fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons spent Tuesday and Wednesday in relative seclusion,
with Mrs. Clinton recuperating from a cold. The couple and Chelsea
went to the beach Wednesday for several hours. While they were
there, a neighbor was holding a beach party for several local
families and their children, and the Clintons joined them for a
couple of hours before spending a quiet night at their borrowed
home.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, Clinton and Chelsea went horseback riding on
the nearby Blue Heron Farm, following sandy narrow paths that cut
through oak forests. The president rode for about an hour, then
headed for the golf course while Chelsea remained behind.
</P>
<P>
   At the Farm Neck Golf Club, Clinton played with two
acquaintances who work for Bear Stearns in New York, Tom Fleaner
and Warren Spector. Their fourth was Ken Iscol of Cellular Phones.
The president blew the first shot into the woods and took a second.
The same thing occurred as he began his second round, this one with
friends from his college days at Georgetown University, Clare
O'Callahan, Maurie Flanagan and her son, Sean.
</P>
<P>
   After the president's first ball sailed off the fairway, Sean,
who appeared to be in his early 20s, told the president to take
another one. ``Hit one more, go ahead,'' he said. The second shot
was more successful. ``Much better, right side,'' Ms. O'Callahan
told the president.
</P>
<P>
   As a damp and chilly night fell over Martha's Vineyard, the
Clintons headed for a clambake at the home of William Rollnick, an
executive with Mattel Corp., and his wife, Nancy Ellison. Rollnick
is a major Democratic contributor and was named last year by
Clinton as his special envoy to Expo 2000 in Germany. The president
has made an annual outing of joining the Rollnicks on the Vineyard.
He was dining at their home two years ago when he learned of the
death of Princess Diana, and he was there last year for roast pig.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are to leave Martha's Vineyard Saturday for the
Hamptons, where an intense round of fund raising awaits them. Mrs.
Clinton is to attend five events and the president four before
going on to upstate New York for another week.

JAMIE TARSES RESIGNS FROM ABC ENTERTAINMENT  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jamie Tarses, who put her stamp on prime-time programming by
championing sophisticated, urban, and sexy comedies, resigned
Thursday as the president of ABC Entertainment, in reaction to a
restructuring of the network's entertainment management.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation ended an often tumultuous tenure marked by
several executive re-alignments that altered her position as the
network's chief programmer. She drew more scrutiny from the media
than any other recent network executive.
</P>
<P>
   The latest and most sweeping change in Ms. Tarses' position came
last month when ABC's parent company, Walt Disney, seeking to cut
costs in the face of declining network profits and to find a way to
get more shows it owns onto ABC's prime-time schedule, merged its
television production studio with the network's entertainment
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarses, who who helped develop hits like ``Friends,'' while
an executive at NBC, and ``Dharma and Greg'' at ABC, said Thursday
that she felt the time had come for her to step away from life as a
television executive. ``I've been at it for 11 years. At some point
you have to wonder, when does your personal happiness factor in?''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged, however, that reorganizational moves by Disney
prompted her decision. She called the reorganization ``necessary
according to the realities of the modern broadcasting business.''
But she questioned whether Disney has the right model, saying,
``The models at the other networks, where CBS takes an ownership
position in most shows it buys from other studios, and NBC is
upgrading its in-house production studio, may be just as viable.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the reorganization ordered by Disney had led to
conflicts among executives ``trying to divide up responsibilities
and still feel they have some autonomy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Disney move, while certain to lead to cost savings, did
create an uncertain hierarchy of three executives in charge of both
the network's programming and development of shows by the
production studio. Ms. Tarses remained as president, but instead of
merely working alongside Stuart Bloomberg, the chairman of ABC
Entertainment, she was also thrust into working with Lloyd Braun,
who had been the chief executive of ABC's television production
studio.
</P>
<P>
   According to numerous accounts by current and former ABC
executives Thursday, the arrangement had quickly grown tense, with
Ms. Tarses unhappy about losing some prerogatives about program
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some real difficulties there,'' one senior ABC
executive said. ``You could read it in everybody's body langauge.''
Ms. Tarses had always worked well with Bloomberg, so the new
tensions were mainly attributed to conflicts between Ms. Tarses and
Braun.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation is effective immediately. Ms. Tarses said she
had not accepted a deal to set up an independent production
company, which is common among departing network entertainment
presidents. ``It's a clean break,'' she said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Fili-Krushel, the president of ABC, said Ms. Tarses had
opted to leave after deciding that ``it didn't work the way she
wanted it to work.'' She said, ``Jamie preferred the old structure
where she had more autonomy. She was not willing to work within the
new process.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarses' resignation came at the end of a week filled with
executive meetings inside ABC Entertainment, where her future was
being thrashed out. On Monday, Newsweek magazine's website reported
that Ms. Tarses would probably be asked to resign this week. But
Robert Iger, the ABC Group chairman, issued a statement saying the
story was ``simply untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   What was true, according to ABC executives, was that Iger made
clear how he expected the new management structure to work, and
that turned out to be unacceptable to Ms. Tarses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tarses said what was most unacceptable to her was that the
stories about conflicts arising from the new management structure
had re-ignited rumors about her job status. ``It started another
round of speculation,'' she said. ``That's not what I signed on
for. It's what I got. But I also got used to being past all that.''
</P>
<P>
   All that included speculation that she had leveled charges of
sexual harassment at an NBC executive in order to break her
contract and leave that network in 1996 and join ABC _ an
accusation that both she and NBC executives denied. That was
followed by almost immediate whispered questions in the television
industry about whether she was old enough to run ABC programming.
She was 32.
</P>
<P>
   ABC did install two executives above her, first Ted Harbert and
then Bloomberg. When the latter arrived two years ago, Ms. Tarses
faced a barrage of speculation about when, not if, she would be
fired. She survived that round of rumors and developed, by all
accounts, including Bloomberg's, an excellent working relationship
with him.
</P>
<P>
   She was credited by many colleagues at NBC with providing some
of the executive guidance that led to that network's ratings
dominance in the mid-1990s. Among other shows she was associated
with at NBC were ``Frasier'' and ``Mad About You.'' Some former
colleagues at NBC noted that after she left that network it
struggled to develop worthwhile comedies.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC she has put on other well-received shows like ``The
Practice'' and ``Sports Night.'' But ABC slid into third place in
the ratings for young adult viewers behind both NBC and Fox. Last
season both Ms. Tarses and Bloomberg guaranteed ABC would improve
in the ratings, but the network still lost viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But Tarses helped develop a different look and tone for the
network, which she said Thursday she was most proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fili-Krushel said that ABC was unlikely to fill the position
Ms. Tarses is leaving.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ms. Tarses, she called herself ``an incredibly happy
person'' after making her decision, and added, ``I definitely never
want to be an executive again.''

 &HT;    Mortgage rates back away from 8 percent
 &HT;    By Susan Harte
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It may seem like a contradiction: The Federal Reserve
Board raises interest rates, and mortgage rates drop.
</P>
<P>
   What's at work, experts say, is a matter of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   After shooting above 8 percent at several local lenders three
weeks ago, the average rate in metro Atlanta dropped to 7.33
percent this week, down from 7.55 percent last week. That's a fall
of more than half a percentage point from the 7.84 percent on Aug.
12.
</P>
<P>
   Then, experts were worried about what the Fed might do and
feared mortgage rates could top 8 percent. This week's drop came on
the heels of the Fed's interest rate increase and the expectation
there won't be another one this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mortgage rates had already bumped up some in anticipation of
the Fed's move. Where they are today will not overly disrupt
general consumer confidence, and certainly not in the first-time
buyer market,'' said Bird Anderson, who manages Wachovia's
residential construction and development lending division here.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, mortgage rates are not directly tied to the Fed's
rates. Instead, they track the yields on long-term Treasury bonds.
When those yields go down _ as they did after the Fed's
announcement _ interest rates on mortgages drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most mortgage rates came down this week along with a decline
in long-term interest rates in general,'' said Frank Nothaft,
deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac, the No. 2 U.S. mortgage
buyer.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Campbell, vice president of MetroFirst Mortgage,
interpreted the drop as a feeling of assurance that the Fed will
not raise rates the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rates are likely to hover around 7.5 percent in coming weeks,
analysts told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   Also last week, the 15-year loan fell to an average 6.97 percent
from 7.16 percent, and the one-year, adjustable-rate mortgage
dropped to an average 5.84 percent against 5.97 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   BankRate.com, which tracks mortgage rates, reported that the
30-year loan carried an average of 0.86 discount points, while the
15-year mortgage had 0.85 points, and the ARM had 0.37 points. A
point, 1 percent of the loan amount, is a fee lenders charge at
closing.

NASA INSPECTIONS UNCOVER WIRE DAMAGE IN ALL SPACE SHUTTLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Inspectors have found wire damage in all four of
NASA's space shuttle orbiters caused by ground servicing equipment,
an agency spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The problems, undetected during routine preflight electrical
checks, were found during inspections triggered after the launch of
Columbia was jeopardized last month by an electrical short.
Columbia carried the giant Chandra X-ray Observatory into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections also uncovered evidence of a past short in
similar wiring of the shuttle Endeavour. That ship had been
scheduled to fly in mid-September with a crew of six astronauts
until NASA suspended operations earlier this month for fleetwide
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NASA managers formally postponed a supply mission
to the unstaffed international space station aboard the shuttle
Atlantis from December until late January to accommodate repairs to
the other orbiters. The decision makes possible two more shuttle
flights this year, bringing the 1999 total to four, the fewest
since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not bad news,'' said James Hartsfield, a shuttle
program spokesman at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.
``We're finding the damage, fixing it and preventing it from
occurring again.''
</P>
<P>
   The wiring issue surfaced dramatically late July 22 as the
shuttle Columbia lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida with the $1.55 billion observatory. Five seconds after
liftoff, a momentary short shut down the computerlike controllers
on two of the shuttle's three primary rocket engines and tripped a
circuit breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Had secondary controllers not functioned flawlessly, the
Columbia crew, led by Eileen Collins, the first woman spacecraft
commander, would have been forced to attempt an unprecedented
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   After the successful, five-day flight, inspectors traced
Columbia's short to wiring that had sustained damage to its
insulation. The wiring ran beneath the left aft payload bay. The
analysis revealed the insulation likely had been damaged
inadvertently when mashed by an access platform used by ground
technicians. The bared wire contacted a rough screwhead during the
vibration of launch, triggering the short, engineers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   When similar but less severe damage was found on the opposite
side of Columbia's payload bay, shuttle managers ordered extensive
inspections of Endeavour, Discovery and Atlantis, and began
postponing launches.
</P>
<P>
   The examinations have found the most damage on Endeavour _ 20
instances of wiring insulation damage, including evidence of
discoloration from a past short on a payload bay power supply wire
and a nick on another wire leading to an oxygen tank heater,
Hartsfield said.
</P>
<P>
   The inspection work on Endeavour is 70 percent complete, and its
11-day flight with an Earth imaging radar apparatus is now planned
for no earlier than October.
</P>
<P>
   The inspections have produced nine instances of wire damage on
Discovery, with examinations about 50 percent complete.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery and a crew of seven had been scheduled for a
mid-October mission to the Hubble Space Telescope when the wiring
problems surfaced. The space telescope's pointing system is in need
of new gyroscopes.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle managers may elect to fly Discovery ahead of Endeavour,
though a decision is not expected until next week at the earliest,
said Hartsfield.
</P>
<P>
   Inspections to Atlantis, which are complete, produced a single
instance of damaged wiring. Its flight to the new space station
cannot be flown until after the Russian's launch the much delayed
initial crew module. Its launching is scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield said ground technicians have extended their
inspections from the shuttle's 60-foot long payload bay to the
electronic compartments in the crew cabin and the aft engine
compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Critical power system wiring is being encased in an articulated
plastic casing. Technicians have also been instructed to make
liberal use of Teflon tape and other coatings to add protection
where they see signs of superficial insulation damage. Burring on
metal surfaces is being sanded where it threatens to damage the
insulation.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, engineers plan to make changes to the access
platforms to reduce the possibility of wire damage.
</P>
<P>
   With its inspections complete, Columbia will be shipped to
Boeing facilities in California next month for a previously
scheduled yearlong overhaul.

DAEWOO'S CREDITORS DEFER DEBT PAYMENTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to make South Korean names conform with AP Style.)   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Daewoo's South Korean creditors gave the
nearly insolvent conglomerate another reprieve Thursday, deferring
repayments on debts owed by 12 of its affiliate businesses for
three months and providing $700 million in new short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time in less than two months that the
creditors have delayed interest and principal due on Daewoo group
debts, which total about $57 billion and have become a growing
source of anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   A Daewoo bankruptcy would mark one of the most spectacular
corporate failures of all time and could reverberate painfully
through South Korea's economy, pulling down 6,000 suppliers and
other, smaller businesses. That could threaten the country's
budding recovery from the financial crisis that erupted nearly two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to a worsening liquidity situation, not only the Daewoo
group, but its contracted suppliers may experience tremendous
difficulties,'' said Lee Yong-keun, vice chairman of the Financial
Supervisory Commission, explaining one of the reasons behind the
reprieve announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a restructuring plan that was announced last week, most of
the conglomerate's businesses will eventually be sold to satisfy
debts, leaving Daewoo with little more than its automotive
business. But the reprieve Thursday will effectively accelerate
that plan by putting the weakest affiliates under bank management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect creditor banks to lead restructuring efforts at
Daewoo affiliates under a firm agreement to defer their debts,''
Lee Ho-keun, managing director of Korea First Bank, one of the
group's major creditors, said.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 Daewoo affiliates affected must sell assets, strengthen
their capitalization and seek foreign investment, the Financial
Supervisory Commission said. The affiliates will also have to lay
off workers, cut wages and scale down their operations, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's domestic creditors will have to accept reduced
interest-rate payments from the affiliates that are put under the
plan, extend loan maturities and transform loans into equity, while
providing ailing companies with enough capital to remain in
business, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The affiliates affected by the arrangement include Daewoo Corp.,
Daewoo Motor Co., Daewoo Heavy Industries, Daewoo Electronics,
Ssangyong Motor Co. and Daewoo Telecom, as well as six smaller
businesses. Daewoo Securities, a profitable brokerage house, as
well as 13 other relatively healthy affiliates, were not part of
the latest debt reprieve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The affiliates selected for workout are either core units or
those facing difficulties in short-term liquidity,'' said Lee
Hun-jai, chairman of the Financial Supervisory Commission. ``The
companies that have been excluded from the workout program are
under normal management and capable of surviving on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo's severe cash shortage has worsened, even though domestic
creditors supplied around 4 trillion won ($3.3 billion) in new
loans last month, as well as a six-month extension of its debt
deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Daewoo agreed to continue interest payments on $6
billion of debt it owes foreign banking companies including Chase
Manhattan, HSBC Holdings and the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo is South Korea's second-largest conglomerate, behind
Hyundai. Financial mismanagement and heavy short-term debts at
several of the biggest conglomerates are considered important
reasons behind the severe Korean financial problems that reached
crisis level late in 1997, requiring an International Monetary Fund
rescue program.

NFL, L.A. JUST CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They say nothing stays the same, and few areas in the world have
changed as dramatically as Southern California in the second half
of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   We've had an explosion of freeways crisscrossing the basin,
replacing the old Red Cars that once dominated the landscape. We've
had a massive influx of immigrants that has altered the
demographics. We've had a profusion of professional athletic teams
starting with the Dodgers arrival from Brooklyn in 1958 descend on
our doorsteps.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite all these significant changes, there, alas, now
is one link between the people who live in this vicinity now and
those who lived here 54 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, what we have common with those hardy World War II
era folks is that we also don't have an NFL team to cheer for like
so many other people do in so many other cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Who ever would have believed that this sprawling area, which as
recently as 1994 boasted the Los Angeles Rams and Los Angeles
Raiders, now would be without so much as one NFL team?
</P>
<P>
   Who ever would have believed that, as another football season is
set to get underway, that we here are left with two colleges, USC
and UCLA, to provide our major football entertainment?
</P>
<P>
   Who ever would have believed that L.A. would be in the same
position as, say, Fresno in regard to having an NFL team as the
millennium nears?
</P>
<P>
   How could this happen?
</P>
<P>
   How could people living in such a large area find themselves
having to get their NFL games via television, or having to take an
hour and a half trek down to San Diego?
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of characters you can point to for such an
odd phenomenon, but no one deserves greater blame than Georgia
Frontiere, Al Davis and members of the Coliseum Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams still would be in Anaheim had Georgia Frontiere put as
much energy and capital into the team during the latter stages of
the 1980s and early part of the 1990s as she did during her wildly
expensive annual three-month summer soirees in England.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of cosmetic surgery she underwent in London is not,
of course, a part of public record, but there is persistent
speculation that she blew millions on such a pursuit, millions that
she could have spent on making the Rams a better football team
instead of the laughingstock of the league the final five years
they were in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere's spendthrift ways resulted in her franchise enduring
serious financial strain, which resulted in her top adviser, John
Shaw, doing business with the politicians of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of all this Rams' untidiness was that St. Louis made
Frontiere an offer she couldn't refuse how could she refuse an
opportunity to have even more face lifts! and the Rams departed
California after arriving in L.A. from Cleveland in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   What made Al Davis' decision to return to Oakland so startling
to most pro football pundits was that he made it after
</P>
<P>
   Frontiere announced her intention to lam it to Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   As you might recall, Davis had been feuding with the Coliseum
Commission almost from the moment he transferred his team to L.A.
from Oakland in 1983, claiming it kept breaking its promise to
build luxury suites for the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Davis got so enraged at the Coliseum Commission at one point
that he even announced he was moving the Raiders to that luxurious
garden spot next to the 605 Freeway, Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   Now you must understand little ol' Irwindale made quite a
distinction in sports over the years staging jalopy races, but no
one thought it ever would be a big-time player on the pro football
front.
</P>
<P>
   And it never did, because of the intervention of the L.A.
politicians, who successfully snuffed out Davis' stadium dreams.
Don't shed a tear for Capt. Al on that particular flameout. He was
reimbursed $10 million from kindly Irwindale, which had promised to
forfeit such an amount to Davis if it couldn't produce the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Al Davis grudgingly would return to the Coliseum, but then a
couple years later Hollywood Park beckoned with still another
stadium pitch, which also went adrift.
</P>
<P>
   When Oakland started waving a low-interest $30 million loan to
Davis and also offered to subsidize the multi-million dollar
renovation of the Oakland Coliseum, Davis decided on a Bay Area
sequel for his Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the 70-year-old Raiders owner, his daring
decision has turned out to be a disaster, with his team having
unraveled artistically and his season ticket sales now having
dipped to a mere 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Never a quitter, Al Davis actually is desperate once again to
shift his team to L.A., but this time the welcome here has been
quite cool, especially from his old pals on the Coliseum
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is now a concerted effort among those involved in
trying to lure an NFL team to L.A. to exclude Davis, which isn't
exactly a horrible idea except those involved in such a chore are
trying to stick a team back in, of all places, the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Please!
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Al Davis returning with his beloved Raiders to
play at, well, Hollywood Park, or some other venue, is a far more
appealing specter than pro football returning to the Coliseum in
the guise of an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   It long has been the strong feeling here that the Coliseum
Commission a disparate body comprised of people representing the
state, county and city governments has done more harm to pro
football in L.A. than Al Davis and Georgia Frontiere combined.
</P>
<P>
   You must not forget it was this sterling group that originally
played hardball with the late Rams' owner, Carroll Rosenbloom, who
reacted angrily by moving his team to Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Coliseum Commission also often seemed to savor calling the
hand of Al Davis, not exactly a shrinking violet in such
situations.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as another football season starts, as we prepare
ourselves to follow the odysseys of the Bruins and Trojans, the
Coliseum Commission and the other L.A. politicians are vainly
trying to bring an NFL franchise back to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   The wagering here is that they will fail, which they're quite
adept at doing.

RENO SAYS WACO DISCLOSURES DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that her
credibility has been damaged by new disclosures of the use of
``pyrotechnic'' tear gas canisters on the final day of the 1993
standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Six years after Reno skillfully managed the political fallout of
a law enforcement disaster to become one of the most popular
figures in the Clinton administration, her supervision of the raid,
her first major task in office, is coming into question, thus
challenging her abilities as the nation's top law enforcement
official.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and officials at the Justice Department and FBI, in
asserting that the government was not responsible for setting the
fire, have long denied that any tear gas canisters were ever used
that were capable of igniting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   But prompted by government inventories used in the assault that
were discovered recently in related civil lawsuits, FBI officials
acknowledged this week that some pyrotechnic canisters were used.
The officials continue to maintain that the fire was set by the
cult members. They say that the pyrotechnic canisters were used six
hours before the fire started and had been aimed at a bunker 100
yards away from the main building that was set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   While the attorney general told reporters Thursday that she was
``upset'' and ``very, very frustrated'' about the latest
disclosures, some former officials who were involved in the 1993
internal reviews of the disaster at Waco said they were not
surprised by the Justice Department's new difficulties, or that
questions still linger over the destruction of the compound and the
deaths of the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Following the incident, Reno and her aides undertook an
examination of Waco that had been perfunctory and uncritical, the
former officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is six years later, and the government's position is
undercut by this fact, which when you get through with it may have
no impact whatsoever on the central question of who killed these
people,'' said Edwin Guthman, a former Justice Department official
in the Kennedy administration and Pultizer-prize winning
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Guthman was one of three outside experts who produced a brutally
candid report for the Treasury Department of its role in the
botched Feb. 28, 1993, raid on the Davidians' compound that led to
the 51-day day standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basic stuff,'' he said. ``When you do these things
you've got to face up to it, be honest about it, and take the
consequences. But whatever the FBI did, they never faced up to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ruth, the former Watergate prosecutor who was also
involved in the Treasury review, said the latest damage to the
Justice Department's credibility was not surprising in view of how
it handled the Waco affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at the time thought the Justice Department evaluation
was a whitewash in the sense that it didn't tell the full facts
about what was known,'' Ruth said. ``It clearly was written to
vindicate the attorney general, for some reason, who speaks well
for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this particular new information by itself bears
on the circumstances of the fire,'' he said. ``But what it clearly
shows is that the internal investigators didn't use the proper
types of investigatory techniques necessary to explore the facts.
That is completely unsurprising because the FBI over time has never
had the institutional ability to investigate itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Thursday that 40 FBI agents, led by an FBI inspector,
will conduct the new inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruth said it would be pointless for those agents to take a
new round of affidavits from those who were involved in the
incident and have already provided testimony to Congress and in the
civil lawsuits. Instead, he recommended an inquiry by agents from
outside the FBI as the only way to produce a credible review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are 40 FBI agents doing interviews really going to restore the
attorney general's credibility?'' Ruth said. ``If they don't reopen
the whole thing now and actually use outside investigators this
will be like the Kennedy assassination for the next 50 years. I
live in the West and the Midwest and this issue is keeping the
militia groups alive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was only one dissent from the 1993 Justice review, by Dr.
Alan Stone, a professor at Harvard law and medical schools who was
one of the experts retained by the Justice Department. He concluded
that the FBI had helped drive cult members to mass suicide and then
misled officials in the review that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a different tack than the attorney general was the
treasury secretary at the time, Lloyd Bentsen, who ordered a more
vigorous review that ultimately led to a major shakeup at the
Treasury's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, including the
removal of Stephen Higgins as the agency's director and the
suspension of five other senior and lower-level officials. Because
the Treasury report was so thorough and critical, ATF has been able
to put the incident behind it, even though it resulted in the
deaths of four ATF agents.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Justice review was seen by many as a whitewash.
Although President Clinton had promised a ``thorough and
independent examination of the affair,'' the main author of the
Justice Department review, Edward Dennis, found that no criticism
of any Justice Department or FBI officials was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find there is no place in the evaluation for blame and no
place for fault,'' he said at the time. He said that ``mistakes
were made'' but did not identify who may have made them.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the Davidians had set the fire, basing
the conclusion on three things: an arson report analyzing the
locations where the blaze began, infrared pictures taken from an
airplane when the fire started that showed intense spots of heat
erupting in different spots in the compound at almost the same
time, and the testimony of some of the Davidians who survived.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said in an interview Thursday that the report ``was not
intended to be a comprehensive, all-encompassing report.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Guthman is highly respected and Henry Ruth is highly
respected,'' Dennis said. ``But they have been critical of the
Justice review from the beginning with little justification other
than what is viewed as the assumption that because this was a
tragic event, someone must have done something wrong at the FBI or
the Justice Department.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said his report ``did not attempt to answer every
question that could be raised about'' Waco, but instead focused on
the questions of how the FBI negotiated with the Davidians, how the
fire was caused and how the attorney general made her decisions. He
concluded that Reno was adequately briefed by the FBI about the
issues she faced in ordering the tear-gas assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a case of the attorney general fiddling while
Rome burned,'' he said, adding that based on what has come out so
far, he remained comfortable with the report's conclusions,
particularly that the Davidians had started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno appeared troubled by the disclosure of the canisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very good for my credibility,'' she said.
``That's the reason I am going to pursue it until I get to the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tear gas used in the assault was liquid sprayed from
the barrels of tank-like vehicles. The use of at least two
pyrotechnic canisters became public in an inventory list of
equipment used in the raid that surfaced in a wrongful-death
lawsuit. An FBI official said the inventory was an internal
document prepared shortly after the raid.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators involved in the Justice Department's initial
review said that the new evidence would not alter their conclusions
that the Davidians had started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was started by the people inside the compound at the
time,'' said Thomas Hitchings, a member of the arson team who is
the chief deputy fire marshal with the Allegheny County, Penn.,
Bureau of Emergency Services. ``The stuff that was used outside the
structure itself had no bearing on what happened inside the wooden
structure.''

RENO VOWS TO `GET TO THE TRUTH' IN WAKE OF FBI REVELATION 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno acknowledged Thursday
that U.S. lawmen might have used flammable gas canisters in their
assault on the Branch Davidian compound near Waco in 1993 and she
promised to ``get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, acknowledging her credibility is now in question, said she
learned this week that FBI agents might have used pyrotechnic gas
canisters in storming the cult's facility after a 51-day standoff
with group leader David Koresh and his followers. But the attorney
general, who had consistently denied any FBI use of flammable
materials, added she remains certain that any explosive devices the
agents might have used did not contribute to the fire that engulfed
the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason whatsoever, at this point, to believe the FBI
is responsible for the deaths of the people,'' Reno said. The
attorney general's comments came a day after she ordered a review
of the assault to determine exactly what equipment was used in the
attack and what effect its use had on the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, all available indications are that the devices
were not directed at the main wooden compound, were discharged
several hours before the fire started and were not the cause of the
fire,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonetheless, it is absolutely critical that we do everything
humanly possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible
and make them available to the public and Congress,'' she added.
``I will not stop until I get to the bottom of this.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, on vacation in Martha's Vineyard, Mass., said
through his spokesman Joe Lockhart that he ``stands with the
attorney general in her determination to get all the facts in this
case and to make them available to Congress and the public as soon
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-five cult members, including Koresh, were killed by
gunfire or by the blaze that broke out during the April 19 raid on
the compound at Mount Carmel. An earlier federal investigation
concluded that some Branch Davidians shot fellow members and
deliberately set the fire during the FBI siege.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at her regular session with reporters Thursday, Reno
said she was told before the raid that lawmen would not use
incendiary devices, assurances that she said were repeated to her
after the assault. Reno then told congressional committees and the
public that the FBI did not use pyrotechnic equipment, statements
that she now concedes might have been untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very good for my credibility,'' she said.
``That's the reason I'm going to pursue it until I get to the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   If FBI agents did use pyrotechnic materials, that could improve
the plaintiffs' chances of victory in a wrongful-death lawsuit
Branch Davidian survivors of the assault have filed against the
federal government in the U.S. District Court for Western Texas in
Waco. Surviving relatives of Branch Davidians who died in the
compound have also joined the lawsuit, which is to go to trial in
October.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday, the FBI said a ``very limited
number'' of flammable military gas canisters might have been used
to penetrate the roof of an underground bunker away from the main
Branch Davidian building. These canisters, unlike their
nonflammable counterpart used by police nationwide, ``may have
contained a substance that is designed to disperse the gas using a
pyrotechnic mixture,'' the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that military gas canisters were used was fueled by
an unconfirmed report that members of the military's elite Delta
Force anti-terrorism unit were at the scene of the Branch Davidian
assault.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the possible presence of Delta Force would be part
of her inquiry, Reno said, ``We will pursue any issue that is in
question.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Pentagon official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told The Associated Press on Thursday that three military observers
were at the scene of the raid but had ``no operational
involvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, in her meeting with reporters, acknowledged she is ``very,
very frustrated'' that it has taken six years for lawmen under her
charge to report that flammable gas canisters might have been used
in the siege. ``But in something like this, you have got to
constantly pursue every issue and not give up and not get
frustrated until you get to the bottom line, which is the truth,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading congressional Republicans have assailed the Justice
Department for the recent reversal on whether FBI agents used
flammable equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa and chairman of the Senate
Judiciary subcommittee that oversees the department, said, ``This
is a serious development in terms of further erosion of the FBI's
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. and chairman of the House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee, said congressional hearings are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am deeply concerned by these inconsistencies,'' he said. ``I
intend for the committee to get to the bottom of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno, responding to the lawmakers' calls for her appearance
before their panels, said, ``As I've always said with respect to
congressional oversight, I welcome it and I'll be happy to
cooperate in every way that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh have ordered 40 FBI agents to
interview everyone who was at the scene of the assault, the Justice
Department reported.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said she has not decided whether the
department or an outside party would conduct the review. She also
did not say when she expects the report to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has often said that she frequently thinks about the
ill-fated raid she ordered six years ago. But she has always added
that she does not second- guess her decision to give the FBI a
green light in light of Koresh's suspected quest for martyrdom, a
point she reiterated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the truths that we will never be able to get to is what
was the right thing to do, because we don't know whether David
Koresh would have done it two weeks later on his own without any
provocation, and we would have been blamed for not acting,'' Reno
said. ``All that we can do in law enforcement, where we deal with
human beings who do different things and march to different
drummers, is make the best judgment we can, based on the
information we have available, pursue it and then do everything we
can to get to the truth and to determine what can be done to avoid
such tragedies for the future.''

BANK UNAWARE LARGE SUMS WERE PASSING THROUGH QUESTIONABLE ACCOUNTS,
SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Exclusive)

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Large sums of money were laundered through accounts at the Bank
of New York for at least six months before the bank was aware of
it, according to people close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   These individuals, who have direct knowledge of the money
laundering investigation engulfing the Bank of New York, said
Thursday that nine New York accounts linked to a company called
Benex became active before March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   More than $4.2 billion that investigators suspect was tied to
organized crime and corporate embezzlement in Russia passed through
these accounts between early 1998 and March 1999. The bank did not
begin cooperating with a federal investigation of money laundering
at the bank until September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that money was filtered through the bank for at least
six months before any action was taken raises questions about how
well accounts and employees were supervised at the bank before the
investigation was begun and will undoubtedly concern regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Also it is not clear why the government allowed the accounts to
remain open so long after the investigation began. In March of this
year, British authorities who had initially notified the FBI about
the suspected money laundering operation in June 1998 expressed
concern that the probe was moving too slowly. Federal and state
bank regulators have declined to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe as much as $10 billion may have been moved
by Russian organized crime and the country's political and business
elites through the Bank of New York in order to hide its origins.
</P>
<P>
   Some news reports have suggested that some of that money may
have been diverted from loans extended by the International
Monetary Fund to Russia in 1998 as part of a failed effort to stop
a series of bank collapses and the crash of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that Attorney
General Janet Reno was given a detailed briefing Thursday on the
scandal and that the Justice Department does not believe, at this
point, that IMF funds were involved in the suspected money
laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the amount of money involved is so great
that it almost certainly did not come only from the direct profits
of criminal activities. Other areas, beside the IMF, that
investigators are studying as potential sources for the money
include looted state assets and corporate corruption.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said that the $4.2 billion
initially moved slowly through the Benex accounts, but then
increased to sometimes very heavy volumes before the bank began
cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of pages of records pertaining to Benex were obtained
through subpoenas sent to the bank, but it could not be determined
when those subpoenas were issued.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said that the government
requested the accounts be left open from September, 1998, until
last week. The accounts were closed only after The New York Times
wrote about the investigation last week, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in New York
declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said Wednesday that no
`smoking gun' has been discovered implicating Natasha Gurfinkel
Kagalovsky, a Bank of New York executive who oversaw the bank's
Russian business and who has been suspended from her job pending
the outcome of the investigation. An investigator also said there
was no document discovered so far that directly linked Ms.
Kagalovsky to the suspected money laundering operation. But he
added that it was ``inconceivable,'' given her position, that she
was not aware of the large volumes of questionable money moving
through the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky's lawyer has declined to comment and she has not
been charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Another bank executive, Lucy Edwards, who worked in the bank's
London office has also been suspended since word of the
investigation was first published. Ms. Edwards has also not been
charged with wrongdoing and it has not been possible to reach her
or her husband, Peter Berlin, who ran Benex, the company whose
accounts are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the investigation said that the Bank of New
York claims it did not know that Ms. Edwards was married to Berlin.
They also said evidence has been found in Ms. Edwards' London home
indicating that she used the Bank of New York name for dealings
unrelated to her bank duties.

 &HT;    Home Depot to halt sale of scarce wood items
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Facing mounting pressure from environmentalists and
shareholders, Home Depot promised to stop selling products with
wood from endangered forests by the end of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based home improvement retailer announced Thursday
that products made with certain types of wood, including cedar,
redwood and lauan trees, will be phased out of stores unless they
are certified to comply with environmental, economic and social
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot expects its suppliers to monitor the wood throughout
the harvesting and distribution process so that the company can
better track the sources of its products.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer also will drop vendors that don't certify their
products, Chief Executive Arthur Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an immense challenge to Home Depot and to our
suppliers,'' Blank said during a news conference. He estimated that
20 to 30 of Home Depot's 5,000 vendors would be affected by the new
wood-purchasing policy.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy covers lumber and any product that contains wood,
including rakes with wooden handles or paint brushes, Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   Lumber represents 10 percent to 12 percent of Home Depot's
business. The retailer is the largest single retailer of lumber in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The policy won't affect prices of Home Depot's products because
the company will absorb added costs to implement it, Blank said.
</P>
<P>
   He made the announcement in conjunction with Home Depot's 20th
anniversary celebration and managers' meeting at the Atlanta Civic
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's environmental policies have been attacked in the
past two years with high-profile protests at the company's
headquarters, stores and annual shareholder meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do what they say they will, it's a great victory for
our campaign and for the forests,'' said Michael Brune of
Rainforest Action Network.
</P>
<P>
   Brune's group has been the most active with protests. Some of
their more adventurous demonstrators hung a banner from a 200-foot
crane on a construction site at Home Depot's headquarters in
Vinings last year. Most protests took place in store parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to quit protesting at Home Depot as long as it
follows through with its policy, Brune said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has repeatedly said that it had no way to track the
wood sources of its 50,000 products, including cabinets, door
handles and hammer handles that contain several types of wood.
</P>
<P>
   Suppliers now must work with environmental groups and other
organizations to certify that their wood products are not taken
from endangered areas.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear which so-called endangered forests fall under the
company's new policy. Suzanne Apple, vice president of community
affairs for Home Depot, said the company is relying on research by
World Resources Institute, for example, to identify high-risk
areas. Forests in Northern California, British Columbia and
Southeast Asia are some of the most oft-cited areas at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Apple noted that Home Depot avoided using the term
``old-growth'' forests in its policy because executives thought the
phrase is open to too many interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot already sells some certified wood products but such
items represent only 1 percent of the total forest products on the
market, according to the Certified Forest Products Council.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from Rainforest Action Network, Greenpeace and
the Sierra Club said they'll now turn their attention to Home
Depot's competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe's Cos., the No. 2 home improvement retailer, said Thursday
it will announce a new certification policy similar to Home Depot's
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pursuing this for a number of months,'' said Lowe's
spokesman Brian Peace. He said Lowe's is working with its major
suppliers, including Georgia-Pacific Corp., on its mandatory
certification program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is clearly on Lowe's to match what Home Depot has
done,'' said Conrad MacKerron of As You Sow, one of several
institutional investors that filed a proposal on Home Depot's 1999
proxy statement regarding sales of old-growth wood.

<P>
   As Ecuador begins the struggle to sell a restructuring plan for
$6 billion of its debt to global investors, Wall Street is
calculating how much owners of this debt might lose. And, at the
same time, investors are wondering whether this so-called haircut
will set a precedent in future debt negotiations between troubled
countries and private creditors.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin called
burden sharing, which is ensuring that private investors pay a
larger share of the official bailouts of countries on the verge of
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The push for burden sharing began after the United States and
the International Monetary Fund bailed out Mexico in 1995, saving
many investors from huge losses. It picked up steam after the Asian
financial crisis, during which the financial assistance from the
United States and the IMF avoided or eased losses for many
bondholders while local workers, who lost their jobs, suffered far
more serious consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Clinton administration Thursday expressed support
for Ecuador's effort, a senior Treasury official indicated that the
resulting burden sharing in this case should not serve as any
precedent. ``The market should not view Latin America or emerging
markets generally through the prism of Ecuador,'' said the Treasury
official.
</P>
<P>
   The official's comments indicate that the administration thinks
Ecuador is a special case because its problems are atypical in
Latin America. The comments also indicate officials don't want to
be hemmed in by guidelines that would prevent them from applying
burden sharing on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, which has been in talks with Ecuador on the bond
restructuring and on an economic plan to help the country get back
on its feet, was also supportive.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big concerns among officials and bondholders is
whether Ecuador has the political will to make the policy changes,
including spending reductions, to turn its economy around. Without
a viable economic plan that is backed by the IMF and appears
credible to investors, there is not much chance the country can
work its way out of its current predicament.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ecuador's debt restructuring _ which could lead to the
first-ever default on the popular Brady bonds that became the
vehicle for restructuring debt in emerging market countries in the
late 1980s _ got underway Wednesday night. In a nationally
televised speech, President Jamil Mahaud said that Ecuador would
delay for 30 days a $96 million interest payment due Tuesday and
ask bondholders to swap their Brady bonds for new debt.
</P>
<P>
   Although the details of the swap were not given, Ecuador will
ask bondholders to reduce the amount of money that the government
owes them. Reducing its debt burden, including interest payments,
is essential to any recovery. Its $13 billion in foreign debt
exceeds size of its gross national product.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Louis Daza, managing director for emerging markets at J.P.
Morgan Securities, estimates that Ecuador will seek debt reduction
of about 30 percent. In trading Thursday, Ecuador's three main
types of Brady bonds were priced from 21 cents on the dollar 32.5
cents and down about a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuadorean Finance Minister Ana Lucia Armijos was quoted by
Bloomberg News as saying, ``What we are doing with the Brady
restructuring is asking bondholders to share the burden, as
international organizations are doing through the granting of
resources, as governments will do through the restructuring of
Paris Club debt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paris Club is the group of nations, including the United
States, that have made separate loans to the governments of many
emerging market countries. Ecuador will also seek to get some debt
reduction of the over $1 billion it owes the club.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Treasury official said the administration encourages
Ecuador to work with the IMF on ``a strong economic program that
will lay the basis for stability and economic recovery'' and to
work with its private creditors to reach arrangements that ``best
satisfy their common interest in economic recovery.'' The official
added that ``on that basis we would be prepared to support an IMF
program and a restructuring of Ecuador's debt to Paris Club
creditors.''
</P>
<P>
   This means the Treasury wants an IMF agreement before
negotiations with Brady bondholders.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin brought burden sharing to the fore again in a speech last
October, when the world financial crisis was at its worst and the
Clinton administration was talking of a new international financial
architecture to deal with such problems. ``Private-sector burden
sharing is critical,'' he said, ``not only because there will not
be sufficient official money for all circumstances, but also
because it is absolutely essential in inducing market discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   But since then, no one in the administration has set out
guidelines for burden sharing. In April, not long before he
announced his resignation, Rubin repeated the call but acknowledged
that he did not know how this should be done. And it appears that
the administration is still loath to set up any guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   One fact that may have been overlooked in all this is that the
Brady bonds that Ecuador is trying to restructure already have been
subject to burden sharing, as all Brady bonds were.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds, named for former Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,
were designed as a way to repackage the billions in dollars of
unpaid bank loans to many Latin American countries that effectively
defaulted on them in the early 1980s. The repackaging into bonds
made the old loans more attractive to investors because they could
be traded easily and they came with various guarantees on the
principal and interest.
</P>
<P>
   But the essence of the Brady bond program was the agreement by
the banks to reduce the the amount of debt owed them by the
countries, led by Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. For example,
Mexico, the first country to negotiate a Brady bond deal, got a 35
percent reduction in the face value of its outstanding bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's Brady bond deal, which was issued in 1995, came with a
40 percent reduction in its outstanding bank loans at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is what kind of impact the Ecuador restructuring
will have on other Brady bonds.
</P>
<P>
   While any restructuring _ whether it results in default or not _
should have an impact on other countries' Brady bonds, it is hard
at this time to measure. Daza said that one reason is that it is
not clear yet how the restructuring will be done. A lot will depend
on whether the exchange is done in what he called a ``market
friendly way.''
</P>

   But so far the damage has not been that bad to other markets.
According to J.P. Morgan's index of Latin American bonds, while the
yield on Ecuador's bonds, compared with U.S. Treasury bonds, has
skyrocketed since May, this so-called spread has stayed relatively
stable on the debt of Brazil, Argentina and Mexico.

   And Daza said that he is surprised that the price of Ecuador's
debt has not fallen further, given the clear threat of default.
Therefore, he said, prices have further to fall.

REPUBLICAN STATE CHAIRS ADVISE BUSH TO KEEP QUIET ON COCAINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Aug. 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A majority of the Republican Party's state chairmen
and women say they would advise presidential frontrunner George W.
Bush to turn down any more questions about whether he has used
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in a telephone poll last week by The Hearst Newspapers
what they would tell the Texas governor to do about the issue, 26
of the state GOP leaders said he should refuse to discuss it
further, and four said he should answer questions about it
completely. The rest either refused comment or didn't return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the state GOP leaders said it was a mistake for Bush to
have broken his long silence on the cocaine question two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994 when he first ran for governor of Texas, Bush
repeatedly refused to respond to rumors that he had used cocaine.
He would end discussions of the illegal drug by saying such things
as ``When I was young and crazy, I was young and crazy.'' Often he
would say he had ``learned from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Aug. 18 he told a Dallas Morning News reporter, who had
asked if he could pass an FBI background check for some federal
appointees that, yes, he could and that he had not used cocaine in
the last seven years. The next day, after the story produced a
media stampede, he said in different ways that he could pass a
White House background check going back to 1974. That was
interpreted to mean that Bush, who is 53, had been cocaine-free at
least since he was 28.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bush, who as governor has talked tough about hard drugs and
stiffened penalties on those who break drug laws, is being
pressured by the media and by other Republican presidential
candidates to answer more questions about any cocaine use before he
was 28.
</P>
<P>
   The issue came up again last Thursday when GOP candidate Gary
Bauer, discussing the campaign with reporters, predicted that
public pressure will become ``overwhelming'' and that Bush will
eventually be forced to answer more fully. ``I don't believe a
question about a felony should be brushed aside,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Hearst poll, many Republican state leaders warned
Bush to steer clear of the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Williamson, the Illinois state Republican chairman who
served as a White House assistant to President Ronald Reagan, said
he would tell Bush, regarding the press: ``Don't feed the beast. It
has got a ravenous appetite and it will never be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   More answers will only trigger more questions, Williamson said.
``It will be, `How many times did you do cocaine, whom you did it
with, what about LSD and what about marijuana.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Clay, chairman of Georgia's Republican Party, said that by
expanding on his comments, Bush put himself ``a little bit between
the devil and the deep.'' Clay said he would advise Bush that ``you
done said enough. Just stick out your chin and gut it out and say,
`Enough said, I ain't addressing it again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Edwards, Oklahoma's state GOP chairman and former chief
legal counsel for the National Republican Congressional Committee,
said Bush should declare the topic ``off limits.'' Edwards added,
``There's no smoking gun here, no Monica and no dress.'' He was
referring to the evidence that led to the House to impeach
President Clinton last December and the Senate to acquit him in
February.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia state Sen. J. Randy Forbes, who chairs the state's
Republican Party, suggested that Bush should follow the lead of
former President Reagan, who often pretended he didn't hear
questions he didn't want to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Constantino, who heads Wyoming's GOP, said, ``My advice
would be to stay the course. The more he answers, the more
questions will come. Frankly, I'm sorry he's answered as much as he
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Novak, a lawyer who heads Pennsylvania's Republican Party,
said Bush ``should not feel compelled to subjugate himself to the
demands of a confessional society.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy DeVos, Michigan's Republican chairwoman, said that further
answers wouldn't do ``anybody any good. ... It seems to be an
incessant line of questioning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the four GOP state chairmen who said Bush should fully
answer the questions, insisted that such an approach would allow
him to put the issue aside.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon Republican chairman Perry Atkinson said the Texas
governor ``should just come clean. ... If he would just say what
his involvement is and when, then he would get the story behind
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah's party chairman Bob Bishop, said Bush should ``tell
everything that he has or has not done whether it's negative or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Trent Clark, who chairs Idaho's Republican Party, said Bush
should ``answer the question straightforward and then move on to
the issues of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona GOP Chairman Mike Minnaugh said he doubted an admission
of drug use by Bush ``would damage him.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls support that conclusion. An ABC News poll conducted
after the drug issue made headlines showed 84 percent of those
surveyed said even if Bush had used cocaine in his 20s, it would
not alter the way they will vote. And 79 percent of respondents
said it wouldn't affect their votes if Bush refused to answer any
more questions about cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the 26 who oppose further discussion of the cocaine
matter said it is irrelevant to Bush's qualifications for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   California's John McGraw described the issue as a
``media-contrived frenzy,'' that voters don't care about.
</P>
<P>
   Montana's Matt Denny said, ``We have a whole generation of
people running for office who grew up in an era where free love and
the drug culture were prevalent.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayne Robinson, Iowa's GOP chairman, said Bush got into trouble
this month by being too honest. ``In trying to answer questions
honestly, it just begged more questions,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Vermont's party chairman, Patrick Garahan, sees the reporters'
clamor over the cocaine issue as an effort to balance their
coverage. ``Some of the national media went after Clinton; now they
want to even it up,'' Garahan said.
</P>
<P>
   The persistent questioning of Bush ``may not die down, but it
may have an enormous backlash in his favor,'' predicted North
Carolina Republican Chairman Bill Cobey. ``People only have a
certain amount of tolerance for people being dogged on any one
issue,'' Cobey said. ``At some point in time they say this person
is being victimized by the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Others among the 26 Republican state chairs saying Bush should
ignore cocaine questions: Winton Blount III, Alabama; Tom McKay,
Alaska: Bob Beauprez, Colorado: Chris DePino, Connecticut; Basil
Battaglia, Delaware; Kathy Watson, Maine; Dick Bennett, Maryland;
Brian Cresta, Massachusetts; Mike Retzer, Mississippi; Chuck
Haytaian, New Jersey; John Dendahl, New Mexico; Bob Bennett, Ohio;
Joel Rosenthal, South Dakota, and David Richard Tyson, West
Virginia.

WRESTLING THE ANCESTORS OF OUR STEERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some wall sculptures in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford, England,
raised the eyebrows of the visitor from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   One showed several men and bovine animals in frenzied action. It
depicted a sport that was popular in Thessaly, Asia Minor, from the
first to the third century A.D. _ a sport called bull wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   The printed explanation of the relief said in part: ``The bulls
were chased on horseback. The rider would seize his victim by the
horns and wrestle it to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Another relief of similar vintage from ancient Smyrna (now
Izmir, Turkey) depicted a competition in which a man lies prostrate
on the ground clutching the horns of a prostrate bull. The caption
on it read: ``The second day of the Taurokathapris Festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Tauro, Taurus, Toro, Torero. You get the connection.
</P>
<P>
   I was not surprised when the Fort Worth Star-Telegram's Jim
Jones, after returning from a seminar at Oxford University, told me
about the bull wrestling reliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The bull, symbolizing power, sexuality and danger, figured
prominently in the religious, cultural, economic and recreational
life of many ancient cultures.
</P>
<P>
   A wall painting from ancient Crete, for example, depicts the
sport of bull-jumping. In that painting, men on each side of the
bull steer it toward another man, who grabs the charging animal's
horns and vaults over the bull's entire length, turning
one-and-a-half somersaults in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Jones had brought the wall paintings to my attention because he
knew of my long-standing interest in Bill Pickett, the
African-American cowboy and member of the National Cowboy Hall of
Fame, who is credited with having invented the modern rodeo sport
called steer-wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   A picture of Pickett dressed in the attire of a bull wrestler in
ancient Smyrna or Thessaly flashed through my mind, and I reflected
briefly on the possibility of reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledge of the antiquity of bull wrestling in no way detracts
from the importance of Pickett's contribution to the modern rodeo
sport. In fact, there were others in his own era who wrestled
steers before he did, both in their regular work and as sport.
</P>
<P>
   It was the different twist that Pickett gave to the practice
that made him famous and the sport popular. He'd ride after the
steer, jump off his horse onto the animal's shoulders, grab it by
the horns, twist its head around, sink his teeth into its upper
lip, release his grip on the horns and fall backward or sideways,
bringing the animal down using just his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   They called the sport bulldogging then because what Pickett did
was reminiscent of the way that cow dogs were used sometimes to
subdue cattle in the thick brush country of Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The sport was renamed steer wrestling after the humane societies
made Pickett and his imitators give up the practice of biting
steers.
</P>
<P>
   It is noteworthy that steer wrestling is the event portrayed in
the posters advertising the 4th Annual Cowboys of Color Rodeo that
takes place Sept. 4 at Will Rogers Coliseum in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time that the event, which is becoming a
September tradition, will be held at Will Rogers. The first two
were staged at the Cowtown Coliseum in Fort Worth's historic Stock
Yards.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 riders and contestants will participate in the
tri-ethnic competition, which calls attention to the contributions
of African-Americans, Hispanics and Native Americans to the cattle
culture.
</P>
<P>
   There will be noon and 8 p.m. editions of the rodeo, which will
include all the traditional events.
</P>
<P>
   As a special treat, the rodeo usually includes an exhibition of
a cowboy bulldogging a steer the way Pickett originally did it.
Well, not quite. The cowboy usually bites into the steer while it
is in the chute and then falls down with it, instead of first
jumping off a horse onto the running animal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is well worth seeing. And the rodeo is for a good
cause: It benefits the Renaissance Cultural Center in Fort Worth.
The center is doing a remarkable job of focusing upon the
achievements of African-Americans in all walks, including their
contributions to the heritage of the American West.
</P>
<P>
   While at the rodeo, one might keep in mind that hundreds of
years ago in ancient Thessaly, Smyrna and Crete, spectators cheered
daring athletes for doing similar feats. They just wore different
clothes.

Do-Right,'' the live-action big screen version of the misadventures
of accident-prone Canadian Mountie Dudley Do-Right, is well, a big
dud.

   FILM-CHOCOLATE (Undated) _ Just when gay-themed films such as
``Edge of Seventeen,'' ``Get Real'' and ``Trick'' take a step
forward, along comes a comedy from Canada that pushes things back a
notch. Sure, ``Better Than Chocolate'' winds ups on a positive note
_ there are thankfully no suicides or murders _ but it's just a
little too pretty, comical and about lust to feel true.

Michael Crichton's attached to it is kicked around the release

gets a last-minute title change to boot, it certainly builds up
some negative expectations. Surprisingly, it's not so bad.

better than the originals. Unfortunately, the studio's latest

 &HT;    The play of his life
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ If only there were a deep pass pattern in the Miami
Dolphins playbook to match the efficiency of Tony Martin's exit
from the federal courthouse in downtown Miami Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Down the stairs in heavy traffic from his second-floor acquittal
on money laundering charges. A brief hesitation move on the
courthouse steps to draw the media's attention. Then, boom, down
the sidewalk, around the corner and gone, the wheels of justice
carting him briskly up Interstate 95 toward the Dolphins' Broward
County training facility and, more than likely, a high five and a
hug from Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Call the play ``No. 80 Flyaway Home'' and count on it for much
more than a lousy touchdown. Martin just spent a month huddling
with defense lawyers in a building so cold and sterile that there's
a metal detector at every door. All the while he was looking at
three to five. Not yards, mind you, but years.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, as prosecutors painted a picture of deceit and
conspiracy and revoltingly criminal greed, Martin wore the dazed
look of a man put on trial for friendship alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm not here to tell you that Dan Marino's new best friend,
this veteran wide receiver with the home-run range, is totally
blameless in his association with Rickey Brownlee, a major vendor
of heroin and cocaine and other poisons in the northern end of
Miami-Dade County. If nothing else, Martin's name on the leases of
three luxury cars in Brownlee's personal stable lent legitimacy to
a louse. Got the attention of federal agents, too, who in their
zeal to net the bottom-feeding big fish hauled Martin, a mindless
minnow, into court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to be more strict on myself,'' Martin told reporters
Thursday, but only after leaning over Brownlee's shoulder at the
defense table to express his continued affection and support for a
man who's facing life in prison for Thursday's five separate
drug-related convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Loyalty is no virtue when it is shown to a rattlesnake. At that
point it translates into stupidity, and a potentially fatal strain
of it. Does it sound like he gets it yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really let it sink in that he's convicted,'' Martin
said of Brownlee, known as ``The Mayor of Opa-Locka'' on the
streets. ``I'm just so pleased with my `not guilty.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two previous drug convictions for Brownlee, who should go by the
more appropriate nickname of ``Vice Mayor,'' must not have sunk in,
either. By convicting Brownlee of cooking up a money laundering
scheme with Martin and then letting the football player go free,
the weary jurors apparently concluded that Martin was too dense to
recognize a conspiracy even when he was surrounded by one.
</P>
<P>
   When it's all said and done, the jury deliberations spread
cruelly over three days, the roundup of TV trucks idling
impatiently outside the courtroom, even the childlike testimony of
Dan Marino that his teammate is a nice guy who's never broken a law
in his presence, it must be said that Martin paid some serious
penalties for his indiscretions, acquittal or not.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons, last year's Super Bowl team, cut Martin
loose in February for fear that the trial's result might rob them
of their leading receiver anyway. The Dolphins wrote him a
free-agent contract that dropped nearly all of his $3.3 million
signing bonus on the other side of a successful trial verdict. Even
now, with attorneys to pay and, according to his bankruptcy filing,
$1.8 million in debts to settle, Martin won't be far from starting
all over again financially after nine NFL seasons. Pathetic to hear
Hal Martin talking outside the courtroom Thursday about taking over
his 33-year-old son's financial affairs, right down to the creation
of a simple budget.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than all of this, however, was the 15-minute recess that
inexplicably halted Thursday's proceedings between the arrival of
the jury with a verdict and the dramatic announcement of its
findings. Martin walked outside the courtroom for a gasp of fresh
air at that point, his parents and his girlfriend at his side, and
wondered what else could go wrong. Silly to compare it to a
field-goal kicker getting frozen by a timeout in the final seconds.
That's a game. This was torture.
</P>
<P>
   Even the good news, delivered once the judge and the jury and
the lawyer were back in place, went down with a gulp of nasty
medicine. Before Martin's verdict was read, he listened to Brownlee
being judged guilty five times on five counts, like the haunting
toll of a bell. Martin's five counts came last of all, his heart
stopped at the thought of how one conviction could negate the
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty ... Not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah,'' shouted Hal Martin, and Jimmy Johnson must have
done the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 80 Flyaway Home,'' the skeptics will say, that's a play
that couldn't possibly fail, given the celebrity involvement of
Marino and the supposed unwillingness of any Miami juror to cast a
vote against the Dolphins offense.
</P>
<P>
   Don't say that Tony Martin walked, however. From the look on his
face Thursday, it was more like running for his life.

 &HT;    Dolphins pleased with Martin decision
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Jimmy Johnson doesn't usually watch television in
the middle of the day. Doesn't matter if CNN is covering a war, or
The Weather Channel is tracking a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   This, however, was different. This was the day that a jury in
the federal courthouse in Miami would decide whether one of the
Dolphins coach's offseason gambles _ the signing of a receiver who
was facing money laundering charges _ would pay off.
</P>
<P>
   So shortly before a 2 p.m. practice, Johnson was sitting in his
office, watching the TV. And when the station interrupted its
regular-scheduled programming to deliver the news _ Tony Martin was
found not guilty on all five counts _ Johnson let out a yell.
</P>
<P>
   With that announcement, Johnson and the Dolphins instantly lost
$3.2 million _ the remainder of Martin's $3.3 million signing bonus
that was payable only if he was able to play _ but they acted like
they had won the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson ran onto the field for practice, he pumped both fists
in the air. He could've given the players the news, but he knew
that wasn't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word spread like wildfire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Receivers coach Robert Ford talked about staff and players doing
somersaults on the field. And he was only slightly exaggerating.
</P>
<P>
   For a team that has spent most of this month losing receivers to
injury _ only four were healthy enough to practice Thursday _ this
verdict was a welcome change of events.
</P>
<P>
   It meant that the Dolphins will have a receiver who has averaged
15.3 yards a catch during nine NFL seasons. It also meant that they
could feel vindicated for wanting that player after he was cut
loose by Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see our justice system really prevailed,''
Johnson said, ``and that people that stuck with him, he proved them
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson not only signed Martin to a four-year, $14.2 million
contract. He was part of a large contingent of Dolphins' staff
that, when the trial opened Aug. 2, showed up at the federal
courthouse to sit behind Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody that I talked to that knew Tony said he was really a
good person,'' Johnson said. ``I called the league office. Tony has
been in this league for 10 years. And they said for 10 years he has
been clean on everything. They've got a file on every person in
this league _ players, coaches, whatever _ and there are very few
people that have empty files.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Dolphins' players, such as receiver O.J. McDuffie, made
several visits to the courthouse. And quarterback Dan Marino
testified for Martin's character _ a move that became the latest
controversy in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Some ripped Marino for the move. Others rushed to his defense.
Others had some fun with the whole situation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, as Dolphins' fans waited for the verdict,
``The First Team'' on WQAM radio played highlight tapes of Marino
throwing passes to Martin ... followed by lyrics from Sting.
</P>
<P>
   (ITALICS) ``If you need somebody ... free, free, set them
free.'' (END).
</P>
<P>
   After the jury did indeed set Martin free, Marino wasn't
available for comment. But McDuffie and cornerback Terrell Buckley
defended Martin _ and their decision to publicly support him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went down there because Tony's my friend,'' McDuffie said.
``I think Danny did the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckley added: ``It's a nice day. It's a great feeling to know
that a guy goes to court, has his day, says his word and then he is
found not guilty of helping a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the verdict, Martin called Johnson and told him
that his first stop after leaving the courthouse would be the
Dolphins' training facility in Davie.
</P>
<P>
   Ford was waiting. When he headed to a receivers' meeting at 4:30
p.m., he carried Martin's playbook under his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have this so he can start cramming for Saturday (an
exhibition game against Detroit),'' Ford said. ``We'll start
working him pretty good.

LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ARGUED AGAINST LENIENCY FOR FALN MEMBERS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A wide range of federal law enforcement agencies
that were asked to review a clemency petition filed by imprisoned
members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group unanimously opposed any
leniency in the weeks before President Clinton offered to commute
the sentences of 16 members of the militant organization, officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The clemency petition was flatly opposed by the FBI, the Bureau
of Prisons and U.S. attorneys in Illinois and Connecticut, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While their opposition was mentioned in a final report from the
Justice Department to the White House, that report made no specific
recommendation, as such reports often do. Instead, the report on
the 16 members of the militant Puerto Rican independence group
known as the FALN, for Armed Forces of National Liberation,
contained what law enforcement officials said was a more carefully
worded analysis that presented the president with multiple options
for each prisoner, from unconditional release to no leniency
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that presenting the White House a
multiple-choice format was highly unusual for the highly
confidential clemency reports and suggested a diversity of views
within law enforcement agencies that did not exist. The officials,
who said they were troubled by the decision, acknowledged that they
had no evidence that anyone at the Justice Department or the White
House intentionally sought to distort the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have not publicly addressed the issue,
but they have complained bitterly in private about the president's
Aug. 11 decision, which one senior official said, left law
enforcement officials ``stupefied'' and ``outraged'' by the
conditional offer of clemency to the nationalist group members.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Thursday that he would
not discuss the details of communications between the Justice
Department and the White House, but said that Charles Ruff, then
the White House counsel, was well aware of the views of law
enforcement agencies and faithfully presented those views to
Clinton. ``The president and his counsel fully understood the range
of views on this issue and were not deprived of any advice they
needed,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Ruff, who stepped down from the counsel's job this
month to return to private law practice, acknowledged that he had
extensive discussions with lawyers in the deputy attorney general's
office at the Justice Department. He would not discuss the
conversations in detail, but said that ``nothing out of the
ordinary'' happened.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 FALN members in question were convicted of crimes
like possession of unregistered firearms and interstate
transportation of a stolen vehicle and none were specifically
linked to crimes that resulted in deaths or injuries. Even so, they
received sentences of 50 or more years in prison and most have
already served more than 19 years. But in their recommendations,
FBI officials complained about granting any leniency to persons
convicted of terrorist-related acts at a time when the United
States was engaged in a worldwide battle against terrorism.
Officials at the Bureau of Prisons, who monitor the FALN members'
visits, telephone calls and letters, concluded that they might not
be trusted to renounce the militancy that led them to the
independence group. Two U.S. attorneys who were consulted both
recommended against leniency. They were Scott Lassar in Chicago
where 12 of the prisoners were convicted and Stephen Robinson in
New Haven, Conn., where four members of the group were convicted of
crimes related to an armored car robbery.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, officials in both offices declined to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the power to grant pardons rests exclusively with
the president, and the White House has not always accepted the
Justice Department's recommendations. In pardons, commutations and
clemency issues, the Justice Department and its agencies play only
an advisory role and the president is free to weigh any viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, thousands of people signed a petition and lobbied
for the prisoners' release, among them former President Jimmy
Carter and prominent human rights leaders like Desmond Tutu, the
retired Anglican archbishop and a nobel laureate, and Coretta Scott
King, widow of the civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Several Democratic lawmakers from New York also urged Clinton to
release the 16 prisoners, including Reps. Jose Serrano, Charles
Rangel, Nydia Velazquez and Eliot Engel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is highly unusual for the president to reject the
unanimous recommendation of law enforcement agencies like the FBI,
particularly in a case related to a group responsible for bombings
that killed six people and maimed dozens of others, including
several New York City police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The clemency offer has been criticized by politicians like New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, who has asked
Clinton to rescind it, and by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, a
Democrat who rarely criticizes the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have criticized Clinton on the ground that the
clemency offer appeared to be an effort to rally support among the
large population of Hispanic voters in New York as Hillary Rodham
Clinton moves closer to entering the race there for the Senate. But
White House officials have denied the decision was an attempt to
help her, saying the deliberations began before she considered
running for office.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists have
not yet decided whether to accept the presidential offer of
clemency. Jan Susler, their Chicago-based lawyer, said Thursday
that the prisoners want to reach a unified decision but are
dispersed at 11 different federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   After a conference telephone call conducted by the group, she
said that they had carefully considered the offer, but ``have a lot
of proble the proposals,'' in part because of the
conditional nature of the offer, which could restrict the
prisoners' activities out of prison, including their ability to
contact each other.

INTERNET BOARD ADOPTS RULES FOR RESOLVING CLAIMS TO DOMAIN NAMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Chile)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Internet's new oversight board Thursday
adopted a proposal for resolving competing claims to the names used
for Internet addresses. But it heeded calls to delay putting the
rules into effect until it can address concerns that they favor big
companies and trademark holders over individuals and small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for resolving disputes over domain names _ the
words or phrases used for Internet addresses, like Amazon.com or
Netscape.net _ was the major issue before the group, the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, at an open meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the disputes that arise when different parties want
the same name, as well as ``cybersquatting'' _ the practice of
buying domain names made up of popular words and trademarks in
hopes of reselling them at a hefty profit.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which will be written into all domain name
registration contracts, will require that all disputes involving
trademarks be sent to mandatory arbitration, with the loser paying
the fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major benefit of this policy is that the people who
register domain names, whether they are individuals or businesses,
will have a much clearer picture of what their rights are,'' said
Esther Dyson, interim chairwoman of the group, which is known as
ICANN. ``This makes it much easier to resolve disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some participants were concerned that the definition of
cybersquatting as an ``abusive'' use of a trademark was too broad,
and would enable trademark holders to take back names from people
who had legitimate claims to them.
</P>
<P>
   That practice has increased as more companies trying to build
businesses on the Internet find that names they want have been
taken _ often by businesses with the same name or by people who use
the name for a personal Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ICANN said the policy should not be put in place
until a committee can more clearly define what constitutes bad
faith and abuse in registering Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The board gave its staff 45 days to appoint a group to devise a
narrower definition of cybersquatting and to strengthen language
safeguarding the rights of all sides in disputes over legitimate
claims to a domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides said they were pleased with the
compromise, reached after two days of preliminary meetings by
advisory groups.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a definite step in the right direction,'' said Mike
Heltzer of the International Trademark Association. ``I'm glad to
see the ICANN board has recognized that cybersquatting is in fact a
problem for trademark holders and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Kleiman, who is part of a group of noncommercial interests
that pushed for changes to the policy, said, ``If that spirit of
compromise carries through, I think we will wind up with a process
that more fairly balances the rights of domain name holders and
trademark holders.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the first charges of ICANN, which was picked last year by
the U.S. Department of Commerce to take over the administrative
functions of the Internet, was to introduce competition into the
business of registering names in the popular domains of .com, .net
and .org. Since 1993, Network Solutions, a Herndon, Va., company,
has held an exclusive government contract to provide that service.
</P>
<P>
   In opening that business to competition, the board has been
working to insure that common rules apply to all the companies it
accredits to register domain names, and one rule involves domain
name disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions has traditionally favored trademark holders
when presented with such claims, resulting in highly publicized
cases like that of a boy nicknamed Pokey who almost lost the domain
name of his personal Web site to the toy company holding the
trademark for the Gumby and Pokey dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, a federal court recognized for the first time
the rights of individuals in such cases. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruled against the Avery Dennison label company,
returning the domain of avery.net to a man who owns the domain and
leases it to several individuals with the last name of Avery.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time that the board, under pressure from
the Clinton administration and the U.S. Congress, had opened its
decision-making meeting to the public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision on the dispute-resolution policy came at the fourth
public gathering of ICANN's interim board. It was the first
substantive decision by the international board, whose main charge
is to create the structure for a membership that is expected to
begin electing permanent board members at its next meeting, in
November in Los Angeles.

 &HT;    Martin found innocent of all charges
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tony Martin was
acquitted in Miami Thursday on four counts of money laundering and
one count of conspiracy, he might have been tempted to send the
Atlanta Falcons a big ``I told you so.''
</P>
<P>
   But Martin and his father, Hal, who lives in Atlanta, were not
second-guessing Falcons coach Dan Reeves for releasing Martin in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all or nothing, and my whole career was flashing before
me as I sat there,'' Martin said minutes after crying in the
courtroom when the verdict was read. He was facing a possible three
to five years in prison. The jury had deliberated 17 hours. The
Falcons waived Martin when he refused to postpone a $400,000 roster
bonus owed him March 1. Reeves said he had wanted to understand
Martin's case better before committing to the 10-year veteran, even
though Martin led Atlanta last year with 66 receptions and 1,181
yards.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Michael Johnson and his coach, Clyde Hart, had
been talking about breaking the world record in the 400 meters for
nearly a decade. They talked about it again at the beginning of
this season and, whenever another nagging pain or nagging newspaper
article would begin to gnaw away at Johnson's mood or motivation,
they would talk about it some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your goal this year?'' Hart would ask him, remind him.
``What's your goal?''
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to do it in Thursday night's 400-meter final at the
World Track and Field Championships, but as Hart watched Johnson
warm up and then walked with him to the Estadio Olimpico, there was
suddenly no more talk about Butch Reynolds' 11-year-old mark of
43.29 seconds. Instead, there was a tacit understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were aware that the opportunity was there,'' Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   And as Johnson took off with the sound of the gun, Hart's
stopwatch would soon confirm their mutual suspicions: 10.9 seconds
after 100; 21 seconds after 200; 31.3 seconds after 300, and now it
was getting serious and now Johnson was sprinting _ unaccompanied
as usual _ toward the finish with the numbers on the clock whirring
just to the left of his line of vision.
</P>
<P>
   It would not be until the 399th meter that Johnson allowed his
eyes to drift toward the numbers, and what he saw as his barrel
chest crossed the imaginary tape was that Reynolds' record was
finally his. The clock stopped at 43.19 seconds although the
official time would soon be corrected to 43.18, and Johnson, after
punching the air with his right index finger extended, was soon
posing in front of that delightfully low number, his decade-long
quest now behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the timing was perfect,'' Johnson said later. ``I
can't think of a better time in my career to beat this world
record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over; it's been a long hunt,'' said Hart, a
fellow Texan who has worked with Johnson since high school.
``Obviously, he is in better shape than he's ever been in.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson set a world record in the 200 in 1996, breaking it in
the Olympic trials and then, golden shoes on his feet, breaking it
again in the Olympic final in Atlanta in an astonishing 19.32
seconds. He won a gold medal in the 400 in those Games, as well,
and after Thursday night's victory, he has now won the 400 four
consecutive times at the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson became a double world-record holder less than three
weeks before his 32nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really always felt that if my career ended at any point
after 1996, I couldn't not be happy,'' he said. ``I've gotten a lot
more out of this sport than I would have thought I would;
experienced more than I ever thought I would; had a lot more
success than I ever thought I would. Since 1996, I've always felt
I'm lucky and fortunate and never would complain, but I've always
wanted this world record, and now everything is totally complete.
But I feel I'm still motivated to go to Sydney next year and defend
both Olympic titles.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   As an Australian, Cathy Freeman, who won the women's 400
Thursday night just before Johnson's dash into the record books, is
probably even more motivated. In 1997, she became the first
Aboriginal from her country to win a world championship. This time,
she survived a surprising late surge from Germany's Anje Rucker in
lane 8 to win in 49.67 seconds. ``I realize that the pressure in
Sydney will be tenfold,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
   The other winners Thursday night were Maksim Tarasov of Russia
in the men's pole vault and Gete Wami of Ethiopia in the women's
10,000. Tarasov's victory marked the first time in the history of
the world championships that Sergei Bubka was not the gold medalist
in the pole vault. Bubka could not compete here because of an
injury, but Tarasov, the 1992 Olympic champion, would have been the
favorite in any case. And his winning effort in Seville of 19 feet
9 inches was better than any of Bubka's in this competition.
Dmitriy Markov, an Australian who formerly represented his native
Belarus, won the silver medal; Aleksandr Averbukh, an Israeli who
used to be on the Russian team with Tarasov, won the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Wami, a bronze medalist in the last Olympics, trains at home
with fellow Ethiopian Haile Gebrselassie. And after Gebrselassie
pulled away on the final lap to win the men's 10,000 on Tuesday,
Wami did the same Thursday night, blowing past silver medalist
Paula Radcliffe of Britain to win in 30 minutes 24.56 seconds.
Kenyan Tegla Loroupe, a two-time winner of the New York marathon,
took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   But the medals, for a change, were secondary Thursday night to
Johnson's time. His previous best in the 400 was a 43.39 at the
1995 world championships, but he let the track and field world know
that something lower might be coming when he ran a 43.95 in
Tuesday's semifinals despite slowing to a jog in the final 50
meters. Johnson and Hart had known it was imminent since last week,
when on his second day in Seville, Johnson went through a typical
workout _ two 350-meter runs with four minutes rest between them _
in very atypical fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He blew the ceiling out of it,'' said Hart, who said Johnson
ran the second segment in 43 seconds. ``And I knew then. It was
scary. I wanted to put him in deep freeze then. The hardest thing
has been just trying to stay ready for the last three or four
days.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing for Johnson has been staying healthy over the
last three years. He tore a quadriceps muscle in a 150-meter,
post-Olympic showdown with Donovan Bailey that was more prize fight
than footrace. He has had recurring problems with his right
hamstring; problems that he discovered last year were linked to a
skeletal imbalance that caused a vertebra to drift out of
alignment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clyde and I were both just extremely pleased last year to
finish a season healthy; the last time I did that was in 1995,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, he was able to lay down a substantial base in
training despite nagging leg injuries again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took 11 years for him to beat 43.29; and it will probably
be another 11 years before somebody beats 43.18,'' said George
Johnson, the coach of the American men's team in Seville.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Johnson does it first. ``I compare this to the 19.66 I
ran in the 200 at the Olympic trials in 1996,'' Johnson said. ``I
can do better.''

DELUGE CRIPPLES NEW YORK CITY AREA AT MORNING RUSH HOUR

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Torrential rains that fell in blinding silver
cataracts inundated much of the New York metropolitan area during
the morning rush Thursday and, with shocking swiftness, brought
regional transportation to the edge of chaos. Many rail lines and
subways were crippled for much of the day, highways were rivers of
stranded cars and millions were caught in the worst flash flooding
in years.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning from meteorologists who had forecast rain but
not a deluge, the skies opened up shortly after the gray dawn and,
over the next two hours, unleashed cloudbursts _ 2.5 to 4 inches of
rain in New York City and parts of New Jersey, the National Weather
Service said. Later, even heavier rain fell in Suffolk County on
Long Island: 6.1 inches in Manorville and 3.76 in Brookhaven.
</P>
<P>
   As if trying to make up for the summerlong drought, the storm _
a vast lake-in-the-sky that diabolically let go over the city and
suburbs at the peak of the rush between 7 and 9 a.m. _ all but
washed out a transportation latticework that, on a normal weekday,
breathes millions of commuters in and out of New York City with
relative ease.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by thunderclaps and stabs of lightning, the rain
fell too fast to soak into the parched ground and ran like
millraces _ along highways and streets, into low-lying commuter
railroad bottlenecks and into the grates and stairwells of New York
City subways, where the water rose over the tracks, soaking power
rails, switches and signal equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The subways, which carry 4 million riders a day, were especially
hard hit, with service on virtually all lines through Manhattan
halted during the morning rush, and later running only
sporadically, with huge passenger loads and long delays, until 4
p.m., when nearly all lines were restored. Floodwaters up to 5 feet
deep also disrupted subways in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens.
</P>
<P>
   While power on most of the subways was shut down for less than
an hour, the effects dragged out for most of the day as enormous
crowds gathered on the platforms for trains that seemed never to
come, or spilled into the streets to clamor aboard packed buses or
join the hopeless search for a vacant cab. Many chose to walk, if
possible, or just went home.
</P>
<P>
   Metro-North trains, which carry 105,000 riders into Grand
Central Terminal each morning on its Hudson, Harlem and New Haven
lines, came to a standstill at 8:10 a.m., halted by a waist-deep
lake covering the Mott Haven junction in the Bronx where all three
branches funnel together for the final plunge to midtown.
</P>
<P>
   Only 66 of Metro North's 125 morning trains made it to Grand
Central before the power was shut off at Mott Haven. Forty-nine
trains, unable to get through, were turned back to points upstate
and in Connecticut, but 10 others were stranded at the junction for
up to six hours, officials said, until power could be restored or
diesels run in to pull them out.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 p.m., Metro-North restored limited service for the
homebound rush, but some commuters who flocked to Grand Central
Thursday night were bewildered by an unfamiliar jumble of revised
numbers on the tote boards, and a few, like Bernardina Moyett, who
works in midtown and lives in the Bronx, were wary after a bruising
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little terrified,'' she said when asked if she was
looking forward to her trip home.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Brucker, a Metro-North spokesman, said that line expected
near normal service Friday morning, except that some trains might
have fewer cars _ some, he said, were damaged by Thursday's
flooding _ and trains may be delayed slightly because engineers are
to creep cautiously through Mott Haven.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The Long Island Rail Road, which has elevated tracks on many of
its lines, reported no delays. But flooding was reported on
highways and secondary roads throughout New Jersey, with 2 to 3
inches of water on the New Jersey Turnpike, and on Manhattan's East
Side, scores of firefighters and police officers waded onto the FDR
Drive and rescued the occupants of 80 cars trapped by floods.
</P>
<P>
   No one was killed or seriously injured in the downpours, which
contributed badly needed water to drought-stricken reservoirs in
northern New Jersey. But the rains missed New York City's upstate
reservoirs and, by knocking out much of the region's
transportation, made tens of thousands absent from or late for
work, forcing many offices and businesses to operate with short
staffs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the city's disruptions at a late-morning news
conference, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani refused to criticize transit
officials. ``I would not Monday morning quarterback at this
point,'' he said. ``I need to know more about it. This was a very
unusual flash flood and, I don't know if it's fair to say, well,
they didn't anticipate it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But the City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, denounced the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ``Today, we had three inches
of rain and millions of people could not get to work,'' he said.
``Unbelievable. The largest city in the nation with the largest
subway system in he world could not handle three inches of rain.
Unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Vallone praised commuters and transit employees for being calm
in the face of great frustrations. ``Millions of commuters were
stuck like sardines on trains, buses and subway platforms, and had
absolutely no idea, no idea, of what was going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials emphasized the timing and severity of the
rains, and the lack of any warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the heaviest rain I've ever seen, like a waterfall,''
said Albert O'Leary, a spokesman for New York City Transit, which
operates the subways and buses. ``This is not a situation that had
been predicted. We were not forewarned that this was going to be an
extraordinary rainfall, and it unfolded in the heart of the rush
hour, when people were already committed to their morning trip to
work. There was nothing we could do to save this rush hour.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said it became clear shortly after 8 a.m. that the
flooding had become not just a service impediment but dangerous to
riders and employees, and power was shut off on all lines between
59th Street and 34th Street in Manhattan. That suspended service on
the A, C, E and F lines, and on the 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 lines on the
West and East Sides.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the power was back on within an hour and trains
began running sporadically, the rush period had been lost, and huge
crowds still undelivered to their destinations jammed the platforms
and buses all day long.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Hofmann, New York City Transit's senior vice president
for subways, said that in 30 years with the system he had never
seen so much water. ``The problem is that it came down so fast. I
couldn't see three feet in front of me. It was like 10 or 12 water
main breaks all at once.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The surging floodwaters tore out 20 feet of the northbound
platform at 28th Street on the West Side IRT, he said, and a wall
collapsed at the IND's 161st Street and River Avenue station
outside Yankee Stadium. Extensive repairs will have to be made, but
neither station will be closed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, Hofmann said, the water was 52 inches deep
at Cypress Avenue on the No. 6 line in the Bronx, and 30 inches
deep at Longwood Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Morrin, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service at
Brookhaven on Long Island, said the torrential rains were dropped
by a huge tropical air mass that had been gathering moisture from
the Atlantic as it moved up from the South in recent days. Arriving
in the metropolitan area, it collided with a slower-moving warm air
mass and, in effect, climbed up over it. As it rose, it cooled
rapidly, and the moisture condensed and fell _ suddenly and
massively.

BANK UNAWARE LARGE SUMS WERE PASSING THROUGH QUESTIONABLE ACCOUNTS,
SOURCES SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS four graf at end.) (Exclusive)

 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN and RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Large sums of money were laundered through accounts at the Bank
of New York for at least six months before the bank was aware of
it, according to people close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   These individuals, who have direct knowledge of the money
laundering investigation engulfing the Bank of New York, said
Thursday that nine New York accounts linked to a company called
Benex became active before March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   More than $4.2 billion that investigators suspect was tied to
organized crime and corporate embezzlement in Russia passed through
these accounts between early 1998 and March 1999. The bank did not
begin cooperating with a federal investigation of money laundering
at the bank until September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that money was filtered through the bank for at least
six months before any action was taken raises questions about how
well accounts and employees were supervised at the bank before the
investigation was begun and will undoubtedly concern regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Also it is not clear why the government allowed the accounts to
remain open so long after the investigation began. In March of this
year, British authorities who had initially notified the FBI about
the suspected money laundering operation in June 1998 expressed
concern that the probe was moving too slowly. Federal and state
bank regulators have declined to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe as much as $10 billion may have been moved
by Russian organized crime and the country's political and business
elites through the Bank of New York in order to hide its origins.
</P>
<P>
   Some news reports have suggested that some of that money may
have been diverted from loans extended by the International
Monetary Fund to Russia in 1998 as part of a failed effort to stop
a series of bank collapses and the crash of the ruble.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said that Attorney
General Janet Reno was given a detailed briefing Thursday on the
scandal and that the Justice Department does not believe, at this
point, that IMF funds were involved in the suspected money
laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that the amount of money involved is so great
that it almost certainly did not come only from the direct profits
of criminal activities. Other areas, beside the IMF, that
investigators are studying as potential sources for the money
include looted state assets and corporate corruption.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said that the $4.2 billion
initially moved slowly through the Benex accounts, but then
increased to sometimes very heavy volumes before the bank began
cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of pages of records pertaining to Benex were obtained
through subpoenas sent to the bank, but it could not be determined
when those subpoenas were issued.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said that the government
requested the accounts be left open from September, 1998, until
last week. The accounts were closed only after The New York Times
wrote about the investigation last week, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the FBI and the U.S. attorney's office in New York
declined to comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the investigation said Wednesday that no
`smoking gun' has been discovered implicating Natasha Gurfinkel
Kagalovsky, a Bank of New York executive who oversaw the bank's
Russian business and who has been suspended from her job pending
the outcome of the investigation. An investigator also said there
was no document discovered so far that directly linked Ms.
Kagalovsky to the suspected money laundering operation. But he
added that it was ``inconceivable,'' given her position, that she
was not aware of the large volumes of questionable money moving
through the accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky's lawyer has declined to comment and she has not
been charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Another bank executive, Lucy Edwards, who worked in the bank's
London office has also been suspended since word of the
investigation was first published. Ms. Edwards has also not been
charged with wrongdoing and it has not been possible to reach her
or her husband; &LR; gQ t Berlin, who ran Benex, the company whose
accounts are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The people close to the investigation said that the Bank of New
York claims it did not know that Ms. Edwards was married to Berlin.
They also said evidence has been found in Ms. Edwards' London home
indicating that she used the Bank of New York name for dealings
unrelated to her bank duties.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky's husband, Konstantin, vice chairman of a large
Russian oil company called Yukos, is also being investigated in
connection with the suspected money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Kagalovsky is a former vice chairman at Menatep, a
now insolvent Russian bank that once did business with Bank of New
York. Investigators are examining whether Menatep accounts were
laundered through the American bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kagalovsky has declined repeated requests for an interview. In a
statement Wednesday, Menatep said that ``neither the institution
nor its esteemed former vice chairman can in any way reasonably be
implicated'' in charges of money laundering at the Bank of New
York.

BACKING WOMEN IN WORK WORLD, CELLUCCI NOMINATES MARSHALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Shifting attention from recent scandals to his support
for women, Paul Cellucci Thursday nominated state Supreme Court
Associate Justice Margaret H. Marshall to be the court's first
female chief justice, then denounced as sexist the criticism of his
choice of aide Virginia Buckingham to head Massport.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those men out there who are threatened by powerful women _
get a life,'' Cellucci said at a State House press conference as he
outlined his reasons for appointing Buckingham. The room, filled
with Marshall's colleagues in the legal community, exploded in
applause.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's impassioned defense of women's place in the work
world underscored his desire to move beyond the events of the last
10 days, in which Massport director Peter Blute was forced to
resign after taking an agency-funded ``booze cruise,'' with
swimsuit-clad young women, and an administration official faced
allegations she an affair with her top aide.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's elevation offered a perfect platform as Cellucci
lavishly praised the 54-year old jurist and spoke of ``her
outstanding intellect.'' He said Marshall's experience as a white
South African who fought apartheid will help her ``carry on the
battle for fairness and tolerance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She has had extraordinary life experience,'' Cellucci said.
``She is a person of great courage, of great character who is ideal
to lead the oldest appellate court in continuing existence in the
western hemisphere into the 21 century.''
</P>
<P>
   The nomination is expected to be approved by the Governor's
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, who pushes a law-and-order agenda, brushed aside
suggestions that the liberal-leaning Marshall's positions on
criminal justice issues differ significantly from his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only would she uphold those positions but she agrees with
those positions,'' Cellucci said. ``She agrees we have to protect
the people of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was more circumspect when pressed on her legal and
philosophical differences with the governor. She dodged a question
about capital punishment, which Cellucci supports and she opposes.
</P>
<P>
   A gradate of Yale Law School who also has a master's in
education from Harvard University, Marshall was appointed to the
court by former Governor William F. Weld in 1996. She had been a
senior partner at Choate Hall &AMP; Stewart and was general counsel of
Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the historic significance of her appointment as the
court's first female chief, and not her resume, that dominated
Cellucci's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I confess that it is particularly thrilling for me to know
that a woman has played a role in my nomination,'' Marshall said,
referring to Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift's influence in the
selection. ``If confirmed, I shall serve not only as the first
woman chief justice but as the first women to head one of the three
branches of government in this Commonwealth. I look forward to
being the first of many women to head a branch of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Others in the legal community took note. Martin W. Healy, legal
counsel to the Massachusetts Bar Assocation, said Cellucci's
decision to tap Marshall is an ``an historic and exciting moment
for the Commonwealth,''
</P>
<P>
   Healy said that, in her three years on the court, Marshall has
been ``basically centrist'' in her decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is strong on constitutional rights for individuals. But
she has not really defined herself as a conservative or a
liberal,'' Healy said.
</P>
<P>
   In her three years as an associate justice, Marshall has
authored opinions strongly favoring civil liberties. She wrote, for
example, that those convicted of sex crimes deserve a hearing
before their names are entered on the state's sex offender
registry.
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues said Marshall will bring a hands-on management to the
court system, and will move to to bring state-of-the-art technology
to judicial offices and courthouses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to leading the SJC, the chief justice has broad
administrative authority over the state's court system, and is
involved in issues ranging from legal ethics to courthouse
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a system slow on the uptake over the years,'' said
Donald K. Stern, the US Attorney in Boston. ``The system is ready
for some changes, and she is going to be the right person at the
right time to make those changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern believes Marshall will nudge other judges to become more
involved in the communities they serve. ``I think more day-to-day
to engagement in the problems of the Commonwealth would be a
healthy thing,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Others praised Marshall for her warm personality. ``She is a
wonderful person to be with,'' said Harvard Law professor Charles
Fried, who just retired from the court. ``She is smart. She is very
hardworking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fried said he would not ``even try'' to describe what her
legal philosophical leanings are or where she as the chief justice
would take the seven member court.
</P>
<P>
   With a feminist tone dominating the media event Thursday,
Cellucci grew animated and emphatic when answering questions about
the appointment of Buckingham, his 33-year-old chief of staff, who
has no background in aviation or maritime management.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said ``a double standard'' has been applied to
Buckingham, noting most of the men who have held the post had no
related experience, but never faced those questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now a woman is being appointed,'' Cellucci said. ``All of
sudden, people are saying she has to have aviation experience. That
is a double standard that I object to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said Buckingham's experience as chief of staff to him
and to Weld prepares her for the port authority job. He said she
has helped manage the biggest public entity in Massachusetts, state
government, and has his full confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the executive director of Massport is not to run
the airport,'' Cellucci said. ``We have a professional airport
manager who is an expert in aviation. We have a professional
seaport manager who is an expert in maritime issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said Buckingham's professional training in
communications and her service as press secretary to Weld will help
repair Massport's tattered image.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is an agency who needs to have its image
rehabitlated, it the Massport agency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buckingham will be thrust quickly into the role of chief
advocate for the controversial for construction of a new runway at
Logan Airport, which is opposed by local neighborhoods and powerful
politicians.

COUSY TO COMMENT ON CELTICS GAMES   FOR FOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bob Cousy has come to terms with the Celtics and Fox
Sports New England to work as a color analyst and as a marketing
representative in the team's front office.
</P>
<P>
   Cousy's future as a broadcaster became uncertain when FSNE
landed a television deal to broadcast every Celtics game. The
television rights were available after Channel 68, the Boston
University-owned station, was purchased by PAX and refused to air
the team's road games. Cousy worked for Channel 68 last year and
covered about 40 games.
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement calls for Cousy, 71, to work as many as 10
games next season and work in the booth with Tommy Heinsohn and
Mike Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess everybody is happy now,'' Cousy said.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics legend said he doesn't plan to hold his tongue
because the Celtics are signing his paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I have to hold on to is my credibility,'' Cousy
said. ``When those turkeys go out there and don't show up, I'm
sorry, but I have got to tell the world. I used to have a lot of
heated discussions with Mr. Gaston Sr. After a game he would come
up to me and say, `Geez, Bob, you didn't have to be so hard on us.'
I'd tell him the same thing. Don't shoot the messenger.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of candor that FSNE needs to give its broadcasts
the necessary weight. ``If I were told what to say or how to say
it, I wouldn't do it,'' Cousy said. ``There's a way to be honest
without being destructive. If I jump all over coach (Rick) Pitino
or 'Toine (Antoine Walker), it's because I thought they deserved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Cousy's integrity will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that everyone has to remember is that viewers don't
watch a game because of the announcers,'' Cousy said. ``If the
product is solid and the team is competitive, then everybody's job
is a lot easier.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ The sale of about 40 MiG fighter jets to
North Korea has set off a diplomatic furor here, including a
possible U.S. threat to cut off aid.
</P>
<P>
   What Kazakhstan officials describe as a rogue group that
included senior government officials had already delivered an
undisclosed number of the jets to North Korea before the deal was
discovered last month and the shipments halted.
</P>
<P>
   The affair has brought down Nurtai Abukayev, head of the State
Security Committee, who had been considered one of the most
powerful men in the country after President Nursultan Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Foreign Minister Kasymzhomart Tokayev said
neither Nazarbayev nor Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev knew of
the sale in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the sale, the second such incident this year, has angered
some of Kazakhstan's most important foreign allies and caused the
government to appear inept, naive or reckless. The episode comes at
a tense moment in which the United States, Japan and South Korea
have protested North Korea's ostensible plan to test-fire a
long-range missile.
</P>
<P>
   Details are sketchy, but diplomats say a Kazakh company agreed
to provide North Korea with 30 to 40 MiG-21s, a 1960s-era fighter
that is still effective in an arena like the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in a month, Japan and South Korea have
issued diplomatic protests to Kazakhstan, but the government seems
particularly worried about a diplomatic breach with the United
States, a guarantor of Kazakhstan independence from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is reviewing the matter and ``there
certainly is the possibility that sanctions may be triggered,'' a
U.S. official familiar with the case said in a telephone interview
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan is scheduled to receive about $75 million in
much-needed U.S. aid this year, but that money and future funds are
in jeopardy because of the sale, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea is one of seven nations that Washington considers
sponsors of terrorism, and U.S. law prescribes sanctions against
countries that provide ``lethal military assistance'' to any of
them. The State Department has a range of options, from waiving
sanctions entirely to halting all assistance.
</P>
<P>
   In the last publicly disclosed application of such sanctions, in
April, three Russian companies were barred for a year from any
business with the United States after they sold antitank weapons to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviet Union collapsed at the end of 1991, some of its
military goods were in republics that eventually became independent
nations, and became their property.
</P>
<P>
   While a thriving global arms market has resulted, experts say it
has been relatively unusual for the weapons to be sold to nations
on the U.S. list of nations that support terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, the Kazakhstan government managed to smooth
over a similar incident. On March 19, Azerbaijan announced that it
had impounded a Russian-registered cargo plane on a flight from
Kazakhstan that was carrying six disassembled MiG-21s.
</P>
<P>
   There was confusion as to its destination. The manifest listed
Slovakia. Kazakh officials said it was headed for the Czech
Republic. Crew members said they were going to North Korea.
Azerbaijan said the jets were headed to Yugoslavia, which is
subject to a U.N. embargo and was then being bombed by NATO. In the
end, no conclusion was reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they didn't realize the importance of selling these
planes, especially to a terrorist country like North Korea,'' a
diplomat here said. ``They do now.''

 DRUG FIRM MAKES OFFER TO SETTLE NORPLANT CASE (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several years of litigation, American Home Products Corp.
said Thursday that it had agreed to pay cash settlements to 36,000
women who contended they were not adequately warned about the
possible side effects of the company's Norplant contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, American Home Products is
expected to pay out between $50 million and $75 million, according
to Turner Branch, one of the lead attorneys for the plaintiffs.
Women who choose to settle their lawsuits will receive $1,500 each,
far from the jackpot attorneys had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total disappointment,'' Branch said. ``But we didn't
get good results in jury trials in South Texas. I'm definitely not
jumping with excitement, but the settlement is voluntary. The women
can take it or not take it.''
</P>
<P>
   A settlement of any kind marked a strong reversal of strategy
for American Home Products and its subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories, which still sells Norplant. The device, six silicone
capsules injected into a patient's arm, can prevent pregnancy for
up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Women who used the contraceptive had long complained that
Norplant's label did not adequately warn about severe side effects
like excessive menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea, dizziness,
mood swings and depression.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products had vehemently denied these contentions,
arguing that the side effects associated with Norplant were clearly
described on in its label. The company had been successful in its
defense of the contraceptive, winning three jury verdicts and 20
summary judgments and having 14,000 claims dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy surrounding Norplant, millions of women
have used it. American Home Products said Thursday that Norplant
had been used by more than 1 million women in the United States and
by nearly 5 million women worldwide. According to the Associated
Press, annual U.S. sales peaked in 1992 at $120.7 million but slid
to $4.4 million through November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Thursday that American Home Products had offered
to settle the Norplant claims to improve its image and allow the
company to focus on its troubled operations. Over the last two
years, American Home Products has withdrawn three products from the
market, including the diet treatment fen-phen, and experienced
steep sales declines in its agricultural division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settling these cases was purely a business decision,'' Joseph
Mahady, Wyeth-Ayerst's president for North America, said Thursday
in a statement. ``Our legal success has come at a steep price
because lawsuits are time- consuming, expensive and have a chilling
effect on research.''
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products has been no stranger to litigation. Its
liabilities over claims that fen-phen caused heart-valve damage
could exceed $3 billion. While analysts have been concerned over
those liabilities, many were relieved over the likely amount of the
Norplant settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American Home Products pays only $50 million to $75
million, that is a low sum,'' said Sergio Traversa, a
pharmaceuticals analyst with Mehta Partners, a research company in
New York. ``But for consumers to collect millions of dollars, they
have to prove permanent damages. Most of the side effects the
Norplant users complained about went away once they had it
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who filed lawsuits about Norplant before March 1 can
participate in the settlement, according to an American Home
Products spokeswoman. Lawsuits that are not settled through the
agreement will proceed through the courts. American Home Products
said in a statement Thursday that any remaining Norplant lawsuits
would be defended aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., has come to be
regarded as one of the pharmaceutical industry's financial
laggards. With earnings last year of $2.47 billion, the company can
certainly afford to pay for the Norplant settlement, but its
performance has trailed many of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at most large pharmaceutical companies are expected to
swell 12 percent or more this year. American Home Products'
earnings will most likely decline, giving it one of the industry's
worst performances. Shares of American Home Products fell $1.8125
Thursday, or 3.8 percent, to $46.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the symbols of the '60s _ peace sign, marijuana leaf,
electric guitar _ the one that came closest to home for many
Americans was a stylized antelope leaping over a chrome hoop. It
was affixed to some eight million Chevrolet Impalas in that decade,
out of a phenomenal 1958-85 production run of 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Countless baby boomers came of age in that full-size Chevy,
which melded power, pizazz and patriotism _ think of Dinah Shore
and commercials for ``baseball, hot dogs and Chevrolet'' _ with
old-fashioned value. The line included the right car for just about
anybody _ powerful Super Sports for high school hot-rodders, sedate
sedans for Gramps and Grandma, family wagons that were the minivans
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Cole, Chevy's onetime general manager, distilled the formula
into a phrase: The Impala was ``a prestige car within the reach of
the average American citizen.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Impala is back now, as a 2000 model. But this is a different
age for Chevrolet and its new flagship, which cannot pretend to be
a prestige car any more. As GM tries to cram its nameplates into
niches _ Oldsmobile as import alternative, Pontiac as the
``excitement'' brand _ Chevy is stuck with a value label that
offers little latitude for high performance or trend-setting style.
Names like Malibu and Impala try to recapture lost glory, but the
badges are affixed to quietly competent cars unlikely to elicit the
envy that an Impala SS once stirred up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if one can avoid comparisons between the old rear-drive,
V8-powered Impala and the new front-drive, V6-engine sedan, the new
Chevy holds its own. It improves in many ways on the less
expensive, less roomy, soporific Lumina (which is still being
made), and it offers a lot of space, pretty good performance and a
few unexpected features. And to their credit, the designers tried
to make the Impala stand out from the flock of midsize-cum-big
cars. The rear end even includes the round taillights that were a
longtime Chevy trademark, though there are just four _ like a
declasse '60s Bel Air _ instead of the Impala's traditional six.
</P>
<P>
   The styling borrows other old themes _ sculptured rear-quarter
panels from the late '60s, a roofline like the Impala SS's of the
mid-'90s _ but the various planes don't hang together prettily.
Bystanders' comments were only slightly favorable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least the styling is distinct from the cars with which the
Impala shares its structure: the Buick Regal and Century, Olds
Intrigue, Pontiac Grand Prix _ even the Lumina. Of course, the most
basic question is why the Impala exists at all; GM. now offers,
depending on how one counts, 12 to 14 midsize cars, plus another
half-dozen full-size sedans. For a company trying to slim down,
building and marketing all those models amounts to a lot of
duplicated expense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM didn't need to come up with money for a new drivetrain; it
just dusted off its 3.4-liter (base model) and 3.8-liter (LS and
base option) V6 engines. These overhead-valve power plants are
about as old as Methuselah, but they hold up pretty well against
newer designs. Both are paired with a workmanlike four-speed
automatic.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a fairly stiff structure, the big sedan handles
surprisingly well, at least with the firmer suspension of the
top-line LS. Both test cars _ an LS and a preproduction base model
_ tracked nicely on the highway and stayed planted on country
roads, except when bumps or curves got extreme. Body roll was
evident only when the car was pushed too hard. The ride was smooth,
with the storm-tossed feel of an old Caprice showing up only on the
worst bumps.
</P>
<P>
   The rack-and-pinion steering, unfortunately, was overassisted
and anesthetized; road feel amounted to harsh feedback from surface
imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   GM has worked hard to improve its brakes, and the four-wheel
disks are quite good. But only the LS includes an antilock feature
_ odd, since all Cavaliers and Malibus have it _ and the test car
emitted an alarming groan when they engaged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chevy also offers a traction control and tire-pressure monitor
that can tell if one 16-inch tire is rolling slower than the
others.
</P>
<P>
   The Impala's cabin is spacious enough for six 6-footers, with
scads of room for big heads and long legs _ the government
classifies this as a large car, in contrast to the Ford Taurus _
and the basic seats provided fair support. Indeed, I found the base
model's front bench preferable to the LS's wide, flat, slippery
leather buckets. Doughnut headrests aid visibility but can't be
moved forward to offer much neck support.
</P>
<P>
   A side air bag (just one, for the driver) is standard on the LS.
The rear seat has three built-in headrests and anchors for three
child seats. The trunk is impressively large.
</P>
<P>
   The curving dashboard looks like many Buicks' (and superficially
like the one in the new Mercedes S-Class). The controls are nicely
laid out, with big knobs that will be appreciated by arthritic
fingers. Stereos include Radio Data System technology like that on
luxury cars _ and that is of limited use until more stations send
signals that include data the radio can display.
</P>
<P>
   One nifty touch: The air vents close flush like elegant little
Venetian blinds, blending into the surrounding, same-color panel.
One ugly touch: Chevy left big screws exposed over the gauges and
on the doors.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin of the preproduction car, like the trim in other early
Impalas, was a riot of mismatched colors, but the trim in later
cars seems much improved. Indeed, the overall quality of the LS was
fine, in keeping with the good record of Luminas from the same
Oshawa, Ontario, assembly plant.
</P>
<P>
   Chevy expects to sell about 200,000 Impalas a year, which would
put it barely among the nation's top 10 sellers. The market has
changed significantly since 1965, when Americans drove home nearly
1.1 million new Impalas, a single-model record that still stands.
(The most popular car of 1998, the Toyota Camry, had 430,000
sales.)
</P>
<P>
   Boomers who drooled in the back of '60s Impalas are in the
driver's seat now, and their mature bodies can appreciate the new
car's unbeatable space-per-dollar equation. They may also like the
way it rides and drives. But while the Impala has its charms, if it
makes a middle-aged heart beat faster it may be time to see a
cardiologist. &QL;

BOSTON ROWER LOSES OUT ON WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. CATHARINES, Ontario _ No busted equipment this time. No
freak tidal wave in lane 6. ``No bad luck,'' sculler Jamie Koven
shrugged Thursday morning, after he'd missed making Saturday's
final at the world rowing championships on placid Martindale Pond.
``Just didn't have it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Brown grad and Boston financial analyst was
on top of the planet, winning the single in his first try. Last
summer, a popped oarlock knocked him out in the semifinals. This
time, he just got outraced by a Canadian, a Bulgarian and a Slovak
in his semi and had to hold off a Briton to have a chance at
preserving the US entry for next year's Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to come in fourth or I wouldn't even have made the B
final,'' said Koven, who needs to be in the top five in Friday's
consolation race to avoid next summer's special qualification
regatta for Sydney. ``And the guy I beat is an Olympic gold
medalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Time was when you could save your A race for the final. No
longer, especially in the men's single, the most brutal event on
the card. Four world champs (defender Rob Waddell of New Zealand,
Derek Porter of Canada, Juri Jaanson of Estonia and Koven) plus
Olympic gold medalist Xeno Mueller of Switzerland are in this
field. One bad piece and you're down by open water.
</P>
<P>
   Koven had his in the second 500 meters Thursday and found
himself sitting in fifth while Porter and Bulgaria's Ivo Ianakiev
ran away with the race. ``That can't be right,'' he said later,
peering at the result sheet in the boathouse. But it was, and Koven
needed a zinging final 1000 to hold off Greg Searle and get another
shot for his country at the Olympic roulette table.
</P>
<P>
   That's what it's coming down to for the Yanks, who had hoped to
improve on the nine medals (in 24 events) they won at Cologne last
time. Though it's still mathematically possible -- they're already
in five finals with a chance at six more in the semis -- the
numbers have been running the other way. The uh-ohs began when the
men's pair and four washed out in the repechages and continued
Thursday when six of the seven US entries (all but lightweight
sculler Lisa Schlenker) failed to advance to the final.
</P>
<P>
   Sculler Leslie Burns Rawley finished last in her race. Sally
Scovel and Lianne Nelson led their pairs semi at the quarter pole
but sagged to fourth. The double of Ian McGowan and Nick Peterson
missed by a seat. Boston consultant Bill Belden Jr. finished fifth
in the lightweight single. And Norwood's Carol Skricki, who just
missed a medal in the double with Laurel Korholz last year, ended
up fifth with new partner Cindy Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was giving everything I had,'' said Skricki, who'll need to
finish in the top two in Friday's B final for the United States to
retain the Olympic entry. ``We were going for whatever we could
get.''
</P>

   Back when Olympus had unlimited space for rowers, missing a
global final only hurt for a year. Now that there's an entry quota
tied to world placement, it can hurt for the whole quadrennium.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans, the Olympic and world silver medalists in the men's
eight, blew up in the repechage here and have to win the B final to
avoid having to use the back door to Sydney. And the US males now
have to rearrange their Olympic trials so they can pick their four
before the July qualification regatta.

   With the new world order spawning dozens of Croats and Slovaks
and Latvians and Lithuanians who know port from starboard, you
don't need a popped oarlock to put you out of business. A couple of
sluggish minutes will do it. ``It's disappointing,'' said Koven,
who'd lost training time with a back injury. ``I thought I had a
shot. Tomorrow will be a big challenge.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cardinal John O'Connor, the Roman Catholic archbishop
of New York, was admitted to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
on Wednesday afternoon for tests after he experienced weakness and
nausea, the cardinal's spokesman said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman, Joseph Zwilling, declined to describe the tests.
But he said the choice of Memorial Sloan-Kettering should not be
taken to mean that the cardinal was being treated for cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal, who is 79 and may retire at 80 in January, began
to feel ill on Monday and Tuesday at his home behind St. Patrick's
Cathedral, Zwilling said. The cardinal had been in ``very good
health,'' he said, but he declined to say whether the cardinal had
a history of hypertension, cardiopulmonary illness or a family
history of cancer. ``I will not go down a laundry list,'' Zwilling
said.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal has no public events scheduled this weekend and
typically has an abbreviated schedule in July and August, Dr. Kevin
M. Cahill, the cardinal's physician, who advised the hospital stay,
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor has often been described as Pope John Paul II's most
important American ally. At age 75, on Jan. 15, 1995, the
cardinal's birthday, he submitted his resignation as archbishop of
New York, as required by church law. But it was refused by the
Vatican in March of that year with the phrase, ``until other
provision is made,'' which was widely interpreted to mean until a
suitable successor could be found.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no successor has been announced. Church law prohibits a
cardinal who turns 80 from voting for a new pope. Thus, it has been
widely reported that the cardinal expects to retire in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's really up to the pope now,'' Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal has been hospitalized or confined to his bed
before, Zwilling said. In 1988, the cardinal had pneumonia, related
to severe allergies, and was confined to his residence. In 1991, he
was briefly hospitalized for heat prostration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the cardinal collapsed at the Alfred E. Smith black-tie
dinner and was hospitalized at St. Vincent's Hospital for what was
later diagnosed as a stomach virus. In 1993, he underwent surgery
for an enlarged prostate, and in April 1998 he had minor surgery to
remove a growth from his nose, which his doctors did not describe.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's last illness was in January, when a bout with the
flu worsened as he accompanied the pope to Mexico. The cardinal was
unable to accompany the pope to a later stop in St. Louis, Zwilling
said.

   At Philip Morris, An All-Index Pension
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos. has given up trying to beat the market and
moved to pure index investing for the nearly $8 billion of assets
that it has in defined-benefit pension plans.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows the lead of Exxon Corp., which has shifted
nearly all of its $13.2 billion of defined-benefit pension assets
to index funds, a strategy that has reduced its annual pension
management costs to a few pennies for each $100 invested.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, the tobacco and food giant, declined to comment
or to provide information like the official names of its pension
funds. A company spokesman, Chris Kircher, said it did not dispute
a report in Pensions and Investments Age, a trade publication, on
Aug. 9 that Philip Morris had moved all of its pension assets to
index funds.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Philip Morris pension managers had failed to meet the
company's benchmarks for investment performance, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   The shift to index investing was revealed in a form the company
submitted to the publication for an annual listing of the 1,000
largest pension funds. Counting both its defined-benefit, or
traditional, pension plans and its defined-contribution plans,
Philip Morris has $14.9 billion in employee retirement assets and
ranks 58th among companies and state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Many large pension funds put the bulk of their assets into index
funds, which try to mirror the performance of broad sectors of the
stock market like the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index. The
largest fund, the California Public Employees Retirement System, or
Calpers, has 48 percent of its $133.5 billion of assets in index
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The change at Philip Morris should not affect workers' pension
checks, because the defined-benefit plan bases its benefits on
earnings and years of service; the company assumes the investment
risk.

RAIN SHUTS DOWN FIRST ROUND OF NEC INVITATIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio _ ``A long day without much accomplished'' was the
farewell of Greg Norman and several other golfers when first-round
play of the NEC Invitational was called off late Thursday after a
rain-and-lightning delay of nearly 3 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of the postponement, the golfers' locker room at
the Firestone Country Club was virtually empty. The Patriots'
locker room after the 1986 Super Bowl had been slower to vacate.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it seemed an apt curtain raising on this tournament
with its gaudy field but understated atmosphere _ its clear
foreshadowing of the Ryder Cup next month in Brookline, Mass. _ its
lack of fans, its lack of tension with a small field (41 golfers),
and no fear of a cut after two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   At midday, the sharp-eyed could see that 48-year-old caddie
``Gypsy'' Joe Grillo, was back toting Steve Elkington's bag after
collapsing just before the start of the PGA Championship two weeks
ago, apparently with a heart attack. Elkington was so concerned
with Grillo's condition that he withdrew from the PGA only moments
before his first tee shot. Grillo, as it turned out, had suffered a
severe attack of asthma and not a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling fine,'' said Grillo. ``It's good to be back.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, at 2 in the afternoon, the early question of this
tournament was whether Lee Janzen would complete his round in less
than three hours. Janzen was the odd player of the 41 golfers,
playing without a partner and choosing not to have a non-playing
marker as his companion. Janzen, the first golfer to tee off, was
able to zoom around this fabled Firestone course with only his
caddie in tow.
</P>
<P>
   Some 2 hours 40 minutes into his round, Janzen hit his third
shot short of the monster 625-yard, 16th hole and seemed to have a
chance to edge three hours in his round. But then the first boom of
thunder was heard here on the outskirts of Akron and tournament
officials quickly suspended play. Janzen, it turns out, will need
two days to play his round of fast golf.
</P>
<P>
   For the next three hours, golfers and fans waited for the
thunder to abate, the rain to relent, and the atmosphere to clear.
None of the above occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Which left time and then even more time to compute how the six
matchups between Ryder Cup players were flowing, whether toward the
European side or the American side.
</P>
<P>
   The NEC Invitational is stroke play, of course, and not match
play as in the Ryder Cup, and it is unlikely if many of Thursday's
matchups will be seen in the Ryder Cup. still, there was time to
kill, and the ravenous hunger for Ryder Cup detail must be fed.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson of the US was paired against Jean Van de Velde,
of Europe and of infamy, and the American was 2 under par after
finishing the 10th hole when the horn was sounded to suspend play.
If the cards of the American and Frenchman were matched, Mickelson
would have been 2 up after 10 holes of match play.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods was paired with Jose Maria Olazabal of Spain and
Woods, who birdied the second hole, had started quickly if this
were a Ryder Cup-like matchup. Olazabal bogeyed the third hole,
which Woods parred, leaving the American 2 up after three holes.
</P>
<P>
   American Tom Lehman and the Spaniard Miguel Jimenez were able to
complete nine holes, with Lehman shooting a 2-under 33 and Jimenez
a 2-over 37. Under match-play scoring, Lehman would have been 3 up
on Jimenez making the turn.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth matchup of Ryder Cup players, Jeff Maggert of the
United States against England's Lee Westwood, neither player was
stroking the ball well when play was suspended after the pair had
completed eight holes. Maggert was 1 over par and Westwood a
ghastly 4 over. In Ryder Cup scoring, when the two cards were
matched, Maggert would have been 3 up on Westwood with 10 holes to
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans' best matchup was between El Nino, Spain's Sergio
Garcia, and David Duval. Garcia was 1 under par after seven holes
and Duval 1 over. In Ryder Cup scoring, Garcia would have been 2 up
with 11 holes to go.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the last pairing of Ryder Cup players, neither
Scotland's Paul Lawrie nor the US's Payne Stewart was able to
complete a hole before play was called.
</P>
<P>
   As for the scoring being used here, Mickelson, Elkington, and
John Huston were all tied at 2 under, Huston having completed 14
holes, Elkington 11, and Mickelson 10.
</P>
<P>
   The players meanwhile retreated to the locker room during the
rain delay ``just sitting and listening to stories and stuff,''
according to Huston. And the best story told by a golfer? ``I
really can't repeat it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first round will resume this morning at 7:30 with Janzen
needing to complete three holes, 36 other golfers at various spots
on the course, and four golfers yet to tee off. In early afternoon,
the golfers will attempt to complete the second round by playing in
threesomes and teeing off from both the first and 10th tees. Mike
Shea, senior director of rules for the PGA, said he expected
players will have ``to play the ball down,'' and not clean any mud
marks despite the inch-and-a-half of rain the last two days.

   (NYT16) NEW YORK -- Aug. 26, 1999 -- NY-CARDINAL-HOSP, 08-26 --
Cardinal John J. O'Connor during an interview in his residence in
1996. O'Connor was hospitalized Wednesday at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and was expected to remain there
until Friday. A spokesperson for the hospital declined to discuss
specifics about his condition. O'Connor will turn 80 in January and
reportedly has told priests that he plans to retire by then. Church

YELTSIN AIDE DENIES REPORT OF SECRET CASH IN SWISS BANK
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A top Kremlin official Thursday denied corruption
charges made in an Italian newspaper against members of President
Boris Yeltsin's family and inner circle. The official dismissed the
latest scandal as a fabrication ordered by Yeltsin's political
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, Corriere della Sera, said on Wednesday that $1
million in ``pocket money'' for the Yeltsin entourage had been
funneled in 1994 through a Swiss bank account held by Pavel
Borodin, the powerful head of the Russian president's property
management office. The newspaper quoted unidentified sources close
to a Swiss investigation into bank accounts allegedly held by
high-ranking Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin, interviewed Thursday evening on a Radio Liberty program
to be aired in Russia on Sunday, said he had no accounts in Swiss
banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know who orders this, and how much it costs, but it is not
interesting to me,'' Borodin said. ``I never wage war with anybody,
let alone with these scoundrels.''
</P>
<P>
   Borodin did not name the Russian political figures behind the
allegations, which have followed months of public inquiry into his
relationship with Mabetex, a Swiss construction company that has
had several large contracts to work on government buildings in
Moscow, including the president's $30 million offices and residence
inside the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a personal attack on Switzerland's former prosecutor
general, Carla del Ponte, who responded last spring to requests
from Russia's chief prosecutor, Yuri Skuratov (who was subsequently
fired by Yeltsin), for help in investigating money held by Russian
officials in Swiss bank accounts. Mrs. del Ponte recently left her
job to become chief justice of the International War Crimes
Tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, she has had too many failures recently,'' said
Borodin, noting, among others, Mrs. del Ponte's investigation of
Silvio Berlusconi, the former Italian prime minister. ``These are
cases on which it is possible to make a career, which is exactly
what Carla del Ponte did. Now she's at the U.N., and now she's
going to accuse Milosevic,'' he said, referring to the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Although Borodin denied having a bank account of his own in
Switzerland, he said Thursday that he and other Kremlin officials
had made several trips to Switzerland and Italy that were paid for
by Mabetex. He said that when the Mabatex president, Behgjet
Pacolli, came to Moscow, his expenses were picked up by the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mabetex won at least six contracts from the Kremlin's
property management agency for work on various government
buildings, the most famous was its work on a $30 million renovation
of the old Senate building inside the Kremlin, which now houses an
office and residence for Yeltsin, his staff and his family.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources close to the construction job, the work
cost $9,000 a square meter. Borodin justified the cost Thursday,
noting that the work involved high-quality renovation of a historic
building and included complex telecommunications systems.
</P>
<P>
   Borodin, who has worked at the Kremlin since 1993, heads a
politically powerful agency that oversees offices, apartments,
country houses and cars that are part of regular compensation
packages for officials throughout the government, including the
parliament and the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   An article on Borodin's business dealings in a June issue of the
investigative newspaper Versiya asserted that he had a Swiss bank
account in which deposits from $100,000 to $1 million were made
between 1995 and 1998. The newspaper also listed a $1 million
transfer in 1995 from Borodin's account to a bank account in
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   The article in Wednesday's Corriere della Sera charged that $1
million had been earmarked as ``pocket money'' for the Yeltsins on
a 1994 trip to Hungary. The newspaper also said that the Yeltsin
family, including two daughters, Tatyana and Yelena, had used
credit cards given to them by Pacolli.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Thursday on the telephone by a Moscow television
reporter, Pacolli dismissed the Corriere della Sera's report as
``invention.'' But in an interview earlier this year, Pacolli said
he had set up a bank account to guarantee a credit card used by
Borodin on his trips to inspect materials for the Kremlin
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   The latest flurry of charges in Russia are part of the political
``kompromat,'' or compromising material, which floods the Russian
news media each time elections approach. Parliamentary elections
are scheduled for December, and presidential elections for July
2000.

AFTER NYC DENIES PERMIT, ORGANIZERS OF BLACK POWER MARCH VOW TO
PROCEED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced Thursday that the
city has denied a permit for a controversial youth rally in Harlem,
but the event's organizers angrily vowed to proceed with or without
the city's permission.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the permit was denied because the organizers, who
he has called ``reprehensible'' for their anti-white and
anti-Semitic comments, failed to submit a proper application.
``They had an opportunity to properly apply,'' he said. ``They
haven't. So as far as we're concerned, it's over.'' The mayor did
not specify how the group's application was improper.
</P>
<P>
   Khallid Abdul Muhammad, the primary organizer of the event,
called the Million Youth March, said he will first seek to overturn
the city's decision in court. But if that course fails, he added,
the rally, scheduled for Saturday, Sept. 4, would proceed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in the philosophy and the ideology of peace if
possible, but violence when necessary,'' Muhammad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's march, which followed a court order permitting the
rally, ended in violence and dozens of injuries as hundreds of
police officers and rally participants clashed.
</P>
<P>
   While saying Thursday that the objective of the rally was to
promote education and economic empowerment for black youths _ ``We
are not going for a war in the streets,'' he said _ he also
insisted on his ``God-given'' right to lead a rally of young blacks
in the streets of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be there,'' he said, emphasizing each word. ``For the
sake of my people, for the sake of our youth, I will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as firmly, Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard Safir
promised that the city would act to prevent the rally from being
held without the required city permits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a group that talks about hurting people and hate,''
Safir said. ``There is no permit. If they attempt to march, they
won't be allowed to, and that will be the end of it.'' He did not
elaborate on what methods the Police Department would use.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's events _ announcement of the permit denial, the
promised legal challenge, the charged words of confrontation _
mirrored the events leading up to last year's Million Youth March.
Once again, Giuliani dismissed the march organizers as marginal
hatemongers who are playing to the news media. Once again, Muhammad
accused the mayor of oppressing black people and pandering to Jews
who resent Muhammad's history of anti-Semitic remarks _ epithets so
extreme that he was suspended in 1994 from his position as
spokesman for the Nation of Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems like deja vu,'' Muhammad said in an interview outside
Sistas' Place, a jazz cafe in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of
Brooklyn that is serving as the headquarters for the rally.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, several passing cars honked, the drivers sticking
out raised fists or calling words of support to Muhammad, who was
dressed in combat boots and black fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   ``These devils won't write that,'' he told one woman about these
signal of support, gesturing to three reporters.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In his announcement Thursday, Giuliani said the permit was
denied because Muhammad's group, the New Black Panther Party, had
refused to ``comply with the parameters'' of a federal appeals
court ruling last year that gave the organization permission to
demonstrate then for four hours on six blocks along a section of
Lenox Avenue known as Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   There was confusion over the timing of the denial of the permit.
Asked when the decision was made, Giuliani said Thursday that it
was made ``about three or four days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the day before, when asked by reporters whether the march
should be allowed, Giuliani declined to answer, and he made no
mention of the permit having been denied. Nor did City Corporation
Counsel Michael Hess mention that there had been a decision when he
spoke late Wednesday afternoon with Roger Wareham, an attorney for
the march.
</P>
<P>
   According to Wareham, Hess said he wanted to work out an
agreement and avoid the necessity of going to court. In an
interview, Hess said the final decision was made Thursday, when the
mayor announced that the permit had been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad said march organizers have agreed all along to abide by
the terms of that ruling. In their most recent letter to the city,
dated Monday, another lawyer for the march organizers, Jomo Thomas,
said they ``fully intend to function within the spirit'' of that
court decision. But in the same letter, Thomas requested additional
city permits for a 17-block parade to the rally site at 118th
Street and Malcolm X Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conveners are only demanding equal treatment before the
law,'' Thomas wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad said it was Giuliani and Safir who were defying the
ruling and ``now trying to rewrite the white Constitution of
America.'' He said the two were ``rattling the saber'' to confuse
and frighten those who might be inclined to attend the rally.
``They are wickedly wise,'' he said. ``They want to minimize this
new black power movement.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani on Thursday noted that Muhammad has lost the
backing of Harlem's leading politicians, who last year supported
the march even as they condemned Muhammad for his comments about
Jews and whites. On Wednesday, for example, the most powerful
political figure in Harlem, Rep. Charles Rangel, called upon blacks
to boycott the march.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I have to commend all of the political leaders in the
community for supporting the city's position,'' Giuliani said. ``I
think that it shows a great deal of independence and courage to do
that, and a willingness to take a look again at a set of facts in
which they had a different position last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, perhaps slightly uncomfortable at being the recipient of
Giuliani's praise, declined Thursday to support Giuliani's decision
to deny a permit for the march. ``The city has done this before and
the courts clearly overruled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Rangel's call for a boycott _ and the likelihood that a
court will now decide the question of whether to grant a rally
permit _ largely diffused any potential political fallout for
Giuliani, who is considering running for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's likely opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, announced
Thursday that she, too, opposed the march. But through a spokesman,
Mrs. Clinton declined to offer an opinion on whether the organizers
should be denied a permit.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nothing succeeds like excess. The Braves walk back
into the Mark McGwire Follies again tonight, where Big Mac and
Slammin' Sammy blot out the field, the crowd and the score itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Year of the Homer _ 1998 _ never ended; it just grew eight
more months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice,'' Sammy Sosa said. ``Mark and myself. We put our
ability and our potential out there, and the two guys take off. I
love it, and it's good for baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Or so they say. The Braves find McGwire at his 70-homer pace of
last season while Sosa, playing this weekend in Los Angeles, is
five ahead of his 66-homer pace. Home-run frequency across the
majors is up from 2.08 per game last season to 2.29. A record nine
teams hit 200 or more home runs a year ago. Currently, 10 are
projected to reach 200 _ Seattle already has 197 _ with another
three clubs within striking range.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sosa, McGwire and Ken Griffey are projected to reach 50
homers, down from four players last season, with Greg Vaughn
muzzled. But the number of players to reach 40 is expected to grow.
One to three players more than the record 13 of 1998 could hit 40
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You still have certain pitchers that you don't hit too many
home runs off, because they know how to pitch,'' said Atlanta's
Brian Jordan, a McGwire teammate last season. ``But guys are
getting stronger and smarter at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, Mike Lieberthal has reached 27 homers, most for
any Philly catcher, including Darren Daulton, Andy Seminick, Stan
Lopata and Bob Boone, with five weeks left on the schedule. In
Seattle, Alex Rodriguez has reached 33, despite missing the first
five weeks because of knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, Jay Bell's 31 homers have drawn Cooperstown's
attention. Of the 14 second baseman in the Hall of Fame, only one _
Rogers Hornsby _ ever hit more than 30. In St. Louis, McGwire
reached 500 homers in 314 fewer at-bats than Babe Ruth, more than a
half-season's worth of swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played in an era where there were a lot of great home-run
hitters, and I hit quite a few myself,'' career leader Hank Aaron
said. ``But there's no one like McGwire.''
</P>
<P>
   In some quarters, however, the question has changed, from ``How
do they do it?'' to ``When does it end?'' The homer, once
baseball's grandest moment, has been devalued, at least, perhaps to
the point that traditional tactics _ and the game _ have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be if you're five runs up, you kind of shut your
game down,'' said Braves first base coach Glenn Hubbard said.
``With the way the game's changed, you can drop five runs like
that. You almost can't stop running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think baseball needs for the pendulum to swing back toward
the other direction,'' pitching great Nolan Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The per-game homer rate more than doubled in just five years,
from 1.03 in 1994 to 2.29 this season. During the entire decade of
the 1940s, only four players reached 40, less than a third of last
year's 13. Even in the free-swinging '70s, there were just 20
40-homer seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting silly,'' Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone said.
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 through '98, 22 clubs reached the 200-homer level. In
the 35 seasons from 1960 through '94, just 19 teams hit 200 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring, which some teams' management equates to attendance,
mocks the past. The average game in 1968 saw a combined 6.84 runs.
The 1999 average is up to 10.23 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting, and the fans love it,'' Jordan said. ``And
that's who we're playing for _ the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Changing trends and strategies have propelled baseball through
the century, and even the men who played the game see it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is designed today to please the fans, and if they
like those high-scoring games, they have them,'' Bob Gibson said.
``But as a pitcher, I don't like these big ball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Newly installed Hall of Famer George Brett has heard the debate
about smaller parks and bigger players and expansion-era pitching
and tightly wound baseballs. If baseball is truly considering
raising the mound back to 15 inches, he wants the topic aired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember being at the Hall of Fame talking to Tom Seaver and
Bob Gibson and some other pitchers: Yes, it is time to move the
mound back up,'' Brett said. ``But if you talk to hitters, they're
saying the mound is fine where it is. I personally like going to
games that are 9-6.''
</P>
<P>
   Like there's a choice. McGwire has gone back into denial, as he
did in 1998, that a record is worth considering until the late
stages. This month lacks the drama of last year's Roger Maris
chase, which is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking back to that ordeal, McGwire said, ``I was in awe of
myself, and I'm still in awe thinking about it. But, you know,
anything is possible.''

 &HT;    Forrest awaits shot at big time
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The title shot might be nearing, although somewhat
belatedly for a member of the Class of '92.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Vernon Forrest sat on a return flight from
Barcelona clutching not an Olympic medal but the memory of being
sprawled on the bathroom floor with a stomach virus on the eve of
his fight.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine victories as a professional and he is still waiting
for glory.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest, a nationally ranked welterweight schooled in Augusta
and now residing in Atlanta, is expected to keep his pro record
flawless tonight when he meets Santiago Samaniego in Augusta's Bell
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The fight itself represents the contradiction in Forrest's
career. The 28-year-old welterweight is talented and respected
enough that he is ranked by all three major sanctioning bodies, as
high as No. 2 by the IBF, and ESPN2 is broadcasting the relatively
meaningless fight. But he is fighting in a smallish venue in his
hometown instead of in a casino town or New York.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest owns a welterweight title, of the lesser North American
Boxing Federation. What he craves is a shot at one of the three
major belts, currently owned by Oscar De La Hoya (WBC), Felix
Trinidad (IBF) and James Page (WBA). But Forrest has been viewed as
too dangerous to fight for what the potential opponents perceive as
a worthy financial return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been hard to leave it in the hands of someone else,''
Forrest said. ``As you get older, you start to understand the
business of boxing more. I understand it, but I don't accept it.
It's almost like being in the minor leagues, waiting to get called
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The call-up could be forthcoming. De La Hoya and Trinidad fight
Sept. 18 in Las Vegas. Shelly Finkel, Forrest's co-manager, expects
that one or both fighters will move up to the 154-pound division
after that bout, leaving at least one title vacant Former Olympic
coach Al Mitchell, who coached Forrest for four years in Northern
Michigan's boxing program and remains close to him, said, ``Vernon
is right there with De La Hoya and Trinidad. He's ready to pop.
He's like a champagne bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Moraetes, who saw Forrest when he first climbed into a ring
at the age of 9 at Moraetes' Augusta Boxing Club, said, ``He could
beat anybody out there now. But he doesn't have a big name outside
of boxing. The guy pumping gas doesn't know who he is, so the money
isn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest was the sixth of eight children born to Willie and
Mildred Forrest, but they divorced when he was young.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a rough upbringing,'' said Alphonso Forrest, one of
Vernon's older brothers. ``We were in the projects for a while. But
we were close-knit. Dad worked and he helped us out financially,
but it was hard on Mama. She had to work a lot of jobs. But we're
all grown now, nobody's in jail, and nobody's dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing Vernon will tell you,'' his brother said. ``He made
it out of the ghetto and he has no intention of going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Once he started boxing, the wins came easily. As an amateur,
Forrest went 225-16. The last loss was an upset decision to Great
Britain's Peter Richardson in the first round of the 1992 Olympics.
Forrest entered the Games as a medal favorite. But a bad hamburger
was believed to have caused the stomach virus the eve of the fight.
The next day, the weakened Forrest didn't think he could fight hard
for three rounds so he cruised in the first, then attempted to
rally. But Richardson held on, aided by some suspect scoring that
had him winning round 3 despite taking two standing-eight counts.
After the bout, Forrest declared, ``I'm fed up with the amateurs.''
He turned pro.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the usual management problems along the way, last
year Forrest suffered the devastating loss of his trainer, Malik
Muhammad, who was hit by a car and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Forrest is estranged from Moraetes. The two often feuded,
with Forrest sometimes leaving the gym and not returning for two or
three months.
</P>
<P>
   His return to Augusta does have a positive side. He wants to be
an inspiration to area youths. ``I'm not a celebrity like Michael
Jordan. I'm Vernon Forrest. I punched the same bags they did.''
</P>
<P>
   He has gone places. Just not as many as he had hoped.

 &HT;    Marlin set to drive University of Tennessee Chevy
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ TEAM RACING
</P>
<P>
   The college football season kicks off Saturday, and Sterling
Marlin will showcase his favorite team during tonight's Food City
250. Marlin, who lives in Columbia, Tenn., will drive the
University of Tennessee No. 14 Chevy. ``I've been a fan of
University of Tennessee football my entire life,'' Marlin said.
Meanwhile, Brandon Sperling will steer the No. 55 Florida Gators
Pontiac for Davis &AMP; Weight Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   NIGHT MOVES?
</P>
<P>
   Don't put your money on the car of Jeff Gordon (below) for
Saturday night's race. Gordon has won at Bristol each of the past
four years, but all were in the day races. He has never won at the
half-mile oval after the sun goes down. ``We'd really like to win
the night race,'' said Gordon, who leads in Winston Cup victories
with four.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPING CREW
</P>
<P>
   Michael Waltrip's crew has canceled hotel reservations this
weekend and will be camping on one of the hills around the track.
Crew chief Jimmy Elledge has rented a camper, and other crew
members are bringing tents. ``I just hope they get enough sleep,
don't turn the motor home over and don't light too big of a
bonfire,'' said Waltrip, who kept his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS UP
</P>
<P>
   To Tony Stewart, who rallied from starting 37th to finish third
in the Pepsi 400. It was the best performance of the talented
rookie's Cup career. Stewart also acted like a veteran after the
race in quickly accepting blame for the wreck that caused Jeff
Burton to spin out.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To the Michigan Department of Transportation, which decided that
Saturday was the ideal time to do construction work on the I-94
section from Detroit to Ann Arbor, the only westbound route for
fans attending the Busch race the same day at Michigan Speedway. A
routine 30-minute drive was extended by three hours.
</P>
<P>
   CAUTION: FEWER FLAGS
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup drivers are seeing fewer caution flags this year.
The 22 races have had 120 cautions for 694 laps. The first 22 races
in '98 produced 133 cautions for 784 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cars have enough downforce that they're real stable under
the current rules,'' said Robin Pemberton, crew chief for Rusty
Wallace. ``The equipment is better, most of the drivers are driving
smarter, and the race tracks are more conducive to allowing for
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Marcis, driver for the No. 71 Chevy, offered a different
explanation:
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR keeps reminding us in the drivers' meetings to use our
heads,'' Marcis said. ``After all, if a race is half over and you
take a cheap shot at somebody or get underneath someone's car when
you don't belong there, it can cause an accident. What is that
worth? Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HE SAID
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning my 50th career race this Saturday night at Bristol
would be extra special and something so meaningful for the rest of
my career. The race (Saturday night) is the hottest ticket in
NASCAR.''
</P>
<P>

Speedway

 &HT;    No timetable for Irvan
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan will be away from the track for the second weekend
in a row. Irvan, the regular driver of the No. 36 Pontiac, missed
the Pepsi 400 last weekend after suffering a bruised lung and mild
head injury during a crash in Busch practice. He was released
Monday after three days in an Ann Arbor, Mich., hospital, and he
will continue recuperating through the weekend at his home in
Concord, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, who is in good condition, has set no timetable on a
return. Jerry Nadeau will drive for MB2 Motorsports on an interim
basis, beginning with Saturday night's Goody's 500. Nadeau was
released from the No. 9 Ford earlier this week by Melling Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all hoping for a speedy recovery for Ernie, but I'm glad
to be able to help out,'' said Nadeau, who will drive for Hendrick
Motorsports next season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nadeau's former car will be in a race Saturday night
with Steve Grissom driving. Grissom also is participating in
tonight's Busch race, the Food City 250.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've wanted, a chance to get back behind the
wheel for a Winston Cup race,'' Grissom said. ``Running both races
this weekend is going to make a dream weekend for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Grissom, 36, is a candidate to be a full-time Cup driver next
season for several teams. He has extensive knowledge of motorsports
and has been asked to help in race preparations and testing the
past few months by drivers Kyle Petty and Terry Labonte and car
owners Travis Carter and Felix Sabates.... Mark Martin won a lot of
race fans when he took the checkered flag at the Goody's 500 last
year. Not only did Martin snap Jeff Gordon's four-race winning
streak, he did it while still grieving over the loss of his father,
Julian, who was killed in the crash of a private airplane two weeks
earlier....
</P>
<P>
   Eel River Racing has dropped Derrike Cope from the No. 30
Pontiac and hopes to name a new driver in time for Saturday's race.

   NFL stars help buy Excel
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mike Tomczak and former
Washington Redskins tackle Jim Lachey are part of a six-member
group that has bought the inactive Excel Motorsports team of the
Busch Series. The purchasing group, known as Alumni Motorsports,
plans to field a full-time team for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Family-owned Excel began this year with cars driven by brothers
Mark and Jeff Krogh. The operation was discontinued after Jeff, 27,
was injured critically in a practice crash in July. Krogh is
undergoing successful rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this is bittersweet,'' said Brent Bushu of Alumni
Motorsports. ``It's such a great opportunity, but all of our
prayers are still with the Krogh family. That's the big issue here
_ Jeff's health more than anything. It's a big move for us, and we
don't want people to think we're taking advantage of anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really weren't even looking to buy a team,'' Bushu said.
``It was never in our plans and just kind of fell into place.''

 &HT;    At the end of the streak
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ricky Rudd, one of the few remaining single-car team
owners in Winston Cup, faces tremendous pressure the remainder of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 races remaining, Rudd's record streak of winning at
least one race each of the past 16 years is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who drives the No. 10 Ford, also is close to his
self-imposed deadline of mid-September for deciding what to do with
his race team. Unless he lands a new primary sponsor to replace
Tide for next season, Rudd is prepared to sell his race team and
drive for another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is there, for sure,'' said Rudd, who participates
in first-round qualifying today for the Goody's 500 on Saturday
night at Bristol Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot distractions going on, like, what are we going
to be doing next year?'' he said. ``But in the meantime, we get to
the track focused 100 percent, trying to go out and win some
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning races has been Rudd's specialty the past two decades.
Beginning with the 1983 season, Rudd has parked his car in victory
lane each year.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year string is the longest current winning steak and
unmatched in the Cup's ``modern era.'' Richard Petty won at least
once for 18 years until the 1977 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to me, if for no other reason than it's a
record,'' said Rudd, who has 20 career victories. ``I think a lot
of people, when they think of Ricky Rudd, they think of that
winning streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, 42, has not come close to winning this season. He had a
season-best finish of ninth at the Brickyard earlier this month. In
the next two races, Rudd's chances for top-10 finishes fell apart
in the final laps.
</P>
<P>
   With five laps left in the Frontier at The Glen, Rudd was going
to finish no worse than ninth when a rock got caught in the car's
transmission. He was running 10th at Michigan Speedway last week
but got caught in a freak wreck with two lapped cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Rudd
said. ``I call those things bad luck. If you throw those things
out, we should really be talking about (three top-10 finishes in a
row), which is a big improvement to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd appears to be peaking, despite mounting concerns within the
race team. If Rudd fails to attract a new sponsor within the next
three weeks, Rudd Performance Motorsports will go up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard on the guys in the shop,'' Rudd said. ``There's a
lot of turmoil. They're kind of new to it, and it's kind of got
them spooked a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 priority is to keep the No. 10 team, and Rudd
confirmed this week that he is having ``serious talks'' with two
sponsors. Without a deal, however, Rudd will move on.
</P>
<P>
   A popular scenario has Rudd driving the No. 28 car of Robert
Yates Racing; Kenny Irwin is leaving it after this season. Other
drivers reportedly being considered are Jimmy Spencer, Wally
Dallenbach, Derrike Cope and Ted Musgrave.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do go drive for somebody, I'd definitely put (the Robert
Yates car) as No. 1,'' Rudd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know for sure,'' Yates said, ``is it's going to somebody
with experience.''

 &HT;    Demon Deacons in running for respect
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ Wake Forest entered last season ranked No.
22 by Sports Illustrated.
</P>
<P>
   The Deacons finished 3-8, and coach Jim Caldwell's job was
rumored to be in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell still has a job, but things continue to look dismal for
the Demon Deacons.
</P>
<P>
   Seven starters are gone, including quarterback Brian Kuklick,
Wake Forest's career passing leader, and flanker Desmond Clark, the
ACC's career receptions leader.
</P>
<P>
   One positive for the Demon Deacons is freshman C.J. Leak, ranked
as one of the top five prep quarterbacks in the country. Leak
shocked the football world by bypassing offers from Notre Dame and
Penn State to sign with Wake Forest. His arrival created a
quarterback controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Ben Sankey is listed as the starter, but Caldwell said
Leak would play this season and maybe start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be being honest if I told you it isn't awkward,''
Sankey said. ``I fully expect to be the starter. If somebody wants
to compete with me, the door's wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say that C.J. is so far ahead of the average freshman
who comes in here,'' Caldwell said. ``He came to 14 of our 15
spring practices, and he's enrolled in summer school and has been
working out with some of the guys during the summer. He understands
a lot about our offense. Most freshmen have trouble getting out of
the huddle.'' During Caldwell's six-year tenure, Wake has won more
than three games once, when it was 5-6 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he will call the offensive plays for the first time.
Last year's play-caller, Hank Small, no longer is there.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell also said he is going to get away from the passing game
the Deacons have featured over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to emphasize running the football more,'' he said.
``And we will, because I'm going to be the primary play-caller on
game day.''
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell will not say whether the school is pressuring him to
win more. When asked whetheranyone has spoken to him about winning
more, he said, ``My wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Sankey said he is not worried over predictions about Wake
Forest's season. ``I'm not going to worry about what's written in
the paper,'' he said. ``Games aren't won in the paper, they're won
on the field.''

MOTHER OF BESSETTE SISTERS FILES FOR CONTROL OF THEIR ESTATES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Fla.)   By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The mother of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren
Bessette filed court papers in Manhattan Thursday seeking to become
the administrator of her daughters' estates. The mother, Anne M.
Freeman, also asked to be given the right to file personal-injury
and wrongful-death lawsuits in the future against ``unknown''
people or parties.
</P>
<P>
   The two women were passengers on the private plane piloted by
John F. Kennedy Jr. that plunged into the ocean off Martha's
Vineyard on July 16, killing all three.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said the parties that might be named in a lawsuit
included the company that manufactured the plane, the Federal
Aviation Administration and the estate of Kennedy. Court papers or
a will for Kennedy have not yet been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine P. Ralli, the lawyer for Ms. Freeman, of Old
Greenwich, Conn., declined to say whether his client intended to
file such lawsuits or whom they might be directed at. ``We have no
comment other than to confirm that we represent Anne Freeman,''
Ralli said.
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Harris, a Manhattan lawyer who regularly handles estates
and was chief law assistant in Surrogate's Court, said the filing
was routine. The papers said that neither Bessette sister had a
will, and valued each of their estates at less than $500,000. It is
routine in such cases, Ms. Harris said, for the next of kin to file
to administer their assets.
</P>
<P>
   The court requested that the girl's father, William Bessette of
White Plains, consent to Ms. Freeman's becoming the administrator
of their estates or present his objections in a hearing before the
Surrogate Court judge, Renee R. Roth, on Sept. 10. The couple are
divorced.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris and court officials said it was normal for a family
to retain the right to file wrongful-death lawsuits. ``It is normal
in accidental death,'' she said. ``I think they have to keep their
options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring a finding that mechanical problems caused the crash,
experts in liability law said the Bessettes could file a lawsuit on
behalf of Lauren Bessette against Kennedy's insurance carrier or
estate accusing him of negligence in the operation of the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Lee Schwab, a Manhattan lawyer who has defended numerous
companies in liability suits, said a suit filed on behalf of
Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, at least as far as insurance is
concerned, would be more difficult. Insurance generally does not
cover one spouse against the acts of another, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her sister could have a cause of action for negligent
operation of the aircraft,'' Schwab said. ``Given the current state
of facts, it certainly would seem that a case can be made out for
negligence in the operation of the aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the National Transportation Safety Board finds that
problems with the plane's equipment caused the crash, the Kennedy
and Bessette families could sue its manufacturer. If maintenance
was the problem, lawsuits could also be filed against whoever
maintained Kennedy's plane.
</P>
<P>
   Another lawsuit could be filed against the Florida flight school
that instructed Kennedy. The Federal Aviation Administration could
also be sued for not issuing regulations that more strictly
hindered the activity of pilots not yet certified to fly by
instruments only, as was the case with Kennedy. But Schwab said
those cases had little chance of prevailing in court.

 &HT;    Christian finally healthy
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Anybody who knows Bob Christian would have known there
was a problem when he got agitated last winter, and let members of
the Falcons training staff know it.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't very Christian-like.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' fullback, who is devoutly Christian in every way,
may be the most patient player on the team.
</P>
<P>
   But after his season-ending left knee injury Dec. 13 at New
Orleans, things grew tense.
</P>
<P>
   The modern treatment for his injury includes a great deal of
pre-surgical rehabilitation, chiefly to maintain flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Christian's knee wasn't flexing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd crank on it, and crank on it, and maybe after an hour I
could bend it 90 degrees,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Christian endured season-ending injuries in 1994 with the Bears,
and '96 with the Panthers, so maybe his concern shouldn't have come
as a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt something was wrong,'' he said. ``And I felt like a
failure because usually when someone puts an expectation out there
for me, I meet it or surpass it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's close now to being back to 100 percent. Tonight, he'll make
his third straight preseason start, at Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   That's very good.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-11, 232-pounder may be the most underrated player at
his position in the NFL. Jamal Anderson loves running behind him.
Chris Chandler loves the way he blocks in pass protection, or
catches the ball when he turns into a receiver.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches loves him, period.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is an integral part of everything we do,'' said Jack
Burns, who is in charge of play-calling. Locating the defender he
needs to block with the proper leverage, proper hat (helmet)
placement, he's phenomenal at it. He's also a treat to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   At Northwestern, Christian's 2,643 career rushing yards were
tops in school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a halfback, but that helped me,'' he said. ``I try to
... read it like the ball carrier, like Jamal. If the defensive
linemen are slanting right, and a hole opens left, I know Jamal is
going left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no use in me running into a pile or trying to get
around, so I'll cut through the hole, keeping an eye on my
(assigned) guy. If he shows up first, I'll hit him. If something
else shows, I got to hit that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best I've ever seen at not just stalemating a
(defender),'' coach Dan Reeves said, ``but moving him.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian was overjoyed when he came out of surgery the week
after the NFC Championship Game.
</P>
<P>
   His torn medial collateral ligament had started scarring
together, and needed no surgical attention.
</P>
<P>
   And his ACL had not torn in half, as thought, but had torn free
from bone on one end. Plus, the ACL had begun scarring to the
posterior cruciate ligament, lending stability to the knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (team orthopedist Andrew Bishop) had to reconstruct, there
would have been more trauma, and rehab, and possibly my range of
motion would have been (permanently affected),'' Christian said.
``So he had to make a quick decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, all he did was clean up a cartilage tear, break up
(scar tissue) that was keeping my knee from bending ... and poke
holes in the bone to cause bleeding so the ACL would take hold
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian doesn't even wear a brace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it was a miracle they didn't have to reconstruct,''
he said. ``Before surgery, I was praying about it, and I felt I had
to pray for Dr. Bishop, too, having no idea he was going to see
something he'd never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the decision he made is why I'm doing so well.

 &HT;    Fox-Turner sports feud is variation of court TV
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In preparing for their first season in the NHL, very
little has gone wrong for the Atlanta Thrashers.
</P>
<P>
   But the team is just a court ruling away from the possibility of
having a bare-bones television package showing only one-fourth of
its games.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, Fox Sports Net South filed a lawsuit against Time
Warner Inc. and Turner Broadcasting, seeking to prevent Turner
South from starting in October with Hawks, Thrashers and Braves
games. The suit claims that Turner South would be violating a
non-compete agreement included in Fox/Liberty Networks' $65 million
purchase of Turner's interests in Fox SportSouth in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Turner South has countered that the suit is without merit. A
hearing is scheduled for today in Fulton County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 or more games proposed for the new network, the Braves
and Hawks would not be hurt dramatically by the court's decision.
But the Thrashers, with as many as 46 games slated for Turner
South, could be facing a marketing nightmare in their inaugural
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If only 20 or 30 games were on television, that would not be a
good entry-level year,'' said Allen Ginsberg, executive vice
president of Atlanta-based BBDO South advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers have a deal with WUPA/Channel 69 to televise 15 to
20 games this year, and the Paramount affiliate could find room for
more. But if the team had no other option, the Thrashers would end
up with television exposure on substantially less than half their
games.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for the Thrashers would not comment on the suit or the
possibility of a contingency plan if the case goes against them.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Thrashers could find themselves in the awkward
position of having to look to Turner's current adversary as a
future partner. Fox Sports Net South currently has deals with the
Braves and Hawks, however.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turner South is being billed as a regional
entertainment network, with Braves, Hawks and Thrashers games
accounting for only about 3 percent of the total progamming, Fox
Sports Net South still considers it a regional sports network.
</P>
<P>
   In the complaint, Fox Sports Net South argued, ``There can be no
question that the professional sports programming it proposes to
telecast over its new cable network will provide the overwhelming
bulk of the advertising income for Turner South, the principal
impetus for cable operator affiliation with Turner South, and the
primary reason for cable subscribers to view Turner South.''
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also alleges that Turner is secretly making plans
to ``form its own regional cable network to broadcast Braves, Hawks
and Thrashers games in direct competition'' with Fox Sport Net
South. It claims Turner rebuffed attempts by Fox Sports Net South
last fall to discuss televising the Thrashers and additional Braves
and Hawks games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand what Fox is trying to do,'' Ginsberg said.
... ``But without sports, Turner South is just another movie
channel.''

 &HT;    Another dash of history
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Atlanta last saw The Man in the Golden Shoes in
flight, Michael Johnson had just crossed the finish line. Spying a
clock that read ``19.32,'' he threw wide his arms and let out an
Olympic roar.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Johnson signed off as the signature athlete of the 1996
Centennial Olympics, as he shattered the world record in the men's
200 meters to complete a historic 200-400 double.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, on a sultry summer evening in Seville, Spain,
Johnson added an astounding P.S. to his signature, breaking the
longest-standing mark in men's track with a 43.18 in the 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted this record,'' he said after the race.
``This completes the circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who won his fourth World Championship 400 in a row,
obliterated Butch Reynolds' 11-year-old world record by 0.11
seconds before a near-capacity crowd in Seville's Estadio Olympico.
Reynolds, who lives and trains in Atlanta, ran 43.29 on Aug. 17,
1988. ``That time is unbelievable,'' gushed Britain's Jamie Baulch,
who finished eighth in the 400. ``That's on a par with 19.32.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 31, has dominated the 400 for a decade, including a
1989-97 undefeated streak. But the Texan was beset by hip and
pelvic injuries the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, though, he again thrust his arms in triumph before
sprawling on his back and then taking a victory lap with American
flag in hand and a fan's hand-lettered sign that read, ``Record _
43.18, Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do better, you know,'' said Johnson, who beat Brazilian
silver-medalist Sanderlei Parrela (44.29) by more than a second.
``But it's a world record. I broke the world record in the 200 and
then shattered it. I think I can do the same thing in the 400. With
the kind of shape I'm in, I know I can run 42 seconds.''

 &HT;    UGA goal: Continue success
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Give them a place to play and they will come. Not
to sit on the bench and watch others get accolades, but to play for
something with a deeper impact on themselves and their sport.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sales pitch University of Georgia soccer coach Bill
Barker used to lure Kristy Bongiovanni from the East Coast,
Stefanie Bertcher from suburban Dallas and Nicole Williams from the
Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   They were recruited by some of the more established programs but
did not want to wait for their opportunity to play. So, like dozens
of other top high school players, they took advantage of an
explosion of programs created because of gender equity
considerations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't really know what to expect,'' said Bertcher, a
defender. ``Like a lot of players, I felt that I could contribute
right away. What you're seeing now is that it's not just the same
three teams being favored every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not quite. The old standbys _ 15-time NCAA champion North
Carolina, Santa Clara, Notre Dame and Portland _ once again are the
favorites this season. But the sport has been transformed rapidly
by some of the new kids on the block. After the success of the
victorious U.S. team in the Women's World Cup this summer, college
soccer stands to gain from the exposure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me chills to see how people were following my sport,''
said Williams, a two-year starting goalkeeper from Kent, Wash. ``I
mean, you had hicks and hillbillies talking about it on the radio
around here. It was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia unexpectedly reached the Sweet 16 last fall with a
13-6-2 record. Florida, a program started in 1995 along with
Georgia's as part of the SEC's gender equity efforts, stunned the
Tar Heels in last year's national championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The next step for the Lady Bulldogs, who open tonight against
Jacksonville State, is to develop staying power. That will be a
difficult task because Georgia, although ranked No. 22 in the
National Soccer Coaches Association of America preseason poll, lost
14 seniors who helped start the program. Barker has signed 13
freshmen, most from metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Bertcher, Williams and Bongiovanni, all juniors, are three of
the five returning starters for Georgia, which has two NCAA bids
and a first-team All-American in its four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to go away,'' Barker said. ``We've got a lot
of new players, but they're talented. We're way ahead of where we
have been in past years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the number of teams in NCAA Division I
has more than doubled, from less than 100 to the 250 last season.
Only basketball (308) and volleyball (299) among team sports have
more Division I participants.
</P>
<P>
   Gender equity might be largely responsible, but the newcomers'
quick breakthroughs reflect the depth of soccer's grassroots. The
NCAA is pushing to achieve Title IX compliance _ adding equestrian,
bowling and water polo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Women's World Cup is going to help women's soccer
at the college level even more,'' said Bongiovanni, a midfielder
from East Brunswick, N.J. ``I think you're going to see younger
girls coming to games because now they can see what they can aspire
to.''
</P>
<P>
   New programs are earning notice in other ways. Texas lured coach
Chris Petrucelli from Notre Dame, where he won an NCAA title in
1995, by promising to build a $28 million soccer facility.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Soccer Stadium has a more modest $4 million price
tag and it adjoins the varsity softball diamond. Work on a
clubhouse with locker rooms won't be completed until an $800,000
fund-raising drive next year. But lights were added recently, and
school officials hope to attract more fans by scheduling six night
games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big explosion at the highest level is pretty much
complete,'' said Georgia State coach Jody Smith, whose team was one
game from making the NCAA Tournament two years ago and went 14-2-1
last season. ``We'll know several years from now what the impact
might be. The opportunities to play are definitely there, but how
competitive will it be to get on the team? We'll have to wait and
see.

WHAT IF YOU'D RATHER HAVE A USED IMPALA? 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ABOUTCARS-IMPALA) 
(For release Sun., Aug. 29) 
(jt) 
 By PAUL DUCHENE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention ``Impala,'' and people of a certain age get wistful. Add
``Super Sport'' and you're likely to hear tales of youth misspent
at the wheel, under the hood, in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The memories are free, but parking a genuine old Impala in the
garage will cost you _ although many collector car experts say
full-size Chevys of the '60s are relatively well-priced. They are
also abundant _ eight million were sold in the '60s alone _ and
thus ubiquitous at old-car shows and in the classified ads of
collector publications.
</P>
<P>
   Although any well-preserved Impala will get second looks and
appreciative comments, prospective buyers should note that special
equipment is everything among serious collectors. Under Chevy's
``central office production order'' system, any combination of
options was possible, regardless of what the brochures said.
</P>
<P>
   Asking prices are almost always highest for convertibles and
two-door hardtops, but low-rider clubs have revived sedans. And
speaking of sedans: Thousands of Impalas served as police cars.
Look for telltale small hubcaps, slotted wheels, holes for
spotlights and plain interiors. A car like this will probably be
cheap, and it will certainly be fast.
</P>
<P>
   Convertibles in great condition can top $40,000 at auction, but
$20,000 _ less than you might pay for a 2000 Impala, which will
assuredly not draw a crowd at Dairy Queen _ affords you a choice of
nice cars. Rusty old beaters can be had for $1,000 and up.
</P>
<P>
   The old Impala lacks the sophistication of the new car, and its
gas mileage will be far lower. But with proper care it will run
forever and probably increase in value.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some highlights of past models:
</P>
<P>
   1958 _ These coupes and convertibles may be the only mainstream
'58 cars worth collecting. (Remember Ron Howard's white coupe in
``American Grafitti''?) The base engine was a 235-cubic-inch 6, but
most came with 283 V8's. The 348 truck motor is rare, but adds
thousands in value. A stunning red Impala convertible with a 348
V8, ``three deuces'' (three two-barrel carburetors), and an exposed
``continental'' spare tire sold for $43,000 at a Kruse auction in
Toronto in April. Desirable coupes nudge $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   1959 _ The Impala line expanded to sedans and wagons with
Chevrolet's most flamboyant design ever _ curved fins served as
eyebrows over cat's-eye tailights. Expect to pay $15,000 to $25,000
for a convertible and half that for a two-door hardtop, even less
for the weird ``flattop'' four-door hardtop.
</P>
<P>
   1960 _ This striking redesign looks thinner and crisper than the
'59, and tends to cost less. Convertibles can top $20,000;
hardtops, with garish hound's-tooth upholstery, are $10,000 to
$12,000, choice sedans half that.
</P>
<P>
   1961-62 _ The bubbletop two-door hardtop has always been a cult
car; The Super Sport arrived in '61 along with a rip-roaring 409
V8. For '62, buyers could get bucket seats and a small-block 327
V8. A 1961 convertible with a 348 V8 brought $28,000 at auction
last spring, and well-equipped coupes are not far behind. Good
sedans can be found for less than $5,000 from families of original
owners.
</P>
<P>
   1963-64 _ The body was squared off more, and the SS interior was
dominated by a big console between bucket seats. SS ragtops may
cost $20,000, more with the 409 engine. (Make sure the SS emblems
are original!)
</P>
<P>
   1965-66 _ These Super Sports were the quintessential '60s hot
rods. The elegantly styled coupe had multiple horsepower options
from anemic sixes, 327's, 409's and the new 396. The 427 made its
debut in 1966 along with the formal Caprice coupe. These cars
remain practical for daily use and have reliable modern
accessories. Look for correct coupes from around $5,000. The SS,
especially with the 396/four-speed combination, can be twice that.
Convertibles, especially red ones, command $30,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   1967-68 _ The Coke-bottle design got more acute and less
attractive from some angles _ especially the slope-back coupe. Look
for the ground-pounding SS 427 but expect to pay 30 percent more. A
good SS coupe may be $10,000, and a convertible twice that.
</P>
<P>
   1969-70 _ The Impala's glory days were ending, and the last SS
427 was built in '69. Horsepower regulations hit hard in '71 as
insurance companies pressured manufacturers not to exceed a
100-horse per 1,000-pound weight limit. As Chevelles became more
sophisticated and powerful, Impalas grew conservative to appeal to
Grandpa (who may still have his). Expect to pay $2,000 for a primo
sedan, $5,000 for a coupe, up to $10,000 for a convertible.
</P>
<P>
   1971-76 _ These huge cars looked much like Cadillacs. Unless you
compete in demolition derbies, only the convertibles are worth a
look; you have lots to choose from for $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   1977-85 _ With square bodies known in Caprice form till '92,
these were anonymous, reliable, indestructible. Coupes with ``bent
glass'' back windows could be collectible.
</P>
<P>
   1994-96 _ The reincarnated Impala SS was a hopped-up Caprice,
only with four doors. These cars have a following yet; the 66,886
that were built might become collectibles.  &QL;

ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWS AS TRADE DEFICIT SOARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A burgeoning trade deficit in the second quarter made the US
economy grow at a slower pace than first estimated, but consumers
continued to spend relentlessly, and growth is expected to return
to record levels before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that the nation's gross
domestic product _ the total output of goods and services _ grew at
an annual rate of 1.8 percent from April through June, down from
4.3 percent during the first quarter. The government originally
estimated the second-quarter growth rate at 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't read too much into these numbers,'' said Sara
Johnson, North American research director for Standard &AMP; Poor's DRI
in Lexington, Mass. ``Consumer spending remains strong. The stock
market shows no sign of slowing down, which will continue to drive
consumer spending. Overall, we have an economy with very strong
momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   The revised GDP report comes two days after the Federal Reserve
raised interest rates for the second time this summer in an effort
to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Thursday's GDP figures show unexpectedly sluggish
growth in the second quarter, they don't indicate Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan acted too hastily, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the report reflects a drag on domestic production
brought on by an unusually high trade deficit as Americans bought
cheap imports at record levels in the second quarter. The trade
deficit was caused by unprecedented prosperity at home while
foreign currencies, especially in Asia, remained weak, making
foreign goods less expensive. Economists said they don't expect
those conditions to last.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed hinted that additional rate increases this year may not
be needed unless the economy shows signs of overheating or if
inflation flares. But some economists said the second half of the
year may see such a strong rebound that a third rate hike isn't out
of the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan has got to be looking at this thing and saying,
`Domestic spending is still very high,' '' said Nicholas Perna,
chief economist for Fleet Financial Group. ``That's what monetary
policy controls. I'd say another tightening is still a
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending in the second quarter rose at an annual rate
of 4.6 percent. That was brisker than estimated a month ago, but
slower than the torrid 6.7 percent pace of spending in the first
quarter. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total
economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending was so strong that merchants had a hard time
keeping up with demand, reflected in unusually low inventory
levels.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, business investment _ spending on new
equipment and plants _ rose at an annual rate of 11.2 percent in
the second quarter, an even stronger showing than the government
first estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Spending for new homes increased at an annual rate of 7.7
percent, better than the 5.1 percent rate originally estimated, but
still slower than the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 90 points in
afternoon trading. Stocks may have been hurt by a portion of the
GDP report showing lower corporate profits, some analysts said. The
Dow ended the day at 11,198.45.

MADEMOISELLE'S EDITOR LEAVING AT END OF YEAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After striving for nearly six years to make
Mademoiselle a must-read magazine for smart women in their 20s,
Elizabeth Crow suddenly resigned as editor in chief this week, a
resignation her employers at Conde Nast announced Thursday after
persuading her to keep working until December.
</P>
<P>
   Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, expects to name a
new editor for Mademoiselle sometime next week, a company
spokeswoman said, and Ms. Crow will work with that person for a
four-month transition period.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crow intends to pursue her interest in new media, she said,
after first taking ``a very long vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Battling in the competitive women's magazine field, Mademoiselle
has experienced a five-year decline in advertising pages, to 582 in
the first six months of this year from 960 in the period in 1994,
according to estimates by the Publishers Information Bureau. In the
last year, the number of ad pages fell 17.2 percent and ad revenue
dropped 13.9 percent, a loss of more than $5 million, according to
the estimates.
</P>
<P>
   But a special advertising supplement called Currency, added to
Conde Nast magazines last year, was not published this year,
accounting for some of the decline, said Maurie Perl, the Conde
Nast spokeswoman. Ms. Crow said the magazine, which has a
circulation of 1.1 million, was profitable. Conde Nast is privately
held.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Walt Disney Co. announced an agreement to sell
Fairchild Publications Inc. to Advance, bringing Jane, a competitor
of Mademoiselle, under the same corporate umbrella and leading to
some speculation inside Conde Nast that the two titles would be
merged.
</P>
<P>
   Asked last week about the speculation, Ms. Crow said that Conde
Nast had a number of magazines, like Mademoiselle and Glamour, that
competed with one another and that a merger would be unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Since she took over in October 1993, when Mademoiselle was
losing money and had an uncertain identity, Ms. Crow has tried to
appeal to sophisticated and technologically adept young women,
adding articles about the Internet to those about fashion, beauty
and relationships. As part of a redesign in February, the magazine
began putting the address of a Web site, chat room or home page at
the end of every article.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Crow said the magazine's research had found sharp increases
in visits to the Internet after the addresses were published.

 &HT;    Judge won't allow `fishing expeditions' into Davidian evidence
 &HT;    By Mark England
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco
said he won't permit unrestricted access to the Branch Davidian
evidence locker _ in spite of recent findings that forced the FBI
to admit using incendiary devices on the day of the 1993 fire at
Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Smith denied a request to search the evidence by plaintiffs in a
wrongful death lawsuit filed by surviving Branch Davidians and
others against the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Requests such as that before the court, to have access to all
the tons of material, will likely not be granted,'' Smith said in
his order this week.
</P>
<P>
   A Colorado researcher, Mike McNulty, first charged that the
federal government used pyrotechnic devices against the Branch
Davidians. He made the claim after being one of the few people
allowed to see the Davidian evidence, which, at the time, was being
held by the Texas Department of Public Safety in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty, who helped produce the documentary, ``Waco: Rules of
Engagement,'' was allowed to view the evidence by a Justice
Department official who has since left the agency.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty reported finding several 40 mm projectiles that he
described as pyrotechnic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, however, said in his motion that he won't allow ``fishing
expeditions'' by those wanting to sift through the Davidian
evidence. His motion made it plain that he thought both sides in
the civil case, which is set for trial on Oct. 18 in Waco, have had
opportunities to view the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Court presumes that the government has had access to the
material for years,'' Smith wrote. ``The Court is also aware that
the Plaintiffs have had access to most of the relevant material
through third parties, thus motions to inspect the material will
need to be specific. ... The Court points this out so that the
parties can begin planning the specific requests they wish to make,
anticipating that pure 'fishing expeditions' will be a waste of
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Phillips, an attorney with the Houston firm of Caddell and
Chapman, which represents some of the plaintiffs, accepted Smith's
ruling placidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can certainly do as the judge requests,'' Phillips said.
``Given that we don't know what's there, it's hard for us to be too
specific, however. We can be more specific than asking to look at
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidian evidence won't be in the court's custody for
weeks, Smith noted in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Smith earlier this month ordered DPS to turn the Davidian
evidence over to the U.S. Marshals Service. DPS officials had
complained that while they had custody of the evidence, the Justice
Department determined who had access to it. Often, people asking to
see the evidence were instructed by federal officials to contact
the DPS, state officials told Smith.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Not everyone seeking transcendent peace and
spiritual growth can live a life of reflection in a cloistered
monastery. In the real world, somebody has to fix flat tires.
</P>
<P>
   And then they can meditate. That is how it works at the Tires
Plus stores in the Midwest, where Tom Gegax, the co-founder, gives
his workers time for meditation, shiatsu massage and nutrition
classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always look for ways we can be more evolved,'' said
Gegax, 52, one recent rainy morning, as the rhythmic chanting of
Indian song on the disk player soothed the bumps in the road. ``It
takes psychological growth, spiritual growth, a striving for
wellness.''
</P>
<P>
   It is Zen and the art of the tire business. While old-style tire
shops might smirk at the touchy-feely style at Tires Plus, it seems
to be working with the customers, or guests, as they are known
here. With more than 150 stores in nine Midwestern states, and
sales of $160 million in 1998, Tires Plus has become something of a
cultural institution here in Minnesota, a state with a history of
social progressivism.
</P>
<P>
   Gegax, who uses the title ``head coach,'' has a modest office _
no bigger than anyone else's in the Tires Plus headquarters, which
was designed with the principles of feng shui, the ancient Chinese
philosophy of blending architecture and spiritualism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping ego in check is the No. 1 goal,'' said Gegax, tall and
silver-haired, with a gentle manner and a soft voice that is barely
above a whisper. ``It's about servant leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Gegax comes by humility from experience. He fell into deep
depression in 1989 after what he describes as a ``three-ring
wake-up call.'' He was divorced from his wife of 20 years. His
business was failing. And he discovered a cancerous lump in his
throat while shaving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get out of bed,'' he said. ``And when I did make it
into the office, I just went in and shut the door.''
</P>
<P>
   He went through extensive therapy, quit drinking and stopped
eating meat. He said he began to coach himself about how to live.
</P>
<P>
   Gegax, a hard-charging basketball player who now has a clean
bill of health, has written a book about his journey, ``Winning in
the Game of Life: Self-Coaching Secrets for Success'' (Harmony
Books, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   In the book, edited with the help of the younger of his two
sons, Gegax says people are fixed on a notion of success that can
be hollow, no matter how big the paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our eyes are bleary from reading business success tomes and
taking notes at `achievement' seminars,'' he writes. ``Still, we're
left asking the same questions: What makes us tick? What makes us
sick? What drives us? While the average American works more hours
than ever, little of the effort actually helps us understand
anything about ourselves. Crowded out by the often-manic push for
success, simple reflective inquiry barely hits anyone's radar
screens.''
</P>
<P>
   To Gegax, who grew up in small-town Indiana, the son of a man in
the mausoleum business, simplicity is among the highest of virtues.
There is nothing very complicated about his philosophy. Reduced to
its essence, it is: Take good care of yourself, and show kindness
to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do good things, it will translate into being good for
business,'' he said. ``But don't do it for that. Do it for human
reasons. Otherwise, people will sense it.''
</P>
<P>
   Each month, he spends two hours with every group of about 40
newly hired workers. And he congratulates them for having the
courage to select a field that may not seem glamorous to the rest
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you at graduation looked up into the sky and
pondered your future and said, `Tires!'?'' Gegax asks them.
</P>
<P>
   After his own graduation from Indiana University in 1968, Gegax
went to work for Shell Oil. At 29, he bought three old Shell
garages and went into the tire business with a partner, Don
Gullett. To show their connection, a string runs from Gullett's
office, through the walls, to Gegax's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to take one little corner of people's lives and make it
a little better experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tires shops, he said, have never had a reputation as
particularly cozy places. They are often dirty, he said, and the
workers can be surly.
</P>
<P>
   At Tires Plus shops, the workers _ they are called ``teammates''
_ wear white shirts and greet each customer with a handshake. Each
store has a coffee table, a television set and a hook-up for a
computer laptop. There are toys and videos for children. And
customers can walk onto the shop floor, provided they wear safety
glasses, to watch the mechanics at work.
</P>
<P>
   In a male-dominated business where a macho ethic has sometimes
prevailed, Tires Plus preaches diversity. There are rules against
insulting anyone over their race, gender or sexual preference, and
workers are required to challenge anyone they hear making a
disparaging remark. ``If you say nothing,'' Gegax said, ``that is
tacit approval.''
</P>
<P>
   For employees, the Tires Plus headquarters has a full-time
``wellness coordinator,'' a fitness room, a quiet room for
meditation, a table for shiatsu massage and bulletin boards with
health information.
</P>
<P>
   But no one is required to take good care of themselves. ``We
have people who drink, smoke and have a horrible diet,'' Gegax
said, ``and we love them, too.''

   INTERNATIONAL TEAM BREAKS INTERNET SECURITY CODES
</P>
<P>
   An international team of researchers has demonstrated that it is
possible to break the security codes used to protect financial
transactions over the Internet. Although the five-month effort
required a significant amount of computing power _ 292 computers at
11 sites worldwide _ it showed that the standard level of
encryption for Internet transactions is not secure.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS RETREAT ON NEW RATE FEARS
</P>
<P>
   Stocks retreated broadly as a new suspicion that the Fed might
raise interest rates again ended the recent rally. The Dow Jones
industrial average fell 127.59 points, to 11,198.45. J.P. Morgan
took the biggest toll, falling $4.375, to $134.875 on concerns
about Ecuador's plan to restructure its debt. The Nasdaq composite
index fell 30.98 points, to 2,774.62, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index skidded 19.78 points, to 1,362.01.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMIC GROWTH SLOWED IN QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   A swollen trade deficit helped slow the economy's growth to an
annual rate of 1.8 percent in the second quarter, but consumers
continued to spend briskly. With the labor market tight, the number
of Americans filing for jobless benefits last week fell by 5,000,
to 283,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds fell for the first time in a week as evidence of strong
consumer spending and employment caused some investors to doubt
whether the Federal Reserve can keep from raising interest rates
again this year.
</P>
<P>
   A DISSENTING VOICE WITHIN THE FED
</P>
<P>
   When the Federal Reserve decided on June 30 to raise interest
rates, one Fed policy committee member dissented. Robert D. McTeer
Jr., president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, said that the
move was not needed to avert inflation, meeting minutes show.

   SORTING OUT INTERNET NAME CLAIMS
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, the new

LONGHORNS, AGGIES FIND OLD LONE STAR GLORY
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Does any of this make sense?
</P>
<P>
   College football has come roaring back to life in Texas. For
decades, the college game had been the state's football stepchild
to the Cowboys, and in the days of Earl, also the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Oilers are long gone, and the giant shadow of the
Cowboys continues to shrink. What does it all mean?
</P>
<P>
   Football roots in Texas were once all about the high school game
feeding the college game. Tom Landry changed that. So did Bum
Phillips. Both had deep Texas roots, and both made the NFL game
seem bigger and better, particularly when the Darrell Royal era
died in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Darrell was the one and only. Larger than Landry, much larger
than Bum. But when the wishbone became boring, and high school
heroes started to leave the state, Darrell did a slow fade into
retirement. College football was never the same in Texas. Even the
Southwest Conference was on its last leg, although we didn't know
it at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Cowboys and the Oilers were for everybody. The
college game was strictly for alums and various hangers-on. But now
...
</P>
<P>
   I know, I know. I'm rambling. Maybe it's just me. Maybe the
college game in Texas only lost its appeal for those of us who
ventured to the NFL for football kicks. But even the advent of the
Big 12 didn't jazz me like I thought it would.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Mack Brown to the University of Texas. Perfect.
Combine Brown's presence with a long overdue wakeup call from
College Station _ it has taken a decade, but is there anybody now
who doesn't think R.C. Slocum has done a sensational job in
building and maintaining a high-quality program at Texas A&AMP;M?
</P>
<P>
   OK, there is that segment of A&AMP;M former students who will tell
you R.C. stands for ``Real Close.'' They want him gone. That's
crazy, but that's college football.
</P>
<P>
   I love Slocum's answer to his critics: ``They keep talking about
how it was in the good ol' days. But these are the good ol' days.
This is the winningest era the school has ever had, by far.''
</P>
<P>
   But this college football season, which begins Saturday night
for UT, also seems full of fresh promise. If you are a
thrill-seeker, and even if you don't bleed orange or maroon, watch
what happens on a weekly basis for the Aggies and the Longhorns. Be
entertained.
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, also keep an eye on Dennis Franchione and TCU.
Obviously, Southern Cal didn't last December in the Sun Bowl. For
TV viewing, that was my personal favorite game of the '98 season.
Better than anything in the NFL, better than anything, period.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-standing theory on the comeback of college football
in Texas had always come down to this:
</P>
<P>
   UT needed to be consistently good again. And the Aggies needed
to inch closer to national prominence. The football train is driven
by those two.
</P>
<P>
   Well, one thing is certain _ that train is on the track and
moving. How fast depends on Brown's second season in Austin, and
the passing game of the Aggies. If A&AMP;M can throw it, all the other
factors are in place for a 3-inch headline kind of year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, however, faces the most difficult challenge. It has been
a whirlwind romance with the UT fandom. Mack is already much
beloved. Season ticket sales went beyond 47,000 this week, an
unheard-of number in Austin. Brown turned around a slow start in
'98, by beating the Aggies, winning the Cotton Bowl, and then
recruiting Chris Simms. Mack can do no wrong, at least until
tomorrow] night, when a very dangerous North Carolina State team
invades Austin.
</P>
<P>
   There's an old saying in the coaching ranks _ no matter how much
you feed the bear, the bear wants more. Which brings up one more
old saying for coaches _ don't be too good too soon. Mack is in
violation of that last ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't agree at all,'' Brown said yesterday from Austin.
``How can you spoil fans at any school? They are already spoiled.
We could have been winless last season and the expectations for
this season would be to go unbeaten.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been major retooling on both sides of the ball for
Brown and his staff. The quarterback, however, remains the very
dependable Major Applewhite. Except the QB of choice in Austin is
already super recruit Simms.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, Major has handled all this very well,'' Brown said.
``Second, Greg Davis \Rthe offensive coordinator\S and I have a
better grasp than the fans of who should be playing. There will be
no poll of the fans on who plays quarterback or any other
position.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be fun to watch. College football in Texas is back. Or
is that just me coming back?

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Calling on a cell phone from a competition
in Detroit, 1998 wakeboarding champion Shaun Murray tries to
explain the appeal of Gen X's hottest new sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, it's just fun,'' says the 23-year-old Orlando,
Fla., athlete. ``I just like being on the water. It's hard for me
to talk now. I'm trying to sign autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   Autographs? From a wakeboarder? Are you thinking what we were
thinking _ Why?
</P>
<P>
   But within the past few years, wakeboarding has, without
fanfare, become one of the most popular sporting activities for
teens and young adults.
</P>
<P>
   And the media and pop culture of America are all over it.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights of professional wakeboarding tournaments are
broadcast on ESPN2's X Games. Athletes are being signed to
sponsorship deals left and right. And the PlayStation National
Wakeboard Championship, which started Thursday and runs through
Sunday at Marine Creek Lake in Fort Worth, has major bucks behind
it, courtesy of sponsors Sony PlayStation, Vans shoes, Mountain Dew
and Rolling Stone magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah, every year it gets bigger and bigger,'' says Dean
Turcol, the PR director for World Sports and Marketing, the
Orlando, Fla.,-based company that produces wakeboarding events
worldwide. ``Right now, there are 2.65 million wakeboarders in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   First, a primer: ``Basically, it's snowboarding on water,''
Turcol says. ``You hold onto a line, like water-skiing, but your
feet are strapped onto a board. The waves the boat creates are
called wakes. You use the wakes as a launch pad to do tricks and
maneuvers in the air. It's a gymnastics show on water.''
</P>
<P>
   The wakes are partially created by special 1,000-pound water
ballast bags towed by the boats. Wakeboarders can perform various
tricks and stunts, such as spins, jumps and back flips, often
reaching heights of more than 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Going up's the fun part. Coming down _ if you don't land
correctly _ is another story, one that 18-year-old Fort Worth
competitor Justin Frizzell is all too familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like hitting concrete,'' says Frizzell, who despite
suffering a concussion last year at a tournament is participating
in this week's events. ``I was doing a trick and I got lost in the
air. Next thing I know, I was sitting in a lawn chair with an ice
pack on my head. It's funny, 'cuz the doctor told me not to ride
for six weeks, but we went out there the next day.''
</P>
<P>
   He was lucky. An acquaintance of his, Greg Akers of Grand
Prairie, was not.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Akers, 20, drowned in Lake Arlington after falling
off his board, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't wearing a life jacket,'' Frizzell says. ``If I
hadn't been wearing one the day of my accident, I would have
drowned, too. You're required to wear them.''
</P>
<P>
   Frizzell, now a college student, got involved in wakeboarding
five years ago after walking into a ski shop and seeing a video for
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it looked like fun, and I wanted to try it,'' he
says. ``It was called something else back then, scurfing or
something like that. People would say, `Hey, it's one of those
scurfboarders.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As Frizzell honed his skills, he began entering local contests,
then national ones. Most recently, he placed first in the junior
division at a local tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He's hoping to do the same this week as he competes in the
PlayStation National Wakeboard Championship's junior men's
division, going up against 50 others for the national champion
title. Last year in Denver, Frizzell took fifth in his qualifying
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten better since then. I've been practicing a lot,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   So has wakeboarding world champ Shaun Murray, who'll be going up
against 17-year-old Florida 'boarder Parks Bonifay, who has won two
of the past three wakeboard Pro Tour season titles, as well as
newcomer Rob Struharik of Ohio, and wakeboarding vet Darin Shapiro
of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   This will not be a male-only competition. Plenty of women will
participate, too, including Florida's 17-year-old wakeboarding
sensation Tara Hamilton, who swept last year's competition by
winning the women's Pro-Tour, Vans Triple Crown, Nationals and
Worlds. Her greatest threat, according to wakeboard fans, comes
from 15-year-old Denver rookie Emily Copeland, who beat Hamilton on
Sunday at the Pro Tour stop in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons wakeboarding appeals to such an
across-the-board, all-ages/genders audience is its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to learn than water-skiing,'' says Murray,
who's been wakeboarding for almost five years. ``First few times
you're out there, you're already doing tricks.''
</P>
<P>
   Frizzell says it's also not nearly as strenuous as other water
sports _ at least not at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost anyone can do it, really,'' he says. ``It's not that
hard on your body, until you start doing the harder tricks. ... But
it's still a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The sport itself originated in the mid-'80s, when Tony Finn of
San Diego and Jimmy Redmon of Austin, Texas, started experimenting
with shorter surfboards and foot straps. Finn popularized the sport
via a line of ski-boards.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, businessman Herb O'Brien perfected what Finn
and Redmon had started, introducing a compression-molded,
neutral-buoyancy board he called the Hyperlite. The fad took off
from there.
</P>
<P>
   Wakeboarding is now enjoying its seventh year as a professional
sport. There's even a magazine devoted to it _ Wake Boarding _ and
an organization, The World Wakeboard Association, which was founded
in 1989 by Redmon.
</P>
<P>
   But will it last?

   ``The participation numbers are astronomic,'' Turcol says.
``Every year, it gets more and more popular.''

<P>
   And, says Frizzell, it's just gonna keep getting bigger.

   ``It still hasn't caught on with the mainstream yet,'' he says,

<TEXT>
<P>
   Before you set foot into wakeboarding waters, here are a few
wake-speak terms you need to know:
</P>
<P>
   Boat speed: Self-explanatory but important. Should be between
18-22 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Wake: Another word for the waves the boat creates for 'boarders
to use
</P>
<P>
   Two-wake air: Jumping from one wake to the other
</P>
<P>
   Wake-to-wake 180: Same thing as two-wake air, but doing a 180
</P>
<P>
   Wake-to-wake 360: Same as above, but doing a 360. Dare ya.
</P>
<P>
   Invert: A flip
</P>
<P>
   Tantrum: A back flip
</P>
<P>
   Bindings: The ``boots'' of a wakeboard mounted onto the board
</P>
<P>
   Handle pass: The handle stays in one hand the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   Blind: When a rider spins and lands in rotation, that he/she is
completely ``blind'' to the wake or boat. The rider can't see or
orient his/her landing. A blind 360, for example, would be spinning
blind to the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Raley: Nicknamed ``Superman,'' this trick happens when your feet
fly behind you and your body is extended behind you.
</P>
<P>
   Fakie: Riding the board backward. Difficult position.
</P>
<P>
   Front-side roll: Rider approaches the wake carving on the toe
side of board and rolls the board over his head and lands on the
other side of the wake.
</P>
<P>
   Scarecrow: Front roll to fakie
</P>
<P>
   Grind: Rider slides board along an obstacle. Also called rail
slide.
</P>
<P>
   Mobius: A roll with a full 360-degree rotation; usually involves
passing the handle from one hand to the other or behind your back.
</P>
<P>
   Moby Dick: Tantrum with blindside 360
</P>
<P>
   Whirly Bird: Tantrum full inverted 360 spin

THREE GOOD STARTERS A TOUGH HAND TO BEAT IN PLAYOFFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers led the American League in
hitting last year and were second in runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Then they faced New York Yankees starting pitchers David Wells,
Andy Pettitte, and David Cone in the AL Divisional Series, scored
just one run in three games and were swept out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres had the third-best record in the National
League last year, and were underdogs when facing the Houston Astros
in the divisional playoffs and the Atlanta Braves in the League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   But starting pitchers Kevin Brown, Andy Ashby and Sterling
Hitchcock got hot, going 6-1 with a 1.86 earned-run average over 10
combined starts as the Padres won both series to reach the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   Those two events are why the Rangers are thrilled by the
resurgence of Esteban Loaiza. Five starting pitchers are needed
during the regular season to reach the playoffs. But once there,
coming up with three effective starters is the key to finishing the
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key?'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``More than
that, it's the lock and key.''
</P>
<P>
   A team can get by with a weak fourth starter. The Yankees won in
1996 even though their No. 4 starter _ Kenny Rogers _ failed to
pitch more than three innings in any of his three starts.
</P>
<P>
   But three starters are essential. If the Rangers play the
maximum 19 games _ five in the Divisional Series and seven in the
ALCS and World Series _ their top three pitchers would likely start
16 of those 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Said New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, ``Ideally you'd like to
have four, but you can get the job done with three.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers may have that in Loaiza, Rick Helling, and Aaron
Sele, three good starting pitchers they can put up against New
York's Roger Clemens, David Cone and Orlando Hernandez or
Cleveland's Bartolo Colon, Charles Nagy and Dave Burba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your first goal is to make the playoffs,'' Oates said. ``The
second goal is to have home-field advantage. The third goal is you
want to have three guys who can go out and pitch well and give your
team a chance to win. Starting pitching is everything when it comes
to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who begin a three-game series against the Toronto
Blue Jays tonight, would like to have their starting pitchers on a
roll going into the playoffs. There are signs of that.
</P>
<P>
   Sele threw shutouts against the Blue Jays and the Boston Red Sox
and Loaiza is riding a six-game winning streak. Other results are
mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Helling is 2-0 with a 3.96 ERA in his last four starts but
failed to get past the fifth inning against the Indians. Mike
Morgan has a 10.80 ERA in his last five starts. John Burkett gave
up one run in eight innings against Cleveland last week, but was
pummelled by the Yankees on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw what happened last year with New York when we ran into
three quality starting pitchers,'' Sele said. ``Good teams find
ways to score runs and play good defense to keep runs from scoring.
But pitching is the link between those two. It just comes down to
how well you pitch on that particular day.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates studies his pitchers just as closely as Torre, who
eventually must choose from among Clemens, Cone, Hernandez, Hideki
Irabu and Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always shuffling them and rearranging them in your mind
who you're confident sending out there,'' Torre said. ``But it's
really not until you get close to the end when you know who you're
playing that you start sorting them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had three solid starters for the 1996 playoffs in
Burkett, Ken Hill and Darren Oliver. They felt the same way last
year with Helling, Sele and Todd Stottlemyre. Loaiza's performance
gives the Rangers hope they will have three this year. Four weeks
ago there was doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Concern over the need for a third reliable starter was why
general manager Doug Melvin was still asking about Kevin Appier,
Juan Guzman, and Chuck Finley
</P>
<P>
   up to the July 31 trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was part of the Stottlemyre trade last year, get a
playoff type of pitcher,'' Melvin said. ``This year that guy wasn't
unavailable. Guzman might have been the guy but he had won just
five games. Mike Morgan had won 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Greg Maddux, John Smoltz and Tom Glavine have
started 42 of 48 playoffs games for the Atlanta Braves since 1995.
When the Oakland Athletics won four division titles and three
pennants under manager Tony La Russa in 1988-92, Dave Stewart, Mike
Moore and Bob Welch started 27 of 32 playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   Going back further, Jim Hunter, Vida Blue and Ken Holtzman
started 27 of 32 playoff games for the Oakland Athletics in
1971-75, and Jim Palmer, Mike Cuellar and Dave McNally started 33
of 35 playoff games for the Baltimore Orioles in 1969-74.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starters have done little this year to merit comparison
with the great staffs of the past. Melvin said a deep bullpen might
be able to compensate for some of the Rangers shortcomings among
their starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But not every night. Melvin said Sele and Helling have to pitch
deep into the game or the bullpen won't hold up through three
potentially brutal playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Said Oates, ``Basically it comes back to how well your starters
can shut down the other team.''

 &HT;    Bush subpoena hearing next week
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A request from Gov. George W. Bush's attorneys
to question former Funeral Service Commission director Eliza May
about her lawsuit against the commission won't be considered until
Monday, when a motion to prevent Bush from being questioned in the
case also will be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's attorneys from the Texas Attorney General's office this
week said May should have to reveal information she claims to have
regarding the governor. In addition to her lawsuit against the
funeral commission, May has sought to formally question Bush,
claiming he has personal knowledge of facts in the case and asking
a court to find Bush in contempt for filing what she called a false
affidavit in his attempt to contest the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Bush denies any knowledge of the situation that led to the
lawsuit and says he did not file a false affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County District Judge John Dietz has been assigned the
case. He scheduled both the motion to question May and the motion
to quash the subpoena of the governor for Monday, according to
Chuck Herring, one of May's attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   May, a former official of the Texas Democratic Party, earlier
this year sued the commission and Service Corporation
International, the world's largest funeral service company,
claiming she was fired for complaining about interference from the
governor's office with her investigation of SCI. The company's
chief executive, Robert Waltrip, is a longtime Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   May also claims that SCI attempted to interfere with her job as
a state regulator by asking Bush's office to stop the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's office denies any interference, and SCI has called the
lawsuit a publicity stunt.

WEATHER FORCES SUSPENSION OF PLAY AT WORLD GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rain and lightning forced first-round play to be suspended
Thursday at the World Golf Championships NEC Invitational in Akron,
Ohio. None of the 41 players in the field completed 18 holes, and
four players never teed off.
</P>
<P>
   Five players were tied at 2-under par when play was suspended _
John Huston (through 14 holes), Steve Elkington (11 holes), Phil
Mickelson (10 holes), Tom Lehman (9 holes) and Greg Turner (4
holes). First-round play will resume at 7:30 a.m. Friday at the
Firestone Country Club, with the second round beginning around
12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the second round players will be grouped in threesomes
starting on both the No. 1 and No. 10 tees in an attempt to finish
the second round by Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The NEC Invitational, limited to players from this year's Ryder
Cup teams and last year's Presidents Cup teams, has a $5 million
total purse, with $1 million going to the winner. There will be no
36-hole cut, and all 10 of the world's top-ranked players are in
the field.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A wide range of federal law enforcement agencies
that were asked to review a clemency petition filed by imprisoned
members of a Puerto Rican nationalist group unanimously opposed any
leniency in the weeks before President Clinton offered to commute
the sentences of 16 members of the militant organization, officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The clemency petition was flatly opposed by the FBI, the Bureau
of Prisons and U.S. attorneys in Illinois and Connecticut, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While their opposition was mentioned in a final report from the
Justice Department to the White House, that report made no specific
recommendation, as such reports often do. Instead, the report on
the 16 members of the militant Puerto Rican independence group
known as the FALN, for Armed Forces of National Liberation,
contained what law enforcement officials said was a more carefully
worded analysis that presented the president with multiple options
for each prisoner, from unconditional release to no leniency
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that presenting the White House a
multiple-choice format was highly unusual for the highly
confidential clemency reports and suggested a diversity of views
within law enforcement agencies that did not exist. The officials,
who said they were troubled by the decision, acknowledged that they
had no evidence that anyone at the Justice Department or the White
House intentionally sought to distort the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have not publicly addressed the issue,
but they have complained bitterly in private about the president's
Aug. 11 decision, which one senior official said, left law
enforcement officials ``stupefied'' and ``outraged'' by the
conditional offer of clemency to the nationalist group members.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said Thursday that he would
not discuss the details of communications between the Justice
Department and the White House, but said that Charles Ruff, then
the White House counsel, was well aware of the views of law
enforcement agencies and faithfully presented those views to
Clinton. ``The president and his counsel fully understood the range
of views on this issue and were not deprived of any advice they
needed,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Ruff, who stepped down from the counsel's job this
month to return to private law practice, acknowledged that he had
extensive discussions with lawyers in the deputy attorney general's
office at the Justice Department. He would not discuss the
conversations in detail, but said that ``nothing out of the
ordinary'' happened.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 16 FALN members in question were convicted of crimes
like possession of unregistered firearms, interstate transportation
of a stolen vehicle, interference with interstate commerce by
violence and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to
commit a crime. None were specifically linked to crimes that
resulted in deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, they received sentences of 50 or more years in prison
and most have already served more than 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's offer, 11 would be eligible for immediate
release from prison and 2 would have to serve additional time
before being eligible for release. Three others who have already
been released from prison would have their fines reduced.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's terms are conditional. The imprisoned
members of the group must agree to the request that their sentences
be commuted, agree to cooperate with parole authorities and
renounce violence for any purpose. So far, none of the 16 have
accepted the presidential offer.
</P>
<P>
   In their recommendations, FBI officials complained about
granting any leniency to persons members of a militant group that
had claimed responsibility for terrorist acts at a time when the
United States was engaged in a worldwide battle against terrorism.
Officials at the Bureau of Prisons, who monitor the FALN members'
visits, telephone calls and letters, concluded that they might not
be trusted to renounce the militancy that led them to the
independence group.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. attorneys who were consulted both recommended against
leniency. They were Scott Lassar in Chicago where 12 of the
prisoners were convicted and Stephen Robinson in New Haven, Conn.,
where four members of the group were convicted of crimes related to
an armored car robbery.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, officials in both offices declined to discuss the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the power to grant pardons rests exclusively with
the president, and the White House has not always accepted the
Justice Department's recommendations. In pardons, commutations and
clemency issues, the Justice Department and its agencies play only
an advisory role and the president is free to weigh any viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, thousands of people signed a petition and lobbied
for the prisoners' release, among them former President Jimmy
Carter and prominent human rights leaders like Desmond Tutu, the
retired Anglican archbishop and a nobel laureate, and Coretta Scott
King, widow of the civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Several Democratic lawmakers from New York also urged Clinton to
release the 16 prisoners, including Reps. Jose Serrano, Charles
Rangel, Nydia Velazquez and Eliot Engel.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is highly unusual for the president to reject the
unanimous recommendation of law enforcement agencies like the FBI,
particularly in a case related to a group responsible for bombings
that killed six people and maimed dozens of others, including
several New York City police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The clemency offer has been criticized by politicians like New
York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a Republican, who has asked
Clinton to rescind it, and by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, a
Democrat who rarely criticizes the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans have criticized Clinton on the ground that the
clemency offer appeared to be an effort to rally support among the
large population of Hispanic voters in New York as Hillary Rodham
Clinton moves closer to entering the race there for the Senate. But
White House officials have denied the decision was an attempt to
help her, saying the deliberations began before she considered
running for office.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists have
not yet decided whether to accept the presidential offer of
clemency. Jan Susler, their Chicago-based lawyer, said Thursday
that the prisoners want to reach a unified decision but are
dispersed at 11 different federal prisons.
</P>
<P>
   After a conference telephone call conducted by the group, she
said that they had carefully considered the offer, but ``have a lot
of problems with the proposals,'' in part because of the
conditional nature of the offer, which could restrict the
prisoners' activities out of prison, including their ability to
contact each other.

BRET'S DAMAGE ONLY $15 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ State officials estimate property damage from
Hurricane Bret at $15 million or less, far below estimates by an
insurance trade group that projected damages at $50 million to $75
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea where they got that number,'' said Jo
Schweikhard Moss, spokeswoman for the Texas Department of Public
Safety emergency management division. ``I was as surprised as you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   Moss said the state has yet to receive reports from all 11
counties seeking federal relief, but estimated the damage from the
storm to be $10 million to $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Southwestern Insurance Information Service
reported insured losses from the hurricane could total $50 million
to $75 million, not including losses from flood damage.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Ray, spokeswoman for Southwestern, said the loss estimate
was based on an insurance industry model that factors the intensity
and size of the storm, the area affected and the number of homes in
that area.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Johns, also of Southwestern, said the estimate is based on
``claims that are going to be coming in for months and months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is damage that these models, after years and years of
research, indicate would be the potential loss from people who find
out that they have damage for weeks and months ahead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johns said similar models are used nationwide to estimate damage
from natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   But preliminary reports indicate minor damage throughout the
affected area. The hurricane took a path through a lightly
populated area of South Texas known for cattle and cotton
production.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster status was sought for Nueces, Cameron, San Patricio,
Aransas, Kenedy, Kleberg and Willacy counties after Hurricane Bret
made landfall Sunday on a remote stretch of coastline south of
Corpus Christi. Duval, Brooks, Webb and Jim Wells counties were
added to the list later.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said the 11 counties have a limited disaster declaration
providing assistance to offset the cost for emergency protective
measures such as evacuations, overtime pay for emergency personnel
and street and bridge closings. Also covered are costs incurred
after the storm, such as debris removal and repair to electrical
and water lines.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there haven't been any requests for assistance to
individuals, as there are in many disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Moss said more than 200 homes incurred major damage and another
1,300 to 1,400 reported minor damage from gusting winds and
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best possible scenario for a storm to hit the Texas
coastline,'' she said of the remote landfall. When tracking the
storm off the gulf coast, state officials anticipated damage to
80,000 homes had the hurricane continued its path toward Corpus
Christi.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Tropical Storm Francis, which made landfall last
September north of Port Aransas, caused $35 million damage because
it hit more highly populated areas in Brazoria, Galveston,
Matagorda and Harris counties. Francis damaged 5,100 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Cooper, corporate relations manager in Dallas for
Allstate Insurance, the second largest insurance provider for home
and auto in Texas, said her company has received 683 claims thus
far for minor wind and rain damage from Hurricane Bret.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a storm of this magnitude it was a miracle that more of
our customers were not severely impacted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Farm Bureau Insurance, the largest provider for farm and
ranch insurance in the state, has received 31 claims totaling about
$145,000 for farm and ranch houses and another 100 claims totaling
$300,000 for other structures such as barns and sheds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I could figure is they might have rolled
agricultural (losses) in there,'' Moss said of the industry group's
high estimate. ``If you put a dollar figure on that cotton you
might come near that number.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Anderson, a cotton market specialist with the Agricultural
Extension Service at Texas A&AMP;M, estimated $25 million in cotton
crops were wiped out in Nueces and Kleberg counties. Most of the
cotton in the storm-affected area had already been harvested, but
cotton was still in the fields in portions of those two counties.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government subsidizes crop insurance, but Anderson
said most of these losses were probably not insured. Farmers, he
said, often insure on the basis of historic yield, but this was
``an exceptionally good bumper crop, one of the best in years.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said other cotton crops farther up the coast toward
Rosenberg suffered rain damage, which reduced their value, but he
didn't have a monetary estimate for those losses.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Jones, a spokesman for the Texas Department of Insurance,
said he didn't know how the insurance industry developed its damage
estimate, but said it shouldn't give the industry any advantage in
getting higher rates later.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of the homeowners' coverage in Texas is written
by insurance companies whose rates are unregulated by the state.
Those that are regulated are required to set their rates within a
rating band, or limits, set by the state insurance commissioner.

 &HT;    UT athletics set records off the field
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The University of Texas athletic department set
all sorts of financial records in 1998 thanks to a charismatic new
head coach, a Heisman Trophy-winning running back and an
over-achieving football team that won the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Longhorns have yet to play a down this season, the
1999 football team is shaping up as another financial
record-setter.
</P>
<P>
   All six home games likely will sell out for the first time since
1970, and UT should easily surpass the home attendance record of
464,642 it set last season. The Kansas State game Oct. 2 and the
Nebraska game Oct. 23 are sold out. Saturday night's opener against
North Carolina State has fewer than 500 tickets remaining, and
there are fewer than 4,500 tickets combined remaining for the other
three home games.
</P>
<P>
   UT has sold out of season tickets at 47,500, breaking the record
set in 1997 by 7,700. A season-ticket package costs $194.
Single-game home tickets range between $28 and $36.
</P>
<P>
   And the sellouts are coming with a bigger stadium. Thanks to
renovations in the off-season, Royal Memorial Stadium has an
official capacity of 80,082, an increase of 627 seats, but it can
hold as many as 85,000, counting media and stadium workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got good fans, a good football team and good coaches,''
said DeLoss Dodds, director of the UT men's athletic department.
``We also have a good economy and a nice-looking stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Ticket revenue will exceed $11 million, breaking the record from
1998 by at least $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything holds, we should be in for a terrific year,''
said Chris Plonsky, UT associate athletic director. ``And if it
doesn't, I would be shocked, very shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the record-breaking stats:
</P>
<P>
   _All 64 stadium suites, which range in price from $39,000 to
$65,000, are leased, with a waiting list of 31. Suites are expected
to generate almost $3.7 million this year. At the start of the 1998
season, UT still had 21 suites to lease. All were taken by the end
of the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   _Fewer than 10 of the 1,262 club seats, which premiered last
year, are unsold. The club seats require a minimum donation of
$1,250 to the Longhorn Foundation, -- he fund-raising arm of UT
athletics. Last year, about 700 of the club seats went unsold.
</P>
<P>
   _Membership in the Longhorn Foundation has grown by about 1,000
members in the past year. Donations have also increased from $9
million a year to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   _The new 34-seat Touchdown Club, located on the east side of the
stadium, is sold out. The minimum donation to the Longhorn
Foundation for entry is $4,000 a person.
</P>
<P>
   _The new Tower Suite, which is on the north end of the stadium,
which will be used as a hospitality room for up to 32 people during
the game, has been leased for all six home games at $10,000 a game.
</P>
<P>
   _The football team is expected to make at least $100,000 more in
television revenue, not including a bowl appearance, than it did in
1998, thanks to a new Big 12 Conference contract with ABC and Fox
Sports. Last year the team was on television 11 times in the
regular season and made $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   _The athletic department this week tentatively agreed to
contract its two Longhorn Limited stadium stores to Stadium
Enterprises, which will give UT about $500,000 a year, plus
incentives, to run them.
</P>
<P>
   When the football team makes money, the profits are felt by all
UT's athletic teams, male and female.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Goble, UT's associate athletic director for business affairs,
said football annually accounts for half of the department's
budget, either in direct revenue, such as ticket sales and
television appearance fees, and indirectly through donations given
to the Longhorn Foundation from football fans.
</P>
<P>
   UT's combined athletic budget (men's, women's and the Longhorn
Foundation) for the school year 1998-99 was $41.23 million. The
men's department, technically, broke even, because it shifted any
extra money to pay for the various construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   Goble said UT has dipped into its reserves for about $5 million
to pay for projects that were not initially in the stadium
renovation budget approved by the UT Board of Regents three years
ago. The approved cost was roughly $90 million, and that has grown
to about $95 million. The $5 million in extras paid for by the
athletic department include new chairback seats, painting the
stadium and extra bleachers at Mike A. Meyers Soccer and Track
stadium, swelling the overall total to about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Messer, senior associate athletic director, said the money
approved by the regents included only the amount needed for
construction. ``Take the track field house: The money was there to
build it, but it didn't cover the furniture or the lockers. There
was a grocery list of operational things we had to address. It's
the same thing when you buy a new house.''
</P>
<P>
   The athletic department is responsible for all but $12 million
of the $100 million. It raised $31 million in donations and
financed $48 million, Dodds said, with the rest coming from the
athletic department reserves. The annual payment on the 20-year
debt service is about $3.7 million, which is covered by the revenue
generated each year by the stadium suite leases.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the department had budgeted for a $4.6 million annual
payment, but lower-than-anticipated interest rates dropped it to
$3.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   With the projects now concluded, Dodds said the department will
be more than able to replenish its reserves, which currently are
about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gritted our teeth and paid the extra money,'' Dodds said.
``Now we can get back to the business as usual. We need to start
replenishing our budget. A lot of these construction projects have
helped us generate this extra money.''

 &HT;    Texas taking steps to recapture past glory
 &HT;    By Mark Wangrin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ National cha ... cham ... cha.
</P>
<P>
   You want to say it. You really do. But you can't. Not if you
remember recent history at the University of Texas and a trail of
hollow talk and unfulfilled promise.
</P>
<P>
   Used to be, not too long ago, that the phrase was dusted off and
buffed up every time the Longhorns put together a modest winning
streak heading into a game against the likes of UCLA or Notre Dame
or Penn State. Then the Longhorn players would liberally insert it
into phrases that began with the likes of ``I think we can win the
...'' or ``We know now what it takes to win the ...''
</P>
<P>
   Nice declarative sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Then they choked on them.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a different time, a different landscape. The new
millenium approaches in one of the most progressive, hi-tech cities
in the nation and we're ... back in the '60s. Buzz cuts are in
style. Texas is getting its pick of the top recruits in the nation.
Former players are worrying about their draft numbers (albeit NFL
not Selective Service). DKR walks, well rides, the practice field.
The tower is even opening back up.
</P>
<P>
   Mack Brown has done everything to bring Texas back to its glory
days except change his name to Darrell and start hanging out with
some pony-tailed country crooner. Oh, and win the big one. The real
big one.
</P>
<P>
   No, you can't say it. National cham ... cha ... cha. Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you out there are already thinking it as a possibility.
This year if things fall perfectly. Next year, almost certainly.
Two years from now, a lock.
</P>
<P>
   Reality check: They don't yet have the depth. One or two
injuries in the offensive line and the season could turn for the
worse as quickly as last year turned for the better. They don't yet
have the pass defense to stonewall a Florida or Tennessee. They
don't have the portfolio. Sweep Kansas State and Nebraska and we'll
start talking.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs Texas is headed in the right direction.
Aggressive, proactive recruiting has most of the top prospects
treating the name Texas like they do Florida State and Ohio State,
a gimme on their recruiting short list. Get in the door and you've
got a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Horns have a defensive front seven you can match against any
in the Big 12, the conference's best receiver and quarterback and
left side of the offensive line. They might not yet have the
big-time playmakers on defense, the kind that can take over a game,
but there is hope that they may already be on campus, or arriving
soon.
</P>
<P>
   There are overt, tangible signs that this isn't another smoke
show. Then there are those that don't show up on depth charts or
recruiting top 100 lists or bench press maxes. They show up in guys
like Joe Walker.
</P>
<P>
   You remember Joe Walker. Last season, as a starting cornerback
even his shadow seemed to get a step on him. Confidence shattered,
he hung onto his starting job for one reason, that being there
really wasn't anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Like any player, Walker wants to win. Like any player, he wants
to start. Unlike many players, he was able to pour his heart into
both.
</P>
<P>
   You could understand how Walker could be selfish, how he could
turn his back and smirk when freshmen like Ervis Hill or Ahmad
Brooks made mistakes last fall, or when hotshot recruits like
Roderick Babers came in this summer with a world of talent but no
understanding of the Texas defense. You could forgive him for being
territorial, for not wanting to surrender any edge to the players
who sought to give him a permanent seat on the bench, who weren't
coming off spring knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Then why does he invite them over to his apartment to watch
video of coverages and defensive technique and receivers, give them
pointers on footwork and keys to deducing a receivers route before
he runs it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' Babers confessed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect that,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Walker about this altruism, and he smiles. ``I'm just
thankful to be here,'' he says. ``I wouldn't be here without this
scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   So he's just a hanger on, right? Just happy to be here? It's
when you figure out where here is that you know differently. Here
is the starting right cornerback spot, a job he won in the
preseason without ever being headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play your best players,'' Walker explained. ``If those
guys play and we win, I'm satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker's not alone. Major Applewhite counsels fellow
quarterbacks Chris Simms and Adam Hall. Receiver Kwame Cavil beats
a cornerback on a route, talks smack to him and then earnestly
tells him, ``Next time, do this.'' In full-scale scrimmages,
offensive players cheer their own big plays. And the defense's. And
vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   When they exercise, or even chant, if strength coach Jeff
``Maddog'' Madden sees only a handful of the players going through
the motions, he stops whatever they're doing. ``One heartbeat,''
he'll say.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it's hokey to build your team around a Smokey Robinson
song. And yeah, talk is cheap. But maybe, in time, they can say it.
Two words. Six syllables. One big fat ring.
</P>
<P>
   And mean it.

CLEMENS STILL HAS FIRE IN THE BELLY TO EXCEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ From the Yankees' dugout, you can hear Roger Clemens
lecturing himself on the mound. The words are harsh and often
profane, delivered with intent. The message is this: you must do
better. You must do well.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' standing as one of the greatest pitchers in baseball
history is secure, but a conflagration still burns hotly within
Clemens when he competes, Manager Joe Torre mused the other day.
Clemens must do better. He must excel.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched with that menacing grimace long before this
year, before joining Yankees, or the Boston Red Sox, for that
matter. Yankees fans want him to win in October, as David Wells
did, but vindicating the February trade of Clemens-for-Wells is not
what drives Clemens; he was chastising himself on the mound years
before Wells, with all his Ruthian gluttony, pitched his way into
the hearts of Yankees fans.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has long had a need to excel. He can remember the first
time he realized he had to do well. It was when he was 9 years old,
when he and his five brothers and sisters lived in Dayton, Ohio,
with Woody and Bess Clemens. It was after his father collapsed,
stricken by his second heart attack, and his sisters put Roger in
the basement to protect the boy from what he might see.
</P>
<P>
   It was after Roger lifted a chair onto a table in the basement,
climbed up and, through a small window, saw his father being lifted
into an ambulance and taken away, forever. Bess Clemens was left to
raise her children alone, and though her fifth child had no idea
his family was poor, the very clear thought occurred to him that he
needed to be good, to do well, for his mother, for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens joined the Yankees this season to win a championship,
something he has never done, after family members encouraged him to
pursue this dream. He wants his mother to have a chance to travel
to New York, if she feels well enough, to see him pitch in the
playoffs or World Series. He tries so hard to be good _ his
teammates have seen that first-hand now _ and sometimes, his effort
has overwhelmed him, his manager believes.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has pitched well intermittently this season, but just as
often has been mediocre. He will take an 11-6 record and 4.70
earned run average into Friday night's start against Seattle at
Yankee Stadium, and has not been the pitcher who routinely
dominated and intimidated batters while racking up five Cy Young
Awards. This has prompted a monthslong examination of him,
accompanied by cries of ``What's wrong with Roger?'' But it is not
what he hears from outside that bothers Clemens, it is the struggle
within.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much harder to stay on the pitching level you've created
for yourself,'' Clemens said, ``than to just finish up. Now I'm in
a uniform with great tradition, great history, and you have that to
deal with as a pitcher _ guys are coming at you. If I blink, I
could get embarrassed out there, and in a sense, that's even more
of a greater challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens pitches, he is as animated as a floor trader on a
high-volume day on Wall Street, cajoling the infielders,
encouraging them, congratulating them with gestures for a nice
play.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for an edge constantly, moving to the clubhouse to
watch games on television for the center- field camera angle, to
see how the hitters are reacting, to see how a certain umpire calls
balls and strikes. ``He is an information hound,'' said David Cone,
with whom Clemens will trade pitching strategy.
</P>
<P>
   But he demands of himself, to the point where he will try to
work through some nagging injuries, rather than tell anyone,
something Torre chatted with him about this season, asking him to
be open. Yankees fans want him to dominate; Clemens wants that much
more than they. He expects to excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't try harder than other people on this club,'' Torre
said, ``but he tries to perfect what he is doing. I think he asks
himself to do more than is capable of being done, to be honest with
you.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' memories of his father are vivid and loving: they would
watch ``Bonanza'' together, and during commercials, the father
would lean down and use a day's worth of his whiskers to tickle
Roger into breathless giggles. Clemens does the same with his
children now and thinks of his father. He was strict and expected
his children to behave and be on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their dad,'' Bess Clemens said, ``was really child-oriented.
He never left the house without taking one of them with him, even
if he was going to run an errand, and he would always be with them,
if he was watching television or doing the house-cleaning or the
cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens and his mother have talked about his memories from the
day his father died _ his collapse, the emotional devastation of
his mother and his siblings, his own feelings, the uncertainty of
being in the basement and not knowing what was happening upstairs,
the numbness of watching his father being pushed into the
ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized my life changed at that point,'' Clemens said,
``and I was going to have to grow up and be a man at an early
age.''
</P>
<P>
   There was never any specific assignment of chores for the
Clemens children, Bess Clemens recalled. It was understood that
there was cleaning to be done, and that the older siblings had to
watch the little ones. All of the boys and girls were taught how to
do their own laundry and wash dishes and clean house, from Richard
_ the oldest _ to Bonnie, the youngest. It was just understood that
things had to get done, Bess Clemens said, that they had to stick
together. Roger idolized his older brothers, and his sisters
developed a protectiveness of him.
</P>
<P>
   Bess Clemens worked as a bookkeeper during the day, a job she
loved, and after returning home for a sit-down meal, she would take
Roger and Bonnie, her youngest daughter, to clean offices in the
evening at a warehouse, and the children would empty trash cans and
sweep for a time, before running off to play.
</P>
<P>
   Bess Clemens wanted them to have fun, to enjoy themselves, and
she would find a way. If there was a prom and money was needed for
a dress or suit, then corners were cut. Sometimes the younger
children didn't get as much as the older kids, sometimes they got
more; it just depended on what was required. You sacrificed for the
family, you stuck together.
</P>
<P>
   Roger eagerly awaited the day he could sign up for Little
League, and when he played, he always had a good glove, good
equipment. Clemens would remark to his mother, after reaching
adulthood, that he had no idea they were poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed all of it,'' Bess Clemens said, looking back. ``It
might've been hard making ends meet from time to time, but that's
the way it is for most people; everybody goes through that. I
really enjoyed the kids _ we had great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   She would watch Roger play Little League and for his other
teams, and there was a tournament game he pitched, before he was in
the eighth grade. His pitches made a loud sound, ``popping into the
glove,'' and Bess Clemens had a sense that Roger _ ``the boy,'' as
she still sometimes refers to him _ might be very good at baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens signed with the Red Sox in the summer of 1983, his first
professional contract, and that fall, Bess Clemens was working in
her kitchen when Roger and Janet, one of the three daughters,
dropped a little bag by the window, telling her they had d bought
candy for her, pestering her to try it.
</P>
<P>
   She relented, finally, opened the bag _ and discovered a diamond
ring and necklace. Bess Clemens had never bought jewelry for
herself. ``I was flabbergasted,'' she said. ``He's never stopped
surprising me. He gets so much enjoyment out of giving.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Roger Clemens designed and built a house for
his mother, as a surprise, and on the day Clemens and his wife
presented it to her, Bess Clemens walked in on Roger working with a
sweeper, adding the last touches. ``Go back outside,'' the son told
her, laughing, ``and ring the doorbell.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not see Clemens pitch in person in October of 1986, when
he faced the Mets in the World Series. She and her other children,
who all live in Texas, were together watching Game 6, when they
thought the Red Sox would clinch the title.
</P>
<P>
   Bess Clemens has emphysema and sometimes struggles for her
breath, but Clemens hopes she is well enough to be in New York, in
October. ``If this goes down like it's supposed to, the playoffs,
it'll be great,'' he said. &QL;

   Other than running Grandma's Marathon in Duluth, Minn., in June,
with the entire route winding for 26 miles 385 yards along the
shore of Lake Superior and a sprinkling of spectators cheering
along the way, 30-year-old David Honea of Raleigh, N.C., had, as he
says, ``no other experience with the Great Lakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, last week, when a sizable portion of the
American population watched him seemingly blow a chance to win
$64,000 on the new ABC game show ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   The question posed by the program's host, Regis Philbin, as
Honea sat in the studio's dramatically shadowed ``hot seat'' while
pulsating music suitable for ``The Texas Chain-Saw Massacre''
played, came down to this: Which of the Great Lakes, other than
Lake Superior, has the largest area _ Lake Huron or Lake Michigan?
</P>
<P>
   Unlike that marathon he ran in June, in which in an elite
international field he finished a respectable 14th _ his
near-world-class time of 2 hours 19 minutes 32 seconds was his best
ever _ Honea this weekend will get another shot, this time for
$125,000, since he is retroactively getting credit for a correct
$64,000 answer.
</P>
<P>
   Honea is a dark-haired, 6-foot-1-inch, 145-pound doctoral
candidate in computer engineering at North Carolina State with
dreams of making the United States team for next year's Olympics in
Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   He saw a videotape of himself on the program. ``I said, `Wow,
I'm really skinny!''' he recalled with a laugh in a recent
telephone conversation. ``I'm taller than most good distance
runners, and I know I'm thin, but on television it looked like I
got stretched out even more.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said wow when Philbin told him that his answer, Lake
Huron, was incorrect. ``It's Lake Michigan,'' Philbin said sadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that wasn't right,'' Honea said. So did numerous
viewers, who called the network with the fact _ this one correct _
that the program's researcher was wrong about the water.
</P>
<P>
   So back Honea comes to the studio in Manhattan to decide whether
to go for the $125,000, or walk away with the $64,000 he has
already won. The show is being taped Saturday, for viewing Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, how will he prepare if in fact he decides to go on,
to seek the next step on the ladder of questions to the top rung of
$1 million, even though one wrong answer, under the game's rules,
will wipe out all but $32,000 of his winnings?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go out and do my training, like I usually do,'' he said.
``Running something like a hundred miles a week. I really don't
know how I'd study for the questions on the show because you aren't
even sure what the categories are. I'm strong in history,
geography, TV, movies, sports and music, and not as good in
subjects like art and literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read a lot and retained a lot, but I'm not like Rain Man.
I'm not sure I have a photographic memory, but I have a pretty good
visualizing component, and I could see in my mind's eye, for
example, the listing in an almanac that Lake Huron was bigger in
square miles than Lake Michigan. I can startle people by telling
them what was the No. 1 song on the charts when they were born.''
</P>
<P>
   Honea said that after an initial nervousness on the show he felt
completely comfortable. ``I think that running in races for the
last 15 years has gotten me used to pressure,'' he said. ``When
you're on the starting line, your stomach is turning in loops. It's
performance anxiety. But when the gun goes off and you start
competing, you put aside the nervousness. That's exactly what
happened on the show.''
</P>
<P>
   What might be even harder than getting the $64,000 question
right is making the Olympic team. ``You have to run a 2:14 to
qualify for the trials,'' he said. ``That's cutting five minutes
off my best time. It's possible, but not likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have asked me, `Would you rather win an Olympic gold or
$1 million?''' he said. ``It's the medal. You have it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that even though he makes $15,000 a year as a research
assistant, his salary will improve substantially when he gets his
doctorate next year. He said he and his wife, Denise Lockett, a
first-year attorney in Raleigh, are comfortable financially.
</P>
<P>
   If he were to devise a sports question for his next round, what
might it be? ``How about, `Who was the last player in the major
leagues to win the triple crown?''' he said. Answer: Carl
Yastrzemski, in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Another question was suggested to him: ``How about, `Who was the
first man to win an Olympic gold in the marathon?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``The first one?'' Honea said. The phone line went quiet for a
moment, and then he said: ``The Greek guy, wasn't it? That would be
mortifying if I missed that one on the show. I'd better look it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Off he went, presumably on a run. &QL;

   WHITECLAY, Neb. _ There is a shrine of sorts by the road near
here, where the bodies of Wilson Black Elk Jr. and Ronald Hard
Heart were found on June 8. Fellow Sioux Indians have decorated the
spot with offerings of chocolate bars, cigarettes, plastic flowers
and eagle feathers, and surrounded it with a simple, triangular
fence of wood posts and beams, 5 feet on a side.
</P>
<P>
   People come to this shrine not in mourning but in anger. For the
two men had been beaten to death, and the still-unsolved slayings
have ignited simmering Sioux anger here in the low, grassy hills
along Nebraska's border with South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   Many American Indians are convinced that the men were killed by
whites and that white sheriff's deputies in northwestern Nebraska
are covering up the crime and might even have been involved. The
sheriff's office denies this and has vowed to help find the
killers.
</P>
<P>
   American Indians have marched in protests every Saturday for two
months. The first march, in late June, turned violent, with
demonstrators looting and burning a store here that sold beer and
groceries.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 American Indians have set up an encampment next to the
shrine and have vowed to stay until the killings are solved. The
site, called Camp Justice, consists of four teepees, a dome-shaped
``sweat lodge'' for traditional worship and, tucked into the elms,
a half-dozen more comfortable tents.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the up to 1,500 American Indians who participated in the
first march assert that two eagles, a rare sight here, had flown
overhead after the demonstration to show that the dead men approved
of the efforts on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eagles mean a lot to us,'' said Loren Black Elk, the brother
of one of the slain men, puffing on a cigarette in the shade of a
tree at Camp Justice this morning, as another American Indian made
coffee over a campfire. ``They're part of our religion. That's the
only reason why they'd come, to bring a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations have widened to include criticism of this
tiny town's existence, because of its extensive sale of beer to
American Indians. No hard liquor is sold.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteclay has only 22 residents, all white. But the town stands
just a few yards south of the South Dakota border, which also
happens to be the border of the giant Pine Ridge Indian
Reservation. The reservation's leaders have long banned alcohol
sales, so American Indians flock here to buy beer at the remote
community's four stores, which sold $3 million worth of beer last
year, according to the Nebraska Liquor Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The American Indians contend that federal treaties with the
Sioux show the reservation extending a few miles south, which would
include Whiteclay and a band of northwestern Nebraska several miles
deep. But some researchers say the disputed area was a buffer zone
initially closed to white settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Sioux leaders met this summer with Nebraska officials to ask
that the land be returned to them. But Gov. Mike Johanns believes
that only the federal courts can settle the matter, said Chris
Peterson, his spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Sioux have been preparing to file a federal lawsuit in the
case, but litigation could take years.
</P>
<P>
   The protests have been organized by the militant American Indian
Movement, which also staged a 70-day stand-off with the police in
1973 at Wounded Knee, which is on the reservation, 15 miles
northeast of here. Two American Indians were killed then.
</P>
<P>
   With tensions between the Sioux and whites running high, a
sheriff of a South Dakota county adjacent to the reservation said
on Wednesday that the severe beating of a white man, who was found
on Saturday on the eastern edge of the reservation, 30 miles
northeast of here, might have been racially motivated. No other
law-enforcement officials have made that assessment, and a relative
of the victim said she thought the beating of the man, Bradley
Young, 22, had resulted from a drunken fight between acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   Two Indians, Louis Means and Byron Bissonette, both 18, were
charged in U.S. District Court on Wednesday with assault resulting
in serious bodily harm. They pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the attack occurred at a drinking party,
and Ted McBride, the U.S. attorney for South Dakota, said it was
``premature'' to ascribe any racial intent in it. Young remains in
critical condition in a hospital in Rapid City, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said his office was still investigating the deaths of
Black Elk and Hard Heart and had not drawn any conclusions. The
bodies were found on the South Dakota side of the border, within
the reservation and about 100 yards north of Whiteclay.

 WHITECLAY, Neb.: of Whiteclay.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard W. Anderson, a deputy in the Sheridan County sheriff's
office, the Nebraska law-enforcement agency that polices Whiteclay
and is frequently criticized by American Indians, said sheriff's
deputies had done everything possible to investigate the crime.
Anderson declined to comment on whether any current or former
deputies were under investigation in the killings. He said deputies
treated American Indians fairly but were resented because most of
the county jail's inmates were American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said that the jail had many American Indian inmates
partly because American Indians committed many of the county's
crimes and partly because American Indian suspects were less likely
than white suspects to be able to afford to post bond. The Pine
Ridge Indian Reservation is one of the poorest in the nation.
President Clinton visited it last month to call attention to the
plight of the nation's poor.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over Whiteclay is complicated by the fact that the
stores here have sometimes extended credit to American Indians,
winning their gratitude. Adrian Long, a 37-year-old American Indian
from the reservation, said that he believed that the reservation
should include Whiteclay, but that the owners should be allowed to
keep their stores open so that they could continue to sell on
credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shouldn't close this town up,'' Long said, sitting
cross-legged on a shady sidewalk here and cradling in his lap a
tall, unopened beer that he had just bought.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many other reservation residents are boycotting the stores.
Lance Moss, a 30-year-old lifelong resident of Whiteclay and the
assistant manager of the Jack and Jill grocery and beer store here,
said that grocery sales had dropped by half this summer, although
beer sales had not been affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people making a point not to come here,''
Moss said. ``It has definitely hurt business.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the store had cut back the hours for some employees.
</P>
<P>
   The only other grocery store in town, VJ's Market, has not
reopened since it was looted and burned in the protest in late
June, although repairs are under way. Anderson said that the
incident was under investigation and that no arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   The latest weekly protests have been smaller, involving only
about 30 people. Anderson said, while Black Elk put the number at
about 150.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Schwarting, a 21-year-old clerk at the Arrowhead Inn, a
tiny store selling beer, soda, candy and pornographic magazines,
said local residents expected the protests to fade away and
business to continue as usual, with the town remaining outside the
reservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like this for 100 years,'' Schwarting said,
occasionally wielding a blue, metal fly swatter against the insects
that buzzed past wall posters of scantily clad women. ``It ain't
going to change.''

RENO SAYS WACO DISCLOSURES DAMAGE HER CREDIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for general rewrite; expands by 200 words.)  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday that her
credibility has been damaged by new disclosures of the use of
``pyrotechnic'' tear gas canisters on the final day of the 1993
government standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Reno survived the political fallout of her first
major test in office, a fiery debacle at the Branch Davidian
compound after which about 80 people, including 25 children, were
found dead. Now, nearing the end of the Clinton administration, she
finds herself facing many of the same questions about the same
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and officials at the Justice Department and FBI, in
asserting that the government was not responsible for setting the
fire, have long denied that any tear gas canisters capable of
igniting a fire were ever used. But prompted by the disclosure this
week of government inventories listing weapons used in the assault,
FBI officials acknowledged on Wednesday that some pyrotechnic
canisters were used.
</P>
<P>
   The officials continue to maintain that the fire was set by the
cult members. They say that the pyrotechnic canisters were used six
hours before the fire started and had been aimed at a bunker 100
yards from the main building that was set ablaze. But Reno said she
was troubled by the disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very good for my credibility,'' she said
Thursday at her weekly briefing with reporters. ``That's the reason
I am going to pursue it until I get to the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   While the attorney general told reporters Thursday that she was
``upset'' and ``very, very frustrated'' about the latest
disclosures, some former officials who were involved in the 1993
internal reviews of the incident at Waco said they were not
surprised by the Justice Department's new difficulties, or that
questions linger over the destruction of the compound and the
deaths of the Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, Reno and her aides undertook an examination
of Waco that was perfunctory and not critical, the former officials
said. The review assigned no blame for any mistakes by the
government and inexplicably contradicted major elements of the
attorney general's own account of what had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews Thursday, some officials involved in the initial
investigation said the new information does not change their view
that David Koresh, the Branch Davidian leader, and his followers
set the fire. These investigators, including an independent arson
expert, said they believed the canisters were fired too far away
and too early to have caused the fatal fire.
</P>
<P>
   But some of these officials continued their broad criticisms of
the federal agents' decision to rush a compound where the
inhabitants were regarded as potentially unstable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here it is six years later, and the government's position is
undercut by this fact, which when you get through with it may have
no impact whatsoever on the central question of who killed these
people,'' said Edwin Guthman, a former Justice Department official
in the Kennedy administration and Pultizer-prize winning
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   Guthman was one of three outside experts who produced a brutally
critical report for the Treasury Department of its role in the
botched Feb. 28, 1993, raid on the Davidians compound that led to
the 51-day standoff, describing mendacity and missteps before,
during and after the raid. One of the Treasury Department's
agencies, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, led the
initial raid on the Waco compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is basic stuff,'' Guthman said. ``When you do these
things you've got to face up to it, be honest about it, and take
the consequences. But whatever the FBI did, they never faced up to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ruth, the former Watergate prosecutor who was another
outside expert involved in the Treasury review, said the latest
damage to the Justice Department's credibility was not surprising
in view of how it handled the Waco affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at the time thought the Justice Department evaluation
was a whitewash in the sense that it didn't tell the full facts
about what was known,'' Ruth said. ``It clearly was written to
vindicate the attorney general, for some reason, who speaks well
for herself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this particular new information by itself bears
on the circumstances of the fire,'' he said. ``But what it clearly
shows is that the internal investigators didn't use the proper
types of investigatory techniques necessary to explore the facts.
That is completely unsurprising because the FBI over time has never
had the institutional ability to investigate itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Thursday that 40 FBI agents, led by an FBI inspector,
would conduct the new inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruth said it would be pointless for those agents to take a
new round of affidavits from those who were involved in the
incident and have already provided testimony to Congress and in the
resulting civil lawsuits. Instead, he recommended an inquiry by
agents from outside the FBI as the only way to produce a credible
review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are 40 FBI agents doing interviews really going to restore the
attorney general's credibility?'' Ruth said. ``If they don't reopen
the whole thing now and actually use outside investigators, this
will be like the Kennedy assassination for the next 50 years. I
live in the West and the Midwest and this issue is keeping the
militia groups alive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Jamar, the FBI special agent in charge at Waco, said
Thursday, ``The important thing that people have to understand is
that we weren't trying to hide anything.'' He said he did not
remember being asked about the incendiary devices and he thought
probably no one considered them important because they were fired
hours before the fire.
</P>
<P>
   There was only one dissent from the 1993 Justice review, by Dr.
Alan Stone, a professor at Harvard law and medical schools who was
one of the experts retained by the Justice Department. He concluded
that the FBI had helped drive cult members to mass suicide and then
misled officials in the review that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a different tack than the attorney general was the
treasury secretary at the time, Lloyd Bentsen, who ordered a more
vigorous review, prepared under the direction of Guthman, Ruth and
Willie Williams, the former Los Angeles police chief. That
ultimately led to a major shakeup at the Treasury's Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, including the removal of Stephen
Higgins as the agency's director and the suspension of five other
senior and lower-level officials. Because the Treasury report was
so thorough and critical, ATF has been able to put the incident
behind it, even though it resulted in the deaths of four ATF
agents.
</P>
<P>
   Reno won widespread praise for stepping forward after the
disaster at Waco and claiming ultimate responsibility for what had
occurred. It was early in the Clinton administration and the
president's advisers had persuaded President Clinton to avoid
making a public appearance concerning the matter, an effort to
reduce his accountability but, in the end, enhancing Reno's
stature.
</P>
<P>
   But the Justice review was seen by many as a whitewash. Although
Clinton had promised a ``thorough and independent examination of
the affair,'' the main author of the Justice Department report,
Edward Dennis Jr., found no criticism of any Justice Department or
FBI officials was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find there is no place in the evaluation for blame and no
place for fault,'' he said at the time. He said ``mistakes were
made'' but did not identify who may have made them.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that the Davidians had set the fire, based
on three things: an arson report analyzing the locations where the
blaze began; infrared pictures taken from an airplane when the fire
started that showed intense spots of heat erupting in different
spots in the compound at almost the same time, and the testimony of
some of the Davidians who survived.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said in an interview Thursday that the report ``was not
intended to be a comprehensive, all-encompassing report.''
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said his report ``did not attempt to answer every
question that could be raised about'' Waco, but instead focused on
the questions of how the FBI negotiated with the Davidians, how the
fire was caused and how the attorney general made her decisions. He
concluded that Reno was adequately briefed by the FBI about the
issues she faced in ordering the tear-gas assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a case of the attorney general fiddling while
Rome burned,'' he said, adding that based on what has come out so
far, he remained comfortable with the report's conclusions,
particularly that the Davidians had started the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tear gas used in the assault was liquid sprayed from
the barrels of tanklike vehicles. The use of at least two
pyrotechnic canisters became public in an inventory list of
equipment used in the raid that surfaced in a wrongful-death
lawsuit filed by survivors of the fire and family members of those
who died in the blaze, and which is scheduled to open in October.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI official said the inventory was an internal document
prepared shortly after the raid, and officials said Thursday that
it might not have surfaced earlier because investigators did not
attach significance to an incident that happened hours before the
fire at a different corner of the compound.

   ``In the last few years and particularly the last six months,
Latin music has made an impact from Madison Avenue to suburban
malls, from prime-time television ads to blockbuster film
soundtracks,'' said Richard Dopico, RIAA's director of Latin Music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily, the buyers are still Latinos, but there has been a
lot more interest from nontraditional buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipments of cassettes dipped 3 percent to 8 million and music
videos declined 30 percent to 46 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin music sector's overall gain came despite tepid sales
(a 1.8 percent increase) and shipments (a 0.3 percent decline) in
the overall domestic music business and on the heels of
back-to-back Latin music gains of 25 percent and 28 percent. ``This
year's growth in Latin music is still impressive considering how
much it grew in 1997 and 1998,'' Dopico said.
</P>
<P>
   David Masry, president of the New Jersey-based Ritmo Latino
chain, said he expects more of the same. ``Not only is the Latino
population growing, but there are a lot of cross-over sales,'' he
added. ``Anglos are buying Latino albums now. My feeling is that
these trends will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Most impressively, the report's figures did not include the
quadruple-platinum album sales of Ricky Martin's self-titled album,
which included the hit song ``La Vida Loca,'' because the survey
only counts albums that are at least 51 percent Spanish language.
</P>
<P>
   However, sales of Martin's ``Vuelve,'' which won this year's
Grammy in late February for best Latin pop performance, were
included. Dopico noted that Martin's televised performance during
the show helped ignite sales in the Latino category.
</P>
<P>
   Other artists with hot first-half titles included Los Tigres Del
Norte, Marco Antonio Solis and Shakira, along with the Selena
anthology. Masry said an upcoming album from Luis Miguel should
sell well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growth is coming from far beyond Ricky Martin's album
sales,'' said Thomas Adams of Adams Media Research.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said Latin music sales have been particularly impressive
in the Southern California and Florida markets. ``There's no end of
savvy Spanish-language media in those places,'' he added. ``It
dwarfs any other niche. And there's a ton of room to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recent figures from the U.S. Census Bureau show the
nation's Latino population was at 10.7 percent in 1996; in
California, Latinos represent 30.2 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
   Indicative of the crossover appeal of Latino artists, Martin and
actress Jennifer Lopez posted strong sales in the early summer, and
a pair of Latin stars, Christina Aguilera and Enrique Iglesias,
recently generated solid numbers. Aguilera's ``Genie in a Bottle''
has been the No. 1 single for five weeks, while Iglesias'
``Bailamos'' moved from No. 11 to No. 2 last week.

   LOS ANGELES -- Latin music sales, continuing a three-year hot
streak, jumped 11 percent in the United States during the first
half of year as the sector moves from niche to mainstream, a trade
group has reported.
</P>
<P>
   Revenues hit $291.6 million, representing nearly 5 percent of
all domestic sales, according to the Recording Industry Association
of America. Overall units shipped soared 12 percent to 25.6
million, spurred by a 20 percent rise in compact disc shipments to
17.5 million.

<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ Japan avenged an earlier loss in the Little
League World Series by pounding Puerto Rico, 12-2, Thursday
afternoon to claim the international championship and advance to
Saturday's title game.
</P>
<P>
   The team from Osaka is the second straight Japanese team to win
the international championship. Last year Kashima reached the title
game and lost to Toms River, N.J., 12-9. Osaka will face the winner
of Friday night's U.S. championship game between Toms River and
Phenix City, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   Osaka's victory came two days after it lost to Yabucoa, 3-1.
Thursday the Japanese team jumped all over the Puerto Rican team,
scoring seven runs on six hits in the first inning. Japan did its
damage with two out, thanks to an error by the Puerto Rico
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst allowed the Japanese team to remove its best
pitcher, Kazuki Sumiyama, after he had faced only three batters.
That should make Sumiyama available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having two outs with no one on base, then giving up
seven runs, that took a lot out of the team,'' said Puerto Rico's
manager, Edwin Carrasquillo. ``It was devastating. We are used to
coming back, but Japan's offense was too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico's first-inning disaster began when pitcher Cristian
Gonzalez issued a two-out walk. The following batter reached on the
error by Josue Rivera. Then Gonzalez allowed four straight
run-scoring singles before being relieved by Xavier Galarza, who
allowed three straight hits and three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico scored in the third inning on a two-run homer by
Gonzalez. That brought the Puerto Rican team to within 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   Four Puerto Rico pitchers allowed 13 hits; three Japanese
pitchers combined for a four-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected to win this game,'' said Japan's manager, Tsutomu
Kameyama. ``The only advice I gave my players was to focus on
having a good time and to play the way I knew they could.''

WATER UNEXPECTEDLY FOUND IN WEST TEXAS METEORITE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ERIC BERGER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A meteorite that spectacularly plummeted into West Texas last
year contained water from the very melting pot that formed our
solar system system, scientists will report Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected discovery, the first time astronomers have
collected water from a space object, offers researchers tantalizing
clues about the early planets and further illustrates the presence
of water, and possibly life, throughout our solar system and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists from NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston and
several other facilities found traces of water in what is,
essentially, ordinary salt inside a meteorite that fell to Monahans
on March 22, 1998, they report in an article published Friday in
the magazine Science.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existence of a water-soluble salt in this meteorite is
astonishing,'' University of Chicago chemist Robert Clayton writes
in the same issue.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, scientists are finding water throughout the solar
system: oceans on Jupiter's moon Europa, ice on Mars, comets,
cooler parts of the sun and recently the moon, although scientists
are still debating that finding.
</P>
<P>
   Without water, scientists believe, life cannot exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you can maintain water in all these sorts of
conditions is really quite important,'' said University of Texas
astronomer Anita Cochran. ``And what happens is that we've realized
that life can exist in extreme conditions all over Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent discoveries of life in steaming thermal vents on the
ocean floor and deep within Antarctic seas have led researchers to
believe that life could also have developed in the inhospitable
reaches of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   A NASA spacecraft searching for life on Mars will land near that
planet's South Pole on Dec. 3 to look for water beneath the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   That the local researchers found water in the space rock at all
is due in large measure to the resolve of JSC space scientist
Everett Gibson. He first heard of the Monahans meteorites from news
reports that the fireball was seen more than 100 miles away from
where it landed and of the subsequent efforts of seven teens to
recover the rock.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare opportunity to study meteorites fresh from space,
so Gibson flew to Monahans, a town of 8,000 known for co-owning the
120-degree record for Texas' hottest day.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived, the city had already seized the two rocks _
grapefruit-sized pieces were found by the teens and by a police
officer _ claiming they had fallen on city property.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson prevailed on the council to release the meteorites to
him, promising to return them within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Within 48 hours, Gibson brought the specimens to Clear Lake, an
area south of Houston, where the research group found the salt and
water. Scientists speculate that water has never been found in
meteorites before because any exposure to Earth's weather, even a
soft rain, can wash the evidence from the porous material.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been out there in the Texas weather for any length
of time, the water would have been gone,'' Gibson said Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, the study's lead author Michael Zolensky and Laurence
Nyquist studied a purple mineral on the rock and found it was
sodium chloride, similar to table salt. Embedded in the salt were
tiny droplets of water about one-tenth the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   After extracting the salty brine, Gibson returned the two rocks
to Monahans.
</P>
<P>
   In what Gibson described as a ``win-win-win-win'' situation, the
seven teen-agers eventually got the piece of rock they found back
from the city and sold it for $23,000 over the Internet to a Big
Spring businessman.
</P>
<P>
   The city gave a third of the remaining piece to scientists and
kept the rest in a local museum, complete with the chunk of asphalt
where it had landed.
</P>
<P>
   But science will probably be the biggest winners of all, the
paper's authors said.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have scientists had liquid water from outer space
to study in a lab. According to dating methods, the salt dates back
4.5 billion years, preserving the water from when the solar system
was still forming.
</P>
<P>
   Rock salts like the one found are typically formed from
evaporations of large bodies of salt water, such as the Gulf of
Mexico, Zolensky said. That indicates large amounts of liquid water
_ as opposed to gaseous (vapor) or solid (ice) _ were present
during the solar system's early years, consistent with theoretical
models.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that most of the solar system's early water
condensed in the gas-giant planets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, or
the outer layer of the sun. How it was acquired by Earth, Mars and
possibly the other rocky planets of the inner solar system remains
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that our moon formed from a collision between Earth
and another body, the impact vaporizing any water on the planet.
However, scientists generally agree that enough time has elapsed
since that collision for comets to have delivered to Earth the
water we have today.
</P>
<P>
   Zolensky said the water in the meteorite could have collected
inside the asteroid during the solar system's formation or have
been left when the rock hit a passing comet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal now is to examine this water, to see where it's been
and how it was formed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A sophisticated analysis should reveal if the water is similar
to that carried by comets, or as it exists in slightly different
chemical forms on other planets and stars.
</P>
<P>
   If the water is found to be chemically similar to that borne by
comets, then the Monahans meteorite could offer clues to what water
on Earth was initially like, Zolensky said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the amount of water collected, trillionths of ounces,
is not enough to be studied by current methods. Zolensky said a lab
at Cambridge University in England could have the capability to do
the chemical analysis by next year.

 &HT;    Sharpton urges Dayton to organize against police brutality
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The scene in Dayton's Mount Enon Baptist Church
on Thursday night easily could have been a page ripped from a
history book on the black struggle in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker was New York activist the Rev. Al Sharpton. The
topic of his politically laced sermon, three decades after the
modern civil rights movement: how to end present-day police
brutality against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the tradition of many black preachers before him, including
those of the movement's era, Sharpton fused talk of socio-political
action with religious rhetoric. He urged the use of civil
disobedience and litigation against corrupt police officers and
their departments, and encouraged a fight for police review boards
that bear the power to recommend penalties for brutality. Sharpton
also accused some successful blacks of suffering from ``Negro
amnesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare you to get over on the backs and blood of your people
and get up there and say you don't have anything to do with
anybody, that you got there by yourself,'' said Sharpton, whose
National Action Network this year has organized protests against
New York City police officers who were involved in the February
shooting death of a Guinean immigrant and the 1997 brutalization of
a Haitian immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton SCLC and the Coalition for Justice sponsored the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it matter how much education you have if any cop can
make you get on the ground and spread-eagle?'' Sharpton asked the
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hundreds of people gathered in the church were Dayton
school board member Clayton Luckie, Dayton City Commissioners Ida
Neal and Dean Lovelace and Ohio Sen. Rhine McLin, as well as area
prosecutors. Dayton police Maj. Jaruth Jefferson was also present.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton demanded mobilization of the people: ``Organize
movements that will put a spotlight on those that are guilty and
unjust,'' he said. ``If people are being murdered, there's no way
to respond in silence. You must get Dayton's attention and say, `No
business will go on as usual as long as our communities are
infested with injustice.'''
</P>
<P>
   The dapper Harlem resident criticized the disparities in drug
sentencing laws that disproportionately incarcerate blacks, as well
as the millions of dollars government officials are pouring into
the construction of new prisons instead of public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (government officials) don't have money for schools and
books and computers but they have money to build prisons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is we still face some of the same
challenges of bigotry that we faced 100 years ago. Police brutality
is the national challenge of this generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton concluded his 45-minute address with a Bible scripture
and laced it with socio-political rhetoric:
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stand up . . ., in the end God will say, `Well done, my
good and faithful servant. Since you were faithful in small
matters, I will give you great responsibilities. Come, share your
master's joy.' ''

WOODSON PROMISES TO BE A VOCAL LEADER ALL YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Strong safety Darren Woodson led the Cowboys'
defense last season with 136 tackles, the third-highest total of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-year veteran was second on the team in pass
deflections.
</P>
<P>
   He was selected to the Pro Bowl for the fifth time in his career
and was an All-Pro for the fourth time _ despite being hampered by
off-season shoulder surgery and having to endure the revolving door
at free safety as the Cowboys searched for a replacement for
free-agent departee Brock Marion.
</P>
<P>
   It might be hard to look at Woodson's play last season and think
it was subpar.
</P>
<P>
   But he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woody,'' as he's called by his teammates, said he didn't make
enough big plays on defense. And, more important to him, he said he
wasn't the leader he should have been.
</P>
<P>
   Now healthier than he has been in two years, Woodson plans to be
an All-Pro player and an All-Pro leader this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a great season last year. I know that,'' Woodson
said. ``I still feel that. I can't blame anything on anybody. I'm
not blaming my shoulder. I'm not blaming it on a new safety. It's
on me to have a better year and help the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson is confident that he will have a better season because
his right shoulder, which he injured in 1997 and had surgery on in
January 1998, has healed. He credits Dr. Richard Drucker and
minerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't terrible, but my shoulder wasn't strong last year,''
Woodson said. ``Sometimes when guys have major surgeries it takes
two years to feel right. I think I'm at that point right now. Dr.
Drucker helped me a lot. He put me on that mineral product, and
it's done wonders for my body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best I've felt since I've come into the league.''
</P>
<P>
   With renewed health, Woodson said he can devote his attention to
not only being a great player on the field but one that his
teammates can turn to for guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly wasn't into being the team leader that I should have
been last year because I was so concerned about other things
health-wise,'' he said. ``That's all behind me now. I can really be
that leader, really be the guy that guys turn to. I want to be that
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an outlook Cowboys coach Chan Gailey welcomes as well,
though he acknowledged that he didn't see a problem with the old
``Woody'' as a player or as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always for him leading,'' Gailey said. ``He's a great
player and a great person. But I always considered him a leader.
And I thought he played pretty good last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Soft-spoken and laid-back, Woodson, 30, has let his actions do
his talking for much of his career. But he said the changing makeup
of the team requires him to change how he leads. He is the
longest-tenured player on a defense that will likely feature five
different opening-day starters from last season and seven from two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson said veterans such as Tony Tolbert, Charles Haley and
Fred Strickland were the vocal leaders on defense for much of his
career. With them no longer around, he said he must embrace his
role as a leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I really grasped that role before because I've
always been the type of guy that did my job by example,'' Woodson
said. ``I think now I've got to be more vocal. I've got to be a
leader for the entire defense, not just the secondary. There are
things I've got to do for us to win. And I welcome the role.''

COWBOYS DON'T SEE QUICK FIX FOR CORYATT'S LINGERING INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ There is growing cause for medical concern about
linebacker Quentin Coryatt, who remains in Indianapolis where he
has gone to see a specialist to treat his chronic Achilles'
tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, who was signed as a free agent during the off-season by
the Cowboys to start at strongside linebacker, has yet to make a
preseason appearance. Sunday night against Denver, he will miss his
fourth preseason game for his new team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think when he comes back to us that everything is
going to be fixed,'' Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said yesterday.
``It's chronic in nature. It's long-lasting. It's going to be an
ongoing process.''
</P>
<P>
   Maurer added, ``A lot of players have Achilles' tendinitis, but
this \Rcase\S is a little more severe than most.''
</P>
<P>
   Coryatt, 29, missed last season with reconstructive shoulder
surgery after being released by the Colts on Aug. 31. Upon his
arrival in Dallas four months ago, Coryatt was viewed as a player
with enormous upside but an injury-plagued past, including
Achilles' tendinitis ``off and on throughout his career,'' the
Cowboys trainer said.
</P>
<P>
   But as Mauer added, ``Obviously, the shoulder was our main
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the focus shifts to Coryatt's Achilles' tendon and the
larger question: When is he going to be able to play? Good morning,
Troy Troy Aikman will appear on ABC's ``Good Morning, America'' at
7:10 a.m. today on WFAA/Channel 8 with approximately 100 children
from Happy Hill Farm in Granbury. Aikman will be promoting the
``Cowboys' Wives Cook Book,'' which benefits Happy Hill Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got chosen to get up at 5:30 a.m. in the morning to go talk
about it,'' Aikman said. Rocket in, Mills out Just when Raghib
``Rocket'' Ismail returns for his first preseason game with the
Cowboys, fellow wide receiver Ernie Mills (strained hamstring) will
miss Sunday's game at Texas Stadium against the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to pressure myself into playing,'' said Mills,
who battled a similar left hamstring injury in 1994 with
Pittsburgh. ``Because I've had this kind of thing before, it's made
me a little more conscious of'' getting it healed.
</P>
<P>
   Ismail is coming off a slightly separated shoulder, which he
suffered trying to make a diving catch during practice Aug. 4.
McKnight under knife Wide receiver James McKnight, who will miss
the season with a torn ligament in his left knee, underwent surgery
Wednesday by team physician Dr. Robert Vandermeer in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   McKnight suffered the season-ending injury during a noncontact,
seven-on-seven drill before the annual Blue-White scrimmage Aug. 5.
As expected, team officials termed it ``successful surgery.''
Musical corner Cornerback Charlie Williams, a five-year NFL veteran
with three career starts, will make his first appearance of the
preseason Sunday night. He will start at right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about musical chairs. Williams is replacing rookie free
agent Duane Hawthorne, who replaced Kevin Smith (bulging disk) who
replaced Deion Sanders (April toe surgery).
</P>
<P>
   Williams? He's coming off a broken forearm from May minicamp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith received a third epidural injection in his back yesterday.
Progress (in the form of relief from pain) has been made, but Smith
will not play in either of the two remaining preseason games. His
reaction to the latest treatment will help determine whether he
will be ready for the Sept. 12 regular-season opener at Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders continues to make progress, mirroring the offense,
backpedaling, working on his own. Said Jim Mauer: ``You keep adding
on \Rto the rehabilitation process\S and hope you don't have a
setback. We've been doing that with Deion ... and there have been
no setbacks.'' Any other questions? Alonzo Spellman continues to
have a positive attitude even now that he has been asked to switch
to defensive tackle from defensive end, a position of comfort that
he had played for his entire career at Ohio State and with the
Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh sure, you lose a couple of steps here and there in getting
back your keys, '' said Spellman, 29, who was released by the Bears
in 1998. ``But that comes back with reps ... it's not a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Spellman, who was signed by the Cowboys as an out-of-work free
agent four weeks ago, has played nickel tackle in pass-rushing
situations all preseason, but admits that playing tackle on every
snap is quite different.
</P>
<P>
   And he makes his NFL debut at defensive tackle against no less a
challenge than Terrell Davis and the Denver Broncos on Sunday night
at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how confident he is that he can return to the NFL in
top form after a 19-month layoff, Spellman looked his questioner
straight in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   He needed only a two-word answer: ``Very confident.''

   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. _ Rain did what no team has been able to do
here at the Little League World Series: slow Toms River, N.J., on
its march toward a second straight championship.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. championship game between Toms River and Phenix City,
Ala., was suspended with the New Jersey team leading by 2-0 in the
top of the second inning. It will resume at 11 a.m. Friday, with a
Toms River runner on first base and no one out.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Friday's game will face Osaka, Japan, in
Saturday's championship game. The Japanese team won the
international championship over Yabucoa, P.R., Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor, the Toms River star who has pitched five shutouts
in regional and World Series play over the last two weeks, did not
start Thursday night. Manager Mike Gaynor, Casey's father, started
Zack Del Vento instead, then removed him after he walked Phenix
City's first batter and replaced him with Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Zack was throwing well, we would have kept him in there,''
Mike Gaynor said after the game had been called. ``But Zack just
wasn't throwing well all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might have been playing mind games with the Alabama
team by making the sudden switch, Gaynor said, ``Yeah, that may
have had something to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Gaynor, who shut out Phenix City, 6-0, last Sunday, was
expected to be the pitcher when Thursday night's game resumed on
Friday. Under Little League post-season rules, a player can pitch
on consecutive days if he pitches only one inning on the first day.
</P>
<P>
   The skies that had been threatening for two days finally opened
up about half an hour before Thursday night's game. Playing in a
steady drizzle, Toms River scored two runs in the top of the first
inning, capitalizing on two walks and two wild pitches by Colby
Rasmus, Phenix City's best pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmus, who gave up the six runs to Toms River last Sunday,
walked the leadoff batter, Eric Campesi, who advanced to third on
consecutive wild pitches. Campesi then scored on a sacrifice by
Casey Gaynor. Rasmus also walked Jeff Burgdorff, who eventually
stole home to make the score 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   In the international championship, Japan avenged an earlier loss
by pounding Puerto Rico, 12-2. The team from Osaka is the second
straight Japanese team to win the international championship. Last
year Kashima reached the title game and lost to Toms River, 12-9.
</P>
<P>
   Osaka's victory came two days after it lost to Yabucoa, 3-1.
Thursday the Japanese team jumped all over the Puerto Rican team,
scoring seven runs on six hits in the first inning. And Japan did
its damage with two out, thanks to an error by the Puerto Rico
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   The outburst allowed the Japanese team to remove its best
pitcher, Kazuki Sumiyama, after he had faced only three batters.
That should make Sumiyama available Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After having two outs with no one on base, then giving up
seven runs, that took a lot out of the team,'' said Puerto Rico
manager Edwin Carrasquillo.

DRUG FIRM MAKES OFFER TO SETTLE NORPLANT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 7th and 8th grafs, bgng When Norplant... .)  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several years of litigation, American Home Products Corp.
said Thursday that it had agreed to pay cash settlements to 36,000
women who contended they were not adequately warned about the
possible side effects of the company's Norplant contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the settlement, American Home Products is
expected to pay out between $50 million and $75 million, according
to Turner Branch, one of the lead attorneys for the plaintiffs.
Women who choose to settle their lawsuits will receive $1,500 each,
far from the jackpot attorneys had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total disappointment,'' Branch said. ``But we didn't
get good results in jury trials in South Texas. I'm definitely not
jumping with excitement, but the settlement is voluntary. The women
can take it or not take it.''
</P>
<P>
   A settlement of any kind marked a strong reversal of strategy
for American Home Products and its subsidiary, Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories, which still sells Norplant. The device, six silicone
capsules injected into a patient's arm, can prevent pregnancy for
up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Women who used the contraceptive had long complained that
Norplant's label did not adequately warn about severe side effects
like excessive menstrual bleeding, headaches, nausea, dizziness,
mood swings and depression.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products had vehemently denied these contentions,
arguing that the side effects associated with Norplant were clearly
described on in its label. The company had been successful in its
defense of the contraceptive, winning three jury verdicts and 20
summary judgments and having 14,000 claims dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   When Norplant went on the market in 1991, it was hailed as a
``dream contraceptive,'' a breakthrough for women who could have a
simple, 10-minute insertion procedure and then not worry about
getting pregnant for five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the drug soon became the subject of controversy and
complaints. Many women said they had not been warned of the
severity of side effects caused by the changes Norplant made in
their hormone levels. And some women said the silicone used in the
Norplant inserts had caused scarring and pain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy surrounding Norplant, American Home
Products said Thursday that it had been used by more than 1 million
women in the United States and by nearly 5 million women worldwide.
According to the Associated Press, annual U.S. sales peaked in 1992
at $120.7 million but slid to $4.4 million through November 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Thursday that American Home Products had offered
to settle the Norplant claims to improve its image and allow the
company to focus on its troubled operations. Over the last two
years, American Home Products has withdrawn three products from the
market, including the diet treatment fen-phen, and experienced
steep sales declines in its agricultural division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Settling these cases was purely a business decision,'' Joseph
Mahady, Wyeth-Ayerst's president for North America, said Thursday
in a statement. ``Our legal success has come at a steep price
because lawsuits are time- consuming, expensive and have a chilling
effect on research.''
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products has been no stranger to litigation. Its
liabilities over claims that fen-phen caused heart-valve damage
could exceed $3 billion. While analysts have been concerned over
those liabilities, many were relieved over the likely amount of the
Norplant settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If American Home Products pays only $50 million to $75
million, that is a low sum,'' said Sergio Traversa, a
pharmaceuticals analyst with Mehta Partners, a research company in
New York. ``But for consumers to collect millions of dollars, they
have to prove permanent damages. Most of the side effects the
Norplant users complained about went away once they had it
removed.''
</P>
<P>
   Women who filed lawsuits about Norplant before March 1 can
participate in the settlement, according to an American Home
Products spokeswoman. Lawsuits that are not settled through the
agreement will proceed through the courts. American Home Products
said in a statement Thursday that any remaining Norplant lawsuits
would be defended aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., has come to be
regarded as one of the pharmaceutical industry's financial
laggards. With earnings last year of $2.47 billion, the company can
certainly afford to pay for the Norplant settlement, but its
performance has trailed many of its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings at most large pharmaceutical companies are expected to
swell 12 percent or more this year. American Home Products'
earnings will most likely decline, giving it one of the industry's
worst performances. Shares of American Home Products fell $1.8125
Thursday, or 3.8 percent, to $46.

 1990 CENSUS MISSED AT LEAST 2 MILLION CHILDREN, STUDY FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., La., Miss., Texas, R.I., Neb., Calif., Conn., N.Y., (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The census of 1990 overlooked more than 2 million
children, many of them poor and in need of government help, in an
undercount that has cost communities and states billions of dollars
in federal aid, a foundation said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Annie E. Casey Foundation of Baltimore, said a
study by its Kids Count Project found that Florida, Louisiana,
Mississippi and Texas had the highest percentage of children who
were not counted: 4.5 percent in each state. Many were from
minority families, the report said. Rhode Island, with 1 percent,
had the lowest rate of children who were not counted.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the census missed 3.2 percent of the country's
children, defined for purposes of the study as people 17 and
younger. Children who were not counted made up more than half of
all those whom the census missed, estimated by the Census Bureau at
4 million people in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impact on kids of this woefully inadequate count is just
very, very significant,'' said a Census Bureau official, who asked
not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   He said the study by the Casey Foundation, a private charity
dedicating to helping children, was based on and supported by
Census Bureau data.
</P>
<P>
   It has been acknowledged for years that the 1990 census (like
those before it) missed many people, and some demographers have
said the 1990 census was actually less accurate than the 1980
count. It has long been known, too, that children made up a
disproportionate percentage of those who were missed.
</P>
<P>
   What was new about the Casey Foundation report was its
state-by-state breakdown regarding the undercount of children. The
report, written by Dr. William O'Hare, a demographer who has study
population trends for years, also provided figures and percentages
for uncounted children in the country's 100 largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``When children are not counted accurately, we don't get a true
picture of our nation, and communities are robbed of their rightful
share of public funds,'' O'Hare wrote. Without being specific, he
urged the Census Bureau to do everything it could to get a better
count of children in the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid, education funds and other forms of federal aid depend
on census results, as do plans for school construction and other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Hare saw a more basic reason for concern. Noting the link
between poverty and the chance of being missed in the census, he
said, ``The places where we need the best data on children are
often the places where we have the worst data.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, 7 percent of America's black children are
believed to have been missed in the 1990 census. So were 5 percent
of Hispanic children and nearly 14 percent of American Indian
children living on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The foundation calculated that 76,579 children were missed in
New York City in the 1990 census, or 4.3 percent of the total
number of children. The study ranked New York 42nd in terms of
uncounted children.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, Neb., was most accurate among the 100 biggest cities in
counting children (missing 648, or 1.4 percent), while Oakland,
Calif., was least accurate (missing 8,717, or 8.6 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut ranked 9th among states in accuracy, missing 13,055
children, or 1.7 percent of its childhood population, the
foundation said. New Jersey ranked 14th (34,177, or 1.9 percent
uncounted), while New York was 22nd, with 113,486, or 2.6 percent
of its childhood population, uncounted.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The methods to be used in the next census have been bitterly
debated on Capitol Hill and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau had wanted to use statistical sampling to
adjust for undercounting, a procedure that many political observers
have said would help Democrats (and hurt Republicans) during the
reapportionment of seats in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in January, however, that the
traditional head-count method, without sampling, must be used to
apportion House seats.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said sampling could be used to adjust the census
figures for other purposes, like the distribution of federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hare said that if the 2000 census is conducted like its
predecessors, its results will probably be worse.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of ``junk mail'' will cause some people to
ignore or throw out their census forms, he said, as will greater
distrust of government in general.

DAVIS CREATES PANEL TO STUDY HATE GROUPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Two weeks after a racially motivated shooting
rampage left one person dead and five others wounded, Gov. Gray
Davis created a panel to study hate groups, as he prepared to sign
two new gun control laws today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate groups that preach intolerance and transform their venom
into violence are a threat to civilized society,'' Davis said
Thursday. ``The proliferation of these groups, especially those
with paramilitary intentions, strikes at the heart of this state's
ideals.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. George Deukmejian and former U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will serve as co-chairmen of the committee, with
other members to be announced in the coming weeks, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will review current and potential laws relating to
hate groups and paramilitary organizations operating in California.
</P>
<P>
   That announcement came as the Governor's Office said he will
sign into law a measure seeking to ban the production and sale of
cheap weapons known as Saturday night specials. The ceremony will
be held at the Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in the Mission
Hills community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, which served
as the primary treatment center for the victims of the Aug. 10
shootings, for which self-proclaimed white supremacist Buford
O'Neal Furrow Jr. is charged.
</P>
<P>
   The governor will sign a measure authored by Sen. Richard
Polanco, D-Los Angeles, prohibiting the manufacture or sale in
California of any handgun that does not meet minimum safety
standards, including firing tests and drop tests to ensure it does
not accidentally fire.
</P>
<P>
   The law will take effect Jan. 1, 2001, and make it a misdemeanor
to sell or import an unsafe handgun. It will exempt certain guns,
including those sold between private parties or police agencies, as
well as those considered relics.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also will sign a bill today to require a trigger
lock or other safety device to accompany every firearm sold in the
state. The measure was co-authored by Assembly members Jack Scott,
D-Pasadena; Dion Aroner, D-Berkeley; and Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury has indicted Furrow for crimes in the
Valley rampage, which began with an attack that injured three
children, a teen-age counselor and a receptionist at the community
center in Granada Hills, followed by a Valley carjacking and the
killing of a letter carrier in Chatsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Furrow told them he shot and killed Postal
Service worker Joseph Ileto because he was not white and was a
federal employee.
</P>
<P>
   Furrow was a member of Aryan Nations and was married to a woman
whose former husband was founder of another supremacist group known
as The Order.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said such groups represent a threat to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``This danger is most critical when such hate groups actually
act out or incite others to act out their hatred with violence on
ethnic minorities, racial or religious groups,'' the Democratic
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Deukmejian, a Republican who served as governor for eight years,
practices law in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher was the first secretary of state for President Bill
Clinton and is best known in Los Angeles for heading the
Christopher Commission that examined the Los Angeles Police
Department after the beating of Rodney King.
</P>
<P>
   A third committee member is Kathleen Sullivan, dean of the
Stanford University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Davis announced the state has
established an Internet site for the Department of Fair Employment
and Housing to accept complaints of discrimination in employment,
housing or public accommodations

`GENE EXPRESSION CHIP' REVEALS GENETIC PATTERN IN AGING OF MICE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(TIGHTENS lede; ADDS percentage to 9th graf to conform.)  (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Biologists, using a new device that lends deep insight into the
nature of aging at the cellular level, have found that putting mice
on a diet can prevent many of the cellular changes associated with
aging.
</P>
<P>
   The research supports the longstanding idea that a
semi-starvation diet prolongs life in mice, and maybe people, but
its wider significance is that the chip offers for the first time a
way to measure aging at the cellular level. Similar chips should
help to test whether present anti-aging remedies do any good and to
screen for better drugs, including perhaps ones that might give the
same effect as low calorie diets but without the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we understood how caloric restriction works we might be
able someday to elicit its benefits without having to undergo the
dietary restriction, so in that sense this is a very important
study,'' said Dr. Leonard Guarente, an expert on aging at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The new research, reported in Friday's issue of Science, builds
on the view held by many biologists that aging is not an inexorable
process but rather the outcome of a genetic program that could be
manipulated. It also gives comfort those who argue that a
manageably small number of genes are involved.
</P>

   The study, by Dr. Richard Weindruch, Dr. Tomas Prolla and
colleagues at the University of Wisconsin, depends on injecting
mouse muscle samples into a special chip, about the size of a
business card but roughly a 1/4 of an inch thick. Made by
Affymetrix of Santa Clara, Calif., the chip was was programmed to
recognize the activity of some 6,000 mouse genes. Mice probably
have about 100,000 different genes, and the 6,000 were those whose
DNA sequence had already been decoded and filed in public data
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch is known for his studies of caloric restriction in
mice and he has in progress a long term study with rhesus monkeys
to see if their life span can be extended by a low calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, Weindruch and Prolla looked first at the
muscles of elderly mice fed a normal mouse diet and then at mice of
the same age who had been on a diet restricted in calories. They
examined the animals' calf muscles because muscle, along with brain
and heart, is one of the tissues not renewed during life and often
are the first to show signs of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Providing the first broad snapshot of how gene activity changes
in the aging cell, the Affymetrix chip shows that in elderly mice
fed a normal diet, most of the cell's genes continue as usual. But
1 percent of the genes _ those involved in responding to stress and
to nerve damage _ become very much more active. Another 1 percent,
genes involved in generating energy from glucose, become very much
less active.
</P>
<P>
   In mice fed a diet consisting of 25 percent fewer calories than
nor- mal, the researchers report, most of these changes were
prevented, giving the cells a profile similar to those of much
younger cells. But cells from the mice on restricted diets had
their own pattern of changes, notably decreased activity by genes
that repair damaged DNA and proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Weindruch and Prolla believe most of these changes can be
explained in terms of the chemical damage caused by glucose
metabolism. The process of combining glucose with oxygen creates
harmful chemicals known as free radicals that damage many
structures in the cell, particularly the energy-generating units
known as mitochondria.
</P>
<P>
   The gene expression chip, they believe, will allow them to
pinpoint the genetic changes that underlie aging in human tissues.
``The technique allows us to measure the aging process at the
molecular level. Now for the first time we have molecular
biomarkers of aging,'' Prolla said, referring to the characteristic
patterns of gene expression revealed by the Affymetrix chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our goal to test a patient's biological age from a drop
of blood,'' Weindruch said.

   Affymetrix has already produced chips programmed to detect the
activity of human genes. The Wisconsin researchers also hope to
apply the human chip to their monkey study. It would otherwise take
another 20 years to see if the monkeys were in fact living longer
on their restricted calorie diet. But by testing whether caloric
restriction is preventing the cellular changes typical of aging,
the biologists may arrive at the answer much sooner. Monkey genes
are sufficiently similar to human genes that the human chip will
provide meaningful answers, they hope.
</P>
<P>
   Although the technology of making the chips belongs to
Affymetrix, the Wisconsin researchers have applied for patents on
using the pattern of gene activity levels as a measure of aging.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven Austad, an expert on aging at the University of
Oregon, said their work was ``fascinating as a new way to approach
aging'' but cautioned they had so far looked at a single tissue in
one strain of laboratory mice.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers have recently made progress in understanding
the cellular mechanism that limits the number of times a cell can
divide. The limiting mechanism, known as the telomere system, may
affect the durability of tissues that are constantly renewed
throughout life, like skin, white blood cells and intestinal lining
cells.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists do not yet know which kind of tissue _ the
nonrenewable ones like the muscle studied by the Wisconsin
researchers or the renewable ones governed by the telomere system _
is the first to break down in natural aging. Guarente said he
believed that serious intervention would be needed in both cases to
affect life span as a whole. ``You would need not one magic bullet
but a series of magic bullets,'' he speculated.
</P>
<P>
   In animals like the laboratory roundworm, a single ``magic
bullet'' _ the alteration of particular genes _ has been found to
make the worms live up to six times as long as usual. Unlike
people, the worms consist wholly of nonrenewable tissues. Most of
the longevity-promoting genes in the worm seem to be involved in
the energy-producing activities controlled by insulin, or at least
the worm's counterpart of this ancient hormone.
</P>
<P>
   Prolla and Weindruch say caloric restriction also seems to work
through effects on the energy-production systems controlled by
insulin. ``Our data fit with the current view that the
insulin-signaling pathway plays a major role in aging,'' Prolla
said.
