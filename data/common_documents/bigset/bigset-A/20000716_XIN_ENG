<HEADLINE> WB Warns of Global AIDS Catastrophe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS pandemic, if not
curbed, would cause a "catastrophe of an unimaginable scale" and
bring economies to a standstill, the World Bank said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As much as we focus on Africa, which is the global epicenter
of the epidemic, we are equally concerned about the growing
epidemics in Asia and eastern Europe, as well as in Latin America -
-especially the Caribbean," the World Bank said in a paper
presented to the 13th International AIDS Conference in Durban,
South Africa, which ended on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"These regions have been spared the worst so far, but could
easily see the epidemic repeat what it has done and continues to
do in Africa," the bank said, noting that "given the large
population of Asia, that would represent catastrophe of an
unimaginable scale."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimated that out of a total of 34.3
million AIDS sufferers across the world, east Asia and the Pacific
region (excluding Australia and New Zealand) has 530,000 while
south and southeast Asia has 5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
"Throughout Africa, the epidemic has literally put the future
at stake," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
UNAIDS estimated that there are 24.5 million AIDS sufferers in
sub-Saharan Africa and the World Bank has set aside 500 million U.
S. dollars for AIDS programs in the region.
</P>
<P>
"AIDS already represents the foremost threat to development in
Africa, and an ominous threat in much of the rest of the
developing world. Until the world has credibly addressed the
epidemic, we cannot regard anything else we do in development as
secure," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
It said that AIDS is hitting labor forces in public and private
sectors, eroding productivity, raising the cost of doing business,
deterring investment, depleting an already scarce supply of
qualified managers and policy-makers, making a "severe impact" on
health and education and depriving the poor of chances to improve
their lives.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Seals off Pipeline Fire Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has barred
any entry into the scene of Monday's oil pipeline fire at Adeje
village near the town of Warri in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger Delta
region, media here reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The decision, according to Environment Minister of State Ime
Okopido, was taken to avert another explosion because the air was
still pregnant with petrol fumes.
</P>
<P>
Okopido, who led a Federal Government team to the scene on
Thursday, directed security agencies in the state, the Pipelines
and Products Marketing Company and the local government to provide
an indefinite round-the-clock security in the area.
</P>
<P>
Defaulters of the order should be apprehended, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Governor James Ibori urged those wounded to come out
of hiding as the state government was providing free medical
treatment for the fire victims.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened on Monday when people were using buckets
to collect petrol flowing from the pipeline after it had been
punctured by thieves on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
About 300 people have been confirmed dead in the accident.

<HEADLINE> Rebels Keep Battling Government Troops in North Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Liberian rebels were still fighting
the government forces on Friday in the northern part of the
country, said Liberian Defense Minister Daniel Chea in the capital
Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
Chea accused the rebels, who he said numbered around 500, of
rampaging through villages in Lofa county on the Guinea-Liberian
border since they launched the cross-border attack on July 8,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Liberian President Charles Taylor had earlier denied that the
government forces had lost control of any towns, saying only "a
few individuals" had been lost.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough people in the Lofa area to deal with the
situation," Chea said, adding that the Liberian troops "have
managed to contain them (rebels) in the Voinjama corridor" near
Lofa county.
</P>
<P>
Chea expressed concern at the instability of Liberia's borders
with Guinea and Sierra Leone, which are all but impossible to
police because of the terrain.
</P>
<P>
Dissidents opposed to the Liberian president attacked twice in
the border area during 1999, causing a diplomatic standoff
between Liberia and Guinea.
</P>
<P>
Guinean President Lansana Conte has rejected suggestions that
his administration was in some way linked to the attack.
</P>
<P>
Chea called for support from both Guinea and Sierra Leone and
from the 16-strong Economic Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
According to the Liberian government, the current incursion was
being led by fighters loyal to faction leaders from the civil war,
Alhaji Kromah and Roosevelt Johnson, both now in exile.

<HEADLINE> S. African Ruling Party Set to Recruit Minorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The ruling African National
Congress (ANC) Saturday called for a massive recruitment drive to
draw the country's minority whites, coloreds and Indians into its
fold.
</P>
<P>
Delegates who attended the party's five-day national general
council in Port Elizabeth this week, debated, among other things,
ways to eradicate racism and build a united South Africa.
</P>
<P>
They resolved that the ANC's highest decision-making body
between national conferences, the national executive committee,
should develop a strategy to draw colored, Indians and whites into
the party.
</P>
<P>
"We must combat any form of ethnicity, narrow nationalism and
regionalism within our ranks," a council report said.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also urged the ANC Youth League to "continue to
reach out to the white youth, especially Afrikaner youth and
identify a common platform for youth mobilization and organization.
"
</P>
<P>
ANC national chairman Mosiuoa Lekota told reporters on Saturday
that "we recognize it is our responsibility to create a climate,
both inside and outside the ANC, which will make it conducive for
a greater number of white South Africans, to move not just closer
to the ANC, but into the ANC."
</P>
<P>
The ANC recognized that it has to set up its structures in, for
example, white suburbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if any section of the population wants to impact
decisively on the government policy, "they will not be able to do
that in some minority weak formations."
</P>
<P>
He was apparently referring to the new Democratic Alliance,
comprising the Democratic Party and the New National Party.
</P>
<P>
By joining the majority of black South Africans in the ANC,
whites and other minorities "can make effective contribution,
along side this majority, in shaping the direction this country
must take," Lekota said.
</P>
<P>
"The ANC is an instrument available to all sections of the
population of this country and we need to make it possible for
them to use the ANC to contribute to the transformation and the
building of the new South Africa," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Pulls Observers From South Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has pulled its
international observers out of four southern Iraqi governorates for
security reasons, George Somerwill, the U.N. spokesman for the oil-
for-food program in Iraq said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Somerwill did not elaborate but stressed that the withdrawal was
not triggered by any specific incident.
</P>
<P>
The pullout came less than three weeks after an armed Iraqi
opened fire at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) office
in Baghdad, killing two people and wounding seven.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawn U.N. observers include monitors of food
distribution under the oil-for-food program as well as those
affiliated with the Rome-based FAO and other U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
Somerwill said the monitoring in the south would be done by
local staff for the time being and the international staff would
continue their work in the central and northern parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 U.N. observers had worked in Iraq to monitor the
distribution of food, medicine and other humanitarian goods bought
under the oil-for-food program, which, effective in November 1996,
allows Iraq to sell oil every six months to buy humanitarian goods
for its 22 million people reeling under U.N.sanctions imposed for
Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Right-Wing Demonstrators Rally against Barak EDS-2nd lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of Israeli
right-wing demonstrators rallied Sunday evening at Rabin Square in
the center of Tel Aviv to protest against the ongoing Camp David
summit negotiating for an end to the half-century Arab-Israeli
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Organized by various settler's organizations and the opposition
Likud Party, the protestors also expressed opposition to the
government's intentions to withdraw from large areas of the
territories and dismantle some Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
"The peace that Prime Minister Ehud Barak is seeking is unjust
and that peace is not the peace we wanted," Likud Party leader
Ariel Sharon told the rally.
</P>
<P>
He accused Barak for conducting a dangerous peace talks at the
summit.
</P>
<P>
Sharon also called on all the participants and other Israelis to
join him to fight for personal and national interests.
</P>
<P>
The organizers hired more than 1,000 buses to transport the
protestors from all over Israel to the rally and expected over 100,
000 people to show up. But participants are in fact fewer than
expected.
</P>
<P>
Four Israeli buses were attacked by the Palestinians earlier
Sunday in the village of Kalandia, south of the West Bank city of
Ramallah, after the drivers who tried to arrive at Beit El
settlement to pick up settlers for the rally made a wrong turn.
</P>
<P>
The stunned drivers managed to make an escape, after their buses
were attacked by angry Palestinians equipped with sticks, clubs and
rocks. Three of the buses were burnt completely while another one
was semi-burnt, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The four drivers were evicted to Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem.
They were not injured, but suffered from shock and anxiety, doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, a middle-aged male settler from the West Bank, who
asked not to named, told Xinhua that he strongly opposes the
government's intention to transfer more territories to the
Palestinians, including the settlement where he lives.
</P>
<P>
"I do not care what kind of peace agreement Barak is to sign
with the Palestinians, but I will not move my family from the
settlement," the settler, who has five children, added.
</P>
<P>
A 13-year-old boy from Haifa, a coastal city in northern Israel,
said that he will not agree to give up more land to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled speakers at the rally also included representatives of
the settlements in the Golan Heights, the Jordan Valley and the
West Bank, Yisrael Ba'aliya leader Natan Sharansky, National
Religious Party leader Yitzhak Levy.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli right-wing political parties and settler's
organizations strongly oppose Barak's possible territorial
concessions to the Palestinians at the summit, which was called by
U.S. President Bill Clinton and also attended by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which started at the Camp David near Washington on
Tuesday, is aimed at solving the key issues such as Jerusalem,
borders, refugees, settlements and water, and reaching a framework
agreement on all these issues ahead of a September 13 deadline for
a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The organizers proclaimed that the rally would be "the mother of
all demonstrations" against the summit.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Deals Near: Israeli Website </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite conflicting media
reports, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators at Camp David in the
United States are close to reaching a peace agreement, Israel's
leading daily Ha'aretz reported on its website Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Palestinian delegation had
expressed optimism about the Camp David summit's outcome and had
said an agreement was near.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Amr, Palestinian National Authority's Parliament Affairs
Minister, was quoted by the report as saying that contrary to "
Israeli-spread rumors," which he claimed are intended for the
strengthening of Israeli stands, "things at Camp David are moving
along very seriously."
</P>
<P>
"The Palestinian side is making efforts (for the success of the
summit) and is showing the necessary flexibility," he added.
</P>
<P>
The report also quoted an American source as saying that since
it is obvious that the pace of the negotiations are growing, he
believed that a certain degree of progress in the talks had been
made during the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The three-way summit at Camp David, attended by U.S. President
Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, had entered into its sixth day Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The talks are aimed at resolving all thorny issues between
Israel and the Palestinians, such as the fate of Jerusalem, Jewish
settlements, Palestinian refugees, borders, security and water.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. media blackout has brought many different, even
conflicting, estimates on the summit's process.
</P>
<P>
The Ha'aretz reports are contradictory to several Israeli
ministers' earlier remarks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy said Sunday afternoon that
the negotiators in the summit were far from closing their gaps.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin also told Israel's Army
Radio that there is no room to be optimistic because there has not
been a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Minister in Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon also
denied that Israel had made compromises regarding Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem, which is the most intractable and
sensitive issue in the talks.
</P>
<P>
All three ministers had phone contacts with Barak during the
weekend. However, the Ha'aretz daily is famous for its exclusive
reports. In January, it revealed a bridge peace proposal made by
the United States to Israel and Syria, which was proved afterwards
authentic.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Increases in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of poor Zambians
increased from 69.2 percent of the total population in 1996 to 72.
3 percent in 1998, according to a paper presented to the 12th
Consultative Group meeting starting here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In their joint presentation, Economics Association of Zambia
and Zambia Congress of Trade Unions said that formal employment in
the country declined to 11 percent in 1998 from 17 percent of the
labor force in 1991; in other words, only about 465,000 out of
about 4.7 million people who were able and willing to work were
actually formally employed.
</P>
<P>
This unemployment was accentuated by company closures,
liquidations, downsizing and cross-border plant re-location, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The result has been massive brain drain involving all the
skilled grades. Others have entered the informal sector as petty
traders peddling all varieties of goods but working in an
environment that is increasingly hostile and dangerous, the paper
added.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that a civil servant earns an average gross
monthly salary of 45 U.S. dollars but the cost of a monthly
household food basket is currently estimated at 90 dollars.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Most Forest Fires in Greece Die Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Most of the forest fires that
scorched Greece over the past weeks have died down while only two
fires remain burning Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two fires, one in the western Peloponnese prefecture of
Achaia and the other farther to the east in Corinth prefecture,
have been partially extinguished, according to the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA).
</P>
<P>
More than 1,100 wildfires were reported across Greece since
the beginning of July and the government attributed the blazes to
both the high temperatures and arsons.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,000 firefighter and 6,000 soldiers, supported by
some 30 planes and more than 10 helicopters, have battled the
blazes for nearly two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Some 12,000 hectares of forest and farm lands have been
destroyed in the fires in which three people, including two Air
Force pilots died when their "Canadair" firefighting plane crashed
in central Greece Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 26,000 soldiers are patrolling the forests
throughout the country in order to spot any new outbreaks of fire
and a dust-to-dawn curfew is still in effect for forestlands.

<P>
Tel Aviv, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of Israeli
right-wing protestors rallied Sunday evening at Rabin Square in the
center of Tel Aviv to protest against the ongoing Camp David
summit.
</P>
<P>
Organized by various settler's organizations and the opposition
Likud Party, the protestors also expressed their opposition to the
government's intention to withdraw from large areas of the
territories and dismantle some Jewish settlements in the
territories.
</P>
<P>
The organizers hired more than 1,000 buses to transport the
protestors from all over Israel to the rally, and expected over
100,000 to show up. But participants are in fact less than the
expectations.
</P>
<P>
Scheduled speakers at the rally include representatives of the
settlements of the Golan Heights, the Jordan Valley and the West
Bank, Likud leader Ariel Sharon, Yisrael Ba'aliya leader Natan
Sharansky, National Religious Party leader Yitzhak Levy and others.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli right-wing political parties and settler's
organizations strongly oppose Prime Minister Ehud Barak's possible
territorial concessions to the Palestinians at the summit, which
was called by U.S. President Bill Clinton and also attended by
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which started at the Camp David near Washington on
Tuesday, is aimed at solving the key issues such as Jerusalem,
borders, refugees, settlements and water, and reaching a framework
agreement on all these issues ahead of a September deadline for a
final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The organizers proclaimed that the rally would be "the mother of
all demonstrations" against the summit.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The World Intellectual Property
Organization (WIPO) is keen on cooperating with Egypt in
strengthening the country's infrastructure to protect the rights of
inventors and secure patents, WIPO chief said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
WIPO will also embark on projects aimed at creating a new
framework for preservation of Egypt's cultural heritage and
antiquities, WIPO Director-General Kamil Idris said after meeting

consolidating the foundation of intellectual property rights (IPRs)
in Egypt.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Zimbabwe's New Cabinet Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Zhu Shixiang
</P>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Most Zimbabweans Sunday expressed
their welcome over the new cabinet appointed by President Robert
Mugabe on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe announced a 19-member cabinet which saw 16 ministers
being left out. A number of respected personalities were appointed
cabinet ministers in the new line-up.
</P>
<P>
The new ministers came only from the ruling Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) led by Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
In the parliamentary election on June 24 and 25, ZANU-PF got 62
seats with a narrow victory while the country's largest opposition
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) won 57 seats.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Sunday, MDC President Morgan Tsvangirai welcomed
the new cabinet, saying it is full of technocrats and respectable
personalities unlike the previous one which mostly consisted of
Mugabe's praise-singers.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the exclusion of the MDC, he said his party never
expected to be included in the new cabinet because Mugabe had said
he would not include any MDC member in his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
MDC needs at least five years to prove itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some members of the business community also welcomed the
cabinet which included well-known faces in the business circle.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Nhlanhla
Masuku said the line-up is encouraging, but what matters is that
the new cabinet should deliver.
</P>
<P>
"The people demand action and the implementation of policies
that would rescue the economy and benefit all and not just certain
sections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, political scientist of University of Zimbabwe John
Makumbe said Mugabe's new cabinet is a welcome development for the
country's future.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet which saw several ZANU-PF stalwarts being dropped
and new faces being included in the line-up is clearly based on
merit, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the eyes of ordinary people in Harare, Mugabe has instilled
confidence to the nation.
</P>
<P>
It is good for the nation that some former cabinet ministers
who had been implicated in corruption activities were left out of
the cabinet, said street cleaner Jacob Banda.
</P>
<P>
He said although the appointment of the new cabinet is not a
guarantee that the nation's economic hardships would end, the
president had honored calls by Zimbabweans that new blood should
be injected in the government.
</P>
<P>
"Many people had lost hope of ever improving their lifestyles
but with the new cabinet in place, there is hope that ahead of the
tunnel there could be light," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jethro Mpofu, a student of University of Zimbabwe, said he had
confidence in the new cabinet which he described as made up of "
professional and intelligent" people.
</P>
<P>
"There are competent people there and I feel this is the best
cabinet line-up to emerge since independence," he said.
</P>
<P>
But residents of Bulawayo, the country's second largest city,
expressed mixed feelings over the new cabinet, which some people
described as "very professional" and some described as
disappointed. Still others said "their main worry is the unity of
the country."

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Talks Resume to Pave Way for Final Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The new round of Burundi
peace talks resumed on Sunday with two committees, one on peace
and security and another on implementation and guarantees, in
Tanzania's northern town of Arusha to discuss pending issues to
pave the way for a final peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the decisive peace and security committee is
expected to be attended by Jean Bosco Ndayikengurukiye, leader of
the splinter Hutu rebel group of the CNDD-FDD (the National
Council for the Defense of Democracy - Forces for the Defense of
Democracy), who had all along stayed out of the Arusha
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Another major rebel group, the PALIPEHUTU-FNL (the Hutu People'
s Liberation Party - the National Liberation Force), is also
expected to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The peace facilitator, former South African President Nelson
Mandela, is scheduled to arrive in Arusha on Wednesday to lead the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the talks said that state leaders of Uganda,
South Africa, Burundi, Rwanda, Ethiopia, the Democratic Republic
of the Congo, Kenya, Zambia and host Tanzania have been invited to
the talks and Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim of the
Organization of African Unity will join them.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued on Sunday by the Nelson Mandela
Foundation based in Johannesburg, South Africa, a peace agreement
aimed at ending the seven-year old conflict in Burundi is expected
to be signed on August 28.
</P>
<P>
Mandela will ensure that the parties confirm their previous
pledge to endorse the comprehensive peace agreement, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
About 200,000 people, most of them civilians, have lost their
lives since the outbreak of war in the tiny central African
republic in 1993 between Hutu rebels and the army dominated by the
minority Tutsi ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks, which began in Arusha in June 1998, are
currently taking place in four committees, dealing respectively
with the nature of the Burundi conflict, democracy and good
governance, peace and security for all and economic reconstruction
and the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, peace negotiators still remain divided on a number of
crucial points, notably the arrangement for a cease-fire;
restructuring of the Tutsi-dominated army, including integration
of Hutu rebels; whether or not foreign peacekeepers will be needed;
amnesty for certain crimes of the past; and who will lead the
transition government.

<HEADLINE> Scientist: School Meals May Have Spread CJD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 16 (Xinhua) - The scientist in charge of research
into the human form of mad cow disease has suggested baby food and
school meals may have been a major source of infection.
</P>
<P>
The BBC quoted Robert Will, director of the government's CJD
surveillance as saying "meat processing methods in the 1980s may
have led to contaminated beef ending up on children's plates."
</P>
<P>
His comments came as scientists investigating the deaths from
variant CJD of three people who had links with Queniborough,
England, are working to pinpoint the source of infected meat the
victims may have eaten 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Although the incubation period of the disease is normally 10
years, the youngest two victims first showed symptoms at the age
of 14 and many others were also teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Will said one explanation could be that baby food and school
dinners in the 1980s contained mechanically extracted meat -
leftovers from the carcass which were removed using high powered
water jets and then ground up and used in cheap food products.

<HEADLINE> Khatami's Visit a New Chapter in Ties with Germany: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here Sunday that President Mohammad Khatami's visit
to Germany on July 10-12 has opened a new chapter in Tehran-Berlin
relations. Kharrazi told the state-run IRNA news agency
that the door is now open for any kind of cooperation between Iran
and Germany in economic, political and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
Despite anti-Iran elements' opposition to the visit, German
statesmen, party leaders and outstanding personalities welcomed it
and made extensive arrangements for a positive atmosphere, Kharrazi
said, adding that all this indicated German government's firm will
to improve relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister pointed out that joint-venture projects,
cooperation in third countries, international cooperation in the
fields of disarmament, anti-narcotics campaign, environment
protection and exchange of views on regional issues are among the
positive areas of cooperation between Iran and Germany.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that expanded Tehran-Berlin relations
would have a positive impact on Iran's ties with the European
Union, as Germany is an influential member of the club.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said Germany has the potential to become Iran's largest
trading partner again after Khatami's landmark visit, the first by
an Iranian president since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Germany had been Iran's largest trading partner, but it was
replaced by Italy in recent years due to strains in Tehran-Berlin
ties after a German court ruled in 1997 that Iranian government had
been involved in an assassination of exiled Iranian dissidents in
Germany.

<HEADLINE> Indian Troops to Continue Peacekeeping Mission in Sierra Leone: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A day after the evacuation of
221 trapped Indian peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, Indian External
Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh on Sunday categorically ruled out
any possibility that New Delhi would pull out its troops from the
United Nations peacekeeping operations in that west African
country.
</P>
<P>
"Of course we are continuing," Singh told reporters here at a
press conference while asked whether India would have a rethink on
persisting with its troops in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Indian peacekeepers, who had been kept in captivity for 10
weeks by Sierra Leone's Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels,
were evacuated on Saturday through a successful military operation
by the UN force.
</P>
<P>
"Our resolve to contribute to UN operations is not diluted in
any manner," said Singh, adding that difficult situation had been
faced in the past by Indian troops as part of UN peacekeeping
missions but this had not acted as a "deterrent."
</P>
<P>
Singh, along with India's Director General of Military
Operations Lieutenant General N C Vij, also briefed the press on
Saturday's UN evacuation mission.
</P>
<P>
Two Indian para commandos sustained shrapnel injuries and were
immediately evacuated, while the RUF rebels, who put up stiff
resistance, suffered a number of casualties, said Vij.
</P>
<P>
Indian troops seized one medium machine gun, eight light
machine guns, seven rocket launchers and one truck load of
ammunition abandoned by the RUF, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As part of the effective air operations, Indian attack
helicopters destroyed three RUF vehicles carrying their
reinforcements, he added.

turnover of recreational goods, 3-4 percent improvement in retail
business of optical goods and books, supermarkets and
telecommunications and computers and marginally 0.1 percent growth
in sale of motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Conversely, turnover of food and beverages and furniture and
household equipment fell by 2.9 percent and 2.0 percent
respectively in May 2000 over the previous month while retailers
of wearing apparel and footwear encountered a slight decline of 0.
6 percent in their earnings in the month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the total value of catering trade in May 2000 was
estimated at 286 million Singapore dollars (about 164 million U.S.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Rwandan President Paul
Kagame has challenged the Kenyan business community to exploit the
high economic potential of his country by investing there.
</P>
<P>
Kagame said on Saturday night that Rwanda needs outside
partners in its reconstruction efforts, according to a news
release issued by Kenya's Presidential Press Service on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has been identified as having the capacity to help in
that reconstruction, said the president.
</P>
<P>
He also assured investors of a conducive environment, noting
that his government has greatly improved security in that country
since the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
It was imperative for African countries to merge in economic
blocs so as to cushion themselves against the effects of
globalization, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda was keen on joining the East African Community, which
groups Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda currently, Kagame added.
</P>
<P>
Kagame arrived in Kenya for a two-day official visit on Friday
morning and had a lengthy meeting with Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi on bilateral relations and regional affairs.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia, U.S. to Negotiate Open Sky Deal: Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Ethiopian and the
United States civil aviation authorities will meet at the end of
this month to negotiate on an open sky sales agreement, local
Fortune weekly reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A 12-member delegation representing the U.S. government and
aviation industry is due to arrive in Addis Ababa on July 31.
</P>
<P>
During a three-day visit, the U.S. delegation will have talks
with its Ethiopian counterpart over signing an agreement which
allows the two countries to let each other's airlines fly in their
respective territories without restrictions and limitations, the
weekly said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Airlines commercial flights to the United States,
which started in 1998, are still conducted on the basis of
temporary permits, the airline officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, the forthcoming U.S.
delegation would like to sign the open sky agreement with Ethiopia.
But Ethiopia's stand over the issue is not clear yet.
</P>
<P>
"The answer (to open sky agreement) is yes and no, " Daniel
Hailu, economic planning and international affairs head of the
Ethiopian Airlines, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Daniel said yes because the agreement is to make Ethiopian
Airlines keep pace with the rapidly growing liberalized aviation
industry.
</P>
<P>
He said no because the airline is concerned about jumping into
a slugfest with some of the world's heavyweight airline companies.
</P>
<P>
"We are in principle receptive of the open market sales,"
Daniel said,"but we would like to see it grow steadily and slowly.
"
</P>
<P>
He said what his airline concerns about include unfair
competition and costing sharing arrangements between partners
airlines that may disadvantage smaller airlines.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has so far signed similar agreements with
such African countries as Ghana and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the U.S. delegation will conduct similar
negotiations with Kenyan Civil Aviation and Kenya Airways before
it comes to Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Economy Shows Signs of Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine's economy has showed signs of
recovery in the first half of this year, with the gross domestic
product (GDP) and the gross industrial output value jumping 5
percent and 10.8 percent respectively from the year-ago levels,
the latest figures released by the Statistics Office show.
</P>
<P>
During the period, direct foreign investment and domestic
investment in the country's infrastructure rose by 50 percent and
21 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Victor Yushchenko cited these figures as the
greatest achievements of his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's GDP has decreased continuously since the country
declared independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country reported a 4.3 percent growth in the
gross industrial output value. However, the GDP still dropped by 0.
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the latest good performance to some
stimulative measures taken by the government, which include
accelerating the privatization process, a reform of the energy
sector and a new financial policy to encourage investment.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they warned that there remain a number of
negative factors hindering the economic recovery. Among them are
an estimated inflation rate of 18.5 percent for 2000 and a present
4.29 percent unemployment rate, they said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Parliament Amends Electoral Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's parliament on Sunday approved
amendments to an electoral law passed in 1956 in a bid to ensure
that parliamentary elections will be monitored by members of the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The People's Assembly, under speaker Ahmed Fathi Sorour,
endorsed the amendments outlined in a republican decree issued by
President Hosni Mubarak last Wednesday, the country's official
Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The modifications followed a July 8 ruling by the Supreme
Constitutional Court that the 1956 law was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Under Egypt's 1971 constitution, all the polling stations for
parliamentary elections must be supervised by members of the
judiciary. But the 1956 law allowed civil servants to oversee
smaller booths while demanding the principal stations be monitored
by members of the judiciary. The country's opposition parties have
long been charging that the government had relentlessly rigged
parliamentary elections and calling for changes.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak called last Wednesday for emergency meetings of the
People's Assembly and the Shura (Consultative) Council to amend the
1956 law for members of the judiciary to exercise full supervision
of parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The Shura Council, which has no legislative powers, endorsed the
amendments on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is expected to hold parliamentary elections in November.
Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Kamal El-Shazli has
said that Egypt has less than 10,000 members of the judiciary, and
the polling stations will amount to 42,000.
</P>
<P>
The country's last parliamentary elections were in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Medicine Becomes Focus of International Symposium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A number of traditional Tibetan
medicine doctors in Tibet and from neighboring Qinghai and Sichuan
provinces sat for the first time in their lives side by side with
hundreds of medical experts from all over the world at the 2000
International Symposium on Tibetan Medicine, which opened in this
capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kradus, a Tibetan who offers medical treatment to farmers and
herdsmen and has gathered medicinal herbs in the mountains for
many years, arrived at the conference hall ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, he said that the 2,000-year-old
Tibetan medicine was developed by the Tibetan people in their long
struggle for survival. However, the main books of Tibetan medicine
were kept in monasteries, and local doctors seldom exchanged the
secret recipes handed down from their ancestors.
</P>
<P>
"The current international symposium provides us with a rare
opportunity to broaden our vision and learn from the experiences
of other parts of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizing committee, 500 papers on Tibetan
medicine will be read at the three-day symposium, the first one
ever held in the homeland of Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
Byamba Chilai, an authority on Tibetan medicine, said in his
report that some medical works describe the occurrence of disease
as the role played by ghosts and monsters. He said this is
unscientific and traditional Tibetan medicine should be combined
with modern medical science, and folk Tibetan doctors should seek
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Solaun Com, a Tibetan doctor who has been working in a rural
area of Damxung County in Tibet for many years, said, "Though we
don't have the advanced equipment and good medical conditions
enjoyed by hospitals practicing Western medicine, the unique way
of treatment and naturally grown medicine are able to cure the
chronic and difficult diseases which Western medicine can not deal
with."
</P>
<P>
To date, thousands of Tibetan doctors offer medical treatment
in Tibet and in the areas inhabited by Tibetans in neighboring
Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. Tibetan hospitals have also been
set up in Nepal, Russia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Denis Doubrovine, a professor at the Russian State Medical
University, said, "Many people in Russia claim to know Tibetan
medicine. But in my view only those who have read Tibetan medical
books and consulted Tibetan doctors are trustworthy."
</P>
<P>
Cuo Ru Ci Lang, a Tibetan lama, and also a doctor, who has
given lectures in Britain, Hungary and Japan, said, "I believe
that Tibetan medicine will earn great prestige worldwide and
better serve the people of all countries."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here Saturday that the country should improve its national defense
while developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
Visiting a defense industry exhibition, Zhu urged that a
vigorous system be created to develop military science, and
nationwide cooperation be expanded in this regard by adhering to
the principle of self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed that the defense industry should be
combined with the civilian sector, and their cooperation should be
market-oriented.
</P>
<P>
He noted that many military plants are suffering losses due to
the dogma of the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
The defense industry should develop technologies and products
that can be accepted by both military and civilian markets, he
said, adding that different research institutes and sectors should
combine their strengths.
</P>
<P>
In addition, those civilian enterprises that produce military
products should take this mission as their priority, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also visited the exhibition on the
cooperative results achieved in the defense industry.

CHONGQING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The highest Yangtze River crest
this flood season arrived at this municipality on the upper
reaches of China's longest river today.
</P>
<P>
The municipal Hydrometeorological Forecasting Center in western
China said that the crest arrived at 8:00 this morning. The
Jialing River, a tributary of the Yangtze, has risen 16 m since
July 13 (Thursday), over the danger level.
</P>
<P>
Non-stop downpours since last Thursday have pushed the river
sections near Chongqing over the danger line for the first time
this summer.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a marketplace in the low-lying area in the city is
under relocation and small barges have been ordered to suspend
operations on the river. The municipal port administration has
increased its patrols on the river in case of navigation dangers.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China held a cultural activity
today at the Badaling section of the Great Wall near here to
accelerate international cultural exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The activity, which is expected to last one month, will invite
troupes from Russia, Japan and Kazakstan to give performances, and
Chinese troupes will perform dragon dances, lion dances and music
of the minority ethnic groups in China, said the organizers.
</P>
<P>
Art troupes will also display how warriors in ancient times
defended the wall against invaders at Badaling.
</P>
<P>
Experts on the protection of the world's cultural heritage will
meet during the period as well to discuss how to protect, exploit
and develop the world's cultural heritage, such as the Egyptian
Pyramids, the Taj Mahal mausoleum and the Potala Palace in China's
Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Badaling, since its opening to visitors in 1952, has received
some 120 million visitors, with some 670,000 tourists to the
scenic spot during the seven-day Labor Day holidays this year

<TEXT>
<P>
LASHA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Wearing religious cassocks and using
needles instead of surgical knives, Tibetan lamas are working as
doctors on the "roof of the world".
</P>
<P>
Dainzin Wangie is one of them.
</P>
<P>
"There is no sign that the tradition will disappear in Tibet,"
says the Living Buddha, founder of the first Tibetan hospital in
Ali Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is different from any modern medical practice.
It uses plants, animal bones, metals and stones to cure diseases,
and to scientists' astonishment, it is extremely effective.
</P>
<P>
No modern theory can explain the phenomenon, and this is why
the international community is holding a seminar in this capital
of the Tibet Autonomous Region to discuss Tibetan medicine's past,
present and future.
</P>
<P>
Dainzin has been practicing this traditional form of medicine
for 40 years, and has cured numerous patients.
</P>
<P>
The old man is proud of his profession, saying that Buddhism is
the spirit of the medical tradition, and being a Tibetan doctor
means being a virtuous man -- a real follower of Sakyamuni, the
founder of Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan hospitals are run by lamaseries, and the treatment is
free. At a hospital run by the Zhaxi Lhunbo Lamasery, dozens of
doctors feel the pulses of patients, which is one of the main
methods of diagnosis in Tibetan medicine.
</P>
<P>
"I often come here to see a doctor. My children come here as
well. However, in the case of serious diseases, we prefer Western
medicine," said Tudun, a patient.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is particularly effective for curing chronic
diseases, such as hepatitis and apoplexy.

<P>
Zhu Huoben, president of the China Ethnic Medicine Society,
says that for thousands of years Tibetan medicine has been part of
Tibetan Buddhism, and Tibetan monks have always been the backbone
of Tibet's medical care system.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
the central government has preserved this tradition, although it
has also created a number of modern hospitals throughout Tibet.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage people to do what they have been doing for
thousands of years," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In Tibet, there are more than 500 lamas who work as doctors,
mainly living in remote mountainous areas where modern medical
care is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 1,700 lamaseries have opened Tibetan medicine
clinics.
</P>
<P>
Tsoru Tsenang, in his 80s and the president of the Tibetan
Medicine Hospital in Lhasa, has won world acclaim because he is so
well versed in this tradition.
</P>
<P>
The Living Buddha and former abbot of the Tsoru Lamasery, has
written 170 books on Tibetan medicine, including the famous "The
Four Medical Tantras". He has been invited to give lectures not
only in Beijing, but also in Tokyo and Europe.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetan medicine will play a bigger role in Tibet and, if more
people come to realize its value, it will benefit people in other
parts of the world too," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsoru is not alone. Tsuchen Gyainzain, 70, is another Living
Buddha working hard to pass on the tradition to later generations.
</P>
<P>
He says he now spends most of his time writing books. "My
mission is to get Tibetan medicine better known worldwide," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Military Officials Voice Concern over Iran's Missile Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli defense establishment
has reacted with concern to Iran's successful test-firing of an
upgraded version of its medium-range Shahab-3 missile on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio Sunday quoted Israeli Defense Force (IDF) Chief of
Staff Shaul Mofaz as saying the Iranians are also making great
efforts to acquire non-conventional weapon technology.
</P>
<P>
This, together with the Shahab missiles, threatens not just
Israel but all the countries that are within the 1,300-kilometer
radius range of Iran, Mofaz said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Shahab missile, Defense Ministry Director-
general Amos Yaron said there is a distance between Iran's ability
to develop the missile and actually using it against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said Iran is
seeking to gain hegemony in the Moslem world and it perceives
itself as guardian of Islamic rights.
</P>
<P>
This becomes evident not only in the development of its weapons
capability but in its desire to continue controlling terrorism,
Sneh told Israel Radio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The radio report also quoted a reserve brigadier as denying
Iran's missle program is first and foremost targeted at Israel but
rather Iran's neighbors. The officer said Iran will threaten
several of its neighbors including Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan and
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Israel is preparing an answer to the Iranian Shahab-3 missile,
the officer noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel believes Iran will have a small number of nuclear
warheads which will be operational in about five years, he added.
The launching of the missile Saturday was not seen as a surprise to
Israel which has been following its development.

MANILA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Two people, including a boy, were
killed and 33 others wounded when a powerful bomb exploded Sunday
morning in Kabacan, North Cotabato Province, in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded in a public market in the town of Kabacan as
market goers milled around stalls, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
Those wounded were rushed to various hospitals in the area for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Town mayor Wilfredo Bataga blamed the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) for the bombing, citing an order of its leader Hashim
Salamat to launch a "Jihad" or holy war against their enemies
after the MILF headquarters Abubakar fell to government troops
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But MILF spokesman Eid Kabalu denied that the group was behind
the incident.

typhoons, submerged more than 100 shanties at the foot of a 15-
meter-high mountain of trash.
</P>
<P>
The council said it could still not determine the number of
people missing after the landslide. Local officials and rescuers
believe some 200 people might still be buried in the heap of
garbage.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who heads the council, said
Saturday in a TV program that search and rescue operations will
indefinitely continue until the last body is retrieved.
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The
open dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in 1999, but the closure
was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for Quezon
City's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.

<HEADLINE> Greene, Jones Bound for Sydney after 100m Triumphs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sprint superstars Maurice
Greene and Marion Jones became the first to clinch their Olympic
tickets as both won their respective men's and women's 100-meters
at the U.S. Olympic trials in Sacramento, California Saturday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Greene, holder of the men's 100m world record, erased the
bitter memory of his failure to qualify for the 1996 Games,
clocked 10.01 seconds for the victory, with his clubmates Curtis
Johnson and John Drummond finished second and third in 10.066 and
10.07.
</P>
<P>
Brian Lewis, who beat Greene in Helsinki last month, had the
heartbreak berth, finishing fourth and out of the Olympic running
in 10.09.
</P>
<P>
"I just feel great," Greene said. "I came here to win the 100m
and 200m, and the first half is over."
</P>
<P>
Jones made a perfect start to her 100m, overtaking reigning
Olympic champion Gail Devers at the 50m mark and winning easily in
10.88 seconds, beating Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines to second
and third.
</P>
<P>
"Crossing the finish line, I couldn't have known how emotional
it would be," said Jones, who held her arms aloft and beamed as
she crossed the line.
</P>
<P>
She'll be joined in Sydney by her husband, shot put world
champion CJ Hunter, who finished second in a tightly-contested
final won by Adam Nelson with a throw of 22.12m -- best in the
world this year.

<HEADLINE> Lama-turned Doctor Making Great Contributions to Tibetan Medicine ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- It may have been the proudest moment
of his life for 71-year-old blind Tibetan physician Qamba Chilai
when he announced his achievements in research on the Four
Medical Tantras, a classic of Tibetan medicine, at an
international symposium on Tibetan medicine here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He told the more than 600 participants at the ongoing three-day
symposium in this capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region about his
research achievements concerning 80 colored charts, said to be the
first of their kind ever made in China, which unveil the secrets
of the human body.
</P>
<P>
Actually Qamba, now the honorary president of the College of
Tibetan Medicine here, has made many important achievements in
research on and the development of Tibetan medicine, which have
won him the title of "state-level expert".
</P>
<P>
He has proved that the Four Medical Tantras, an ancient
encyclopedia of Tibetan medicine, was written by Yuto Yondan Gonbo,
an eighth-century Tibetan doctor.
</P>
<P>
Qamba's evidence solved a long-standing problem and ended an
enduring historical controversy involving the belief by some
people that the encyclopedia originally came from India.
</P>
<P>
Qamba also compiled the first set of teaching materials on
Tibetan medicine, which are explained using modern scientific
theories.
</P>
<P>
Qamba, born into a family of Tibetan physicians, became a lama
at the Drepung Lamasery here at the age of 13. At the same time,
he began to study Tibetan medicine under Qinrob Norbu, the palace
doctor for the 13th Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
It took Qamba nine years to systematically learn Tibetan
medicine, how to calculate the Tibetan calendar and the phonetics
of Tibetan language. He can recite by heart the Four Medical
Tantras, which contain hundreds of thousands of words.

<HEADLINE> Rapid Development for Tibetan Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Tibetan medicine has
reached a new stage of development after 40 years of research.
</P>
<P>
More than 600 Chinese and foreign experts on Tibetan medicine
gathered today in this capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, to
attend the ongoing 2000 International Symposium on Tibetan
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
"The three-day symposium will put Tibetan medicine in the
spotlight of global medical circles. The convention of such a
large symposium in Tibet reflects the marked progress of Tibetan
medicine over the past 40 years, since the peaceful liberation of
Tibet in 1951," said a symposium organizer.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine experienced its heyday in the eighth century.
But by 1959, when democratic reforms took place, there were only
three Tibetan clinics in Tibet, with less than 100 medical workers,
who served mainly the aristocracy and lamas.
</P>
<P>
In the past four decades, the central government of China has
allocated 800 million yuan to build Tibetan hospitals in seven
cities and prefectures in Tibet. The Hospital of Tibetan Medicine,
the first regional medical institute of higher learning, was set
up in 1993. Apart from 3,000 Tibetan doctors in rural areas, the
number of professional physicians in Tibetan medicine has grown to
over 1,000.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Tibetan hospitals have been set up in communities
inhabited by Tibetans in Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. Nearly 100
books on Tibetan medicine, including the "Diagnosis of Tibetan
Medicine", have been published. The "Hanging Charts of the Four
Medical Tantras" have been translated into three other languages.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceuticals plants in Tibet and Qinghai are producing
Tibetan medicine with modern techniques to make the traditional
drug easy to take and adapt to the demands of the world market.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Dui, president of the Tibetan Hospital, expressed the wish
that Tibetan medicine will make bigger contributions to promoting
the health of people around the globe.

<P>
LHASA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Medical workers from at home and
abroad are quite familiar with the genome project and bio-
engineering, which represent the most advanced level of the
development of modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
However, more and more of them are becoming fascinated with
Tibetan medicine, which has a recorded history of over 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
Information from the on-going international symposium on
Tibetan medicine here show that China has set up a system which
covers medical treatment, teaching, scientific research and
production of Tibetan medicines over the past two decades and more.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries have established research institutes on
Tibetan medicine, and some classics of Tibetan medicine such as "
The Four Medical Tantras" and "Pearl Herbology" have been
translated into English, French, German, Russian, Japanese and
many other foreign languages.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine, which originated on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau,
has a recorded history of over 2,000 years, and its actual history
is probably more than 4,000 years, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
It is a unique traditional medical system developed by Tibetans,
which absorbs the advantages of traditional Chinese medicine,
ancient Indian medicine and ancient Arabian medicine.
</P>
<P>
Qamba Chilai, honorary president of the College of Tibetan
Medicine, said that traditional Tibetan medicine boasts a complete
theoretical system and is rich in clinic experience.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine unveiled the profound mystery of the human
anatomy as early as in the 8th century, Qambao said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Experts Fascinating With Tibetan Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Bhagwan Dash, an Indian expert who
has engaged in clinical Tibetan medicine for more than two decades,
delivered a report at the 2000 International Symposium on Tibetan
Medicine held here today.
</P>
<P>
He briefed the symposium participants on the principles,
diagnosis method and historical development of Tibetan medicine. "
Tibetan medicine regards the human body as an integral part of the
body, spirit and soul. It pays attention not only to treatment of
disease but also to psychological recuperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Similar to the traditional Chinese, Mongolian and Indian
medicines, Tibetan medicine values natural drugs and therapy,
which have few side effects, he added.
</P>
<P>
Dash has been engaging in medical research in New Delhi and is
an advisor to the World Health Organization in Southeast Asia. He
shuttles between New Delhi and Italy to attend to his five
Tibetan and Indian medicine clinics in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is specially effective for arthritis,
cardiovascular diseases and cancer, he said. "A lupus sebaceus
patient of mine received Western medicine treatment for two years,
but to no avail. But since he turned to Tibetan medicine not long
ago, he has felt much better," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 64-year-old physician has written 14 books on Tibetan
medicine. The majority of them have been published in New Delhi. "
I hope Tibetan medicine becomes better known not only in India but
also in other parts of the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the current symposium on Tibetan medicine
include over 20 foreign medical experts like Dash from the United
States, Germany, France, Japan, Russia and four other countries.
</P>
<P>
Eliot Tokar, an American physician, has opened a Tibetan
medicine clinic in New York. "I am glad to have a chance to
compare notes with experts from other countries on Tibetan
medicine," he said. "I think Tibetan medicine should be combined
with Western medicine. It should find its rightful place in modern
medicine, while maintaining its unique theory and way of treatment,
" he added.

Rinwang, vice-president of the Beijing College of Tibetan
Medicine, explained that Tibetan drugs are all collected from
highland areas with long periods of sunshine and sharp differences
in temperature, and that make their effectiveness and bioactivity
stronger.
</P>
<P>
He added that Tibetan medicine stresses holistic internal
recuperation. Clinical experience has proved that Tibetan drugs
are more effective for digestive, cardiovascular and immune
diseases than other types of drugs.
</P>
<P>
Doctor Bwagwan Dash from India said that one of the reasons why
Tibetan drugs are so attractive is that they come from the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau, known as one of the world's four most unpolluted
regions.
</P>
<P>
Such pollution-free medicines cannot lead to iatrogenic and
drug-induced illness, said Bwagwan Dash, who has opened five
clinics of Indian medicine and Tibetan medicine in India and Italy.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that Tibetan medicines are collected from places
more than 3,800 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau boasts more than 2,000 plants, 159
kinds of animals and over 80 kinds of minerals which can be used
for medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Guoben, president of the China Association of Ethnic
Medicines, said that cultural content is another factor that makes
Tibetan medicine so attractive.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Tibetan medicine combines ancient philosophy,
astronomy and calculation of the calendar, biology, physics and
chemistry.
</P>
<P>
This is a reflection of the history and culture of Tibet, Zhu
said.

QINGDAO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China will expand democracy in
selecting cadres, said Zeng Qinghong, head of the Organization
Department of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
The country will expand ordinary people's rights to select and
supervise cadres, including the right to know about and
participate in the selecting process, he told a national meeting
on the reform of the personnel system, which ended today in this
coastal city in Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
A system combining the people's recommendation, public opinion
polls and democratic evaluation should be established in this
regard, he vowed.
</P>
<P>
In three to five years, the country will create a mechanism
mandating that information on the qualifications of the candidates
for posts at and below the prefecture or bureau level should be
publicized before they are appointed, according to Zeng.
</P>
<P>
He said that the move is aimed at cultivating high-quality
officials for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of China, with more than 60 million members,
has been giving top priority to the cadre issue, while a fight
against corruption among high-level officials is being intensified.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Ballooning in India: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The AIDS (Acquired Immuno-
Deficiency Syndrome) disease is continuously spreading in India
with as many as 3.5 million people across the south Asian country
already contracting the disease, a recent report by the United
Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said.
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence of the continued spread of HIV (Human
Immunodeficiency Virus) both within high-risk groups and,
importantly, to the general population," the Press Trust of India
(PTI) quoted the UNICEF report as saying here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The southwestern coastal state of Maharashtra is heading the
country in the number of AIDS and HIV positive patients, followed
by the state of Manipur in the northeast, said the report, adding
that in both states over one percent of the local population is
infected.
</P>
<P>
The report cautioned India, which has the highest number of
people with HIV/AIDS in the world, against it becoming an epidemic,
the PTI noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, "heterosexual intercourse" is the main
mode of HIV/AIDS transmission in India, while in some northeastern
states intravenous drug injection users have constituted the
majority of the patients.
</P>
<P>
The last four years have witnessed a broadening of the epidemic
across the southern and western states, such as Andhra Pradesh and
Tamil Nadu, and the impact of the epidemic is already felt in
cities like Mumbai and Imphal, capitals of Maharashtra and Manipur,
where bed-occupancy rates for HIV-related illnesses of between 20
and 40 percent are reported, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Sporadic Fighting Kills 14 Rebels in Sri Lanka Amid Diplomatic Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government said
Sunday that at least 14 Tamil Tiger rebels had been killed in
fresh sporadic fighting which erupted between government troops
and the rebels in the north of the island while foreign guests are
visiting the country to assess the peace prospects.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement that troops killed 11 rebels
of Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) on Saturday in three
clashes in the northern Jaffna peninsula, the scene of weeks of
fierce fighting until May.
</P>
<P>
It added that three LTTE rebels were killed on Friday also in
the Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a delegation from the European Parliament arrived
here on Saturday to assess the prospects for peace in Sri Lanka's
long-running civil war which has plagued the country since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Their arrival follows the departure of Peter Westamacott, under
secretary of state in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of
Britain, who held talks with senior members of the government and
opposition on Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increased number of overseas visitors coincides with
efforts by Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga to end the
Sri Lankan civil war. She is talking with minority Tamil parties
in a bid to hammer out a consensus on constitutional reform
proposals which will give more autonomy to regions, including the
north and east, where the LTTE rebels are fighting for an
independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
The government and the main opposition United National Party
reached consensus on the constitutional reform proposals early
this month after four months of peace talks. Kumaratunga said she
would present the proposals before Parliament in early August.

<HEADLINE> World Forum to Focus on Diamond-Turned War Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANTWERP, Belgium, July 16 (Xinhua) -- World diamond traders are
scheduled to start on Monday discussing revenues from diamond
sales that were used to fund civil wars in Africa.
</P>
<P>
An international outcry over the use of illegal diamond
revenues to fund wars in Africa where lots of people have been
killed will be the limelight at this year's world diamond
conference to be held here at the world's largest diamond trading
center.
</P>
<P>
The biannual event happened to follow a United Nations embargo
over Sierra Leone diamonds in an attempt to cut off funding for
the African country's Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. embargo on the export of Sierra Leone diamonds has
raised a call for global measures to stop the smuggling of
diamonds from one African country to another in order to
circumvent national laws and international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report published in March on sanctions against illegal
Angolan diamonds used to fund the UNITA criticized some companies
in the diamond industry for allegedly allowing trade in what has
been described as conflict diamonds to flourish.
</P>
<P>
But observers believed that it would not be easy in that the
complicated chain system of dealers will only make diamond trade
difficult to track and therefore difficult to halt trade of
conflict diamonds.
</P>
<P>
The Antwerp conference draws representatives from around the
world's diamond-producing countries, mining companies and diamond-
cutting centers. Apart from diamond-producing countries in Africa,
Russia and Canada will also be present while such diamond-cutting
centers as India, Belgium, Thailand, Israel and the United States
will also be attending the conference.
</P>
<P>
The global diamond business produces 6.8 billion U.S. dollars
in diamonds which in turn generate a retail diamond jewelry sales
of around 56 billion dollars each year.

<HEADLINE> How Do Dotcoms Survive? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- For Peter Yip, chief executive
officer (CEO) of the Chinadotcom Corporation, the multi-revenue-
source strategy and good management are two fundamentals that
matter a dotcom company's survival in the fierce competition in
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
Yip predicted that half of some 400 NASDAQ-listed Internet
companies will be kicked out of the market during the downturn
marked by the 9.67 percent crash on the technology-dominated
Nasdaq market on April 14 this year, when 2,000 billion U.S.
dollars vanished in the twinkling of an eye. He said that the
decline would continue at least 18 months to two years.
</P>
<P>
Among the remaining players, the top 10 percent including today
's Internet titans like Yahoo! e-Bay and AOL will seize 80 percent
of the market, he said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The downturn is very healthy for the industry in the long term.
It is a correction which will force the investors not to accept
every dotcom company in the market and to pay closer attention to
the business fundamentals of the dotcom companies, which are how
to serve the customers, how to expand the business, how to improve
the revenue base and how to make money," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chinadotcom, the first Asian dotcom company listed on Nasdaq,
adopts a tripod business model, namely, distributing content via
its portal network, building e-business strategies and solutions
for clients and helping them sell services through online
advertising.
</P>
<P>
Internet analysts of the Salomon Smith Barney (SSB) said last
week that they believed Chinadotcom will reach profitability by
the fourth quarter next year given its multi-revenue-source
strategy yet synergistic businesses to become one of Asia's first
profitable Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
"Counting on advertisement alone does not work," said Yip, who
has been on the position since January last year, adding that
advertising accounts for 46 percent in Chinadotcom's revenues
while 51 percent comes from e-solutions and the other 3 percent
from e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
Yip, holding that Internet is an international business, said
the multi-revenue-source strategy also means developing a global
business to take up an advantageous place.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to make Chinadotcom enter the top ten in Japan this
year and top five next year, step into Europe in 2001 and become
one of top ten in the United States in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"Wall Street values a company on the basis of its consistent
growth, confidence and dominant status. Without a multiple
strategy, the business cannot be big enough to survive there,"
said Yip.
</P>
<P>
The company, which raised nearly 500 million U.S. dollars upon
its debut on Nasdaq in July 1999, invests in synergistic Internet
companies throughout the Asia Pacific region that add value and
depth to its services and portal channels.
</P>
<P>
Chinadotcom recorded 561 million U.S. dollars in liquid funds
as of the end of the first quarter of 2000, with an average
monthly burn rate of only 3 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Chinadotcom has grown from just nine offices in Asia with 150
staff when it was started five years ago to 24 offices with over 1,
900 employees in over 10 markets in the Asia Pacific region today.
</P>
<P>
"The management for an Internet company is very different from
that for a traditional one since Internet develops at an
astonishing speed," said Yip.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the most important thing for the management
team of an Internet company is to be equipped with a quick and
open mind as well as expertise to be able to follow the fast
changes in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Students Go on Fast to Protest Court Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian students on Sunday staged
a "political fast" before the office building of the Majlis
(parliament) to protest the court verdict on last year's student
dormitory case and the imprisonment of a reformist lawyer.
</P>
<P>
The fast, held by Iran's most influential student organization,
the Office to Foster Unity (OFU), may continue in the next few days
to urge the Majlis to take quick measures to overhaul the
conservative judiciary, said a statement released by OFU.
</P>
<P>
A military court here on Tuesday acquitted former Tehran police
commander Farhad Nazari along with 17 other co-accused policemen
who stood trial for forcibly entering a Tehran University dormitory
on July 8 last year to crack down on student protests against the
closure of the outspoken Persian daily Salam.
</P>
<P>
Nazari was tried on several charges, including illegally
entering the dormitory complex, ignoring an order of the Interior
Ministry not to use tear gas to suppress students and damage to
university property.
</P>
<P>
Many students were beaten and at least one was killed in the
police raid, which led to the worst nation-wide unrest Iran had
experienced since the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, only two minor defendants in the case got prison
terms according to Tuesday's verdict, one was sentenced to two
years in jail for breach of order and the other to 91 days in jail
plus a small fine for stealing an electric razor in the student
dormitory.
</P>
<P>
The verdict invited protests from many reformist organizations,
including the most influential Islamic Iran Participation Front.
Reformers believe that the trial and verdict are mostly symbolic
because those responsible for the incident remain unpunished.
</P>
<P>
Before the verdict was issued, the conservative judiciary had
issued arrest warrant for Mohsen Rahami, a reformist cleric lawyer,
for allegedly making and distributing video cassettes, the contents
of which are said to have insulted some officials.
</P>
<P>
Rahami, a law professor, was the lawyer for the student
plaintiffs in the university dormitory case. He also defended
various reformist clients in a number of high-profile cases.
</P>
<P>
Rahami and Ms. Shirin Ebadi, also a reformist lawyer, went on
trial Saturday at a Terhan court.
</P>
<P>
Akbar Atri, one of the leaders of the OFU, said on Sunday that
the political fast launched by the students before the Majlis is in
conformity with the Constitution, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that the students made the decision due to the weakness
of the judiciary in performing its functions. "The judiciary has
disappointed us because it failed to have our rights restored," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Atri pointed out that another aim of the student movement is to
show its support for the reformist-controlled Majlis, which only
started work in May but has to overcome conservative pressures to
carry out its reformist tasks.

<HEADLINE> Barak, Lapid Discuss Camp David Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
and head of the opposition Shinui party Yosef Lapid discussed on
Sunday the ongoing three-way Camp David summit.
</P>
<P>
Lapid told Israel Radio that Barak has called him Sunday morning
from Camp David and gave him a summary of the situation at the
talks with Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
"Barak has asked specifically not to talk publicly about the
conversation in the face of a virtual news blackout," Lapid said.
</P>
<P>
"The only thing that I can tell you is that he doesn't sound
like the most optimistic person in the world," lapid added.
</P>
<P>
Asked if this meant Barak would fail to forge the planned
framework agreement for a final peace, Lapid said: "I didn't say he
is not coming back with agreement and I didn't prophesy in this
direction or the other, and I don't want to enter into this."
</P>
<P>
Shinui, or Religious Reformation Party, has six members of the
120-member Knesset (parliament) and the party would be asked to
join a new coalition that Barak will form on his return from the
summit, which was also attended by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The summit, which started on Monday at Camp David near
Washington, is aimed at solving the key issues such as Jerusalem,
border, refugees, settlement and water and reaching a framework
agreement on these issues ahead of the target September deadline
for a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
After days of "soft negotiations" and hours of restating old
positions, the Israeli and Palestinian teams at the summit got down
to real work over the weekend, splitting into working groups and
dealing with a verbal U.S. bridging proposal.
</P>
<P>
Officials on all sides admitted that the talks were tense and
little progress has been made. Tensions between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators heated up over the weekend as the sides
delved deeper into the core of the key issues.
</P>
<P>
Arafat threatened to walk out of the summit after receiving a U.
S.
bridging proposal with a map that was too similar to the Israeli
position.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Chinese Asked to Lend Helping Hand to Aboriginals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Sunday urged the Chinese community in the country
to lend a helping hand to rebuild Bumiputera (aboriginals)
businesses affected by the recent economic turmoil in efforts to
accelerate national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the recession, many Bumiputera companies
collapsed because they were too new and were almost completely
destroyed by the currency attack.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that when the new economic policy was first
launched (in the early 1970s) for the indigenous people to have a
share in the economic wealth, the Chinese had cooperated in such a
way that it was successfully implemented.
</P>
<P>
Their Bumiputera counterparts however must understand that they
must work very hard and practice prudent financial management and
cannot blame the Chinese community if they fail, he said when
opening a Chinese Chamber building in Kuching, Sarawak, East
Malaysia, Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the government recognized the contribution
of the Chinese community in the country's emergence as one of the
strongest economies in the developing countries due to their
dynamism.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese community realize the importance of reducing the
disparity in the economic wealth among the different communities
and give them a share in it. And because they (Bumiputeras) have a
share, the feeling of jealousy and envy to the Chinese community
have almost disappeared," Mahathir was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
This was the reason why during the economic turmoil there was
no outbreak of racial fighting in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said when the Bumiputeras are enriched, a market is
being created for the Chinese to produce goods to sell to them.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir lauded the Chinese community which comprises the
second largest ethnic group in Sarawak for building up much of the
state's economic wealth.
</P>
<P>
He said Sarawak had remained a peaceful place because the
Chinese understood the cultural values of the indigenous people by
getting along well with them.

<TEXT>
<P>
The council said there is still an undetermined number of
people missing after last Monday's massive landslide at the
dumpsite. Local officials and rescuers believe some 200 people
might still be buried in the heap of garbage.
</P>
<P>
The avalanche, set off by heavy rains from recent typhoons,
submerged more than 100 shanties at the foot of a 15-meter-high
mountain of trash.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado, who heads the council, said
Saturday in a TV program that search and rescue operations will
indefinitely continue until the last body is retrieved.
</P>
<P>
So far, 496 families or 2,419 people have been evacuated to
safe places from the dumpsite, the council said.
</P>
<P>
There were reportedly 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The
open dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in 1999, but the closure
was held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for Quezon
City's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Automotive Industry Urged to Restructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz Sunday urged the local
automotive industry to restructure to face challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
She said since Malaysia has been allowed to push back the ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA) implementation for the sector to 2005
instead of 2003, the local automotive industry should take the
opportunity to enhance collaboration, especially in research and
development.
</P>
<P>
"The local motor industry must work together and look at export
markets in the long term because our domestic market is small,"
she told reporters after a social function in Petaling Jaya near
here.
</P>
<P>
"What the government has done is to give them the breathing
space to consolidate, to get over their problems following the
recession, to do the necessary restructuring and in the end, to go
into the export markets," she said.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah pointed out that the local automotive industry, while
competing with each other, must also cooperate in critical areas
for each other's survival.

BAGHDAD, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
has said Iraq will never kneel down to the domination of the United
States, condemning the U.S. domination in the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has utilized the U.N. Security Council to struggle
against the Third World states, especially those rejecting the U.S.
subordination and submission, Ramadan said, quoted Sunday by the
official daily Al-Jumhuriya.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the decade-old sanctions against Iraq will never be
lifted by a U.N. Security Council resolution, said Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan criticized the Arab League (AL) for failing to play its
role to alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people, who have been
the hardest hit by the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan also urged the Arab and Muslim countries to take action
to break the "unjust" sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly protested to the U.N. and the AL against the
continued U.S. and British aggressions over the two no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq, and demanded them to pressure the U.S.
and Britain to stop such aggressive acts, but so far has received
little response.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south
against possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has never recognized the zones for lack of explicit U.N.
authorization.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: EPZs Develop Rapidly in Bangladesh By Chen Jian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- With a view to accelerating the pace
of industrial development and generating productive employment
opportunities, Bangladesh has taken different measures to promote
the development of export processing zones (EPZ), the newest of
which is the Comilla EPZ inaugurated Saturday in southeastern
district Comilla.
</P>
<P>
Comilla EPZ, the fourth EPZ in the country, is to be built on
258 acres adjacent to Comilla Airport, in which 208 industrial
plots will be set up.
</P>
<P>
The development works for infrastructure began in April last
year,with an estimated cost of 835.6 million taka (16 million U.S.
dollars), and the first-phase works are expected to be completed
in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The authorities hoped the Comilla EPZ would attract foreign
investment of 3.6 billion taka (69.2 million dollars) and create
jobs for over 40,000 people when operations go in full swing.
</P>
<P>
While laying the foundation of the much-awaited Comilla EPZ,
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said it would usher in economic
development and prosperity not only for the district, but also for
the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Aiming at promoting economic progress, the decision to set up
EPZ in the country was taken by the government in 1978. Two years
later,an act was passed in the parliament, which was known as
Bangladesh Export Processing Zones Authority Act 1980.
</P>
<P>
Initially Chittagong EPZ, the first EPZ in the country, started
its operation in 1983. Later in 1993, another EPZ was set up in
the capital city Dhaka. Investors from 18 different countries of
the world including South Korea, Japan, Italy, Britain and the
United States have so far invested in Chittagong and Dhaka EPZs.
</P>
<P>
Investment in Chittagong EPZ has reached 283 million dollars
while that in Dhaka EPZ has come up to 144 million dollars as of
June 30, 2000. The investment in both EPZs has increased by 22
percent on an average during last four years.
</P>
<P>
The export from the zones is also very encouraging, with goods
worth 891 million dollars being exported from the existing two
EPZs in the last fiscal year 1999-2000, which accounted for 15
percent of the total national export. The average growth rate of
export of the two EPZs stands at 37 percent during last four years.
</P>
<P>
With the successful operation of Chittagong and Dhaka EPZs, the
present government decided to set up some more EPZs in other parts
of the country. Accordingly foundation stone of Mongla EPZ was
laid in 1998 in the southwestern port city. The construction work
of Mongla EPZ is going on in full swing, which is expected to be
finished by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The government has also decided to set up another two EPZs in
northern districts of Pabna and Nilphamari in the next one or two
years for balanced regional development of the country.
</P>
<P>
The speedy development of EPZs will undoubtedly attract more
foreign investment with the favorable policies, comparatively good
infrastructure and facilities, easy communication and cheap labors,
accordingly accelerate the country's transition to export-oriented
economy and promote the overall development of the country,
however,to set up too many EPZs in a rather short period will
inevitably bring about lots of problems, experts here said.
</P>
<P>
In the first place, to set up too many EPZs at the same time
may cause shortage of fund, which will result in the lagging
construction of infrastruture.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the imperfect related rules and regulations in the
EPZs and the wide-spread red-tapism in the governmental sectors
may hit the investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the hasty setting-up of EPZs may lead to vicious
competition among the EPZs for foreign investment, which is
harmful to the national interest.
</P>
<P>
Noting the importance of the EPZs for the development of the
country, Experts urged the government to take necessary measures
to tackle these problems and make sure the exuberant EPZs won't
become some white elephants.

<HEADLINE> Tibet to Turn Tibetan Medicine into Pillar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Traditional Tibetan medicine will
play an increasingly important role in promoting and safeguarding
the health of human beings today, according to a senior official
from the Tibet autonomous Regional government.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has listed the development of Tibetan
medicine as a key project for attracting both domestic and foreign
investment, said Legqog, chairman of the regional government.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the on-going three-day international
symposium on Tibetan medicine, which opened here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that neighboring Qinghai Province has also listed
the sector as a key industry for local economic development.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan medicine is a unique medicine system developed by the
Tibetan people over the past thousands of years by absorbing the
advantages of traditional Chinese medicine, ancient Indian
medicine and ancient Arabian medicine. It is proved to be
especially effective in treating diseases of digestive and
cardiovascular systems as well as immune diseases.
</P>
<P>
To boost the production of Tibetan medicines, which had been
hand-made for thousands of years, the state has invested 200
million yuan (24 million U.S. dollars) to build modern Tibetan
medicine plants in Tibet and Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan Medicine Plant in Tibet, China's largest,
manufactures more than 60 million capsules, more than 30 million
granules, and over 100,000 tons of traditional Tibetan medicines
annually.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than a dozen kinds of Tibetan medicines have
been included in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, 336 kinds are produced
according to the country's ministerial standards, and two kinds of
newly-developed Tibetan medicines have been exported to the United
States, Japan, the Republic of Korea and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau boasts more than
2,000 kinds of plants, 159 kinds of animals and over 80 kinds of
minerals that are suitable for making Tibetan medicines.
</P>
<P>
The rich resources, together with rapid developing high
technologies, provide a firm foundation for turning Tibetan
medicine into a pillar of the local economy, said Legqog.
</P>
<P>
The central government's strategy to develop the vast western
region will also give a boost to the local effort, he added.

product).

<P>
BEIRUT, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Two militiamen of Hezbollah were
killed and at least one injured in fire exchange with another
militia organization Amal movement on Saturday night in south
Lebanon, Lebanese police said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred in the village of Malkaba in central

</P>
<P>
After Israel's pullout, the two organizations control the

the south, claiming it will not be operated until the U.N. confirms

Israel's withdrawal and deploys its peacekeeping forces there
first.

<HEADLINE> Iran's New Missile Threatens Region: Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Israel has voiced its concern
over Iran's successful test-firing of an upgraded version of its
medium-range Shahab-3 missile, saying the new missile could pose a
threat not only to Israel, but to the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran test-launched on Saturday a Shahab-3 ballistic missile and
declared it a success. Israel said the 1,300-kilometer range
missile could reach targets across Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security officials said Saturday night that while the
test run does not pose an immediate threat to Israel's security, it
is clear that Iran is establishing its strategic capability.
</P>
<P>
"The successful test run is a worrying sign...this is a step
forward in the Iranian buildup of power," Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh told the Army Radio.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the Israel Defense Force and the strengthening
of Israel by peace agreements are together our answer to this
launch," Israel Radio quoted Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak as
reporting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Barak is at Camp David, the United States, attending the three-
way summit with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S, President
Bill Clinton to discuss how to settle the key issues, such as the
fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees,
borders, in the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
Officials with Barak at the Camp David said the new Iranian
Shahab-3 missile "is a signal not only to us but to the region as a
whole and it threatens the whole region and goes to show the need
to immediately stop financial aid to Iran," the radio added.
</P>
<P>
Shahab-3 is modelled mainly on North Korea's Nodong-1, but has
been improved with Russian technology. It is a single stage
ballistic missile, using liquid fuel and with a speed of about 7,
000 kilometers per hour. It can carry an 800-kilogram warhead.
</P>
<P>
In July 1998, Iran test-fired the Shahab-3 for the first time
but it exploded during the launch due to a system failure.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Launches Resettlement Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The resettling of the landless
Zimbabweans has started on 200 white commercial farms acquired by
the government throughout the country, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Saturday, Vice-President
Joseph Msika said this followed the amendment of the Constitution
and the subsequent amendment of the Land Acquisition Act under
which the government published a list of 804 white-owned farms for
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
"This legal framework has removed the impediments that has
hindered the government from quick acquisition of land for
resettlement," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had now adopted the "fast track"
approach that priority would be given to land acquisition,
demarcation, settler emplacement and the provision of basic
infrastructure such as water points and access roads.
</P>
<P>
He said the farms to be targeted would be the derelict ones,
those being underutilized, the ones belonging to absent landlords,
those adjacent to communal areas and those that were under
multiple ownership.
</P>
<P>
Beneficiary selection would be done in accordance with the
established resettlement and land redistribution policies and
procedures of the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the whole process was designed to ensure fair and
equitable redistribution of land so as to correct the racial
imbalance in land ownership created by former colonial regimes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leader of the Zimbabwean War Veterans Association
Chenjerai Hunzvi has given the government a two week ultimatum in
which it had to acquire all the 804 designated farms.
</P>
<P>
"I do not like to give ultimatums to the government, but if
they move slowly in acquiring the land within the next two weeks
then we will do it ourselves," he told war veterans in Harare
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied about 1,500 white farms since
February this year to press for acceleration of land
redistribution.

<HEADLINE> Taufik Hopes to Play in Indonesia Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion of Sanyo
Indonesia Open Taufik Hidayat has voiced hope that he will being
able to compete in next week's tournament despite a back injury.
</P>
<P>
He said his fate would be decided on Monday by orthopedic
specialist Dr. Chaehab and the official doctor of the Badminton
Association of Indonesia (PBSI) Michael Triangto.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Michael and I will visit Dr. Chaehab on Monday to learn
the exact diagnosis of my injury and the medical treatment. I also
want to know what would be the consequence if I force myself to
compete in the Indonesia Open. Somehow, the pain only comes when I
have to run and not while practicing," Taufik was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Taufik said should he have to take a long rest prior to the
Olympic Games in Sydney in September, he would prefer to do so
after the Indonesia Open.
</P>
<P>
"Dr. Michael told me that there was a possibility that I would
have to take a two to three weeks rest. In that case, I hope I can
still compete in the Indonesia Open but miss the Malaysia Open
instead. I am the defending champion and I really aim to retain my
title. If I force myself to compete and I lose next week, I won't
blame it on my injury but because I played bad. If I have to skip
both tournaments, I will lose so many points and my world ranking
will drop. It means I will have a tough draw in the Olympics," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Taufik is seeded third in the tournament after world number one
Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark and world number three Hendrawan
of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
His injury has worried PBSI as he is one of the Indonesian
athletes predicted to earn gold medals in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old shuttler complained of back pain during
practice on Tuesday but Michael indicated that it might only be a
strained muscle. However, X-ray results were "not very good".
</P>
<P>
PBSI secretary-general Leo Chandra Wiranata earlier said the
organization would not force Taufik to compete in the tournament
as it would prefer that he concentrate on the Olympics.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Iran said Saturday it had successfully test-fired an upgraded
version of its medium-range Shahab-3 missile, amid concern in
Israel and the United States. The Ballistic missile has a range of
1,300 Kilometers, making it capable of striking Israel.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said:"The
Strength of the IDF (Israel Defense Forces) and the strengthening
of Israel by peace agreements are together our answer to the
launch."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said the successful test
run is a worrying sign. Former defense minister Moshe Arens said
this was the missile's first successful test run, and it will take
time until it becomes fully operational. Meanwhile, Iran continues
to work on the Shahab-4, with a long-range capability of 2,000 km.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In his first major intervention to save the Israeli-
Palestinian negotiations at Camp David, U.S. President Bill Clinton
managed to dissuade Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat from leaving
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Arafat threatened to leave after U.S. Middle East special envoy
Dennis Ross submitted a suggestion on the status of Jerusalem on
Thursday night, which the Palestinians claimed was too similar to
the Israeli position.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton met both leaders on Friday and the Israeli
delegation invited the Palestinians and American delegations to a
Shabbat dinner. The three leaders then met alone until 1 a.m..
There were no official meetings on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright intervened in a
minor summit crisis at Camp David on Friday morning when Arafat
demanded that a group of three Palestinians, not originally part of
his delegation, be allowed to consult the Palestinians already
there.
</P>
<P>
Albright met with the group near Camp David and explained why
they could not join the Palestinian delegation. She also promised
to raise the matter with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The three are Fatah members -- heads of factions who supported
Arafat going to the summit and who are influential in Palestinian
domestic politics. Arafat wanted to include them to broaden his
circle of support.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Over 100,000 are expected to attend a rally Sunday night in
Tel Aviv's Rabin Square to protest the Camp David summit and the
government's intentions to withdraw from large areas of Judea,
Samaria and Gaza (the West Bank and Gaza Strip) and dismantle some
settlements.
</P>
<P>
Protesters will be bused from settlements in Judea, Samaria and
Gaza. In the past few days, activists in all the communities have
conducted an hours-to-house campaign, reminding residents of their
duty to attend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, left-wing activists and peace process supporters will
hold a motorcade along the coastal highway to support Barak and the
summit talks.

<HEADLINE> China to Build Big Reservoir in Northeast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 16 (Xinhua) -- China is to build a large reservoir
in its northeast province of Heilongjiang to prevent future floods.
</P>
<P>
The State Council has already approved the project, which will
need an investment of 4.5 billion yuan (560 million U.S. dollars),
government sources say.
</P>
<P>
The Ni'erji reservoir will be built on the upper reaches of the
Nenjiang River and is expected to hold 8.1 billion cubic meters of
water, one-fifth that of the reservoir in the Three Gorges.
</P>
<P>
Devastating floods on the Nenjiang River and nearby Songhua
River in 1998 affected millions of people and caused tens of
billion yuan in economic losses in the northeastern region, China'
s major granary and industrial basis.
</P>
<P>
The new reservoir will provide a shield for big oil fields and
key transportation lines, said the sources, adding that it will
also generate 550 million kwh of electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to ease the shortage of water in part of
the region and improve irrigation and shipping.

<HEADLINE> More Lumberjacks Become Tree Planters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Vegetation at the upper reaches
of the Yangtze River, the longest in China, has increased since
China banned the logging primitive forests there in 1998 following
the devastating floods downstream.
</P>
<P>
By now, more than 200,000 lumberjacks in the area have put down
their saws and axes and joined the army of tree planters. And the
government has earmarked more than two billion yuan (about 240
million U.S. dollars) for planting trees and protecting forests
there.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past two years, 306,700 hectares of
trees have been planted and 9.3 million hectares of natural
forests have been put under good protection.
</P>
<P>
Excessive logging in the past several decades has resulted in
degradation of the ecological environment at the upper reaches of
the Yangtze. In the 1980s, serious soil erosion expanded to an
area of 350,000 square kilometers, with about 1.6 billion tons of
mud and sand washed into the river each year.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze River valley is China's most important economic
center, covering one-fifth of the country's territory, a quarter
of its cultivated land, and one-third of its population. Combined
industrial and agricultural output value of the area accounts for
two-fifths of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bangladeshi Police Hunt for Killers  By Pan Xiaozhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Seventy nine people have been
arrested in a combing operation launched by Bangladeshi law-
enforcing agencies on Saturday for their alleged involvement in
the massacre in Chittagong on July 12, in which nine people were
gunned down by members of Islami Chhatra Shibir (Islami Student
Front).
</P>
<P>
The operation was launched jointly by Chittagong metropolitan
and district police aided by Bangladesh Rifles and armed battalion
police.
</P>
<P>
After getting the directive of Home Minister Mohammed Nasim,
different law-enforcing agencies had stated non-stop combing
operations at least in seven districts in the country including
Chittagong, 264 kilometers southeast of Dhaka, Chittagong Hill
Tracts and Rajshahi, 272 kilometers west of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Police force in Chittagong made raid at different places in the
sea port and other areas adjacent to the city with a list of 2000
hard-core and identified terrorists.
</P>
<P>
At least 38 activists and leaders of the Islami Chhatra Shibir,
the student wing of Jammat-e-Islami, were arrested in separate
raids on eight residential halls of the Rajshahi University.
</P>
<P>
A tense situation is reportedly prevailing on the campus
following the police raid. Panic-stricken students have left their
hall rooms and took shelter in the houses of their relatives and
friends.
</P>
<P>
A group of armed cadres of Chhatra Shibir riding a black
microbus were alleged to have sprayed bullets on another microbus

Student League), the student wing of the ruling Awami League, on
July 12, gunning down nine people including six activists of
Chhatra League.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Saturday called for the people to
build up resistance against the killers. Addressing a big public
meeting in Comilla, 79 kilometers southeast of the capital, she
said that the killers would have to be punished wherever found.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh Chhatra League on Thursday announced five-day
agitation program throughout the country, protesting over the
killing incident. Leaders of the league urged the government to
arrest "killer" Shibir activists immediately and demanded ban on
Jamaat-Shibir politics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (
BNP) demanded judicial inquiry committee to probe into the
killings in Chittagong to deal with the real culprits.
</P>
<P>
In a statement on Thursday night, BNP Secretary General Abdul
Mannan Bhuiyan expressed concern at the different activities of
the government and the ruling party and its front organizations
centering the Chittagong killings.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the reported attacks on BNP and other opposition
parties in different parts of the country in the wake of the
Chittagong killings, the BNP leader urged the ruling party to
refrain from carrying out such provocative activities.
</P>
<P>
He urged the people to remain alert against the ill motive of
spreading conflicts throughout the country centering on an
incident.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Launch Power-Saving Project Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to introduce special motor from next year in industrial,
commercial and domestic electrical appliances to save some 460
megawatt electricity and reduce technical system loss, load
shedding and power pilferage, the Bangladesh Observer reported
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The special motor called Intelligent Motor Controller (IMC) is
the culmination of over 10 years' research and development in the
field of optimum motor efficiency by experts from different arenas.
</P>
<P>
The IMC to be launched as the "Power-Saving Pilot Project"
under the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources will be
implemented by the Power Development Board at a cost of 100
million taka (1.92 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Elaborating on the benefit of the IMC, sources said it could be
installed in different types of domestic appliances including
refrigerators, air conditioners, various types of motors in small
and medium factories and agricultural apparatuses.
</P>
<P>
It can save 35 to 40 percent power consumption from the
existing level, they added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Short Study Report on the IMC, prepared by the
Department of Project Planning of the Power Development Board, the
introduction of the IMC could save 45.33 billion taka (872 million
dollars), equivalent to the cost of 460 megawatt power entailing
generation, transmission and distribution of electricity.
</P>
<P>
It could decrease the pressure on the distribution system in
different grid lines and substations, ensuring the proper
operation of the electricity supply around the country, sources
hoped.

<P>
OTTAWA, July 15 (Xinhua) -- At least nine campers were killed

Police are still working to square the list of the injured
supplied by half a dozen hospitals in Pine Lake, where up to 100
rescue workers continue their search for survivors in the Green
Acre trailer park and camp ground.
</P>
<P>
There were 429 trailers and at least 400 campers at the
campsite when the powerful twister descended at the speed of 300
kilometers an hour.
</P>
<P>
"How many people were here? We really don't know," said police
officer Dan Doyle, indicating the casualties might be even higher.
</P>
<P>
"In all likelihood that may happen, especially when you take
into account the number of people who may have been out on the
lake at the time," he added.
</P>
<P>
Authorities are yet to confirm a report that several local
fishermen were caught out in the storm.
</P>
<P>
The rescue mission is being intensified with helicopters
equipped with infrared search technology put to use while about
150 troops from the provincial capital Edmonton get prepared to
head into the area.

<HEADLINE> Britain Urges Sri Lanka's Tamil Parties to Support Consensus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 16 (Xinhua) -- A visiting senior British official
has urged the Tamil political parties in Sri Lanka to adopt
positive approach towards the consensus reached between the
government and the main Opposition on proposals to resolve the
ethnic conflict, the official Sunday Observer reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Westamacott, deputy under secretary of state in the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office of Britain, was here during the
past two days to obtain a first hand situation of Sri Lanka's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
Westamacott, who had met the Tamil political parties in Colombo
Friday evening, told the newspaper that his country is "very
particular" that a political settlement should be found to the
ethnic problem in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the consensus reached between the Sri Lankan
government and the main Opposition United National Party (UNP), he
suggested that whatever the shortcomings of the peace proposals by
the two major political parties in the country, the Tamil
political parties should take a "positive approach" towards the
proposals and sort out the issues that were not acceptable to the
Tamils.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the talks with the representatives of the Tamil
parties, he suggested that all efforts must be focused on reaching
a political settlement as early as possible to bring an end to the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Westamacott, who left here Saturday morning, had meetings with
Minister of Foreign Affairs Lakshman Kadirgamar and the Leader of
the Opposition and the UNP Ranil Wickramasinghe during his brief
visit.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lankan government is talking with minority Tamil
parties in a bid to hammer out a consensus on constitutional
reform proposals which aim to end the 17-year ethnic conflicts
between government troops and Tamil rebels who have been fighting
a war for a separate Tamil state in the north and east of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The government and the UNP reached consensus on the
constitutional reform proposals last week after four months of
peace talks. The government would present the proposals before
Parliament in early next month.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Frequent Visits Render Kindred Sino-Myanmar Ties Closer (1) By Duan Tingchang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 16 (Xinhua) -- "At the top of a river lies the
home of me/At the other end, that of thee/Infinite feeling we
harbor for each other/As from the same river we fetch drinking
water/The river water flows incessantly/Drinking together in
delight/So long as it does not cease/We are neighbors since yore/
Maintaining friendship/Keeping it lush and green like a mountain
range/Not growing old, never like the water that flows on...."
</P>
<P>
This is a poem composed by late Chinese Marshal Chen Yi on
December 14, 1957 in praise of Sino-Myanmar friendship when he
visited Myanmar and is still widely recited by the peoples of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
It is a true portrayal of the Sino-Myanmar phaukphaw (fraternal)
friendship.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Vice-Chairman of the Myanmar State Peace
and Development Council (SPDC) General Maung Aye, Vice-President
of China Hu Jintao will pay a three-day official visit to Myanmar
from July 16 to 18.
</P>
<P>
This visit will provide new opportunities for enhancing mutual
understanding, extending common views and strengthening friendly
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It will also compose a new chapter for the development of
friendly Sino-Myanmar ties in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China and Myanmar, linked by mountains and rivers, share a
common border of over 2,000 kilometers and enjoy a long-standing,
time-tested friendship.
</P>
<P>
The earliest exchange between China and Myanmar dates back to
the 4th century BC. Since ancient times, Myanmar people have
called Chinese people "paukphaw" which means "full brothers."
</P>
<P>
The two countries established diplomatic relations on June 8,
1950. For half a century since then, their cooperation in politics,
economy, culture, education and other fields has been developing
steadily, based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence
jointly advocated by both sides despite the great changes that
have taken place in the international arena.
</P>
<P>
Both the two Asian neighbors belong to the developing world.
They share an extensive common view on many major issues such as
safeguarding of national sovereignty and opposition to hegemonism
and power politics, and have been closely cooperative partners in
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The mutual trust and support in politics have become an
important cornerstone of the two countries' friendly ties.
</P>
<P>
For the past half-century, China has always respected Myanmar's
independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity. Myanmar, on
its part, has stuck to the "One China" policy, supporting China's
reunification cause and recognizing the government of the People's
Republic of China as China's sole legitimate government and that
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.

<TEXT>
<P>
SERI BEGAWAN, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Brunei's Sultan Hassanal
Bolkiah said Saturday that regional peace and security are some of
the preconditions that will allow his country and people to
continue enjoying prosperity and national building.
</P>
<P>
Bolkiah, who also holds the positions of prime minister and
minister of defense, made the remarks at his 54th birthday party
held at the royal palace here. In Brunei, which is rich with oil
and populated by 330,000 people, the sultan's birthday serves as a
grand festival nationwide every year.
</P>
<P>
In such a world that is currently experiencing changes and
formidable challenges brought about by the new millennium, Bolkiah
said, the reason why Brunei still enjoys peace, prosperity and
development is diligence and cooperation of both the private and
public sectors and citizens and inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Bolkiah promised that Brunei Darussalam will continue to uphold
the principles of cooperation with friendly countries.
</P>
<P>
"This concept will be employed in our interaction with APEC,
ASEAN, the United Nations, the Commonwealth and other
international bodies and regional organizations," the ruler of
Brunei said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Brunei will make good use of its involvement as
the host of this year's APEC 2000 and the Visit Brunei Year 2001.
</P>
<P>
The informal summit of the Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation (
APEC) will be held in November in Seri Begawan, capital of Brunei.
</P>
<P>
The sultan said Brunei will continue to self-improve in order
to engage in global competition and practice thrift although the
year-long Asian economic crisis has been overcome.

<HEADLINE> Violence Continues in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Gunfights continued in Ambon,
capital of Indonesia's Maluku province, on Saturday, forcing
residents to stay at home for fear of being shot.
</P>
<P>
"Sounds of gunfire and grenade and bomb explosions have been
heard since 07:00 a.m. (local time). It is like a war in the
Middle East or something. Thick smoke is billowing out here and
there. We cannot see anything farther than 20 meters," The Jakarta
Post Sunday quoted a reporter based in Ambon as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reporter said no one dared to go out, "therefore there is
no way for us to find out how many more people have been killed
and how many buildings were ravaged or burned down on Saturday."
</P>
<P>
But the Antara News Agency reported that four people were
killed by gunshots and six others injured in three different
places in Ambon, about 2,300 kilometers northeast of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, two people aboard the speed boat "
Sampan Rua" en route from Passo port on Ambon island to Haria port
on the nearby Saparua island were also killed by gunshots in the
waters of Tanjung Tial on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged battle in Ambon has apparently affected the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lack of kerosene and rice. A liter of kerosene
usually costs 600 rupiah (7 U.S. cents), but now we have to cover
a three-kilometer distance up the hill to get kerosene at 1,500
rupiah (18 cents) per liter. A kilogram of rice is now 4,000
rupiah (44 cents), or 1,000 rupiah more than the old price," a
local woman told the Jakarta Post.
</P>
<P>
Violence has been rife in Ambon since the enactment of the
civil emergency in Maluku and North Maluku provinces last month.
</P>
<P>
The spice islands of Maluku have been wrecked by communal
clashes since early 1999. Thousands of people were either killed
or wounded and hundreds of public buildings destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Russia Seeks Balanced Foreign Policy, Says Putin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia, a country straddling the
Eurasian continent, should seek a balanced development in its
foreign policy, Russian President Vladimir Putin said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The main task of the Russian foreign policy is to maintain a
balance between the world's forces and interests," Putin said in
an exclusive interview with the Xinhua News Agency and the China
Central Television on the eve of his visit to China which starts
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that top priorities should be given to settling
domestic problems. "A country cannot play an effective role on
the international arena without adequately settling domestic
problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, the Russian president also admitted that his
wife felt unhappy and wept for a whole day when she learnt he was
appointed acting president on the New Year's Eve following the
surprise resignation of Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Putin disclosed that he had to spend less time with his two
daughters at present. "When I leave home for office, they are
still asleep; and when I come back, they have already gone to bed.
"
</P>
<P>
Putin, 47, was officially sworn in as the new head of state
last May after winning the presidential campaign in March.

<HEADLINE> Putin: Visit to China Aimed at Boosting Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin
has said his upcoming visit to China is aimed at understanding the
lives of the Chinese people and boosting bilateral ties in various
fields.
</P>
<P>
The visit starting Tuesday also represents a key event in his
personal life, said Putin in an interview on the eve of his visit
to China with the Xinhua News Agency and China Central Television.
</P>
<P>
Russia shares strategic partnership with China and puts
relations with Beijing among priorities of its foreign policy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
It is not an expedient measure for Russia to develop ties with
China and the strategic partnership between the two countries will
keep developing in the new century and become the most important
factor in maintaining global stability and peace, Putin noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia would actively advance its cooperation with China in the
economic and cultural fields as well as in international affairs,
the Russian president said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the maintenance of frequent contacts with Chinese
leaders is very important.
</P>
<P>
He and Chinese President Jiang Zemin have not only met
frequently but also talked over the phone regularly, Putin noted.
</P>
<P>
In their last meeting in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, he and President
Jiang discussed a range of issues and raised some problems that
need to be addressed urgently, Putin said, expressing the hope
that his upcoming meeting with Jiang would be conducive to the
settlement of those problems.
</P>
<P>
On trade cooperation, Putin pointed out that despite speedy
development, the potentials are far from being fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
He said some of China's experience in its economic reforms
could be adopted in Russia, especially in taxation reforms,
alleviation of taxes on enterprises and simplification of
enterprise registration formalities.
</P>
<P>
Putin also pledged to create a better investment environment
for domestic and foreign investors, including those from China.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Russian people have special and profound
friendly feelings for the Chinese people and he becomes even more
confident of the development of Russian-Chinese strategic
partnership when he hears Chinese President Jiang Zemin speaks
Russian and sings Russian songs.
</P>
<P>
Putin is to pay a state visit to China from July 17 to 19.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- South African President Thabo
Mbeki Saturday declared war on corrupt officials who are using
state resources that are supposed to go to communities for their
own ends.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally in Zwide township in Port Elizabeth, Mbeki
urged communities to reject the names of any corrupt candidate
nominated to stand for the local elections.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want such people in any of the ANC (African National
Congress) leadership structures; if we still have such people and
cannot identify them, let us sniff them out," he said after a
meeting of the ANC's national general council (NGC).
</P>
<P>
Mbeki noted that although South African people have achieved
freedom, the country is still divided into two.
</P>
<P>
"We know our country is still divided into white areas with big
houses, sporting facilities and so on, on the one hand, while in
the townships most of these are still non-existent," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the NGC had agreed to review all
its existing programs and plans including the building of houses
and business for job creation.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Use Expropriation in Land Reform: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The South African government
would use expropriation as a tool for land reform where necessary,
said Agriculture Minister Thoko Didiza in Port Elizabeth on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing reporters at the end of the African National
Congress' national general council, the minister said
expropriation is nothing new and was provided for in terms of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
While expropriation is not the only option to meet the demands
of land hungry South Africans, the Expropriation Act will be used
where necessary, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Act was in fact used only two weeks ago, Didiza said,
without giving more details.
</P>
<P>
She said the real issue revolves around compensation and
whether the state would have to pay market related prices.
</P>
<P>
Delegates attending the council meeting earlier this week
debated the issue in their commissions.
</P>
<P>
According to a draft report tabled before the council on
Saturday, the delegates agreed that land reform should be speeded
up through expropriation and redistribution of under-utilized and
unused farmland, including state owned land.
</P>
<P>
"The land reform program must be accelerated to give rural poor
more equitable access to productive land and correct the highly
skewed ownership land patterns," the report said.
</P>
<P>
The delegates also called on the party's highest decision-
making body in between national conferences, the National
Executive Committee, to convene a national workshop to assess both
land restitution and reform.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, ANC presidency head Smuts Ngonyama said the
delegates, especially those from the rural areas, were generally
satisfied with the pace of land reform.
</P>
<P>
However, there was a feeling that the "willing seller, willing
buyer" method might prove too costly for the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
He was echoed by Agri South Africa chief executive officer Jack
Raath, who was quoted by the South African Press Association as
saying that in terms of commercial land, there is no reason to opt
for the expropriation route.
</P>
<P>
"You don't need it. There is enough land and prices are going
down if you look at agricultural land. You can get it on the
market, you don't need expropriation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to expropriate under these circumstances would put
it mildly stuff up the whole land market and the capital base of
agriculture, he said.
</P>
<P>
"However, organized agriculture held a different view if
expropriation was to be used as 'an important instrument in
finalizing the restitution process'," Raath said.
</P>
<P>
"If the process is taking too long and is going to slow and
there are obstacles, then there is no problem if people proceed
with expropriation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Expropriation should never become the government's first choice
in normal land transactions, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, the National Land Committee (NLC) agreed with the view
of ANC delegates that the "willing seller, willing buyer" approach
would be financially crippling.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, quality land is not being redistributed through this
method, said NLC deputy director Tom Lebert.
</P>
<P>
"What tends to come on the market is fairly marginal. The
arable resources are quite small," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebert, the issue is not whether land should be
expropriated, but that of compensation.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution's property clause did not only refer to market
value, but provided for several other factors to determine "just
and equitable" compensation, he said.

<HEADLINE> "African Union" to Replace OAU: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 16 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign Affairs
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said on Sunday that the envisaged
"United States of Africa" would replace the current Organization
of African Unity (OAU), and would focus on the economic
regeneration of the continent as well as on political matters.
</P>
<P>
The new body would not take on the form of a federation of
African countries, but would instead be a loose union with member
states retaining their own sovereignty, cabinets and ministers,
Zuma told the South African Broadcasting Corporation's Newsmaker
Program.
</P>
<P>
She said the envisaged body could not be likened to the United
States of America, but rather to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"We believed that the OAU needed to be radically re-organized
in order for it to be able to take the challenges that face us,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would be the fate of countries refusing to become
part of the new African union, Zuma said all countries have agreed
to the concept in principle.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Angola, she said, did not attended the recent OAU
summit on the topic, not because they did not support the
formation of such a union, but because they objected to holding
the summit in Lome, Togo.
</P>
<P>
The union would come into effect as soon as two-thirds of
African countries ratify the proposal.
</P>
<P>
According to Zuma, the union would not be headed by a
secretariat, but rather by a body comprising the different African
heads of state. It would furthermore be made up of a commission
and a number of specialized committees, looking at issues the
continent has to tackle jointly, such as education, health and
human resource development.
</P>
<P>
Zuma denied reports that she would become the foreign minister
of an envisaged "United States of Africa".
</P>
<P>
The body would not even have such a position, she said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no such thing," she added.

<HEADLINE> Germany Takes FISA World Cup for Fourth Successive Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUCERNE, Switzerland, July 16 (Xinhua) -- Germany has won the
overall FISA Rowing World Cup for a fourth successive year with
the final overall points of 143 in the three-regatta world cup,
according to the international rowing federation FISA.
</P>
<P>
Part of Germany's tally included maximum points from wins in
two individual boat classes. In the final held Sunday, world
champions Jana Thieme and Katrin Boron won the women's double
sculls while the world champion women's quadruple sculls were also
victorious in their boat class. Katrin Rutschow-Stomporowski
finished first equal in the points table in the women's single
with Ekaterina Karsten of Belarus, although the title goes to
Karsten thanks to her victory in the Lucerne final.
</P>
<P>
Australia, fourth at last year's world cup, cemented the second
place it achieved at the Vienna regatta, with a total of 100
points, while Great Britain stayed in third with 93. Romania was
fourth, Italy fifth and France sixth.
</P>
<P>
Vaclav Chalupa of the Czech Republic took the men's single
sculls title with consistent performances over the season - gold
in Munich and bronze in Vienna and Lucerne. The same was the case
for the Norwegian men's double who took the title over Munich and
Lucerne winners, Iztok Cop and Luka Spik of Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian women's eight snatched the title from Belarus
after an improvement in their performance saw them win today's
final. And Great Britain had a firm grasp on the men's title after
their win today.
</P>
<P>
The British men's coxless four won its third World Cup title,
despite not placing in the final. Wins in Munich and Vienna meant
they were certain of the title before the Lucerne final.
</P>
<P>
But the Danish lightweight coxless four were not so lucky. They
ended a three-year World Cup winning streak after the injury of
crew member Thomas Poulsen disrupted their season.
</P>
<P>
44 countries and regions have entered crews for the third and
final regatta of the Zurich Rowing World Cup which took place in
Lucerne,Switzerland from July 14-16, 2000.

Rotsee of Lucerne in a last chance to earn World Cup points and
the title of World Cup champion to be awarded on Sunday. The
impressive entry includes 25 world champions and 23 Olympic gold
medallists.
</P>
<P>
"This regatta represents the last international encounter for
the rowers before the all-important Olympic regatta in Sydney so
we are expecting some excellent racing." said Matt Smith, FISA's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
The FISA Rowing World Cup, created in 1997, is an annual team
competition comprising three regattas staged at three week
intervals and featuring the fourteen Olympic boat classes racing
over a classic 2000 meter distance.
</P>
<P>
Points are awarded to the highest placing boats at each regatta
in the fourteen Olympic boat classes. A winning federation is
declared after each regatta and an overall Rowing World Cup
winning federation is declared at the end of the three regattas.
Eight points are awarded to the winners of each World Cup event,
six for second, five for third, four for fourth, three for fifth,
two for sixth and one for winning the B final (the seventh).
</P>
<P>
In year 2000, the regattas of the series took place in Munich (
June 1-3), Vienna (June 23-25) and the final in Lucerne,
Switzerland (July 14-16).

LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of the oil pipeline
fire in Nigeria's eastern Delta State has risen to 100 on Monday,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Local government officials were quoted as saying that the
casualty figure was increasing as more bodies were found from the

The renewed fire broke out on Sunday when vandals scooped up

Warri a few days after an earlier pipeline explosion at a nearby
village which claimed more than 250 lives.
</P>
<P>
A local police officer said that Sunday's pipeline explosion
was caused when one of the villagers siphoning gasoline from the
pipeline lit a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has been fighting for the control of
pipeline vandalism which often results in pipeline explosion in

pipelines have ignored similar disasters and repeated to cash in

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Total Debt Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
Monday called for the total cancellation of foreign debts the
African countries and his country in particular owe, warning that
"unless this is done all our efforts and resources will be
dissipated in unsustainable debt repayments and deprivation."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the appeal at the three-day 12th Consultative
Group (CG) meeting attended by representatives from the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, the European Union and a number
of donor countries.
</P>
<P>
"In order to consolidate the gains we have made, and will make
from economic growth strategies, the heavy indebtedness, which is
a yoke on our efforts, needs to be addressed," he told the meeting,
which is to review and assess the country's short and long-term
economic agenda and solicit development assistance to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The president said that whereas the current mechanisms for debt
relief are welcome, they do not go far enough in tackling Africa's
debt burden.

<P>
On his country's economic reform, the president said that since
1991, when he took power, Zambia has undertaken perhaps the most
comprehensive economic and structural reforms in the region.
</P>
<P>
"Beyond all precedent in the region, we have decontrolled
prices and interest rates, removed all subsidies, removed exchange
controls and all restrictions on imports and exports and lowered
tariffs significantly," he said, adding that these measures have
brought about many changes.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said his country's resolve remains unwavering to
achieve and maintain macro-economic stability throughout prudent
budget management, improved tax administration and expenditure
controls.
</P>
<P>
On the privatization of his country's copper mines, he said
that Zambia's economic performance has been dependent on the
fortunes of its mining industry, the Zambia Consolidated Copper
Mines (ZCCM) in particular.
</P>
<P>
With the conclusion of the privatization of ZCCM in March this
year the restoration of confidence in the economy and the
resumption of new investment is expected in the mining industry,
he said.
</P>
<P>
On the country's agriculture, Chiluba said that with an arable
land area of 42 million hectares and abundant water resources,
Zambia is agreeably one of the region's sleeping giants as far as
agricultural production is concerned.
</P>
<P>
Zambia can turn this sector into a veritable driving engine for
growth in the economy and reducing poverty over the next few years,
he assured, noting that presently agriculture provides a
livelihood for over 50 percent of Zambians but only generates
about 18 percent of its gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government ministers and representatives of civil
societies are also attending the meeting.

<HEADLINE> One Indian U.N. Peacekeeper Killed in S. Leone  </HEADLINE>

seven others wounded in a weekend operation to rescue a trapped

Saturday ventured into the eastern town of Kailahun to walk out
the 222 Indian soldiers and 11 international military observers,
who had been surrounded in their camp by the rebels since early in
May.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Exports Drop Sharply in Last Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's exports fell by 15
percent in the 1999-2000 fiscal year ending this June, New Vision
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fall was mainly caused by the decline of coffee prices on
the world markets, which cost Uganda more than 100 million U.S.
dollars in the fiscal year, according to the Quarterly Report
produced by the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The ban imposed by the European Union on Uganda's fish exports
also reduced the country's earnings by more than 30 million
dollars, says the report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Uganda's exports to Britain dropped from 670 million
dollars in 1997 to 450 million dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the high cargo transportation cost was to
blame for the fall of Uganda's exports to Britain, because Uganda
is landlocked and its exporting products have to be flown out.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 17 (Xinhua) -- A high-level South African
delegation left for Japan on Monday to attend the Group of Eight (
G8) Summit, the Foreign Affairs Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The summit of heads of state and government will be held on
July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the presidents of South Africa, Algeria and
Nigeria have been mandated to represent the continent of Africa on
a variety of issues at the summit.
</P>
<P>
"It is expected ... that the African leaders will engage their
G8 counterparts on the cancellation of Africa's external debt, as
this continues to be an obstacle to, and has a negative effect on
development objectives," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of people-centered development and poverty
alleviation in Africa could be speeded up by the cancellation of
the unsustainable debt burden of developing countries, it said.

<HEADLINE> WB Director Urges Zambia to Further Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- World Bank Director Michael Sarris
Monday urged Zambia to speed up its economic development, warning
that failure to make more progress would jeopardize previous gains
and seriously compromise future growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Sarris made the call at the three-day 12th Consultative Group (
CG) meeting beginning here Sunday, which is attended by
representatives from the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund and some donor nations as well.
</P>
<P>
To develop its economy, Sarris said Zambia needs to remove the
remaining obstacles to a diversified economy, adding that in this
regard impediments to private business development should be
cleared and more competition be introduced into the financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance to develop the country's
agricultural sector, which employs 70 percent of its workforce and
contributes more than half of its exports in 1999.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the country needs to improve physical and social
infrastructure in the rural economy, further liberalize
agricultural markets and provide essential inputs on a more
competitive basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sarris also pressed Zambia to curb corruption in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"Low civil service pay and morale, bureaucratic red tape,
onerous regulations, and weak enforcement mechanisms are breeding
ground for corruption, which could erode investor confidence,
limit economic growth and redirect government spending away from
poverty reduction," Sarris said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is convened to review and assess Zambia's short and
long-term economic agenda and to solicit development assistance
for the country.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government ministers and representatives of civil
societies are also present at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> East Timor to Join CPLP: Gusmao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 17 (Xinhua) -- East Timor will join the Community
of the Portuguese-speaking Countries (CPLP) as its eighth member
once it gains full sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Xanana Gusmao, representative of the East Timorese delegation
and observer to the third summit of the CPLP, made the statement
at its opening session in Maputo on Monday, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
"East Timor will surely be the eighth member of the Community
of the Portuguese-speaking Countries", Gusmao said before
presenting the summit leaders with colorful Timorese "tais",
traditional hand-woven scarves.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, senior East Timorese diplomat Jose Ramos Horta
reaffirmed in Maputo the territory's choice of Portuguese as a
future "official language" alongside indigenous Tetum as its "
national language", adding that East Timor would also consider to
take English and Indonesia's Bahass Malay as working languages.
</P>
<P>
Residents in East Timor, a former Portuguese colony in
southeast Asia annexed in 1975 by Indonesia after the Portuguese
retreat, have voted in September 1999 for independence from
Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> About Half of Nigerian Children Stunted: UNICEF Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 43 percent of Nigerian
children under the age of five suffer stunted growth due to
inadequate feeding and repeated illness, said a report released by
the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Progress on Nations 2000", listed Nigeria
as the sixth nation in sub-Saharan African with the highest number
of children suffering from stunted growth while Ethiopia topped
the list with 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate feeding and repeated illness are the immediate
causes of stunting among young children, said the report, adding
that the vicious cycle was a result of poverty and the consequent
inability of families to adequately cater for their children.
</P>
<P>
Deprivations in feeding and care that impair growth in the
critical first years may also reduce a child's cognitive
development and learning ability, often leading to poor school
performance and drop out, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicated that 39 percent, about 209 million
children under five in the developing world, are stunted, with
Asia and sub-Saharan Africa recording the highest.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Invited to Attend OPEC Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 17 (Xinhua) -- Jorge Valero-Briceno, president of
the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said
Monday in Nigeria's capital Abuja that OPEC was planning a summit
of heads of government of all its member states to find ways to
further strengthen the organization.
</P>
<P>
The visiting OPEC president said shortly after his meeting with
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo that he had sent through the
invitation message to Obasanjo for the meeting scheduled for a
date between September 27 and 29 in Venezuelan capital Caracas.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be preluded by a session attended by ministers
of foreign affairs, finance, and petroleum from all its member
states, he said.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC president, who is also a special envoy of the
Venezuelan government, said the summit is part of the celebrations
marking the establishment of OPEC.
</P>
<P>
On the increasing price of crude oil on the world market
inspite of the injection of about 2.4 million barrel more oil per
day, Valero-Briceno said that the rising price was not the making
of the organization, which he said had taken all the necessary
measures to check the price.
